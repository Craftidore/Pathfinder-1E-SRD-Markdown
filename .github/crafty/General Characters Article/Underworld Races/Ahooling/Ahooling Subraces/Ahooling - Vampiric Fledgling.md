# Ahooling - Vampiric Fledgling
## Overview
The most feared (and common) type of [[Ahooling|ahooling]] is the vampiric fledgling; feared for their powerful predatory instincts and their propensity for blood.

## Traits
***Blood Thirst.*** Vampiric fledgling must drink the blood of others to fuel their metabolismâ€”more so than other [[Ahooling|ahoolings]]. Once per long rest, you must consume one gallon of blood per Hit Die or suffer from level 1 exhaustion. For every additional day without meeting the requirement, you increase the exhaustion level by a further +1. If an [[Ahooling|ahooling]] manages to drink one gallon of blood, they reduce their exhaustion level by 1. This exhaustion cannot be alleviated by any means apart from consuming blood equal to one gallon per exhaustion level incurred.

***Change Shape.*** At 3rd level, you can use *polymorph*, except you can only target yourself and you can only assume the form of a swarm of bats for 1 hour. You must take a long rest to use this ability again.

***Flight of the Vampire.*** At 5th level, your wings develop further. You have a flying speed of 35 feet.

***Vampiric Bite.*** As a reaction to hitting a living (non-construct, non-undead) creature with a bite attack, you may heal 1d8 + your Constitution modifier hit points. This ability recharges on a short or long rest.
