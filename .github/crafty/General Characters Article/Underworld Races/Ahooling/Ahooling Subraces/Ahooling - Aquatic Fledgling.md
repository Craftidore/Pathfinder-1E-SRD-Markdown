# Ahooling - Aquatic Fledgling
## Overview
[[Ahooling]] that bear the heritage of [[Ahool|ahool]] spawned from the demons near aquatic realms develop differently than their airborne counterparts; they do not receive wings, but are well-suited to water.

## Traits
***Born Swimmer.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill and gain advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks made to swim. Once you gain 5th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed.

***Change Shape.*** At 3rd level, you can use *polymorph*, except you can only target yourself and you can only assume the form of a swarm of insects (crabs in the case of most aquatic fledglings) for 1 hour. You must take a long rest to use this ability again.

***Gills.*** Aquatic Fledglings are at no risk of suffocation from being [[Underwater|underwater]], but can survive out of water only for 24 hours before they start to drown: You are immediately subject to the suffocation rules after this period. You require enough water to fully immerse yourself in it and spend at least 10 minutes inside the water to reset this timer.
