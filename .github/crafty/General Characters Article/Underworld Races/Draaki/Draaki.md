# Draaki
## Overview
### Draaki

The draaki were once a proud race of enchanted beings that ruled over the Underworld without peer, taming even the great dragons. Their entire species, however, came to a calamitous end and were transformed in a disastrous series of events that took them from the heights of power to the depths of negligence, their civilizations gone and their peoples reduced to a nomadic existence in the endless caves of Aventyr. The draaki’s strong resemblance to their former slaves grants them formidable abilities, but also marks them to other underworlders as the failed race, considered weak and ripe for abuse.

## History
Now long forgotten, the true originator race of the Ruins of the Rift still trace their power and influence throughout the Underworld. From the [[Drow|drow]] to the dwarves, all of the subterranean civilizations were affected by the Progenitors, for it was they who tamed the many primal dragons that kept their lairs below the surface. Using arcane magics long forgotten to all of Aventyr, they subjugated the primal dragons to their will, using them to carve out entire regions for colonization, re-route the thousands of magma flows throughout the stone and destroy thousands of the untold prehistoric monsters that once roamed the countless caverns miles under the surface. This, the Grand Sculpting, made the Underworld into what it is today. Their obsession with the primal dragons eventually became the originators’ undoing.

In an intricate plan that crossed the span of centuries before reaching fruition, the draconic slaves enacted their revenge. Promising far greater powers and abilities, one of each of the primal dragon types offered up their soul to the Progenitors in a ritual that would transform every member of their race. This carefully planned and perfectly manipulated ruse instead revoked the powers that once allowed them to bind and control the primal dragons, transforming each of their species into a strange amalgamation of reptilians that only barely resembled their supposed creators: draaki. Baffled, caught largely unaware and temporarily sapped of strength and will by their transformations, they proved to be no match for the freed primal dragons, which quickly fled into the Underworld to recoup their strength—or so it seemed. Meanwhile, the terrifying true threat hatched by the primal dragons began to stir and the Dracoprime gathered strength.

Hours after the disastrous calamity, the draaki were thrown into total disarray as the mountainous creature began to rise from the depths, crafted over hundreds of years by thousands of dragons, hidden from the Progenitors by the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]], it instantly destroyed most of their civilization as it rose from the Underworld. With little recourse the high mages of the draaki that remained enacted a ritual that called out a plea which shook the Planes, killing each instantly as a buzzing, resonating voice answered their desperate cry for help.

The Dracoprime’s skull instantly erupted with thousands of small insectile humanoids—the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]]—and the immediate threat to the forever cursed draaki came to a quick end.

The primal dragons, however, were not even close to sating their thirst for vengeance (and in truth, they never will be) and they did not rest long after the destruction of their idol. The subterranean civilizations of the draaki quickly fell to the claws of their former slaves and eventually the reptilians retreated into The Rifts, their scant sorcerers and high enchanters enacting one final ritual to grant their people solace against the draconic menace.

In the hollowed out magma tunnels below the Fungi Forest, the Draaki Caverns, they have lived peacefully for centuries and only the bravest and most inquisitive of the primitive tribes sets out into the Underworld (and their return is a rare and celebrated event.) The draaki have five distinctive subtypes, each emblematic of one or another trait belonging to underworld dragons. Traditionally they have gotten along, but the numbers of the draaki are swelling and tensions rise as game grows scarce and the need to expand into the Underworld grows. They once had the ability to assume the shape of any humanoid (as a dragon does) but became so complacent with impersonating the nearby [[Drow|drow]] of the emerging Holoth that now they can only assume the form of a dark elf.

## Physical Description
These reptilian humanoids stand a head higher than a man but are truly much taller from toes to snout, craning their thick necks forward in a constant stoop. Their bodies are exceptionally powerful and graceful, and they have a surprising magnificence granted by a potent echo of their former grand presence.

## Society
The draaki each have different cultural traditions reminiscent of the practices of tribute they were once made to pay to their former draconic slaves as tensions between each dispersed. Reaching adulthood is an event celebrated by the entire settlement, as the many dangers of the Underworld still prey on the draaki for their ancestral doings, even if their former slaves have abated. Survival and martial disciplines thrive, and they greatly value any member with the magical talents they all once possessed.

## Relations
First and foremost, the draaki are paranoid—many underworlders still bear them ill will and their suffering never seems to end. This overriding instinct to remain paranoid serves them well, however, and they continue to survive despite their tribal practices and lack of proper civilization. Using their ability to blend as [[Drow|drow]], they move about the society of the Underworld and trade the valuable ores they find emerging in the decaying bedrock for weapons, tools and goods they cannot produce on their own. The draaki’s natural presence gives them an advantage in this charade and they are raised to be deceitful about their true identities. When found out they become skittish and fearful, but when their trust is fully gained they prove to be capable allies well-versed in the dangers of the Underworld.

## Alignment & Religion
While they aren’t all of Chaotic alignment, most draaki tend to be. Whether they abandoned their gods or if they themselves were abandoned, they don’t worship any specific deity, though draaki particularly value both community and nature.

## Adventurers
Draaki adventurers are more likely to be exploring Aventyr by necessity rather than a desire to do so. Still, once they’ve ignited their inner passion for dominating the Underworld, it is difficult for them to stay in place for too long. The draaki make phenomenal sorcerers or warlocks and although extremely rare, paladin draaki are legendary in their prowess.

## Additional Details
**Draaki and the Underworld**

Draaki are universally disliked for the part they once played in the unfolding of the Underworld and left lacking in sense by the Progenitor’s dramatic call to the reaches of the cosmos. They are a suspicious people, equally feared and preyed upon by others, leaving them to value strength above all else. Tribal leaders are often the most physically powerful, though some are usurped by potent spellcasters and particularly clever, underhanded dissenters. Their cultures all still practice rituals once meant to appease the dragons that plagued them; sometimes these can be exceptionally dangerous to the unwary, and travelers that succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20) recognize the telltale signs of practices that spell trouble for foreigners when they approach a draaki settlement.

## Traits
Your draconic heritage manifests itself in a variety of traits that you share with the dragonborn base race. However, you have a different assortment of inborn abilities, gaining draaki traits instead of dragonborn traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Young draaki grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3 and reach adulthood by the age of 15. Draaki can reach ages of up to 104 years.

***Alignment.*** Draaki tend towards extremes, often making a conscious choice towards one side in the eternal cosmic battle. Draaki generally gravitate towards chaotic alignments.

***Size.*** Draaki are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to the endless caves, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***[[Drow]]****** Form.*** Each draaki can assume the appearance of a single [[Drow|drow]]. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can use your action to switch between your [[Drow|drow]] form and your true form.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

***[[Draaki Heritage]]******.*** You have a draaki ancestry derived from the primal dragons your people once subjugated. Choose one ethnicity of draaki from the [[Draaki Heritage]] table. See [[Draaki Heritage]] for a detailed explanation of each heritage ability.
