# Svirfneblin
## Overview
### Svirfneblin

Undergnomes, most commonly known as svirfneblin, are greatly misunderstood by the other races of Aventyr, just as their ancestors were once ostracized by their kin on the surface. Still, they maintain the same tight-knit sense of familial duty. While they dabble in mining, the svirfneblin are as adept at engineering as regular gnomes, and have even learned how to incorporate arcane magics into their clockwork creations. Their undeniable talent with mechanical devices, however, makes them extremely ambitious in their designs, often leading to disastrous consequences.

## History
The ingenious dark gnomes were not originally natives to the Underworld, and are instead children of the Elemental Plane of Earth. After a few generations, the svirfneblin found the few pockets of livable territory far too confining for their numbers. Scouts of the Svirf clan took to a newly appearing orange passageway—an Amber Road.

Following the interplanar pathway, the gnomes from the Elemental Plane of Earth came upon a realm ruled over by ingenious gnomes mastering clockwork devices. Welcomed as kin, their mastery of magic was impressive and became a valued asset among the different but affable gnomes of the surface world. Working the arcane into these newfound mechanical wonders, the master tinkerers and mages—the descendants of the Svirf clan—took their experimentations too far.

It was never the intention of the Svirf clan to access energies beyond their control—the calamity that struck during The Great Schism could possibly have been contained given their augmented automated devices, but the release of the Dracoprime’s energies reached even as far as their continent, exacerbating a situation that was already spiraling out of control. Details of the event remain sketchy, but something went horrendously wrong during a quasi-magical scientific experiment, and the ensuing explosion vaporized hundreds of gnomes, maiming or wounding thousands more.

While they pleaded a fine case, the Svirf were still banished from the continent, and the use of magic to augment mechanical devices was banned for centuries. Their fellows did not care where the “svirfneblin” went, simply that they did not ever return. Using quasimagical mechanical attenuators and spectrometers, the exiled gnomes returned to the Amber Roads.

The Svirf clan took to the mystical byways with ease, leading the rest of their folk—now known as svirfneblin across the lands—but their esteemed scientists recognized quickly (with the use of mechanical devices) that anyone who spent too much time within the enchanted tunnels would be forever changed by them. After the debacle which saw them all exiled, they agreed to each settle in a different part of the Underworld, spreading themselves far and wide in the centuries following The Great Schism.

Isolated and uninhibited, the cleverly hidden enclaves of svirfneblin prospered in the Underworld, seeing their sciences advance in leaps and bounds matched only by their increased understanding of magic. For a long while, all was well with the slowly-changing undergnomes, until the first clan’s ambition once again outgrew their sense.

Frustrated with containment in the dangerous Underworld, High King of the First Clan Galdross Svirf devised a means to greatly mitigate his people’s exposure to the magical energies that suffuse the Amber Roads. Using the wealth amassed by his enclave, the High Kin developed a massive enchanted machine called the *Svirfdozer*, a capsule that could not only burrow through earth, but replicate the material of the Amber Road, allowing the svirfneblin to craft their own transitways across the Underworld.

At first nothing seemed awry and the svirfneblin let out a collective sigh of relief, enjoying their new means to pave safe paths across the endless caves by connecting the many isolated settlements established centuries before. *Svirfdozers* became more and more common, quickly adopted by each of the enclaves and used to great effect beneath the surface of Aventyr, all of the settlements gradually becoming more dependent on one another. It was not long, however, until the doings of other races would see calamity fall upon the svirfneblin.

The colloid’s momentous arrival in the First Hive sent both seismic and ethereal shockwaves throughout the Underworld, rocking some settlements to their cores. The delicate, intricate latticework of Amber Roads connecting the numerous svirfneblin enclaves was shattered like glass when the alien entity landed. Once more, the undergnomes found themselves cut off from their kin by the lethal, endless caves of Aventyr.

The self-reliance they had been lulled away from was difficult to re-attain, but the svirfneblin are wiser and more loyal to one another than ever before. They still pursue the synthesis of the magical and mechanical, toiling (rather inefficiently, dwarves are quick to point out) in the Underworld for ever more ore to craft into tools, though now they have taken a mindset of adaptation, enhancing and incorporating the world around them into their society.

## Physical Description
Svirfneblin look very much like gnomes, save that many have stark white hair and all of them have dusky, dark skin that blends in easily with the caves of the Underworld. They favor light armors and almost always have a set of tools about their person, if not an odd-looking device or two as well.

## Society
The undergnomes are very polite, amicable people, but most outsiders fail to understand their esoteric, extremely rational approach to problem solving and life. The pursuit of science and magic are penultimate, only in the shadow of loyalty to kin. Svirfneblin are woe to betray another of their kind, and are revolted by the very thought of doing so to a direct relative. Their settlements run efficiently, using magically augmented mechanical devices throughout to create wondrous cities filled with clockwork amenities.

## Relations
Svirfneblin are often mischaracterized as cold, calculating and pessimistic—in truth, they are thoughtfully efficient, comprehensive thinkers, and pragmatic, often determining what to do by weighing the probabilities of success or failure. Their aloofness makes it difficult to establish a true bond of trust with an undergnome but those that do find an extremely resourceful, productive companion of unwavering loyalty.

## Alignment & Religion
Svirfneblin are typically of a good alignment but not exclusively so; their positive morality is a societal trait and not a racial compulsion. They sometimes pay homage to Nearru but for the most part, svirfneblin don’t much care for the gods. Little attention has been paid or given to the undergnomes by the deities, and with their penchant for overwhelming self-confidence, it should be no surprise that most svirfneblin worship science over faith.

## Adventurers
While they aren’t keen on leaving their kin, many svirfneblin find themselves exiled from their home enclave. Overly ambitious students that let experiments get out of control receive periods of banishment for punishment, though they typically survive the enduring trial (thanks to allies that refuse to leave their side) and are the better for it. When a posse of svirfneblin finds a foe too powerful to defeat or hide from, however, surviving undergnomes attach themselves to the most likely means of continuing their existence, which has led to many of the subterranean gnomes achieving great glory in the endless caves of the Underworld.

## Names
**Male Names:** Bezkyzan, Dryleno, Haszinzk, Mynakysk, Plykk, Tzenri

**Female Names:** Cyzil, Ellyaz, Fyllyz, Naztali, Ryllzi, Zessyssi

## Additional Details
**Svirfneblin Enclaves**

While svirfneblin enclaves are by and large liberal lovers of culture and knowledge, the steep bent towards a logical existence (a harsh lesson learned twice already) can sometimes lead a city of under gnomes into totalitarianism—rarely of the sort friendly to travelers. The signs are there for those with an eye to see them, however, and an Intelligence (investigation) check (DC 20) tells explorers whether or not they should seek cover or comfort in a svirfneblin enclave.

**Svirf Slugs**

With the troubles of *Svirfdozers* indelibly marking the history of svirfneblin, there is a sensible aversion to the creation and use of mechanical vehicles. After the fall of the last network of Amber Roads during the Confluence, most undergnomes have taken to adapting the Underworld to their advantage and developed a pervading fondness for riding slugs. Virtually every svirfneblin enclave, regardless of its technological prowess, boasts stables and pens of mollusk mounts for traversing the endless caves of Aventyr. The two most common breeds are the riding slugs and the rare, ill-tempered siege slugs. Svirfneblin Beast masters may select [[Svirf Riding Slug|svirf riding slugs]] as their ranger’s companion. See the [[Underworld Bestiary|underworld bestiary]] for stats for svirf slugs.

## Traits
Like their kin on the surface, svirfneblin are prodigious craftsmen and engineers and while you and your kin aren’t widely known to upperworlders, you are still gnomes. You have the standard gnome traits. In addition, you have the following svirfneblin subrace traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma or Wisdom score increase by 1.

***Superior Darkvision.*** Your darkvision has a radius of 120 ft.

***Mechanowonder.*** You hail from a culture that blends technology and magic, and thus you may use Intelligence (Arcana) in place of other skill checks to determine the function of obscure pieces of technology and/or activate them.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** Whenever you are in direct sunlight, you have disadvantage on all checks that rely on sight including attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.

***Tool Proficiency.*** Select one artisan tool. You are proficient with that tool.
