# Vestraadi
## Overview
### Vestraadi

Vestraadi are a strange race of man-like aberrations that rule over the Forever Deep of the Underworld. Their lack of any visual senses is easily compensated by their retinue of tactile, auditory and olfactory organs, but it is their bizarre appearance that makes them so reviled and hated among the few upperworlders that have seen them. They are only now traveling across Aventyr, though none are sure why, and the mysterious nature of the vestraadi does nothing to encourage them to find out.

## History
The vestraadi are one of the many races attributed to the fall of the Dracoprime in the Great Schism, but records of their race are some of the rarest tales in the Underworld. Scholars and historians say that when the impossible beast’s blood leaked into the subterranean rivers and streams, some of the fiercer aquatic creatures mutated into the sightless men. The eldest of their race, the few that have survived the fantastic dangers of the Forever Deep, know the truth of their origins and carry that secret until their dying breaths. Their greatest rites of passage are one of the most dangerous endeavors throughout the Underworld and only ever taken by the truly intrepid vestraadi or those disputing rights of rulership.

Far down toward the core of Aventyr, in the darkest waters of the world, ruins that date back to the Prime Event persist despite the incredible pressures cold, and currents that dominate the depths. The most well-traveled bards and loremasters of the Underworld speak of these primal cities with reverence and fear—few but the most powerful vestraadi are able to penetrate these briny dungeons with any safety, and the countless others that have tried all fall to the truly massive sea beasts that occupy the bottom of the Forever Deep.

For those strong enough to survive the dangerous environmental hazards of the aquatic pits of Aventyr, there are treasures galore and objects of power that rival the greatest artifacts of Upperworld. Chief among these are the *Song Spheres*. The legends of the vestraadi elders, told only in song during great rites of passage, speak of the ancient orbs and their part in the history of their race, and that of the entire world. None have ever been recovered—they sing out into the deepest waters in placating melodies that keep the enormous beasts that once roamed the world freely in repose on the ocean floor.

When disturbed by a living being, a *Song Sphere* trills out in joy—interrupting the lullaby they normally croon—and wake the dangerous sea monsters, quickly leading to the deaths of explorers in the Forever Deep that attempted to plunder her treasures. Underworld sailors, keen to avoid the many hazards of the Forever Deep, have come to believe that the songs are the keening of the sea beasts themselves—a rumor the vestraadi have done nothing to stop from propagating, for the *Song Spheres* carry more than the honor of their race. Some of the sacred orbs tell the true tales of why the vestraadi abandoned their empires on the ocean beds of the world, and fell prophecies of their seers foretell that the knowledge itself will bring the danger from below to haunt those that would learn of them.

Still, these mysterious, sightless creatures have propagated throughout the waters of the Underworld since the Great Schism. They are an aloof peoples that keep tribal societies throughout the Forever Deep, each ruling over their territories with a savage zeal. The bizarre nature of the vestraadi still puzzle the few scholars of Aventyr that have researched them, and their strongholds are rarely breached by any army or invasions—the few that try meet deeply unpleasant ends.

## Physical Description
Vestraadi are approximately the same shape and size as a human, but bear extremely little resemblance past that point. Their powerful arms end in three large fingers with half a dozen digits, and all of their bodies are covered in frills and tendrils that constantly shift and writhe about. A vestraadi’s misshapen skull elongates towards the left or right (none are sure why) forming into a sort of ‘tuning fork’. In the middle of their ‘face’ is a large gaping mouth filled with wavering thread-like appendages and gnashing teeth. Openings on the sides of their heads spiral inwards and seem to create a type of ‘pupil’, often mistaken by Aventyrians as the creature’s eyes.

## Society
The vestraadi are a tribal, secretive peoples often misunderstood by other races of the Underworld and instantly designated as monsters. Despite appearances, they are in fact extremely sophisticated, and have developed forms of tactile language and other nonverbal communication that colorfully flavor their exchanges in Straad. Still, they have not recovered the means to record their history in any fashion other than oral renditions and thus they deeply prize historians, bards and any other tellers of tales. The place of a vestraadi in their society is determined by what they can offer to the other members of the tribe, be they mages, seers, warriors, scouts or healers. Those who cannot carry their weight are left to wither in the [[Underwater|underwater]] regions they call home, left to defend themselves should a predator come prowling.

## Relations
For the most part, the other races of the Underworld are ignorant of the vestraadi. The [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] know who they are and what more, they know from whence they came, and the infernal dwarves (rightfully) keep a respectable distance from the sightless men. The [[Funglets|funglets]] find them to respect nature and typically when they interact it is one of the only peaceful, casual interactions the vestraadi can enjoy (though they also get along with the [[Dødelig|dødelig]], as well as anyone does anyway). The [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], ironically, find them to be infuriating in their bizarre ways and the [[Ahool|ahool]] find sightless men to be foul of taste, albeit simple prey in a dry cave.

## Alignment & Religion
The vestraadi are of many different minds and alignments, but they all show reverence to the Current (N, minor deity), a mysterious force that seeps and flows around the core of Aventyr with an agenda unknown to any but itself. It is said they once had other gods, but once the Current found them after the Prime Event, an understanding between the strange, bizarre entity and the sightless men overrode their old faiths in a bloody war in the annals of legend.

## Adventurers
The sightless men are not typically explorers; they only ever leave their tribal homes when forced to by decree from on high, passion or great need. When they do, however, leave the home, many compose long ballads that record their deeds as well as their route of travel, or collect bits of specific plants and rocks along the way to better smell their way back.

## Names
**Male Names:** Bs’burigh, Fetzgryth, Glotf ’lty, Jes’thlint, Srelakth, Thyg’dzen

**Female Names:** Ds’bai, Ig’zall, Meddriz, Oliev, Res’zdra, Vhyg’dzei

## Additional Details
**Vestraadi and the Forever Deep**

The sightless men might once have been a great empire, but that was long ago. They have fallen back onto tribal practices and hierarchies that persist in the dangerous underseas of Aventyr. While not nearly as xenophobic as the paranoid and aggressive [[Dvergr|dvergr]], the bizarre nature of vestraadi often drive away upperworlders and underworlders alike. Those that persist typically find the weird water dwellers to be gracious and kind hosts despite their fundamental differences. Vestraadi settlements are not uniformly magnanimous, however; after seemingly endless invasions by misunderstanding or murderous neighbors, some of them have laws that call for unidentified intruders to be killed on sight. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 20) reveals to travelers whether or not they should be concerned with an aggressive response to unintended intrusion.

**Vestraadi and Perception**

Unlike other PC races, the vestraadi lack a key sensory organ and the reliable means to gain visual information. Rather than simply giving them a greater range of blindsight (which a GM is welcome to do at their discretion), we’ve developed a different system exclusively for vestraadi. (See [[Vestraadi Sonar]].)

## Traits
Your vestraadi character counts as an humanoid (vestraadi) for purposes of race.

***Ability Score Increases.*** Your Wisdom and Dexterity scores increase by 2.

***Age.*** Vestraadi mature slightly faster than dwarves, reaching adulthood at approximately 42 years. If they do not fall prey to the harsh underworld, they can reach almost 400 years of age.

***Alignment.*** Most Vestraadi are Neutral, following the strange teachings of the mysterious Current.

***Size.*** Vestraadi stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and average about 170 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You have a swim speed of 30 ft.

***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.

***Blind Senses.*** You can't use your ***[[Vestraadi Sonar]]*** (or ***[[Vestraadi Sonar|Vestraadi Blindsight]]***) while deafened and unable to smell.

***Condition Immunity.*** Since vestraadi are already blind, you can't be blinded. Additionally, you are immune to sight-based effects, illusions, and gaze attacks and similar abilities that rely on sight.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** You have advantage on non-sonar-based Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Poison Detector.*** Some of your mutated, highly specialized sensors are adept at detecting toxic substances in the Underworld. You are constantly under the effect of *Detect Poison and Disease* (Poison only).

***Vulnerability to Poison.*** A significant portion of your body is a sensitive sensory organ—unfortunately, this makes you vulnerable to poison damage.

***Sensory Dependent.*** While you are immune to all sight-based effects, this does make you more susceptible to auditory illusions and effects. You suffer disadvantage on all saves against auditory-based illusions and spells and effects that deal thunder damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak Common and Straad, a language of strange brushing noises caused by the frills all over your body.
