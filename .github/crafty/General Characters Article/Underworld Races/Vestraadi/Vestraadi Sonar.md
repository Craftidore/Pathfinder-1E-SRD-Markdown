# Vestraadi Sonar
## Overview
***[[Vestraadi]]****** Sonar.*** The mysterious sightless men emit an enigmatic partially-subsonic pulse keyed to each individual [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]], sensed only by them (unless they decide otherwise, in which case they may make their location known to any [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] within 120 feet or 240 feet as a bonus action) every turn they are awake.

This inexplicable energy extends to a maximum radius of 240 feet, and provides the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] with a means to discern their physical surroundings. Static structures (walls, ground, ceiling, chairs, tables, etc) are automatically detected, but any creatures or dynamic (moving) objects are more difficult to perceive. A [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] can “charge” a number of objects equal to character level + Wisdom modifier to respond to its sonar to automatically identify a creature or dynamic object (within 240 feet) with blindsight (usually allies).

In combat, the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check to perceive each creature and dynamic object in a 30-foot radius whenever they roll initiative or enter back into the initiative order or on their turn—this very precise pulse is known as ***Combat Sonar***. The DC for this check is equal to 3 + a creature or dynamic object’s size modifier (+4 for Tiny, +2 for Small, –2 for Large, –4 for Huge, etc.) + a creature or dynamic object’s attribute modifier used for attack and damage rolls or a creature’s Dexterity (Stealth) check, if it is actively hiding. Ammunition of ranged weapons is treated as part of the creature or ranged weapon firing the piece of ammunition. Thrown weapons are treated as part of the throwing creature or object lunging the weapon.

The [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] is granted blindsight against targets he succeeds these checks against until a perceived target actively attempts to hide from the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]. Hiding from a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] who has perceived the target is a Dexterity (Stealth) check made at disadvantage; if successful, the target stops being perceived by the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s blindsight. The [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] maintains this reliable understanding of the battlefield until he rolls a 1 on a Wisdom (Perception) check, is deprived of the ability to smell or hear, or is knocked unconscious.

During combat, a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] may take an action to send out another pulse that plays out exactly as the first except that it is made at advantage against targets it can perceive with blindsight. This pulse is known as ***Discerning Pulse*** and provides more information, depending on the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s level. Targets the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] can see with its blindsight that are successfully beaten on this Wisdom (Perception) check more keenly perceived, depending on the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s level. A [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] may continue to make Wisdom (Perception) checks in this manner so long as they have available actions to do so.

The [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] is completely unaware of the location of dynamic objects or creatures around it if it fails to perceive them with these checks. A [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] is considered to be at disadvantage against any creatures or dynamic objects it fails to detect (even in the middle of combat) and such creatures’ or object’s attack rolls have advantage against the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]].

At 2nd level and every level thereafter, the range of a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s combat sonar increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 125 feet at 20th level.

***Focused Sonar.*** Starting at 3rd level, The [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] may also focus the pulse of the combat sonar on a single creature or object, willfully blinding itself against all other dynamic objects and creatures; for the duration, it is even blind to “charged” creatures or dynamic objects. Attacks made against the target of the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s sole attention are made at advantage. A [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] may decide to end this focused sonar whenever it emits a new combat sonar pulse.

At 3rd level, objects and creatures perceived by a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s ***Discerning Pulse*** are treated as though they were subject to the *Detect Magic* spell while the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] was concentrating on it.

At 5th level, objects and creatures perceived by a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s ***Discerning Pulse*** are treated as though they were subject to the *Detect Evil and Good* spell while the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] was concentrating on it.

At 11th level, objects and creatures perceived by a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]]’s ***Discerning Pulse*** are treated as though they were subject to the *Detect Thoughts* spell while the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] was concentrating on it.

At 20th level, the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] immediately perceives creatures and objects detected with its sonar as though it emitted a ***Discerning Pulse*** also perceives them via truesight.

**Can I have that in quick-and-dirty, please?**

As a simple (but much less interesting) alternative to the sonar, you can just give the [[Vestraadi]] the following: 

***[[Vestraadi]]****** Blindsight.*** You have blindsight 30 ft. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, the range of your blindsight increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 125 feet at 20th level.
