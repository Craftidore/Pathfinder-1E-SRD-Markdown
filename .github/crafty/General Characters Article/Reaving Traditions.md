# Reaving Traditions
## Overview
There are two commonly known types of mutations and paths taken by colloid reavers, known as reaving traditions. There may well be more out there and all three require the unique physiology that blends living crystal with hot-blooded flesh and thus can only be practiced by the [[Colliatur|colliatur]] most adept at manipulating their own body, the truth of the information resonating forth from the colloid and changing the bodily structure of the [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|colliatur reaver]] to accomplish feats otherwise deemed impossible. Some [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|colliatur reavers]] must make a pilgrimage to a node of colloid containing the respective information, while others already have the required impulses dormant within their very bodies. These modifications generally require a certain aptitude and thus, a [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|colliatur reaver]] need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
