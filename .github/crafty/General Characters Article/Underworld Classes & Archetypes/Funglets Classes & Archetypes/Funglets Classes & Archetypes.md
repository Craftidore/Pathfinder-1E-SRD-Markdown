# Funglets Classes & Archetypes
## Overview
**Psilocybists**

The wilds of the Underworld are not dominated by trees, but mushrooms. Wardens of these subterranean forests of fungi develop truly unique relationships with these earthy growths, utilizing their truest natural properties to achieve remarkable mystical powers. While often quite tame, in combat they are as explosive as their enhanced illusions are powerful.

The articles in this grouping comprise the new [[Funglets|funglets]] classes introduced in *[[Underworld Races and Classes]]*. See the list of Governed Content on the right for a complete list of names and links.
