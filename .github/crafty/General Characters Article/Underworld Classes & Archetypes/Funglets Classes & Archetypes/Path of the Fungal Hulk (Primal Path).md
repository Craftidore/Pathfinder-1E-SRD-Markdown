# Path of the Fungal Hulk (Primal Path)
## Overview
For some [[Funglets|funglets]], rage is as much a metabolic choice as an emotional one—these are the fungal hulks and even standing next to one can be a dire proposal.

## Features
**Verdant Path**

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you begin shedding spores and sticky fungal material when you rage. For the duration of the rage, opponents within range of your melee attacks that take the Disengage action, still provoke opportunity attacks due to the sticky fungal threads you constantly shed. Additionally, any invisible creatures that attack you with a melee attack automatically get covered in the sticky, fungal goo, making them clearly visible to everyone. The goo lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. While you are raging, you leave an easily discernible trail of plant material behind you—this is known as your verdant trail and is considered to be difficult terrain for anyone but you. Your verdant trail covers a number of 5-foot-cubes behind you equal to twice your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The gooey train of fungal matter always follows your movement and once it has reached its maximum length, the oldest cube reverts to being normal terrain. If you end your rage, the verdant path no longer follows you and withers after Constitution modifier rounds. While flying, the fungal matter falls to the ground; in water, the fungal matter floats like algae.

**Verdant Bloom**

Also at 3rd level, you learn to manipulate the type of plant matter you are shedding. Choose one additional effect from the following. Your verdant path also has the chosen effect.

***Broadened Path.*** The shedding of fungal matter spreads further. When raging, the 5-ft-cubes adjacent to your verdant path are also treated as difficult terrain.

***Clustered Shedding.*** Whenever you haven’t moved in a given round, the area in a 5-foot-radius directly around you is covered by the effects of your verdant path. This radius increases by +5 feet per round spent without movement, up to a maximum distance equal to your Constitution modifier times 5 feet.

***Corrosive Path.*** Acidic slime coats the fungal matter of your verdant path. Any creature attempting to move through the verdant path takes 1d4 points of acid damage for each 5 feet movement through the area. Creatures beginning their turn in your verdant path also take this damage.

***Entangling Path.*** Any creature attempting to traverse the verdant path must succeed a Strength saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature becomes grappled. The Escape DC is equal to the saving throw DC.

***Forming Path.*** You may exert control over your verdant path. As an bonus action during your turn, you may direct your verdant path to move on its own accord. You may move up to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier 5-foot-cubes of the verdant path a total number 5 feet times your class level. The verdant path still has to form an uninterrupted line from its end to you. All creatures that are in the verdant path once the movement concludes, immediately are subject to the effects of the verdant path.

***Grapes of Wrath.*** You can focus the rampant power of your verdant path and expend one of your rages as a bonus action taken on your turn to grow a number of explosive fruits from your body equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). The fruit is treated as a thrown ranged weapon you are proficient with and has a range of (20/60) and explodes in a 10 foot radius upon impact. Creatures affected must succeed a Dexterity save equal to DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creatures within the radius take 5d6 fire damage, half as much on a successful save. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***Grapes of Wrath, Weird.*** Choose another type of damage from the following list: Acid, Cold, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, Radiance. Your may choose to inflict this damage instead of fire damage when using grapes of wrath. You need to know the grapes of wrath verdant bloom to select this verdant bloom.

***Thorny Path.*** Razor-sharp fungal matter sprouts from your verdant path. Any creature attempting to move through the verdant path takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the area. Creatures beginning their turn in a square covered by your verdant path also take this damage.

**Improved Verdant Bloom**

Starting at 6th level, you choose an additional two verdant blooms to add to your verdant path class feature. Additionally, your hulking nature and sticky plant material allow you to ignore your sunlight sensitivity and fire vulnerability racial features while raging.

**Hulking Adaption**

Beginning at 10th level, you become immune to fire damage due to the moist, sticky, fungal nature of your body. You also never catch fire.

**Reach of the Hulk**

Beginning at 14th level, whenever a creature takes damage from your verdant path or moves into or out of it or moves more than 5 feet over your path, you may use your reaction to make a melee attack against the target, as though the target was within reach of your melee weapons: A mossy arm grows quickly from the path, attacks and withers away in the span of seconds.
