# Maneuvers
## Features
***Extending Filaments.*** You can expend a filament die when making a ranged attack with a [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]]’s filament to increase its range. Roll the filament die and then expend a number of crystal points up to or less than 1/2 the number rolled, minimum 1. For each crystal point expended, you increase the range of your [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]]’s filaments by +(10/20) for a number of rounds equal to the result of your filament die or until you complete a short or long rest, whereupon the range resets to normal.

***Filament Exchange.*** You may, as an action, roll one of your filament dice. You gain a temporary number of crystal points equal to the number you rolled. These temporary crystal points last for a number of minutes equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Constitution modifier.

***Filament Pacification.*** You may, as a bonus action, expend one of your filament dice to add Pacifying Strike’s effects to all attacks you execute with your [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]]’s filaments for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on your filament die.

***Filament Parry.*** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one filament die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your filament die + your Dexterity modifier. If you expend 2 crystal points, you may also use this ability to reduce the damage you incur from ranged attacks.

***Filament Push.*** When you hit a creature with a filament attack, you can expend one filament die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the filament die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

***Filament Reposition.*** When you hit a creature with a filament attack, you can expend one filament die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the filament die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you, That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack. Since you lift your ally through the air with your filament, the movement may ignore terrain that costs additional movement and you may lift your ally with your filament over obstacles, provided you could lift the ally in question.

***Filament Web.*** You can expend filament dice whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack. One of the razor-sharp filaments cuts into the attacker, who takes damage equal to the filament dice you expend plus your proficiency bonus.

***Whirling Trip Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a filament attack, you can expend one filament die to attempt to knock the target down. If the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone and it can be moved around by your filament for 5 feet times the result of your filament die. You may expend an additional filament dice to increase the damage at 11th level and 17th level.
