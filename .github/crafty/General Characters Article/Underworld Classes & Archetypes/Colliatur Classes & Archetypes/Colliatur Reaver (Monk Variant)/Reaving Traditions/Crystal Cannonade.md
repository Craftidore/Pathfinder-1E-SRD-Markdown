# Crystal Cannonade
## Overview
### Crystal Cannonade
![[Crystal Cannonade.png|Crystal Cannonade|300]]
[[Crystal Cannonade.png|open outside]]

The offspring of the colloid quickly learned to adapt to the terrestrial Aventyrian weapons, and the crossbow was the first the alien collective was to fully embrace. These inexplicable warriors turn the weapons into otherworldly devices that fire slivers of crystal that slam into objects, but strangely melt into living creatures.

## Features
**Bonus Proficiencies**

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with light, hand and heavy crossbows.

**Crystalline Crossbows**

Also at 3rd level, you learn to have your crystalline structures grow over a crossbow you wield as a bonus action, fusing it to your hand. While fused to your hand, you can’t hold objects or manipulate objects with the hand that is fused with your crossbow. It is possible to fuse one crossbow to each of your hands, but when you do, you obviously can’t use your hands. You may use your bonus action on your turn to separate one of your hands from one crossbow fused to you.

When thus fused to your body, crossbows lose the two-handed property and expend no ammunition, as your body has a small reservoir of crystalline bolts and reloads the crossbow with crystalline bolts specifically generated for the respective weapon. Your crystalline crossbows have a Capacity of 2 (see [[Crystalline Crossbow Rules|crystalline crossbow rules]]) while fused to your hands. These crystalline bolts change the damage type inflicted by the crossbow to the type you inflict with your Crystalline Claws class feature. You can generate an infinite amount of these crystalline bolts, but they melt away to a sludge after 1 minute, so they can neither be sold, nor scavenged from the battlefield.

Starting at 5th level, your crystalline ammunition receives +1 to attack and damage rolls and is treated as ammunition+1 for all intents and purposes. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.

After completing a long rest, you may spend 5 minutes in meditation to modify one of your hand’s capacity to hold bolts for your crystalline crossbows. Whenever you do, you may expend a number of crystal points of up to your Constitution modifier. For each crystal point spent, you increase the Capacity of one of your crystal crossbows by 1 until you next complete a long rest. (So if you want to enhance the capacity of 2 crystal crossbows, you have to pay the costs separately.) This way of spending crystal points reduces your maximum of crystal points by the amount of crystal points spent until you complete a long rest.

**Crystalline Shrapnel**

At 6th level, you may add the Spread Rate of Fire to a crystalline crossbow when customizing it after a long rest. Adding Spread to a crystalline crossbow reduces your crystal points maximum by 2 per hand modified.

**Lethal Crystal Bursts**

Beginning at 11th level, you can add the Burst Rate of Fire to a crystalline crossbow with a Capacity of 3 or higher when customizing it after a long rest. Adding Burst to a crystalline crossbow reduces your crystal points maximum by 3 per hand modified. Additionally, you increase the base Capacity of your crystalline crossbows to 3.

**Crystalline Barrage**

At 17th level, you can add the Automatic Fire Rate of Fire to a crystalline crossbow with a Capacity of 10. Adding Automatic Fire to a crystalline crossbow reduces your crystal points maximum by 4 per hand modified.
