### Colliatur Reaver
![[Colliatur Reaver.png|Colliatur Reaver|300]]
[[Colliatur Reaver.png|open outside]]

*Run, you puny undead monstrosity—you shall not escape the radiant wrath of the chosen agents of the colloid!*

The [[Colliatur|colliatur]] reaver is a lethal adversary unlike any other—with crystal-suffused skeletons, these master of their own, strange fighting style can exert superb control over their crystalline components, shaping them into truly deadly claws. More importantly, they can generate crystalline, razor-sharp filaments they can emit and wield with a precision unknown in the realms above, cutting undead and the foes of the reaver into deadly ribbons.

**Creating a** **[[Colliatur]]**** Reaver**

When you make your [[Colliatur|colliatur]] reaver, think about your awakening as a [[Colliatur|colliatur]]. Do you remember your life before the transformation? Perhaps you once were a true blackguard, a dastardly foe, now mellowed out by the influence of the colloid. Or you once were a divine champion of good, now struggling to adapt to a new world-view. Your ability to control your crystalline parts is impressive and beyond what other [[Colliatur|colliatur]] can accomplish—so how were you chosen? Do you simply have a talent for the art? Or were you groomed in a strange process within the colloid’s crystalline depths to be its executioner? Perhaps you have deliberately sought the art and transformation to execute your own revenge against the forces of darkness? The existence as a [[Colliatur|colliatur]] reaver may be a journey to self-awareness via combat, an enlightenment arising from conflict or it may be a revenge-driven quest to annihilate undead. Work with your GM to make the unique concept of your character shine as brightly as the crystalline filaments you’ll use to wreck your foes.

**Martial Arts**

At 1st level, your skills with deadly, crystalline martial arts grant you mastery of combat styles that emphasize crystalline claws and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed attacks and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain [[Colliatur]] Reaver levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the [[Colliatur]] Reaver table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

[[Colliatur]] Reavers tend to train with monk weapons that emphasize piercing and slashing damage, featuring strange and often alien weaponry. These weapons have a lot of variations in name and specific design, but utilize the game statistics provided for simple weapons found on page 65 of the *System Reference Document 5. 1*, only changing the damage type as appropriate.

**Claws of Crystal**

Also at 1st level, you learn to exert a level of control over your crystalline claws. You may cause the crystals of your body to cover your hands in razor-sharp claws. You can change the damage type inflicted with your claws as a bonus action. Your claws can inflict either bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage and you are proficient with them. Crystalline Claws are treated as unarmed attacks for the purposes of the Martial Arts class feature.

**Crystal Powers**

Starting at 2nd level, the structures of crystal underlying your physiology enhance your potency in combat, granting you wondrous powers. These powers are represented by a number of crystal points. Your [[Colliatur]] Reaver level determines the number of crystal points you have, as shown in the crystal points column of the [[Colliatur|colliatur]] reaver table. You can spend these points to fuel various crystal powers. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense and Crystal Refraction. You gain more crystal powers as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a crystal point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which your body regenerates its potent powers. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest and eat and drink, since your metabolism fuels your powers. Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Crystal Powers save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Crystal Refraction** 

You may expend a crystal point as a bonus action on your turn to recharge your Crystal Refraction racial feature and use it an additional time before requiring a long rest. When you do, you also negate the exhaustion level increase incurred by using your Crystal Refraction racial feature.

**Flurry of Blows**

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 crystal point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

**Patient Defense**

You can spend 1 crystal point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

**[[Jack-in-the-Limb]]**

Also at 2nd level, you gain the [[Jack-in-the-Limb]] feat.

**Reaving Tradition**

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a reaving tradition: The [[Crystal Cannonade|Crystalline Cannonade]] or the [[Reaving Vortex]], all detailed at the end of this class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th and 17th level.

**Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

**Extra Attack**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

**Pacifying Strike**

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with an opponent’s body and mind, instilling a sense of the profound quietude and calmness of the colloid inside them. When you hit another creature with a weapon granted or modified by the class features of the [[Colliatur|colliatur]] reaver, you may spend 1 crystal point to attempt to calm the creature. The target must succeed on a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (target’s choice) or become charmed until the end of your next turn. If the creature is subject to a spell or effect that instills murderous rages, subject to the confused condition or similar effects that are based on an emotional response, the target receives another save against these effects. Additionally, barbarian rages and similar features are suppressed for as long as the target is charmed.

**Colloid's Blessing**

At 6th level, all your attacks with weapons modified or granted by this class are treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, any attacks made with the Claws of Crystal class feature receive +1 to attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.

**Evasion**

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or devastating spells due to your enhanced reflexes. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**Stillness of the Colloid**

Also at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be frightened. Additionally, you may spend 1 crystal point as part of using this feature to immediately end one type of ongoing damage you suffer from, as your crystalline physiology supports your mortal parts.

**Thunder Adaption**

Starting at 9th level, you lose your racial vulnerability to thunder damage.

**Pure as Crystal**

At 10th level, you can touch upon the pristine beauty refracted through your crystal components to destroy your foes. You may now also choose to deal radiant damage with your Claws of Crystal class feature.

**Tongue of the Mortals**

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the primal longing and sense of aesthetics in other minds, so that you can understand all spoken languages of mortal creatures. Any creature that can understand a language can understand what you’re saying. However, immortal creatures with no natural maximum life span seem to be curiously exempt from this: You can’t communicate with such beings in this way. You may spend 1 crystal point as part of uttering any statement to render your speech completely intelligible gibberish to immortal creatures.

**Diamond Soul**

Beginning at 14th level, your strange physiology grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 crystal point to reroll it and take the second result.

**Live by Light**

At 15th level, your crystalline components support your whole physiology, drawing sustenance from exposure to bright lights like those emitted by the colloid’s crystals. If you spend at least 1 hour during a long rest soaking in light from a very bright source, you do not need to eat, drink or sleep for 24 hours.

**Colloid's Body**

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 crystal points to generate a crystalline sheathe of exoskeleton-like armor that lasts for one minute. While this armor is active, you have resistance to all damage types except thunder and you are immune against the frightened and charmed conditions.

**Avatar**

Beginning at 20th level, you become one of the avatars of the colloid. Whenever you roll for initiative and have no crystal points remaining, you regain 2 crystal points. Additionally, when using your Colloid’s Body class feature, you may expend an additional 2 crystal points (for a total of 6) to become immune against all damage types except thunder for the duration. However, if you do, you incur one level of exhaustion once the duration of Colloid’s Body elapses.
