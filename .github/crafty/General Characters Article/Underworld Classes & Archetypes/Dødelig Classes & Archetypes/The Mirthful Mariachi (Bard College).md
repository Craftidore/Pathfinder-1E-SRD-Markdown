# The Mirthful Mariachi (Bard College)
## Overview
### Mirthful Mariachi

Bards of the mirthful mariachi “college” (the art is almost never actually taught and comes naturally to most practitioners) feel the droning and vibrating rhythm of the underworld in the strings of their guitars. In love with both their ranged expertise, scouting and the melodies they use to bring the tunes of their strange home to life, these bards are tinkerers and vagabonds, blending their expertise with ranged weapons with a keen ear and a wide smile.

## Class Features
**Bonus Proficiencies**

When you join the mirthful mariachis at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with 1 skill of your choice as well as ranged, simple, and martial weapons.

**Crossover of Destruction**

Also at 3rd level, you learn to tinker with ranged weapons. You may, with a day’s work, combine an instrument you are proficient with and a ranged weapon you are proficient with. You can make hornbows, violin-slings, guitar-crossbows or any other combination you can think of. The combination retains the properties of the ranged weapon and is known as a crossover weapon. You are automatically proficient with the resulting crossover weapon, though all other creatures suffer disadvantage when trying to use your modified instrument. Additionally, when firing this weapon, you do not gain disadvantage for firing at long range and gain your Charisma modifier as a bonus to the attack roll to hit your targets.

**Crossover Crafting**

The mirthful mariachi at 3rd level learns all the necessary tricks to craft, maintain and sometimes repair his crossover weapons. Crafting requires material costs, skill proficiency with the item in question, a crafting place, and time. Depending on the environment you are in, certain modifications may not be possible.

**Subterranean Song**

Starting at 6th level, you become so attuned to the melodies of the wind surging through the caverns, the dripping of water and the rumble of the earth that you become practically impossible to take by surprise, as you can unconsciously read even the minutest modifications of the melody you perceive. While in the underworld, you gain advantage on your first attack in every combat and you cannot be surprised. Additionally, you do not suffer from disadvantage when attacking with your combined music instrument/ ranged weapon when only 5 feet from an enemy. Finally, you can expend a bardic inspiration die to completely silence a ranged attack you execute with your crossover weapon.

**Improved Crossover Crafting**

Also at 6th level, you have learned to craft quicker and more efficiently. You craft or repair twice as much as usual per workday of downtime. Additionally, you may spend time during a long rest to craft 2 x your Charisma modifier pieces of ammunition for your crossover weapon.

**Hail of Missiles**

Starting at 11th level, you may use your crossover weapon to blast a hail of missiles at enemies. You may either make an Attack action twice, instead of once, when attacking with your crossover weapon. Alternatively, you may fire up to your Charisma modifier projectiles at foes within range, but you suffer from disadvantage on all attack rolls when you do and are stunned in the round following this use of the Hail of Missiles feature.
