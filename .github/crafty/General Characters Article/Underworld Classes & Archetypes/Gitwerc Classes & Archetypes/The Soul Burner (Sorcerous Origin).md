# The Soul Burner (Sorcerous Origin)
## Overview
*And then, we saw him—the tyrant of the lower tunnels, surrounded by a circle of candles—and as we approached, all hell broke loose. Literally.*

Among the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]], there are some practitioners of the arcane arts that have fully embraced the practice of fashioning blood candles and sending them straight to Hel. Both sorcerers and wizards are known to follow this path. These traditions work in different ways than usual.

## Features
**Font of Magic: Blood Candle Casting**

As a soul burner, you do not gain the Flexible Casting feature. Instead, you can use a [[Blood Candle|blood candle]] as an optional material component for your spellcasting. You also gain [[Blood Candle|blood candle]] points. You gain a number of [[Blood Candle|blood candle]] points equal to 1/2 your sorcery points, rounded down. These points work like sorcery points, but can only be used for [[Blood Candle]] Casting.

Blood candles can be placed in mid-flight or under water—the magic of the spellcasting process lets the candle levitate and burn, if required.

You may spend sorcery points to modify spells: You can spend a number of sorcery points to delay the onset of your magic and modify the wick-length of the [[Blood Candle|blood candle]]. The wick burns down by one round when it’s your turn.

A [[Blood Candle|blood candle]]’s wick-length can delay the onset of a spell—you may delay the onset of a spell cast with a soul candle by up to your proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier rounds. If a spell that targets one or multiple specific creatures is cast this way, it instead targets any creature in a chosen 5-foot-cube within the spell’s original range, determined by you upon placing the [[Blood Candle|blood candle]]. If no creature is within the chosen square upon the spell triggering, the spell’s effects harmlessly dissipates as it affects the chosen square. You have to be able to see and have a line of effect to the target, if any, upon casting the spell.

If the spell targets multiple specific creatures, you can choose multiple 5-foot-cubes equal to the number of creatures affected. Any creature occupying a square chosen by you when the wick burns down is subject to the spell’s effects. Spells with a range of Self instead affect the square in which you have cast the spell.

The sorcery point cost shows the cost of modifying a spell with a [[Blood Candle|blood candle]].
