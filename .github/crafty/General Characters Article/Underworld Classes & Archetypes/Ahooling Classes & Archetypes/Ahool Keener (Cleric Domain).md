# Ahool Keener (Cleric Domain)
## Overview
### Ahool Keener
![[Ahool Keener.png|Ahool Keener|300]]
[[Ahool Keener.png|open outside]]

*You hear that creepy caterwauling? Sounds like keening, right? Don’t be fooled—they make these noises as they vanquish their foes, so move—they’re coming closer!*

There is fascination in blood and those that consume it—from decadent nobles to savage cultures, there seems to be a primeval fascination associated with the drinkers of blood. It should come as no surprise, then, that the [[Ahooling|ahoolings]] not only have their own clergy with their hunting laments, but that some non-[[Ahooling|ahoolings]] follow this path as well.

**Stealth of the Predator**

Starting when you take this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to grant yourself advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. However, while thus affected, you suffer from disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks as you take on predatory features. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

**Sanguine Supplicant**

Also at 1st level, you have shown your devotion to the [[Ahool|ahool]] and similar drinkers of blood. You have advantage on Charisma checks against [[Ahool|ahool]], [[Ahooling|ahoolings]], bats, vampires and similar creatures associated with bats and drinkers of blood. Additionally, such creatures tend to look favorable on your fawning and thus attack you last or not at all... or at least hear you out before trying to drain you of your blood. Finally, you are treated as an [[Ahooling|ahooling]] for the purpose of prerequisites.

**Channel Divinity: Keening**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to emit a haunting keening at a target within 120 feet that tears foes asunder. Make a ranged spell attack for the keening. If you hit, the target creature takes 2d6 thunder damage, 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, 5d6 at 16th level. You can use this ability up to your Constitution modifier times. It recharges upon taking a long rest. If you also have the [[Ironsinger]] feat, you can use your bonus action to emit the feat’s destructive vibration as though it originated from a target hit by your keening, using the creature as the point of origin.

**Smashing Keening**

At 6th level, when you deal thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can choose to also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

**Potent Sonics**

Starting at 8th level, your affinity with the blood drinking [[Ahool|ahool]] and their ilk allow you to add extra power to your sonic attacks. You may add your Wisdom modifier to the thunder damage you deal with your keening and ironsinging.

**Lord of Caverns**

Beginning at 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are underground or indoors.
