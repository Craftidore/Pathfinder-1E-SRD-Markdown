# Underminer (Ranger Archetype)
## Overview
Riding your dread [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] into battle, you are a fearsome foe to behold that can charge through the very earth and even rock to break your foes.

## Class Features
**Deep Badger Companion**

At 3rd level you gain an unusually intelligent, strong and loyal [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. The [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] increases its Intelligence to 6 and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. The [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] obeys your com mands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action to command it to take its turn.

On your turn, you can verbally command the badger to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge or Help action. You may not command the badger to use Multiattack. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the badger to take the Attack action. The [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.

While astride your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]], you can travel on top of it through the earth, at its burrow speed. Passengers that are not you must make a Dexterity saving throw at a disadvantage after every minute traveled or be thrown off and buried, taking damage equal to your proficiency bonus times d6. The tunnel you dig collapses almost immediately behind you unless fortified. If the badger dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] that isn’t hostile to you. You add 1/2 your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to the badger’s AC, attack rolls and damage rolls as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or three times your ranger level, whichever is higher.

**Erupting Charge** 

At 7th level, if you take the Dash action while astride your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]], you may burrow through earthwork, mud, soil or loosely packed stones as part of the Dash. Additionally, if you move at least 10 feet in a straight line while astride your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]], you receive a bonus action to gain a +5 bonus to the attack’s damage roll (if you choose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you choose to shove and you succeed). The target of your erupting charge must succeed a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, regardless of whether you succeed with the attack or shove. You also increase the burrow speed of your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] by +10 ft.

**Badger Fury**

Starting at 11th level, your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] can utilize Multiattack when you command it to use the Attack action. Additionally, your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]]’s burrow speed increases by +10 ft. and its claws become so hard they can burrow through stone, allowing you to use Erupting Charge to charge through rock while astride your badger.

**Shredding Badger**

Starting at 15th level, when you make a melee attack as a result of your Erupting Charge you may command your [[Deep Badger|deep badger]] to use the Attack action as a bonus action.
