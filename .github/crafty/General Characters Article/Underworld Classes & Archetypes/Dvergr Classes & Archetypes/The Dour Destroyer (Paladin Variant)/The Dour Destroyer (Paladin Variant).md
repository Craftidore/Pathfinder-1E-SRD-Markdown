# The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)
## Overview
### Dour Destroyer
![[Dour Distroyer.png|Dour Destroyer|300]]
[[Dour Distroyer.png|open outside]]

Clad in ragged, time-worn armor, a single [[Dvergr|dvergr]] marches on through the lightless depths, with eyes as black and empty as the wasteland that is the ultimate fate of the world. Where he treads, things fall apart and the center truly cannot hold. Rough and bestial, he slouches onwards, weapon ablaze with power, as the works of mortals crumble before his inexorable stride towards a goal and fate unknown. Whatever their origin or mission, dour destroyers are united by their oaths to the forces of entropy. Whether sworn in the ruins of his erstwhile home amidst the bodies of friends and family or in the presence of his masterworks undone and ruined by catastrophe, the dour destroyer’s oath is a binding, powerful force as he takes up an implement that symbolizes the vanity of mortal striving and goes forth, bringing destruction.

**The Vortex of Entropy**

The dour destroyer swears to end the illusions of all creatures—just as his epiphany has robbed him of any sentiment pertaining hope, goodness or similar merits, the dour destroyer is an instrument of entropy: Decay and dissolution follow where he treads, and neither art nor hope is left in his wake, as all things uplifting, all joy, ultimately, is but a veil concealing eventual destruction. To the dour destroyer, all existence is akin to a man stranded in a maelstrom, clinging to a raft in futility. He has accepted the inevitable, and the suffering endured by those who resist it is what he seeks to alleviate, permanently.

It is said permanence is what makes dour destroyers work within the context of less scrupulous adventuring groups, for while they tend to have a sapping effect on morale, they are completely devoted to the ending of the revels of anything that is deemed immortal—whether it is fiends, angels, fey or the undead—it matters not to the dour destroyer, for said beings, resisting the vortex of time and entropy, are anathema and must be destroyed.

**Creating a Dour Destroyer**

The most important aspect of a dour destroyer is the moment of epiphany. Almost all dour destroyers are born in a moment of trauma, where all their work, effort and passion is snuffed out in a cruel twist of fate. Whether by pillaging rovers, unthinking creatures, or even adventurers—the dour destroyer has lost all and from the wreckage, he takes an implement of destruction... and it begins whispering the truths of futility to a mind already savaged. Those that witnessed the birth of a dour destroyer often commented that they could see the light die within their tear-streaked faces. Of course, there are those that arrived at the same conclusions via vastly different paths, be it philosophical rumination or just a feeling that existence is pointlessly cruel. How did you experience the awakening? What conclusions did you draw from it? How do you perceive your interaction with your implement of destruction? What aspects of your code of conduct are most important to you? How does your instrument of destruction communicate with you? Perhaps through visions, whispers, taste? What personality does it have?

**Quick Build**

You can make a dour destroyer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be the highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the outlander background.

## Class Features
As a dour destroyer, you gain the following class features.

**Hit Points**

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per dour destroyer level

**Hit Points at 1st level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per dour destroyer level after 1st

**Proficiencies**

**Armor:** All armor, shields

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, Religion and Survival

**Equipment**

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- ***(a)*** a martial weapon and a shield or ***(b)*** two martial weapons
- ***(a)*** five javelins or ***(b)*** any simple melee weapon
- ***(a)*** a dungeoneer's pack or ***(b)*** an explorer's pack
- Chain mail

**All is Dust**

Being suffused by the very powers of entropy takes its toll on your equipment. For every total of 24 hours you carry a given item, you reduce its damage threshold permanently by 1. If an item’s damage threshold is reduced to 0, it instead begins losing hit points with a rate of 1 per day, up to a minimum of one. This is the reason most dour destroyers look like dilapidated vagabonds or beggars, but the fragility is deceptive—while in your possession, only specifically targeted attacks against objects reduced to 1 hit point via this ability will destroy them. When you for example fall on your potions, they are not crushed, in spite of their fragility.

**Entropy's Sense**

The mere presence of immortal creatures, those who have cheated death and decay, are garish to your eyes, their smell an assault on your senses. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such foes. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense thus, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect any place or object that has been magically repaired or reassembled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

**Instrument of Entropy**

You have one weapon that is the channeling tool and physical representation of your power, the fervent belief in entropy and destruction. Choose one of your starting weapons. You hear whispers and instructions from this weapon, sent to you in dreams of desolation or a pernicious whisper in your head. This is your instrument of entropy and it is, for all intents and purposes, indestructible for as long as you are alive and following the creed of the dour destroyer. The instrument of entropy is exempt from your all is dust feature. If you ever lose your instrument of entropy, you may gain a new one after a week of meditation on the nature of decay. Your instrument of entropy is a sentient magic item that can only communicate telepathically or whisper to you. This communication sounds like unintelligible gibberish to all but you. The instrument’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus and it has normal hearing and vision out to 30 feet. The range of the instrument’s senses increase to 60 feet at 7th level, and again to 120 feet at 15th level.

**Touch of Entropy**

Your weary touch can hasten the inevitable end of all things. You have a pool of entropic power points that replenishes when you take a long rest. This pool has a size equal to your dour destroyer level x 5.

As a bonus action while attacking with your instrument of destruction, you can channel a pulse of your entropic power through it. You expend a number of entropic power points of up to your dour destroyer level and add an amount of necrotic damage to the damage of the attack equal to the entropic power points expended. Undead vulnerable to radiant damage treat this damage as radiant damage instead. When attacking an object of up to your size, you instead reduce its damage threshold permanently by an equal amount. An object receiving a whole day of repairs can regain its usual damage threshold.

Additionally, when attacking a construct with touch of entropy, you add +1d6 to your damage roll for every 2 entropic power points you expend in addition to the usual benefits. If the construct has a vulnerability to a damage type, this damage is treated as said damage type. Otherwise, you treat this bonus damage as the same type as your instrument of entropy’s damage type. You can choose the alignment of the instrument freely, but it may not be good. Starting at 7th level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the instrument of destruction. This increases to +2 at 15th level and to +3 at 20th level.

**Fighting Style**

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. You gain a second fighting style at 13th level.

**Offense**

While wearing armor reduced to 1 hit point via your All is Dust feature, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.

**Shielded**

Shields you wield are exempt from the effects of your All is Dust class feature and you gain a +1 bonus to AC when wielding your instrument of destruction and a shield.

**Great Weapon Fighting**

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee instrument of destruction you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The instrument of destruction must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Inevitable**

When you see a creature use a feature or spell as a reaction to negate, redirect, or impose disadvantage on an attack roll you make against the target, you may use your own reaction to ignore the effects of the feature or effect that would impede or redirect your attack or impose disadvantage on it.

**Spellcasting**

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw upon the divine magic inherent in the dissolution of all things to cast spells. You only can cast a very select number of spells, drawn from the dour destroyer spell list. To cast one of your [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]] of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]] that are available for you to cast, choosing from the dour destroyer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]] equal to your Charisma modifier + half your dour destroyer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting a spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]] requires time spent in communion with your instrument of destruction; at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability**

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]], since their power is derived directly from the strength of your nihilist convictions and personality. You use Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dour destroyer spell you can cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spellcasting Focus**

Your instrument of entropy is your spellcasting focus for your [[Dour Destroyer Spells|dour destroyer spells]].

**Entropic Smite**

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one dour destroyer spell slot to deal necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. If a target of the smite has resistance or immunity to necrotic damage or radiance vulnerability, you deal radiant damage instead.

**Plague Carrier**

Starting at 3rd level, you become immune to the detrimental effects of diseases you have contracted. You still show signs of the diseases you incubate and exposure to you may cause other creatures to contract the diseases you incubate. Starting at 14th level, the saving throw for any disease contracted from you suffers from disadvantage.

**Oath of the Endtimes**

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that forever marks you as a chosen of entropy. Up until now you have committed to the path, but have not yet sworn heart and soul to it. Now you choose the Oath of Destruction, the Oath of Elimination or the Oath of Despair. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 15th and 20th level.

**Ability Score Improvement**

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

**Extra Attack**

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

**Aura of Decay**

Starting at 6th level, whenever a hostile creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature takes a penalty to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum penalty of –1). You must be conscious to inflict this penalty. At 9th level, the range of this aura increases to 20 feet. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

**Aura of Despair**

Starting at 10th level, hostile creatures within 10 feet of you suffer from disadvantage when making a saving throw to negate the frightened condition. You must be conscious for the aura to be in effect. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

**Improved Entropic Smite**

By 11th level, you are so suffused with the forces of entropy, that all your weapon strikes with your instrument of entropy carry the power of decay with them. Whenever you hit a creature with your instrument of entropy, the creature takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage. If a target of the smite has resistance or immunity to necrotic damage or radiance vulnerability, you deal radiant damage instead. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.

**Superior Entropic Smite**

At 17th level, when you elect to expend a dour destroyer spell slot to use your smite feature, you may elect to inflict extra force or psychic damage instead of the regular damage type.
