# Secrets of the Stone
## Features
**Spellcasting Ability**

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your secrets of the stone, since your power stems from insight into the foundations of the world. You use your Wisdom whenever a secret of the stone refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a secret of the stone you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Secret of the Stone save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

**Spellcasting Focus**

You can use a druidic focus, an arcane focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]] secrets of the stone. Once chosen, this choice cannot be reversed.
