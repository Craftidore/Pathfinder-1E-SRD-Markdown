# Stonespeaker
## Overview
**Scions of Stone**

These (mostly) dwarven geomancers are venerated for their supernatural connection to the earth. Even the [[Dweorg|dweorg]], [[Dvergr|dvergr]], and [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] show them respect (and fear) for their divine abilities, knowing full well the terrible powers at their disposal. Their mastery of the terrain is unmatched and they are talented combatants regardless, but within a subterranean arena, their elemental control makes them supreme warriors.

**Creating a Stonespeaker**

As you create your stonespeaker character, spend some time thinking about your culture and race and how it views your gifts and connections with the earth. How did your gift manifest? Was it a cause for celebration or fear? Is your power the result of deliberate study or being chosen by forces beyond your ken? How do you view your own power? As a gift or curse? Do you know why you have been bestowed with the powers of the stonespeaker? Work with your GM to determine how big a part your potential obligations may have in your daily adventuring life and how you view upperworlders and the more common races of the underworld—do you, for example, fear the open sky? If so, then why? Do the stones literally speak to you in a voice only you can perceive or is your communion with the earth a more empathic, spiritual experience? Some stonespeakers pray to deities, while others worship nature or are atheists—it all depends.

**Quick Build**

You can make a stonespeaker quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte (for pious stonespeakers) or guild artisan or [[New Background - Miner|miner]] (for secular stonespeakers) background. Third, choose the *resistance* and *acid splash* [[Secrets of the Stone|secrets of the stone]].

**Exploding Earth**

Stonespeakers have supreme command over the forces of the rocks and earth and can cause the ground to violently detonate. As an action, you can point at a 5-foot-square of earth, rock, or other solid material (wood and buildings qualify) you can see within 30 feet. Any creature within the square must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. On a failed save, the explosion inflicts 1d6 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier bludgeoning damage, half as much on a failed save. Creatures flying 5 feet or more above the square you designate are immune to exploding earth. You can expend two uses of exploding earth instead to add one of the following effects to your exploding earth:

- Creatures that fail their save have their walking speed reduced by 10 feet until they regain at least 1 hit point.
- The square you targeted with exploding earth is considered to be difficult terrain thereafter.
- Creatures that fail their save are knocked prone.

The amount of damage exploding earth inflicts increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the exploding earth column of the Stonespeaker table. At 8th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet. At 14th level, it increases to 100 feet. At 20th level, you can use this ability on any creature you can see, no matter how far away it is. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once) plus your class level. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of exploding earth left and finish a short rest, you regain 1 use of this class feature.

**Stone Lore**

Different stonespeakers claim different origins for their mastery over earth and rock. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall in one of three categories: A [[Divine Calling|divine calling]], [[Innate Power|innate power]], or the [[Geomancer]]’s bending of the earth to his whims.

**Tremorsense**

At 2nd level, a stonespeaker can feel through the very rocks. You gain tremorsense 10 ft. Your tremorsense’s range increases by +10 feet at 5th level, 8th level, 12th level, 15th level and 18th level.

**Stonestride**

Starting at 3rd level, moving through unworked, nonmagical difficult terrain made of earth and rocks costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through unworked, nonmagical rock or earth obstacles without being slowed by them or taking damage from them, even if they are hazardous. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against rocks or earthen material that is magically created or manipulated to impede movement.

**Ability Score Improvement** 

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

**Tough as Granite**

Starting at 5th level, the rocks begin suffusing your being, imbuing you with their vitality. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level above 5th.

**Enforced by the Earth I**

Starting at 10th level, your body begins taking on qualities associated with the resilient stones of the underworld. Choose slashing, piercing, fire or acid damage. You gain resistance against the chosen damage type. You may select a damage type against which you are vulnerable, but you do not get the usual benefits. Instead, you lose vulnerability to the damage type chosen.

**Siege Master**

Like the scions of the earth, you are a powerful force to behold when assaulting the inanimate. Starting at 11th level, you deal double damage to objects and structures.

**Earthen Path**

Starting at 13th level, you may, as a reaction to an enemy moving towards you or as an action, duplicate the effects of *dimension door*, with the restriction that both your current location and destination need to be in contact with earth or rocks. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (with a minimum of once) before requiring a long rest to recharge.

**Monument to the Ages**

Beginning at 15th level, your body is so suffused with the powers of the stones, you become nigh unbreakable. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage and may expend one use of your exploding earth as a reaction to being hit to reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your Constitution modifier + your stone speaker level. If you reduce the damage to 0 and it is inflicted by a nonmagical weapon or attack by a creature with a challenge equal to 15 or less, the weapon breaks upon ineffectually trying to injure you. If the attack thus negated was inflicted by a creature’s natural attack, said creature suffers disadvantage to attacks made with it until it finishes a long rest.

**Enforced by the Earth II**

At 18th level, you become immune against the damage type chosen with your enforced by the earth I feature. If you used enforced by the earth I to eliminate a vulnerability, you gain resistance to the chosen damage type instead.

**Eternal Monument**

At 20th level, you are one with the earth and every rock and just as enduring—You gain additional uses of exploding earth equal to your stonespeaker class level.

**Secrets of the Stone**

Stonespeakers do not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of magic do. Instead, you possess a repertoire of abilities known as [[Secrets of the Stone|secrets of the stone]] that require you to focus the earthen energies suffusing you. You can use each secret of the stone you know 3 times before requiring a long rest to recharge your uses for that particular secret of the stone. The [[Secrets of the Stone|secrets of the stone]] column in the stonespeaker table shows the maximum level of secret of the stone you can learn. At 7th level, for example, a stonespeaker knows 2 secret of the stone cantrips, one 1st-level secret of the stones and one 2nd-level secret of the stones. Secrets of the stones behave like spells otherwise, with one notable difference—if a given secret of the stone has an “At Higher Levels” line, a stonespeaker may not use the secret of the stone’s higher level version, unless he learned the secret at that level as well. Uses of the same secret of the stone learned at different levels are tracked independently from one another.
