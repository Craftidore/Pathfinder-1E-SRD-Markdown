# Divine Calling
## Overview
Your mastery of stone and rock stems from being chosen by a deity or nature itself. Most often, [[Stonespeaker|stonespeakers]] with this stone lore are respected members of a tradition of chosen stewards and shepherds of subterranean communities, though exceptions exist—lone, grizzled survivors of the underworld have been known to exhibit [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]] powers after prolonged exposure to the magical geodes deep within the lightless depths, their powers stemming from an instinctual communion with nature itself.

## Features
**Wrath of the Earth**

At 1st level, you can cause the very earth to rise up in defense of you, rebuking assailants. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend a use of exploding earth and cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against exploding earth. On a failed save, the creature takes your exploding earth’s damage and falls prone (without requiring you to expend an additional use of exploding earth), half as much damage and no falling prone on a successful save. Additionally, if a creature fails its save against this feature, you may Disengage as a bonus action on your next turn.

**Riddle of Stones**

At 6th level, you can attune yourself to the eternal knowledge inherent in the earth itself by sitting in meditation and communing with the rocks. During a short rest, you can choose to expend a use of exploding earth to gain proficiency with a single tool or weapon. You lose this proficiency again when on your next short or long rest.

**Embrace of the Earth**

At 9th level, you may use an action on your turn to talk to the earth to allow you to pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If properly protected against the heat, you can even swim through lava. While being embraced by the earth, you move through it at your base speed and can breathe as if the earth were air. You can see clearly up to 5 feet while embraced by the earth. Your transit leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create a ripple or sign of your presence. Using this feature expends one use of the exploding earth feature and its effects last for concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you are still inside solid earth when the effects of this ability end, you die. However, you may, at any time while being embraced by the earth, expend additional uses of exploding earth to reset the duration.

**Chosen of the Earth**

At 17th level, you are a chosen of a higher elemental power or a deity associated with the earth. As an action, you can expend one use of exploding earth to reinforce this status. Earth elementals, subterranean beasts and creatures from the elemental planes or associated with them (subject to GM’s discretion, as a guideline creatures that speak Terran as their native tongue) refuse to attack you and cease all hostility against you and your allies at the display of your might. Unless you or your allies resume hostilities, the creatures will not stand in your way, but neither are they obliged to help you. They do, however, suffer disadvantage on saves against spells and effects by you and your allies to inflict the charmed condition upon them.
