# Hoyrall Shredder (Ranger Archetype)
## Overview
*“It was horrible—suddenly, these small insectoid things started coming at us—and when Bjarn fired an arrow, things turned ugly. One of them transformed into a whirling ball of blades, impervious to damage, destroying anything in its path. Nothing could hit it... ”*

There is huge potential within the four-armed nature of the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], but mortal bodies and minds, even alien, insectoid ones, tend to have problems when trying to coordinate more than two weapons in the chaos of melee combat. Still, there are those exceedingly dexterous individuals that manage this feat, becoming whirlwinds of destruction. As you follow the path of the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] shredder, you become increasingly adept at making your 4 arms a nigh-impenetrable wall of defense or a storm of severing slashes.

## Features
**Multi-Arm Specialist**

Starting at 3rd level, you may use melee weapons that do not have the light property in conjunction with your Multi-Armed racial feature. Additionally, when using your bonus action to attack with only one additional weapon, you may now add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack. Finally, as soon as you get the Extra Attack feature and when you use your bonus action to attack with your additional arms, you are allowed to attack with additional arms on that attack as well.

**Web of Steel**

Beginning at 7th level, you learn how to weave a web of steel with your blades. Whenever you use a bonus action to gain additional attacks with weapons held in hands other than the one used during the Attack action, you may choose to begin an offensive or defensive whirl that lasts until your next turn. You may only begin one type of whirl per turn.

***Offensive Whirl.*** When you engage in an offensive whirl, you may add your ability modifier to the damage of the additional attacks you execute beyond the second, but if you do, you suffer from disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws until your next turn.

***Defensive Whirl.*** When you engage in a defensive whirl, you gain the benefits of the Dodge action. Additionally, you may choose to forego any number of your attacks during this round. Attacks foregone this way are treated as performed attacks for the purpose of interaction with the Multi-Armed racial feature. For each attack you do not execute, you gain one defensive die, which is a d8. You cannot have more than 4 defensive dice in any given round. These dice last until your next turn. When a creature damages you with a melee or ranged attack, you can use your reaction to raise your defensive whirl. If you do, at any time until your next turn, you may spend any number of defensive dice to reduce the damage incurred by an attack by the number you roll on your defensive die or dice, + your Dexterity modifier. You add your Dexterity modifier once to the total per die rolled. If you manage to reduce the damage to 0 or below and the attack negated was a melee attack, you gain an opportunity attack against the opponent and the opponent’s weapon is caught in your web of steel and the opponent has a choice: He may, as a reaction, drop the weapon to the ground, or be restrained for 1 round.

**Improved Web of Steel**

Beginning at 11th level, attacks against you after you have used more than 2 of your arms no longer gain advantage. Additionally, offensive and defensive whirl improve.

***Offensive Whirl.*** You may now engage in an offensive whirl without being in melee range by foregoing one of your attacks and those granted by beginning an Offensive Whirl associated with this attack. When you do, you gain the benefits of the Dash action, but only for the purpose of moving towards an enemy. After the movement, you may still execute your Extra Attack and all additional attacks granted by the Offensive Whirl. You may add your ability modifier to the damage of the additional attacks you execute beyond the second, but if you do add it to more than 3 attacks, you suffer from disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws until your next turn.

***Defensive Whirl.*** You may now gain up to 8 defensive dice per round, accounting for your Extra Attack feature. Additionally, a target restrained by the Defensive Whirl feature now remains restrained for a number of rounds equal to your Dexterity modifier or the number of defensive dice used to restrain the target, whichever is lower. Additionally, you may now use defensive dice to reduce damage you take incurred by spells or magic effects, though you cannot restrain opponents by reducing damage thus. Additionally, you may mix offensive and defensive whirl—you could, for example, forego one attack (and all associated attacks granted by your Offensive Whirl) to move towards an opponent, then execute your Extra Attack and any associated attacks granted you choose to execute. You could, for example, substitute 2 of these attacks to gain 2 defensive dice and execute two attacks. In essence, you may decide for one attack to be an Offensive Whirl and one to be a Defensive Whirl.

**Superior Web of Steel**

Starting at 15th level, you have truly mastered your strange fighting style.

***Offensive Whirl.*** You no longer suffer from disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws until your next turn when you use Offensive Whirl.

***Defensive Whirl.*** You may spend 2 of your defensive dice to gain the Evasion class feature until your next turn.
