# Fortune's Smith (Martial Archetype)
## Overview
*You don’t like the pauldrons?! My craft is not just a creation of tools—with each stroke, I bend the flow of fate itself. So take my goods as an investment into your destiny! If we are to adventure together, you’ll soon see why I insist—now quit your whining and let’s slay this dragon!*

The archetypical fortune’s smith is unlike most fighters in that he can make his allies more adept and flexible via his gorgeous craftsmanship.

## Features
**Bonus Proficiencies**

At 3rd level, choose up to 3 artisan's tools. You gain proficiency with these tools.

**My Own Fortune**

Also at 3rd level, you choose a number of item ‘slots’ such your head or one of the your hands equal to your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1. Whenever you wear an item you have crafted yourself in the slot chosen, you gain a number of fortune points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. You may assign or reassign any number these points either upon completing a long rest or as a bonus action  during your turn. When a fortune point is spent, it can no longer be reassigned until the fortune’s smith has completed a long rest, whereupon it regenerates. You may assign these points to do the following features:

- Fortunate Durability. The wearer may increase the damage threshold and hit points of all items worn by 5 for every fortune point assigned to this feature.
- Crafter’s Weal. The wearer of an item with a fortune point assigned to this feature may spend one fortune point assigned to use his reaction to reroll an attack roll. He must take the second result, even if it is worse.
- Fortunate Occurrence. The wearer of an item with a fortune point assigned to this feature may expend 2 fortune points assigned as part of a reaction to being critically hit. If he does, he treats the hit as a regular hit.

**Shared Fortune**

A weapon may only be ablaze with one of these energies at any given time.
