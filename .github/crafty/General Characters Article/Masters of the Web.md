# Masters of the Web
## Overview
Living in the Underworld of Aventyr for any period of time tends to alter one’s perspective. The lack of light or changes in temperature that normally indicate day and night are gone, as are the meaning of the terms. The senses run amok as constant sounds flit in and out of the limits of hearing, and the need to be able to navigate in three dimensions as chimneys and crevasses discombobulate any natural talent for direction. Were that not enough, the creeping horrors that developed below the picturesque surface of Aventyr have a disturbing trait of “changing” people. In the stygian depths, the claustrophobic tunnels, endless caverns, and undiscovered realms beneath Aventyr’s surface, the paths taken by humanoids of the Upperworld warp considerably. Specialties suited to the peculiar and particular environs abound.

Those that adapt to their surroundings live, while those that only hold fast to the old ways fall prey to menaces that lurk around every corner. The archetypes and classes in *Underworld Classes* are most frequently associated with dwarves and [[Drow|drow]], but can be adopted either by a race in an Underworld setting or by a character with an Underworld influence in their history. If your campaign doesn’t have a subterranean bent, each class has other means and motivations for characters to pursue them detailed in their class entry.

**Masters of Deception**

In the labyrinthine, nefarious politics of the underworld and in the face of the uncounted ways one can fall prey to deadly predators, few races have managed to eke out a means of survival, much less established a civilization that has reached a proper level of sophistication. Those that manage this feat are among the hardiest and most adaptable beings one can find. It is testament to their wiles that the feared [[Drow|drow]] have managed to create a truly impressive array of bustling empires built on deceit, murder, treason, and poison. Among the feared masters of the underworld, there are certain [[Drow|drow]] who have developed unique means of meeting the challenges of the underworld, known to most other races as the masters of the web.

The articles in this grouping comprise the new Masters of the Web for [[Drow]] introduced in *[[Underworld Races and Classes]]*. See the list of Governed Content on the right for a complete list of names and links.
