# Drow Magic Item
%% Description: Describes a single, stock special item, e.g. a Bag of Keeping, a Blessed Avenger sword, or an Elite Mercenary Disruptor. These are generally preconfigured stock items, unlike those built with weapon or protective properties (e.g. "flaming sword"). Usually describes the item itself, what it can be used for, how much it costs, and its general availability.

Note: This category should not be used for unique, named items in your story, such as a legendary magical blade, or a superhero's custom armor suit. Those should use the "Named Equipment" or "Named Object" topic categories as appropriate. If their characteristics are identical to a stock special item, you can reference the special item article from the named equipment or named object topic for stats, descriptions, etc. %%
