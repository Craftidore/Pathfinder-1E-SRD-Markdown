*Clouds whirl into existence and, with a peal of thunder, let loose a drenching downpour.*

You cause clouds to gather and a heavy rain to fall. The rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a –4 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5 Spot and Search) checks. It automatically extinguishes unprotected flames and has a 50% chance of extinguishing protected flames. Ranged weapon attacks and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5 Listen) checks take a –4 penalty. Fire damage in this spell’s area is reduced by 1 point per die of damage.

This spell does not function indoors, underground, underwater, or in desert climates. After the spell ends, the water created evaporates over the next 10 minutes. The water created with this spell does not slake thirst or provide any nourishment to plants.
