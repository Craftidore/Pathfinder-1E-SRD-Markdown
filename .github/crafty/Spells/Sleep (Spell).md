A *sleep* spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spellâ€™s point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are [[Helpless|helpless]]. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). *Sleep* does not target [[Unconscious|unconscious]] creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

**GM Note** 

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 1 to Level per *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
