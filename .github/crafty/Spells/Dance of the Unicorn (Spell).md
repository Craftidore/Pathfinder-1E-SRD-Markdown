*Whirling your pointed finger through a complex gesture, you create a cool and fresh mist that cleanses the air of pollutants.* 

You surround yourself with a purifying, swirling mist that washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons. Nonmagical contaminants, including inhaled poisons, are automatically negated within the cloud. *Dance of the unicorn* also grants everyone within the mist a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical or supernatural gas effects, such as *[[Acid Fog (Spell)|acid fog]], [[Cloudkill (Spell)|cloudkill]]*, and green dragon breath.

The cloud of mist leaves everything within its area damp.
