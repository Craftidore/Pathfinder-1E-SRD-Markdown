This spell accomplishes 4 hours worth of crafting as if you were investing that time yourself. You must make any checks necessary to the creation process, applying your own ranks and modifiers to the results. *Magician’s workshop* can develop mundane or magical items so long as the means to craft the items are provided before you cast the spell. Multiple instances of this spell may be used to develop the same item simultaneously, provided that the workshop is capable of accommodating multiple craftsmen.

*Magician’s workshop’s* development does not apply toward the caster’s normal magic item creation limit of one item per day, nor does it apply toward the caster’s normal magic item creation limit of eight hours of work per day.

If this spell is extended, eight hours of work are accomplished.
