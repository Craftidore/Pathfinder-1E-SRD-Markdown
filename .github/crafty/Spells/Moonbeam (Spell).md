*As you complete this spell, a swath of pale moonlight springs from your hand.* 

On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone of light points.

Light from a *moonbeam* spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creatureâ€™s next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against *moonbeam,* it is not affected by any more of your *moonbeam* spells for 24 hours.

*Moonbeam* penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a *moonbeam.*
