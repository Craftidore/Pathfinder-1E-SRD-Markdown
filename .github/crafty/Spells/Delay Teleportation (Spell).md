The subject of the spell is surrounded with an invisible aura that delays the teleportation of any creature within the spell's area seeking to leave it. Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) are delayed. The spell delays the departure of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it departs on its initiative count immediately before its next turn).
