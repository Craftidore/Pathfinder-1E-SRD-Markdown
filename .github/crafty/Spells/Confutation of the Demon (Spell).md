**Casting Time:** One standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 feet + 10 feet/level)

**Target:** 1 evil outsider/round

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 56

When you point your finger at an evil outsider and speak holy words whispered to you by servants of the divine, you consume the outsider utterly in an explosion of light and glory. Beings with less than 10 HD get no saving throw versus this effect. Those with 20 HD or more are not consumed but instead suffer 10d6 points of holy damage if they fail their saving throw. Beings of godlike status are immune to the effects of this spell.

Despite its name, this spell works equally well on devils, efreeti, and all evil outsiders. When an evil outsider is consumed, it is destroyed utterly and forever.
