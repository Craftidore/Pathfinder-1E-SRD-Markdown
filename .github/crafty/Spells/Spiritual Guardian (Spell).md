*The sound of hoofbeats begins in the distance and draws swiftly nearer. As though leaping down from an invisible charger, a translucent knight, clad head to toe in heavy plate, appears by your side. The holy symbol of your deity is emblazoned across his tabard and shield.*

By casting this spell, you create a translucent knight made of force. It remains within 5 feet of you at all times, constantly matching your speed and mode of travelâ€”even if you are mounted or magically accelerated. Any time you are attacked, it moves to parry the attack with its shield or longsword, granting you a +6 deflection bonus to Armor Class. As a standard action in any round, you can command the knight to make a single attack against any creature within 5 feet. It strikes with its longsword, using your base attack bonus and applying your Wisdom modifier to the roll. The attack deals 1d8 points of force damage +1 extra point per three caster levels (maximum +10).

At any point before the spell expires, you can turn the knight loose and order it to fight on its own. It then moves at a speed of 60 feet to attack any foe you designate. It continues to use your base attack bonus and your Wisdom modifier for its attack rolls, and it can make as many attacks per round as your base attack bonus allows. You need not concentrate on the knight as long as it is fighting a specific opponent, but commanding it to change foes requires a move action. If its opponent falls, the knight waits for your direction.

Once you have turned the knight loose, you lose the deflection bonus to Armor Class that it provided, and you cannot regain it. Furthermore, the remaining duration of the spell converts from minutes per level to rounds per level on a one-to-one basis.
