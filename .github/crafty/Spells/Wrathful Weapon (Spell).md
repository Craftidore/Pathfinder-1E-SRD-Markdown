You grant the targeted weapon one of the following weapon special abilities: *[[Anarchic (MagWpnSpcAb)|anarchic]]*, *[[Axiomatic (MagWpnSpcAb)|axiomatic]]*, *[[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]]*, or *[[Unholy (MagWpnSpcAb)|unholy]]*. If *[[Anarchic (MagWpnSpcAb)|anarchic]]*, this spell has the chaos descriptor; if *[[Axiomatic (MagWpnSpcAb)|axiomatic]],* the law descriptor; if *[[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]],* the good descriptor; and if *[[Unholy (MagWpnSpcAb)|unholy]]*, the evil descriptor. If the caster attempts to place a special ability on a weapon that already has that special ability, the spell fails. If a warpriest casts this spell on his sacred weapon, the duration doubles. Warpriests with unarmed strike as a sacred weapon can cast this spell on their unarmed strike.
