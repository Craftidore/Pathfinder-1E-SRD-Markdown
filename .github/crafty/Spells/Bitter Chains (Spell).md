With a successful melee touch attack, the ring you wield bursts into chains of sharp, interlocking rings that envelop the target. The target is [[Entangled|entangled]] while chained. If the target moves more than 5 ft. in a round while under the effect of this spell, it takes 1 hp [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] damage/caster level (maximum 10 hp per round) as the rings dig into the creature.

The target must make a concentration check (DC 15 + the spell’s level) to successfully cast a spell while chained. As a full-round action, the target can attempt an [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check to escape the chains or a Strength check to burst the chains. The DC for these checks is equal to the spell’s DC. A successful check escapes the spell. A failed check deals [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] damage as if the creature had moved more than 5 ft.
