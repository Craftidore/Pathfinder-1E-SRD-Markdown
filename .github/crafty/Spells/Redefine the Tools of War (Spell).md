You transform a single weapon, shield, or suit of armor into any other type of weapon, shield, or armor. The new form’s size must be within one size category of the original item, it must fall into the same general category (weapons can be turned into other weapons, but not armor), and it must be possible to make the new form from the same material as the original armor ([[Mithral|mithral]] full plate cannot be turned into leather armor).

The item adopts all the base qualities of its new form, such a damage, weight, or armor class; however it is made from the same material as the original item, gains any bonuses granted from special craftsmanship (such as the masterwork quality) and retains all of its magical properties.

If the item changes into a form that is incompatible with one of its magical abilities, such as if a *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* weapon were transformed into a bludgeoning weapon, that ability is suppressed as long as *redefine the tools of war* is in effect. If a nondouble weapon is transformed into a double weapon, then only one head gains the benefits of special craftsmanship, materials, or magical enhancement. If a double weapon is transformed into a non-double weapon, you select one head’s special properties to transfer to the new form, and the other head’s properties are suppressed while the spell remains in effect. If you transform one double weapon into another double weapon, you may freely choose which head of the old weapon corresponds to the new weapon.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Duration changed from Permanent to Instantaneous for campaign continuity.

There is an OGL version of this spell from Silven Publishing, 50 New Ways to Turn Things into Other Things, page 25.
