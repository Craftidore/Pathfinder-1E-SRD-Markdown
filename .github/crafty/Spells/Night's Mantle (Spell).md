You imbue a creature with an invisible shield that protects it from all effects of sunlight. If cast on a vampire or other creature that is normally harmed or destroyed by exposure to sunlight, the spell allows that creature to function in sunlight without hindrance. The spell does not overcome any aversion the target creature may have for sunlight, however.

*Night’s mantle* is not countered or dispelled by any light spell of equal or lower level (such as the 3rd-level cleric spell *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]*). It can be countered or dispelled by a light spell of greater level (such as the 8th-level cleric spell *[[Sunburst (Spell)|sunburst]]**,* which both counters *night’s mantle* and inflicts its normal damage).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7 to Level.

*House Rule: Night's mantle* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
