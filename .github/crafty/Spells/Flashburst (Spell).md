*Flashburst* creates a blinding, dazzling flash of light. Sighted creatures within the area are [[Blinded|blinded]] for 2d8 rounds. A successful Will save negates the blindness. Creatures in the area are [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round even if their save was successful. Creatures outside the area, but within 120 feet of the burst, can be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 2d8 rounds if they have line of sight to the burst (Will negates). Creatures outside the burst area are not [[Dazzled|dazzled]].
