*You uncork the vial and pour out its contents, and the armor you designate begins to soften and flow.*

You alter the physical properties of a metal object so that it runs like water. The melted metal does not change temperature but flows as a liquid for 1 round and then returns to its normal solid state, usually in a form resembling a puddle. An item in a creature’s possession is allowed a Will save, using the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
