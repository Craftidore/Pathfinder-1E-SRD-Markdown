*You force your will against that of the possessing fiend, trying with all the strength of your faith to drive it from the body of the unfortunate creature before you.*

After casting this spell, you can spend a use of your turn or rebuke undead ability (as a standard action) in an attempt to drive a possessing fiend from its host. The host creature or object must be within range of your turn or rebuke attempt. However, you do not make a turning check when you cast the spell. The possessing fiend must instead succeed on a Will save or be driven from the host and shunted into the nearest available open space in its incorporeal form. (See the rules for possession.) This use of turn or rebuke undead has no effect on undead within range of the ability.

A fiend driven from its host cannot attempt to possess that same host for 24 hours.

*Material Component:* A vial of holy or unholy water.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *exorcism* to *lesser exorcism* to avoid duplication.
