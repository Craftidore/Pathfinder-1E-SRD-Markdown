*The plant-matter creaks and writhes beneath your hand as you generate a malignant rot at its center.*

This spell allows you to deliver a single touch that either damages a plant creature over a number of rounds or renders a wooden weapon poisonous.

When used as a touch attack against a plant creature, the spell deals 1d8 points of damage per round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round.

Alternatively, you can touch a weapon with a wooden striking surface (such as a club or quarterstaff). Any creature damaged by the weapon is [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. Treat this as a poison effect for creatures immune or resistant to such effects.
