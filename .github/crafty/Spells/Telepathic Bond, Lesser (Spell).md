*As you send your thoughts outward, your mind brushes against the consciousness of your friend and it welcomes you, forming a bond that no distance can break.*

You forge a telepathic bond with another creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher. You can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).
