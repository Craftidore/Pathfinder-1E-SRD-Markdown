To utter the holy words of the kami is to bring forth magic of awesome power. Creatures with the Shadowlands subtype or with a Taint score suffer the following ill effects:


| **HD** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 12 or more | [[Deafened]] |
| Less than 12 | [[Blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |
| Less than 8 | [[Paralyzed]], [[Blinded\|blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |
| Less than 4 | Killed, [[Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[Blinded\|blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |

The effects are cumulative.

**Deafened:** The creature is [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1d4 rounds. A [[Deafened|deafened]] creature, in addition to the obvious effects, automatically fails Listen checks, suffers a –4 penalty on initiative, and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that it tries to cast.

**Blinded:**The creature is [[Blinded|blinded]] for 2d4 rounds. In addition to the obvious effects, a [[Blinded|blinded]] creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers’ attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks.

**Paralyzed:** The creature is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] and [[Helpless|helpless]] for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.

**Killed:** Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

Creatures free of Taint and without the Shadowlands subtype, including the spellcaster, are [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1d4 rounds, regardless of their Hit Dice.
