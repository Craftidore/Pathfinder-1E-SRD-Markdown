Cold energy surges through the target’s body, congealing the blood in the creature’s extremities. This effect causes a –4 penalty on attacks, Armor Class, and all Strength- and Dexterity-related checks, and anyone casting a spell with a somatic component has a 50% chance of spell failure for the duration of the spell. If the target makes its Fortitude save, the creature only takes a –2 penalty on attacks, Armor Class, and all Strength- and Dexterity-related checks and has only a 25% chance of spell failure for spells with a somatic component.
