The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of woven, spiked chains to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.

A *wall of chains* is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wallâ€™s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 20 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 20 +2 per inch of thickness. Creatures who use a Strength check to breach the wall take 1d6 points of damage from the spikes and barbs covering the chains.
