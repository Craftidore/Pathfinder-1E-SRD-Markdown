The air in front of you shimmers slightly as a strange mirror suddenly materializes, hovering in the air. Through the mirror, you can see anywhere on any plane or realm. You can always see a place that you have visited at least once, even if you are not exactly sure where that was. If you only have a name of a place, there is a 50% chance of success. If you have a description of the place, the chance of success is 25%.

The mirror is open on both sides, meaning that creatures on the other side could gaze back. If you use a diamond worth 200 gp as an arcane focus, no creature will be able to see the mirror on the other side.
