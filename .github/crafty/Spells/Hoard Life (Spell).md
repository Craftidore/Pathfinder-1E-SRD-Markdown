*You clasp your hands around a gem. A flash goes off, and then a feeling of deep weariness passes through you. The gem now bears a spark of light within it.*

Although true healing magic is usually the province of the divine, dragon sorcerers have devised an arcane method of creating a “reserve” of health for use in emergencies. This spell siphons off hit points from the caster and temporarily stores them in a gem for later retrieval.

When you cast this spell, you deal nonlethal damage equal to twice your caster level to yourself, and you become [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. (If you are immune to nonlethal damage, this spell automatically fails.) At any point during the spell’s duration, you can use a standard action while holding the gem to heal yourself of an amount of damage equal to the nonlethal damage the spell dealt to you. This healing can’t cause you to exceed your full normal hit points; any healing in excess of this amount is lost. Triggering this effect ends the spell’s duration (so you can’t portion out the healing over multiple uses). Triggering the healing does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 

If the spell’s duration elapses before you have triggered the healing, you gain no benefit from the spell. Casting this spell a second time automatically ends the duration of any previous casting of the spell that you have performed.

*Focus:* A gem worth at least 50 gp.

*Special:* A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
