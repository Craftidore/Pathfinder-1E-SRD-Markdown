With this spell, you place a magic trap on any object that casts a shadow. If the object is disturbed in any way that causes its shadow to shift (for instance, if it or a nearby light source is moved), a bound greater shadow emerges from the object’s shadow to attack the nearest living creature. The shadow can be turned or destroyed as normal; otherwise, it remains for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. If the trapped object resides in a place that has no shadows, the trap does not trigger, although the spell remains in effect.

**GM Note**

Note: Another action that could trigger this trap is if a stronger light source were brought into its area; causing the trapped object’s shadow to shift.
