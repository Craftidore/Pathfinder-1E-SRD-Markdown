You warp time with regard to your subject, causing the effects of old age to sap his strength and leave him a disheveled husk of his former self. On a failed save, you cause your opponent to suffer a  -4 penalty to any three attributes of your choice. The subject ages before your eyes, his hair turns gray, his skin wrinkles, and he hunches over under the weight of his advancing years.

You may also use this spell against inanimate objects, which causes them to crumble, rust, and otherwise weaken. They lose the benefits of their hardness rating for the duration of this spell.

Casting this spell can cause a backlash in the flow of time. You must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or suffer 2d4 points of damage to each of the same 3 attributes. Should any attribute be reduced to 0, you immediately die, crumbling to dust.
