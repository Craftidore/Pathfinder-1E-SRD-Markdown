You can spit out to close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). If you have a poison bite attack, this spell allows you to spit your poison out to this range. You make a ranged touch attack to hit your foe, and if you succeed, the target must make a saving throw against your poison as if it had been bitten.

This spell is normally used by the yuan-ti and has no significant effect if used with normal spittle.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1 to Level.
