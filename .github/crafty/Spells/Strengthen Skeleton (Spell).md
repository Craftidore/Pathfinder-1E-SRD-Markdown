*A brief flash engulfs your ally, and through his flesh you can see his skeleton. The skeleton glows a foggy gray for a moment, thickening with eldritch power, then all is as it was before.*

You cause the skeleton of the target corporeal undead to become thicker and as strong as stone. This gives the subject a +3 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor.

*Arcane Focus:* A miniature skull carved of granite.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *stone bones* to *strengthen skeleton* to avoid duplication.
