Your teeth extend and sharpen, transforming your mouth into a maw of razor-sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit with this attack, it also deals 1 point of [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] damage. If you already have a bite attack, your bite deals 2 points of [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] damage on a critical hit. You are considered proficient with this attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus â€“5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage.

You can end this spell before its normal duration by making a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can make an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Elven archer 1 to Level per New Paths Compendium (Kobold Press), pg. 20.
