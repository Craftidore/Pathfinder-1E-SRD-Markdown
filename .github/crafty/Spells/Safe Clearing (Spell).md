*You press your hand against the ground and intone the ancient words. A green radiance spreads from your hand, forming a ring of translucent jade flames. “We’re safe,” you tell your allies, “for the moment.”*

You make an area safe from attacks. This spell’s benefit functions much like that of the *[[Sanctuary (Spell)|sanctuary]]* spell. The area of a *safe clearing* spell is immobile. Any creature attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack anyone within the *safe clearing*, or any creature attempting to enter the area, must make a Will save. Success means the creature can act normally and is not affected by this casting of the spell. Failure means it can’t attack anyone in the area or even enter the area for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack creatures in the warded area remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent creatures in the warded area from being attacked or affected by area spells.

A creature within the area that makes an attack is no longer protected by the spell, and can be targeted normally.
