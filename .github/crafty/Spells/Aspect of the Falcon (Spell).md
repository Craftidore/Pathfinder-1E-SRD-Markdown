You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat or a *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* weapon.

**GM Note**

Added Elven archer 1 to Level per New Paths Compendium (Kobold Press), pg. 20.
