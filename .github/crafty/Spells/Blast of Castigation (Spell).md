You hurl a ray of violet energy from your open palm. You must make a ranged attack roll against the target. A successful strike inflicts 1d8 points of damage for every three caster levels (maximum 5d8).

You may then concentrate to keep blasting the target with a continuous beam of energy. Each round the target is blasted, the spell deals 1d8 points of damage for every three caster levels (maximum 5d8).

If you or the target moves so as to break line of sight, even for a moment, the spell ends. You cannot switch the target of the spell once you have cast it.
