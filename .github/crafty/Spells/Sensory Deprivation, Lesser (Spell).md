*Your vision blurs, and sounds seem muffled as you cast the spell. Upon completing it, you release the spellâ€™s energy, freeing your senses from that which dampened them. The target of your spell glows for an instant with a black aura.*

Rather than creating an illusion of something, this spell creates an illusion of absolute nothingness. The spell effect surrounds the subject in a dark, clinging shadow that only it perceives, which blocks all auditory, olfactory, taste, and visual sensations. In addition, it blocks finely tuned senses of touch such as those that provide a creature with tremorsense. A subject that fails its save is [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Deafened|deafened]], and it gains no benefit from blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense.

The subject retains any telepathic or empathic links it might possess with other creatures while affected by the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *sensory deprivation* to *lesser sensory deprivation* to avoid duplication.
