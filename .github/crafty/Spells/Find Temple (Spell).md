*At ease and filled with a reassuring calm, you close your eyes for a moment to allow your deity to guide you to a holy place.*

With this spell, you can easily find a place to worship and possible aid or shelter from the priests within. When the spell is cast, you sense the direction of the nearest temple to your god. If there is none within the spellâ€™s area, the spell instead shows you the direction of the nearest temple dedicated to a god of the same alignment as yours. You can also specify a particular temple to search for, but you must have visited the temple personally at some point in the past (seeing the temple through a divination does not count).
