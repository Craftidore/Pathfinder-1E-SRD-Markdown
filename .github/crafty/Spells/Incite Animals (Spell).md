This spell incites and enrages animals, making them hostile and vicious. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + your caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained only to attack on order is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not. For example, a ranger could enrage a normal bear or wolf with little trouble, but itâ€™s more difficult to drive a trained guard dog into a frenzy so that it attacks its master.

The affected creatures attack the nearest creature, including any other creatures affected by this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: Name changed from *enrage animals* to *incite animals.*
