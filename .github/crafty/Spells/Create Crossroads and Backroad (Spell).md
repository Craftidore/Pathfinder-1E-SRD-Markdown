You form two crossroads and a backroad that links them. The crossroads are vertical, rectangular areas of up to 50 square feet each. You must have personally visited the end crossroads location in order to create the backroad.

The spell summons a crossroads guardian and establishes a crossroads at each end.

The crossroads guardians always start with a Helpful attitude toward their creator.

The procedure requires your complete dedication and attention for a full day, preparing and nurturing the site, typically naturalizing it and removing signs of civilization.
