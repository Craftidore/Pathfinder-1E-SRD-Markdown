This spell creates flickering motes of light that cause intense mental anguish. Creatures inside or passing through a cloud of *dolorous motes* must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. A new save may be made each round. Leaving and then re-entering a cloud of motes forces a new save.

The caster can create one large cloud of flickering motes or several smaller clouds. For example, a 5th-level caster could create five separate clouds, each filling a 10-foot cube anywhere within the spellâ€™s range. Conversely, the caster can group one or more 10-foot-cubes together to form larger clouds or barriers. The affected cubes need not be adjacent to one another, but each cloud is stationary once placed.

*Sacrifice:* 1d3 points of Wisdom damage.
