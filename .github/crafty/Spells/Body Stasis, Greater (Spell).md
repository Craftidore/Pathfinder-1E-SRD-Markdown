This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Body Stasis (Spell)|body stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Petrified|petrified]], poisoned, or polymorphed.

Subjects of this spell are also immune to critical hits.

If cast on a Shapechanger or other creature with the means to change shape, this spell prevents the creature from changing shape.

This spell also prevents the subject from becoming poisoned or diseased. All poisons and diseases the subject comes in contact with have no effect on the subject. Poisons and diseases within the subject before the spell is cast cannot be cured as long as the spell is active.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
