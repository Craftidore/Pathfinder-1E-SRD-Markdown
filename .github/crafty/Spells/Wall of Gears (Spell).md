*You pop the gear into your mouth and make a humming, buzzing incantation. The sound takes on a life of its own, and springing from the ground is a huge wall made of machinery, all spinning, clattering and moving about, endangering all who are close to it.*

This spell creates a 6-inch-thick wall of moving iron cogs, wheels, gears, pistons, and assorted mechanical parts. Each 5-foot square of the wallâ€™s surface has hardness 10 and 90 hit points.

Both sides of the wall have hundreds of moving parts that flail out, dealing 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within 10 feet. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.
