# Whispercast, Greater (Spell)

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 13th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 13]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** The Mage's Tower 

Any spell you cast during *greater whispercast's* duration can be cast as a purely mental action, provided that it is of 7th level or lower. It requires no somatic or material components, unless the spell normally requires a focus or an expensive material component (any component worth more than 25 gp). If the spell does require a focus or an expensive component, you can still *greater whispercast* it as long as you have the focus or expensive component on your personâ€”the magic of *greater whispercast* causes the focus to be used or the expensive component to be consumed normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it.

**GM Note:**

*House Rule:* Spells that are *whispercast* using this spell are much more difficult to identify via [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]; spells with a V or S component add an additional +10 penalty to the difficulty to do so.
