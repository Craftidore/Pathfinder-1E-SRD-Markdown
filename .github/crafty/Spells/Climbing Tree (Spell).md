*At your call, a tree snakes up from the earth, in seconds growing as tall as trees that have lived for years.*

You cause a 1-foot-diameter tree to grow in the center of any adjacent square. The tree can grow as high as 10 feet per caster level (to a maximum of 50 feet). The branches are evenly spaced and perfect for climbing; ascending the tree requires a successful DC 5 [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check.

The tree can grow only in soft terrain, such as dirt, soil, or sand. The tree has hardness 5 and 120 hit points; if cut down, it vanishes instantly. It can't be animated by any means, such as with *[[Animate Plants (Spell)|animate plants]]**,* nor can it serve as the basis for any plant-related spell such as *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]**.* Treat the tree as a slender pillar for terrain purposes.
