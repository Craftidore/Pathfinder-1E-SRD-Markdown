Keleshite wizards and clerics have always sought to emulate the genies that they bind. The *geniekind* spell is the result of attempts to gain the power and influence of these proud outsiders without entirely forsaking the casterâ€™s own form.

Upon casting this spell, you must choose one type of genie to transform into, selecting from [[Genie, Djinn (Bestiary PF1)|djinni]], [[Genie, Efreet (Bestiary PF1)|efreeti]], [[Genie, Marid (Bestiary PF1)|marid]], or [[Genie, Shaitan (Bestiary PF1)|shaitan]]. You retain your basic physical appearance but shift in some way to become more akin to the genie type you chose. While under the effects of *geniekind*, you gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against [[S3.1N-Q - Universal Monster Rules N-Q (Bestiary 6 Apx)|paralysis]], [[S3.1N-Q - Universal Monster Rules N-Q (Bestiary 6 Apx)|poison]], sleep, and stunning effects, and a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus. You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution and a +5 bonus on all [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made when interacting with creatures of the same [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|elemental subtype]] as your chosen genie. In addition, you gain other abilities depending upon the type of genie you choose to assume the form of, as detailed below.

*[[Genie, Djinn (Bestiary PF1)|Djinni]]*: You gain the ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. When flying, your lower torso trails away into a vortex of wind and smoke. You gain resist electricity 10.

*[[Genie, Efreet (Bestiary PF1)|Efreeti]]*: Your flesh turns a deep red and you grow large horns on your head. Your unarmed strikes and any melee weapon you wield deal +1d6 points of fire damage. You gain resist fire 10.

*[[Genie, Marid (Bestiary PF1)|Marid]]*: Your flesh turns blue and you gain webbed fingers and toes. You gain a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe water. You gain resist cold 10.

*[[Genie, Shaitan (Bestiary PF1)|Shaitan]]*: Your flesh gains the coloration of stone and your hair appears to be sculpted from fine crystals. You gain a burrow speed of 60 feet and resist acid 10.
