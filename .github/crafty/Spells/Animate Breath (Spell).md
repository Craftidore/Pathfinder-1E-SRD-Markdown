*You exhale a flaming tongue of fire, but instead of lashing out against your foes, it produces a creature made of flames that answers to your bidding.*

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as *dragon breath*. When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The animated breath then attacks whomever or whatever you designate. The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) damage. The animated breath uses the statistics of a Huge fire elemental, with the following exceptions.

- The creatureâ€™s subtype changes to match the energy damage dealt by the breath weapon.
- The creature deals 2d8 points of damage of the same type as the breath weapon with each successful slam attack, instead of 2d8 points of fire.
- The creature has immunity to its own energy type, but no vulnerability to another energy type.
- The creature does not have the burn ability.
