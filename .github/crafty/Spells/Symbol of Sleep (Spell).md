This spell functions like *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the *symbol of sleep* instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 Ã— 10 minutes. Unlike with the *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]* spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, *symbol of sleep* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of sleep* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of sleep* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill to find a *symbol of sleep* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +  spell level, or 30 for *symbol of sleep*.
