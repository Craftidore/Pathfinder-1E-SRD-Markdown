You call into being a small double-decked sailing ship that functions in all respects as an ordinary caravel. It can take on the normal amount of cargo, crew, and passengers, and even have weapons mounted on it if you wish. The ship does not require a full crew, as it is staffed with a complement of invisible deckhands similar to *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servants]]* that perform all ordinary functions necessary for sailing the *caster’s caravel*, though they cannot steer it. These *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servants]]* have a speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 15 feet, and they respond to the spoken commands of the caster or any creature she designates as the ship’s pilot. If there is no living pilot, the ship steers itself in whatever direction it was last directed, but it cannot adjust its course to avoid hazards, compensate for severe weather, etc.

The *caster’s caravel* also contains an extradimensional space reached through a shimmering panel similar to the entrance of a *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage’s magnificent mansion]]**.* Like that spell, only those designated by you can enter the portal. It is invisible to others, who pass down the aft deck ladder that leads to it and into an ordinary cargo hold. Within the extradimensional space, which can fill up to three 10-foot cubes per caster level, you can create any deck plan you desire. All cabins within the space are furnished and its galley contains food and water sufficient to feed one Medium-sized creature per caster level each day. A staff of uniformed and transparent but visible *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servants]]* waits upon all guests within the extradimensional space and sees to their needs. Like a *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage’s magnificent mansion]]*, outside conditions do not affect those within. Even if the ship sinks, those within the space remain unharmed, though they must leave through the same portal by which they entered, even if it lies at the bottom of the sea.

**GM Note**

This spell replaces *[[Capable Caravel (Spell)|capable caravel]]* in Pathfinder.

In the World of Greyhawk setting, this spell is commonly known as *[[Capable Caravel (Spell)|Mordenkainen's capable caravel]].*

An important consideration is that 'outside conditions do not affect the passenger space.' This means that there is no risk of [[Seasickness (PF Freeport Comp)|seasickness]] within the extradimensional space. Also, should the ship sink, the extradimensional space is unaffected by pressure effects. Someone leaving or entering the extradimensional space does not risk it being flooded as the spell is quite specific about only designated individuals being able to do so. Like the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell, environmental effects within the extradimensional space are renewed, ie., it always has fresh air.

Unlike the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell, whose entrance does not move with a ship (*Skull and Shackles Player's Guide 17*) the extradimensional space here does.

*House Rule:* Subsequent castings of this spell or *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* by the same caster within an existing extradimensional mansion extend either the duration by the amount of the subsequent casting or double the size of the extradimensional mansion.

### Caravel

[[Deck plan - Caravel.jpg|open outside]]

1.Sterncastle

The ship's wheel is located on this raised platform at the aft of the vessel; it is generally from here that the captain issues orders while sailing.

2. Forecastle

The ship's forward mounted ballista is here, usually kept covered by an oilcloth tarp.

3. Captain's Cabin

By far the most elaborate quarters on the vessel is this small room. It has a table, along with a bed, a wardrobe, a chest and a barrel of liquor. 

4. Ship's Mess

A large well lit room used for dining by the ship's officers (and any important passengers) as well as a meeting room when necessary.

5. Main Deck

The main deck is a broad, open space, although usually it is filled at least in part with ropes, the ship's anchor, a lifeboat and that sort of thing. Next to the mainmast is the hatch providing access to the cargo hold below.

6. Crew Quarters

Twelve hammocks are arrayed in this area, in two tiers on a solid wooden framework. The crew members sleep here, usually in shifts. In addition there can usually be found a number of sea chests, one per crewman, arranged beneath the hammocks.

7. Ship's Galley

Here the ship's cook and his helper both live and work; preparing meals for the crew (and any passengers).

8. Ship's Larder

This water-tight room is always locked with only the ship's cook and the captain holding keys to it. Here the ship's provisions are stored.

9. Cargo Hold

This space could contain just about anything, provided it can fit in through the cargo hatch. A cargo hatch set into the deck leads to the lower hold.

10. Private Cabin

For important passengers or, at least, those who can pay for it, this cabin boasts a bed and perhaps a table or a storage trunk. It can also be used for a first mate, if appropriate.

12. Secure Storage

The door to this room has a lock built into and the door itself is iron. Only the captain hold the key to this room which is used for securing valuables as well as a cell for prisoners as needed.

13. Lower Hold

This large open area is split into two separate areas: each is used for holding bulk goods as well as ship's stores (timber, rope, canvas, etc.

14. Crow's Nest (Not pictured)

A small platform high on the ship's foremast provides a place for the lookout to stand.
