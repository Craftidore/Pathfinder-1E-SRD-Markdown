You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it strikes. The *aqueous orb* can move up to 30 feet per round, rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches any nonmagical fires and functions as *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* against magical fires as long as those fires are size Large or less.

Any creature in the path of the *aqueous orb* takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a Medium or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the *aqueous orb* and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They gain cover against attacks from outside the *aqueous orb* but are considered [[Entangled|entangled]] by its churning currents, takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each round to escape into a random square adjacent to the *aqueous orb*. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An *aqueous orb* stops if it moves outside the spellâ€™s range.
