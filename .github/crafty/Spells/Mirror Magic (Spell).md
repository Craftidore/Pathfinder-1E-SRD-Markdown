You can converse with another being using a pair of mirrors. When you cast the spell, gaze into a mirror, and specify the person you wish to contact, you see that creature as if gazing from the mirror closest to the creature. In order for the spell to function, the creature must be willing to communicate and be within 10 feet of a mirror.

A particular sound (such as clarion horns, a single note, a chime, or the like) emanates from the distant mirror to announce your wish to converse. You choose this sound at the time of casting. If the target creature is present and wishes to converse, it need only gaze into the mirror and give mental or verbal acquiescence. Doing so allows the target to see and hear all that transpires within 10 feet of your mirror, within its normal limits of perception. You and the target can then speak and see through the mirror for the duration of the spell, as can any other creatures within 10 feet of the surface of either mirror.

If the target is not present, or does not accept your attempt at communication with 5 rounds, or either mirror is broken, the spell ends. The two mirrors are ordinary in every respect except while used to communicate. During that time, each gives off a faint aura of divination.
