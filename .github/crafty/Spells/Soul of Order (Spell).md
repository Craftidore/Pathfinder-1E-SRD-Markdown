*A shimmering field of silver energy flows up your body from your feet to your head, giving your skin a metallic sheen.*

This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the primal forces of law. You gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saves made to resist enchantment effects. Your natural weapons are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Regardless of your normal alignment, you are considered lawful-aligned for the purpose of effects that rely on alignment (such as *[[Protection From Law (Spell)|protection from law]]* or *[[Order's Wrath (Spell)|order's wrath]]*).

If *soul of order* and *[[Soul of Light (Spell)|soul of light]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/chaotic or evil. If *soul of order* and *[[Soul of Shadow (Spell)|soul of shadow]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/chaotic or good.

*Soul of order* counters and dispels *[[Soul of Anarchy (Spell)|soul of anarchy]]**,* and vice versa.

*Special:* A lawful-aligned dragon capable of casting 4th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
