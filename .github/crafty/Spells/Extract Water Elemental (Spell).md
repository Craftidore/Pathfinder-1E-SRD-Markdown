*Calling upon the essence of elemental water, you surround your target creature with a swirling blue and red aura. The aura seeps into the creature a moment before water spurts forth from its pores. It cries out in pain.*

This brutal spell causes the targeted creature to dehydrate horribly as the moisture in its body is forcibly extracted through its eyes, nostrils, mouth, and pores. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage on a successful Fortitude save. If the targeted creature is slain by this spell, the extracted moisture is transformed into a water elemental of a size equal to the slain creature (up to Huge). The water elemental is under your control, as if you summoned it, and disappears after 1 minute.

This spell has no effect on living creatures with the fire subtype.
