*A ray of pulsing yellow light springs from your hand. It strikes your target and wraps around him like a snake, hampering his ability to move and attack.*

This spell creates a ropey strand of arcane energy that restricts a creature’s movements. A creature struck by this ray can only make one attack per round and cannot make attacks of opportunity. In addition, the creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet.

After the spell has been in effect for 1 round, at the start of its turn in each round thereafter, the subject is allowed a Reflex save to resist the spell’s effects. If the save succeeds, the creature ignores the spell’s effects for that round. It must make a new save each round, regardless of the result of a previous save.
