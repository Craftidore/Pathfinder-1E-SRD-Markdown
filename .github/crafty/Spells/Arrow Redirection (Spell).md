As *[[Arrow Reflection (Spell)|arrow reflection]]*, except that you may redirect the ranged attack at anyone of your choosing within the attack’s normal range. The attack retains its initial attack roll to determine whether it hits the new target and inflicts damage normally.

Thus, if an archer fires an arrow at you with an attack roll of +25, you direct it at another target, striking if the new target’s Armor Class is 25 or less. You can still redirect attacks back at the original attacker if you wish.
