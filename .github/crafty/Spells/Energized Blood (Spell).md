Your blood becomes suffused with the same energy type that powers your breath weapon. (You must have a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to cast this spell.) Whenever you take damage from a natural or manufactured weapon, a spurt of blood erupts in a 5-foot-radius burst from the wound, dealing energy damage to creatures in its area. The energy-charged blood deals a number of points of damage equal to your caster level.

When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, *energized blood* is an acid spell when you cast it to suffuse your blood with acid.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *burning blood* to* energized blood* to avoid duplication.
