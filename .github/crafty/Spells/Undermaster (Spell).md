*You invoke the mighty powers of the earth and it rises about you, limning you from below with brilliant green radiance. The power surges within your hands as you are invested with its might, and you bend that might to your own will.*

You take up the mantle of the earth, gaining power over it as long as you stand upon or beneath its surface. While energized with the awesome power of this spell, you can choose a spell from those listed below once per round and use it as a spell-like ability. Using a spell in this way requires a standard action, even if the spell would normally have a longer casting time (such as *[[Move Earth (Spell)|move earth]]*).

The spells granted by *undermaster* are *[[Earth Lock (Spell)|earth lock]]*, *[[Earthquake (Spell)|earthquake]], [[Excavate (Spell)|excavate]]*, *[[Flesh to Stone (Spell)|flesh to stone]]*, *[[Meld Into Stone (Spell)|meld into stone]]*, *[[Move Earth (Spell)|move earth]], [[Reverse Gravity (Spell)|reverse gravity]]*, *[[Soften Earth and Stone (Spell)|soften earth and stone]]*, *[[Statue (Spell)|statue]]*, *[[Stone Shape (Spell)|stone shape]]*, *[[Stone Tell (Spell)|stone tell]]*, *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]]*, *[[Transmute Mud to Rock (Spell)|transmute mud to rock]]*, *[[Transmute Rock to Mud (Spell)|transmute rock to mud]]*, *[[Tunnel Swallow (Spell)|tunnel swallow]], [[Wall of Stone (Spell)|wall of stone]]*, and *xorn movement*.
