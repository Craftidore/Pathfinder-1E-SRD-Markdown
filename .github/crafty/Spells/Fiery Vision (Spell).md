# Fiery Vision (Spell)
## Overview
[[Evocation Spells|Evocation]] \[[[Fire Spells|fire]]]

**Level:** [[6th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 6]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 12th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 12]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, DF

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect:** Two rays of fire per round

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Shining South (WotC), pg. 46

Immediately on completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you can emit two fiery rays from your eyes, targeting one or two opponents within range as a free action during your turn each round. A successful ranged touch attack is required to strike with each beam, and one that hits deals 4d6 points of fire damage.

You need not use your eye rays while the spell is in effect; other actions, such as spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you can use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to use the eye rays.
