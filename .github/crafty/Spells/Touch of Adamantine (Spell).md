This spell grants one weapon the properties of an adamantine weapon. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls (as though it was a masterwork weapon) and bypasses hardness when striking objects or sundering weapons, ignoring hardness less than 20. The affected weapon also has one-third more hit points than normal for the duration of the spell. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. A monk’s unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.

If the weapon is made of another special material (cold iron or silver, for example), it loses the benefits of its original special material for the spell’s duration.

*Touch of adamantine* cannot be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
