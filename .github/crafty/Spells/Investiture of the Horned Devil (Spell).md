*With a flash of red light, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from a horned devil to fuel the spell.*

This spell infuses a creature with the terrible essence of a horned devil. Whenever the subject successfully strikes another living creature with the first melee attack that it makes in a round, the struck creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's DC or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.

In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the horned devil).*

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
