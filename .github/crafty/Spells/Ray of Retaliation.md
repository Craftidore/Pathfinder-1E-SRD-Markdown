*You raise your hand to block an incoming ray attack and absorb the energy into your dragonmark. An instant later, a ray of force, colored like your dragonmark, springs from your outstretched hand and races back toward your attacker.*

When you are hit with a ray attack, you can cast this spell to negate the ray’s effect and turn its energy back against its caster. You must be aware of the ray attack and not flatfooted. Casting this spell is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack. If the ray hits and penetrates the target’s spell resistance (if any), you deal an amount of force damage determined by the strength of your dragonmark.


| **Dragonmark** | **Force Damage** |
|---|---|
| Least | 1d6 per 2 caster levels (max. 5d6) |
| Lesser | 1d8 per 2 caster levels (max. 5d8) |
| Greater or Siberys | 1d6 per caster level (max. 10d6) |

Your ray is a force effect with the same range as the original ray. You cannot use the ray to attack any target other than the caster of the original ray.

*Dragonmark:* Any true or aberrant dragonmark.
