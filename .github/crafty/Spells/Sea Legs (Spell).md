You grant a creature the ability to maneuver easily while aboard ship, even during inclement weather. Any creature affected by a *sea legs* spell automatically succeeds on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Balance) checks (DC 20 or lower) made due to sloped surfaces and slightly slippery conditions. Furthermore, the creature can move at its normal speed while balancing on a shipâ€™s deck, rather than half speed.

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Sea legs* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
