This spell functions like the spell glyph version of *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]*, except you can store a hex you know (but not a major hex or a grand hex) instead of a spell. If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The triggered hex uses this spellâ€™s caster level and DC.

*[[Read Magic (Spell)|Read magic]]* allows its caster to identify a *hex glyph* with a successful DC 13 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and indicates that it stores a hex, but does not indicate the effect of that hex.
