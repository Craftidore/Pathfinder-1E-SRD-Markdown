*Your foe will reach you in seconds. You cast this spell, and yellow strips of magical energy loop about its wings, hampering its flight and dragging it to ground.*

You hinder the subject creatureâ€™s ability to fly (whether through natural or magical means) for the duration of the spell. If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet. An airborne creature subjected to this spell falls to the ground as if under the effect of a *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* spell. Even if a new effect would grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the *earthbind* spell.

*Earthbind* has no effect on other forms of movement, or even on effects that might grant airborne movement without granting a fly speed (such as jumping or *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]* or *[[Air Walk (Spell)|air walk]]* spells).
