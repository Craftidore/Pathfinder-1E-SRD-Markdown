You become shrouded in a dense cloud of yellow mold spores. You can see through the cloud with ease and are not affected by it in any way, but it provides you one-half concealment (20% miss chance). The cloak of swirling yellow spores travels with you and does not leave a trail as you move. Anyone who passes through your square, or anyone whom you successfully overrun, bull rush, grapple, or who otherwise shares your area must make a Fortitude saving throw or suffer 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage; another Fortitude saving throw is required 1 minute later to avoid taking 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage.

As long as the spore cloak is active, you are immune to fungal infestations such as the spores of brown or yellow mold and the rotting touch of violet fungi.

If you fail a saving throw against a fire spell or effect, the spores are instantly burnt away and the spell ends. If you are in direct sunlight, the spell continues but the spores become inert until you reach shelter. Inert spores continue to provide one-half concealment but cannot infest others and do not provide protection from fungal attacks.
