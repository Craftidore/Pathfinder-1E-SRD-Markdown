*A foul sludge seeps out of the ground, coating* the *area before you.*

You cover the ground in an acidic slime, roughly the consistency of thick mud. The sludge is sticky; entering any square affected by *caustic mire* costs 2 squares of movement. In addition, each square entered deals 1d6 points of acid damage to the creature moving. A creature who stands in the area without moving from its space takes 1d6 points of damage per round at the end of its turn.

The fumes rising out *of caustic mire* are flammable. Any effect that deals fire damage within an area of *caustic mire* deals an extra 1 point of damage per die (minimum +1 damage).
