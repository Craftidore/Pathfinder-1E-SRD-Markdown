A sphere of crackling energy shoots out of your outstretched hand to strike a single creature or object. The ball of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the creature struck, and then encases the creature or object struck in a sphere of lightning and powerful wind. A successful Reflex save halves the damage done and allows the target to escape being caught; in this case the spell's duration ends immediately.

If the target fails its Reflex save, it becomes trapped in the resulting sphere. The creature floats in the center of the sphere, held in place by the powerful wind. Projectiles cannot pass into or out of the sphere. A creature caught in the sphere must make a successful DC 20 Concentration check to cast a spell. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the trapped creature immediately takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (a successful Reflex save halves this damage).

As a standard action, you can move the sphere by mental will to the limit of the spell's range. The sphere moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect). You can attempt to bull rush or overrun a creature with the sphere. It has an effective Strength score of 20 and Large size, for determining the modifiers to the attempt. Any creature successfully bull rushed or overrun with the sphere takes 3d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex save half). If the sphere is empty, a creature that fails this Reflex save also becomes trapped in the *storm prison*. A creature inside a *storm prison* as it is moved suffers no ill effects from any regions or hazardous areas you move the prison into, since the powerful winds and electricity around the creature shield it. Once the spell ends, though, this protection ends as well. If the creature was in the air at the time, it falls for the appropriate amount of falling damage.

You cannot cause a *storm prison* to move through water or other liquids.
