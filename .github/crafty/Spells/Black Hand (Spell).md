You gather the powers of darkness into your fist and strike with a paralyzing and shadowy chill. Black and purple flames encase your hand.

With a successful touch attack, this spell deals 1d3 Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage to an enemy. These points are added to your own attributes as an enhancement bonus. If the victim makes a Fortitude save, it suffers (and the caster gains) just 1 point of Constitution damage. If this spell is discharged into a creature or object without Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, the damage is not applied to the applicable attribute or attributes.

**Mythic:** When you gain a bonus to attributes with this spell, you gain that bonus an increased number of rounds equal to your mythic tier.
