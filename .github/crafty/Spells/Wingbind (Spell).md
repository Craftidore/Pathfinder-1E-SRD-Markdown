*The flying creature lets out a surprised howl and then plummets to the ground, its wings flat against its body and struggling against a green glowing net.*

A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net. This spell functions like *[[Earthbind (Spell)|earthbind]]* , except that an ensnared creature immediately falls to the ground, taking falling damage.

An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can escape with a successful [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check against a DC equal to the save DC of the spell. Like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, this web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. Also like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, the web is immediately destroyed by *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]*, a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]*, or *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mageâ€™s disjunction]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* *[[Freedom of Movement|Freedom of movement]]* negates this spell automatically.
