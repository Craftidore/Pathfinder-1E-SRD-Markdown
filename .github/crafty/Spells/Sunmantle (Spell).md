This spell cloaks the target in a wavering cloak of light that illuminates an area around the target (and dispels darkness) as a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell. However, its ability to generate bright light is not the spell’s primary function.

The *sunmantle* grants the target damage reduction 5/–. Furthermore, if the target is struck by a melee attack that deals hit point damage, a tendril of light lashes out at the attacker, striking unerringly and dealing 5 points of damage.

Because of the brilliance of the *sunmantle*, creatures sensitive to bright light (such as dark elves) take the usual attack penalties when in the light radius of the *sunmantle*.

*Sacrifice:* 1d4 points of Strength damage.
