The caster touches both the corpse to be occupied and the target creature while chanting; as the caster does so the corpse's brain dissolves, running out the nose, ears, and eyes in the form of a clear serum-like liquid. At the same time, the target creature's body flows into the victim's now-empty skull, vanishing in one round.

The target creature now possesses and controls the victim's body, much like a use of the *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* spell, except that the target's body is not left behind. Instead it is nestled in the host body's skull. The target controls the victim's body and has use of its physical ability scores (Str, Dex, and Con) and hit points, but has no access to its mental ability scores, skills, feats, or other attributes. The target gains a +10 bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks to impersonate the victim.

The target can leave the host's body at any time. When it does so, its true form bursts out of the host body's skull, leaving it a shattered ruin, and reassumes its true shape and size anywhere within 5 ft. of the now dead body.

Evil spellcasters sometimes use this spell to help their followers infiltrate the followers and guards of an intended victim.

Divinations such as *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* reveal the inner creature as a faint, translucent overlay over the host body. Magicks which prevent divinations are frequently used in conjunction with this spell.
