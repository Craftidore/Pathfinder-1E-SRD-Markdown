*You point at the target of this spell. The colors of your clothing, skin, and hair shine for a brief moment before they surge away from you, forming a multicolored ray that strikes your target. You disappear as the colors of your body and items leap from you into the beam. The target clutches his eyes and staggers.*

You strip the color from your body and gear, turn it into a lance of energy, and hurl it at a target. When you cast this spell, you target a creature with the colors stripped from your form. The target must make a Will save or be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round.

You also gain the benefit of *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]**,* for the duration of this spell, even if the target creature succeeds on its save or if its spell resistance protects it.
