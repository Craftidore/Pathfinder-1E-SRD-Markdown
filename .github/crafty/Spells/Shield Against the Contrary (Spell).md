You emit an invisible force that repels chaotic-aligned outsiders. This mobile field can be an area equal to a maximum of 10 ft. + 5 ft./level. Once set, the area’s diameter cannot be adjusted. Any chaotic-aligned outsider that is within the field or attempts to enter the field must make a Will save. Those that fail cannot move toward to you. Those that make their save are unaffected for that round, but must roll a new save each round that they are within the spell’s area of effect. This spell does not effect any other actions that the chaotic-aligned creature may perform (attacking you with ranged spells or weapons, fighting others around them, etc.) for the duration of the spell.
