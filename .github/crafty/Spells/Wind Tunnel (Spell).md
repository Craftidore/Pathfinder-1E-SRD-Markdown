*You evoke the powers of the sky, and the wind picks up around you. It blows from your back, now, and wraps itself around your allies’ missiles, sending them to their targets more surely.*

You call on the wind to assist your allies’ accuracy. A *wind tunnel* improves the accuracy of your allies’ ranged weapons, granting each subject a +5 competence bonus on ranged attacks. Further, it doubles the range increment of these weapons.
