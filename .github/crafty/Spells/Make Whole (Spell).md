This spell functions as *[[Mending (Spell)|mending]]*, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6).

*Make whole* can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When *make whole* is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.

**GM Note**

*Errata:* This spell affects a ship as if it were a construct. (**Source:** *Skull and Shackles Player's Guide* 17)

*Errata:* Magic (such as *make whole*) can repair a sinking ship if the ship’s hit points are raised above 0, at which point the ship loses the sinking condition. Generally, nonmagical repairs take too long to save a ship from sinking once it begins to go down. 

The fastest and easiest way to repair a ship is with spells. *[[Mending (Spell)|Mending]]* is not powerful enough to meaningfully affect an object as large as a ship, but *make whole* affects a ship as if it were a construct, repairing 1d6 points of damage per level. In addition, more mundane methods can also be used to repair ships. Because of their specialized construction, ships (as well as oars and sails) usually require the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) skill to repair. Depending on the nature of the damage, skills such as [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (carpentry) or [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (sails), or even various [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skills, can be used to repair ships with the GM’s approval. In general, a day’s worth of work by a single person using the appropriate skill to repair a ship requires 10 gp of raw materials and a DC 10 skill check, and repairs 10 points of damage on a success, or 5 hit points on a failure. *[[Fabricate (Spell)|Fabricate]]* can also be used to create the raw material needed for repairs. New oars can be purchased for 2 gp each (*Core Rulebook* 159).
