You draw forth the material essence of joy from a creature experiencing great bliss. This physical manifestation of joy, called ambrosia, can be used in the creation of good magic items, as a special spell component, or as a druglike substance (with no addictive qualities). The Celestial Hebdomad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens, subsist entirely on ambrosia.

The caster draws ambrosia from the target and contains it within a tiny receptacle, such as a vial. Ambrosia can only be drawn from a blissful creature; how the creature achieves this state of bliss can vary from one individual to the next. For example, *distilled joy* can be cast on a deliriously lovestruck character, a dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist crafting his lifeâ€™s masterpiece, or a character experiencing a moment of rapture or undiluted sexual pleasure.

Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in magic item creation. Each dose provides the equivalent of 2 experience points needed to create the item. A dose of ambrosia can also be used as an optional spell component (see Chapter 3, Book of Exalted Deeds).

A living creature that drinks a dose of ambrosia experiences a soothing sensation that wipes away minor aches and pains, takes the edge off grief and sadness, and cures 1 point of damage. These positive sensations and emotions persist for 1d4+1 hours.
