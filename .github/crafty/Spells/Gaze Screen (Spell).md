*You cup your hands as if to catch the light and then bend them outward, causing the air in front of the recipient’s eyes to take on a shimmery, refl ective quality.*

This spell creates a mirror-like area around the recipient’s eyes. This effect moves with the recipient and does not affect his vision. If the recipient is subjected to a gaze attack while the spell lasts, there is a 50% chance that he does not need to attempt a saving throw against the attack ( just as if the recipient had averted his eyes). The foe with the gaze attack does not have concealment from the recipient (see Gaze Attacks). The recipient gets no additional protection from averting his eyes while the spell lasts, though he can shut his eyes and entirely avoid the gaze.
