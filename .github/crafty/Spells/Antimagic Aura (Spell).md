An invisible barrier surrounds a single creature and its equipment. The target creature is impervious to most magical effects including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, thus preventing the target from casting spells or using spell-like abilities or magic items for the duration.

An *antimagic aura* suppresses any spell or magical effect used on or by, or cast onto, the target, but does not dispel it. A *charmed* creature, for example, is not *charmed* while affected by the aura, but the spell resumes functioning when *antimagic aura* ends. Time spent within an *antimagic aura* counts against the suppressed spellâ€™s duration.
