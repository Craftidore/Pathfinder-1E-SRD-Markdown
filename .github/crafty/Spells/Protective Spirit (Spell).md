A *protective spirit* is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the *protective spirit* makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A *protective spirit* can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.

A *protective spirit* occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]*, or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]* affects it. A *protective spirit*â€™s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
