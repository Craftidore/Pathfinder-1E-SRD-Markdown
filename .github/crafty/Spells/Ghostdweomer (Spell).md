*Ghostdwoemer* is a plague to the wizards of Burok Tom. In the dwarves' many battles with the dark elves of Dier Drendal, the dark elves rely on their magic to give their own warriors equal footing with the heavily armored dwarven guardians. The dwarven wizards' attempts to dispel the magic augmenting the dark elven warriors is often foiled by the dark elves' prolific use of *ghostdweomer.*

Intended to protect enchantments from being dispelled, this spell surrounds another spell or magical object with an illusory dweomer that foils *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]], [[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]], [[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]], [[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]* and similar attempts to strip or unravel enchantments from objects or creatures.

You must invoke the *ghostdweomer* upon the desired enchantment or object after it has been cast or created. Thereafter, any *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* (or similar spell) cast upon the enchantment protected by the *ghostdweomer* must first attempt to dispel the *ghostdweomer.* If the dispel attempt is successful, then *ghostdweomer* vanishes, but the original enchantment remains intact. After the *ghostdweomer* is removed, the object or enchantment can be dispelled normally. When used in this fashion, the *ghostdweomer* feeds upon and lasts for as long as the magics of the original enchantment it overlays. A *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or similar spell will reveal only the original enchantment. 

This spell may also be used to produce a magical aura around a nonmagical item, as if it was affected by *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]].* If used in this way, the spell lasts for up to 1 day/level.

Only one *ghostdweomermay* exist upon an object or enchantment at one time. Extremely powerful abjuration magics, such as *disjunction,* will function against both *theghostdweomer* and the original enchantment.

*Focus:* A small square of silk with *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]* cast upon it, which must be passed over the object that receives the aura.
