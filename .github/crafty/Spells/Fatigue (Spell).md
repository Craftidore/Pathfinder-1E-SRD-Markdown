The subject becomes [[Fatigued|fatigued]], suffering an effective penalty of –2 to Strength and Dexterity. A [[Fatigued|fatigued]] character cannot run or charge and becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]] by doing something that would normally cause fatigue. If the subject is already [[Fatigued|fatigued]] when you cast the spell, it becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]], moving at half normal speed and suffering an effective penalty of –6 to Strength and Dexterity.

The subject can negate the effects of the spell through normal rest. The creature must rest for 8 hours to remove the fatigue.

**GM Note**
