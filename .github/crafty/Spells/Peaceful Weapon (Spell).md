You surround an item with a field of magical energy that makes it impossible for the weapon to inflict damage in any direct way. No matter who uses the weapon, or how it is used, it cannot hurt anyone or anything. Even dropping it from a great height or causing someone to fall upon it inflicts no damage. The weapon cannot hurt objects; thus a blade cannot sever a rope or fell a tree. It canâ€™t even dig into the ground or be used to push an object.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Since the weapon does no damage, any additions that cause damage are also negated (for example: feats such as [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], class abilities such as a rogue's sneak attack, even things like additional damage due to great strength).
