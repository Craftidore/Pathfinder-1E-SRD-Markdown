# Fins to Feet
## Overview

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Willing creature touched

**Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)

**SourceC** Advanced Race Guide, pg. 195

You transform the targetâ€™s fins, flippers, or tail into legs and feet, allowing it to walk on land. The target loses its swim speed but gains a base speed appropriate for a humanoid of its size (speed 30 if a Medium or larger creature, speed 20 if Small). If the creature is immersed in water for 1 round, the transformation reverts, allowing it to swim normally. One round after leaving the water, the transformation occurs again, allowing it to walk.

This spell only works on merfolk, tritons, seals, fish, and other creatures whose bodies or limbs are used mainly for swimming and are not suitable for walking. It does not give the target the ability to breathe air.
