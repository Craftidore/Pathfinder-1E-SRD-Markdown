This spell can be cast upon a door, chest, or portal. This magically seals the target and attaches a mystical alarm to this location. The focus of the spell is a platinum key; this key is mystically bound to the target of the spell and cannot be used again. The bearer of the key may freely pass the *arcane seal* without affecting it. Otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. In addition, if the door is opened in any manner, the bearer of the key receives a mental alert: a single word, set when the spell is cast.

A *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell suppresses the *seal* for 10 minutes. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|Dispel magic]]* permanently destroys the *seal* if the dispel check is successful. However, the *seal* sends its mental alert even if its magic is dispelled. A rogue or artificer can sense the presence of a *arcane seal* by making a successful [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check (DC 28). A rogue or artificer can temporarily disable the alarm using an arcane key.
