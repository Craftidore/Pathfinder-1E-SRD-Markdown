This spell attempts to prevent a targeted creature from voluntarily changing forms for the duration of its effect. If the target creature fails their saving throw, transmutation effects are not possible. *Formlock* does not return the target creature to its true form.

If the creature is the target of a transmutation spell while affected by *formlock*, the other caster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC (11 + your caster level). Success means that the transmutation effect succeeds and *formlock* ends.
