*You channel negative energy into the dark mote in your hand, causing it to leap and dart about in your grasp. When you have poured enough energy into the spell, you release the mote to drain the life of your enemy.*

This spell uses negative energy to drain the vitality from a single foe. The spell's strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.

If you cast *channeled lifetheft* as a swift action, it renders a single target [[Fatigued|fatigued]], and you gain 5 temporary hit points.
