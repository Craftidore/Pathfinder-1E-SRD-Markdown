You gain an unnatural premonition for impending attacks and can respond to them a bit quicker than usual.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your armor class (this bonus doesn't apply if you are caught flatfooted). You foresee your opponent's defenses and dodges. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks and increase the DC of spells that require a Reflex save by 1.

Casting this spell does not run the risk of a temporal backlash as many chronomancy spells do, as it involves merely observing the flow of time to predict future events.
