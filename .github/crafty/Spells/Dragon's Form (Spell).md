You change yourself into a young adult red dragon. Your type changes to dragon. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a young adult red dragon but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the young adult red dragon’s bite, claw, tail, wing and crush damage plus its Armor Class, speed, flying ability, breath weapon, frightful presence, spell-like abilities, damage reduction, immunity to fire, sleep, and paralysis, spell resistance, improved grab, blindsense, keen senses, darkvision, lowlight vision, and vulnerability to cold. You do not gain its spellcasting ability. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the dragon’s feats and racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You can speak, cast spells, and use disciplines while in dragon form.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *dragon’s form*, but it is nonfunctional.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8 to avoid redundancy with *[[Dragonshape (Spell)|dragonshape]]*.
