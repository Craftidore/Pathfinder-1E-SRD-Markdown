*With the casting of your spell, you feel a presence about you, warding off the spells of other casters.*

This spell creates an invisible aura around the recipient that moves with that individual. It prevents all spells and spell-like abilities of 6th level or lower from affecting the recipient. The protected individual can cast spells normally, even on himself. Magic items and spells that summon items to the caster such as *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]* and *[[Instant Summons (Spell)|instant summons]]* likewise function normally.

A *mystic shield* also negates the enhancement bonuses and special properties of magic weapons used against the target.
