You transform yourself into a form better suited to the watery environment, growing shimmering scales and gaining webbed hands and feet. For the duration of the spell, your swim speed increases by 10 feet.

If you had no swim speed, you gain a swim speed of 15 feet, gaining a +8 racial bonus on any [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. You can always choose to take 10 on a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check, even if distracted or endangered. You can use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line.

Finally, you gain a natural armor bonus +1/three caster levels, maximum of +5. However, because of your strange appearance, you gain a penalty to Charisma-based checks equal to the natural armor bonus when dealing with nonaquatic creatures.
