This spell transforms a single weapon or projectile you are holding into a silvered weapon. The weapon may be magical, masterwork, or nonmagical, but it must be in hand when the spell is cast. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see *[[Silvered Claws (Spell)|silvered claws]]*).

The spell cannot be cast on more than one weapon or on multiple projectiles. If the weapon targeted by the spell is made of another special material (cold iron or [[Adamantine|adamantine]], for example), it loses the benefits of its original special material for the spell’s duration.

*Silvered weapon* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
