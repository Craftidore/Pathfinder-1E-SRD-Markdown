This spell modifies the functioning of all conjuration (teleportation) spells and spell-like abilities, including *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*, *[[Teleport, Greater (Spell)|greater teleport]]*, *[[Refuge (Spell)|refuge]]*, *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*, *teleportation circle*, and *[[Word of Recall (Spell)|word of recall]]*, into, out of, and within its area.

If cast in an area adjoining or overlapping another *teleport cage*, the effects of both spells merge to create a single *teleport cage*. Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faerûn, is believed to have been enclosed within the largest *teleport cage* in existence in the Realms by means of this effect.

When cast within a *teleport cage*, such translocation spells simply transport all affected creatures and objects to another random location within the *teleport cage*. For example, if a wizard casts *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* within the confines of Undermountain, the encompassing *teleport cage* would cause him to appear at another random location within the great dungeon.

When a caster outside the area encompassed by a *teleport cage* attempts to teleport into it, this spell redirects their destination to another random location reachable by the spell. For example, if a 9th-level wizard in Waterdeep attempted to *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* into the depths of Undermountain, the *teleport cage* would cause him to appear at another random location within 900 miles of the place where he cast the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's teleport cage* to *teleport cage* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Halaster’s teleport cage* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.
