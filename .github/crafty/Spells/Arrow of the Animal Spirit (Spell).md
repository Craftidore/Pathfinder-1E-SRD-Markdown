You bind powerful animal spirits to an arrow, which you must loose during your next turn for the spell to take effect. If the arrow strikes, ghostly wolves, bears, aurochs, or wildcats appear around its shaft and attack the target. The arrowâ€™s successful hit deals 6d6 hp damage; in addition, you may make a combat maneuver check for the ghostly animals and add a +10 competency bonus to your CMB. This maneuver may be a [[Bull Rush|bull rush]], [[Grapple|grapple]] (1 round), [[Trip|trip]], or [[Feint|feint]].

Regardless of whether you make a successful combat maneuver check, the terrible, ghostly spirits cause a struck target to be [[Frightened|frightened]] for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.

**Mythic:** You can target a number of arrows or bolts equal to your mythic tier. You must loose these arrows or bolts in the next minute for the ghostly animals to attack.

**Augmented (4th):** Augmented (4th): You can expend two uses of mythic power to increase the competence bonus to CMB for a [[Bull Rush|bull rush]], [[Grapple|grapple]], or [[Feint|feint]] you make with these arrows by a number equal to your mythic tier.
