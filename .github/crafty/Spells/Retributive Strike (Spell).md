This spell surrounds you with a flickering silver aura that seems to reach out to those nearby. While in effect, any adjacent opponent who successfully strikes you with a melee weapon provokes an attack of opportunity from you. This spell does not grant you the ability to make additional attacks of opportunity in 1 round. Opponents who take other actions that provoke attacks of opportunity draw them normally from those who threaten them.

*Arcane Material Component:* A small band formed from the gum of a rubber tree.

**GM Note**
