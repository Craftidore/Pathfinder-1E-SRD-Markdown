*A golden ray of light erupts from the ground beneath you, bathing you in a column of healing illumination that dances with yellow flecks.*

This spell converts arcane spell energy into pure draconic life energy, guiding it to repair damage to your body. You immediately heal 5d6 points of damage. As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one sorcerer spell slot of up to 9th level; doing this increases the healing by 1d6 points per level of the sacrificed slot. For example, a 10th-level sorcerer who spent two 5th-level spell slots (one to cast the spell and another to enhance it) would heal 10d6 points of damage.

This spell does not channel positive energy as divine healing spells do, so it functions the same for undead spellcasters as it does for living casters.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, this spell heals an extra 1 point of damage per die rolled.
