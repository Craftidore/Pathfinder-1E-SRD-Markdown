You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the *fabricate* spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.

You must make an appropriate [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be affected by the spell.
