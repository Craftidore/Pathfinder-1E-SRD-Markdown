You fall asleep, creating a dream duplicate of yourself in an adjacent area in the waking  world. It looks, sounds, smells, and even feels like you. You can see through its eyes, hear through its ears, manipulate objects, and cast any spell you could normally cast. In fact, you project your spirit into it, giving it seeming reality, directing it from the seat of your sleeping consciousness in your original body. Your *dream image* has all your currently memorized spells, hit points, and abilities.

The *dream image* is a copy of you, but initially appears unclothed and without equipment. Your dream image can borrow the equipment on your sleeping body if desired. The *dream image* cannot successfully range farther than 400 feet + 40 feet/level from your sleeping body, nor travel to another plane. If either of these situations occur, the spell's duration ends, and you awaken. If your *dream image* is killed, you also immediately awaken.

All spells or uses of daily special abilities used by your *dream image* are also debited from you; however, you do not suffer any hit point damage or ability damage suffered by your *dream image*. If your *dream image* was using your equipment, you must physically retrieve it from the point where the *dream image* faded.
