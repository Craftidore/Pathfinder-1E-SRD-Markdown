You cause the creature touched to slowly freeze into a block of ice. You must succeed at a melee touch attack, at which point the target creature is allowed a saving throw to resist the magic. If the creature fails, you deal 6d6 points of subdual damage to the target, and the target suffers a =4 penalty on all attacks, saves and checks for the duration of the spell. Each round, the target takes an additional 6d6 points of subdual damage on your action. The *deep freeze* can be dispelled normally during this time.

If the target is rendered unconscious while under the spell's effect, it freezes solid (along with all worn, carried, or held items), becoming an inert statue of living ice. The creature is not dead, but exists in a state of suspended animation from which it can only be revived through *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]**,* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**.* If not revived, the creature remains in the *deep freeze* for a period of 1 year per caster level.

*Material Components:* A silver charm shaped like a snowflake.
