This spell allows the caster to scry people or places in another time. This operates through the caster’s mind, and any innate abilities or permanent spell effects placed upon the caster apply. The spell is cast as *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]*, except as noted above. All of the following spells can be cast reliably through the sensor: *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]*, *[[Darkvision (Spell)|darkvision]]*, *[[Detect Chaos (Spell)|detect chaos]]*, *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]*, *[[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]]*, *[[Detect Law (Spell)|detect law]]*, *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*, *[[Message (Spell)|message]]*, *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]*, *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]*, and *[[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]]*.

The caster must make a caster level check (DC 5) to scry any time within the past week, a DC 15 check for within the past month, a DC 20 check for within the past year, a DC 30 check within the past decade, a DC 40 check for within the past century and a DC 50 check for within the past 1,000 years.

Any area being scried upon in the past that is warded to prevent divination works just as it would if the caster were attempting to pierce the protection normally.

*Arcane Material Component:* The eye of a far-seeing creature (eagles or hawks do nicely) is held in the left hand. Finally, hundreds of strands must be collected from the Temporal Prime. These strands are then enchanted and woven into a veil worn over the face. All items are destroyed except the veil (v. 10,000 gp), which may be reused.
