*With a hand dripping with pale violet slime, you touch your foe, causing him to collapse into a pile of shifting tissue.*

Your touch causes a creature to undergo a terrifying transformation. A target that fails its save collapses into a spongy mass of flesh and sinew and takes 1 point of Wisdom drain. 

Each round, as a free action, the target can attempt a new Fortitude save to regain its form. If the save fails, the target remains transformed and takes another 1 point of Wisdom drain.

A target afflicted with *touch of chaos* cannot use possessions or cast spells. It takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity, its land speed drops to 10 feet, and it loses all other modes of movement. The target can lash out with tentacles that burst from its flesh, but it attacks the closest creature, whether friend or foe. The attack is made at a –4 penalty and has a 50% miss chance. If a tentacle hits the creature, it deals damage based on the afflicted target’s size (Small, 1d3 points; Medium, 1d4 points; and Large, 1d6 points).
