*You invoke the power of good and indicate each of your party members in turn. A crystal blue aura springs up around each of them, fortifying them against the assaults of undead.*

You grant one or more creatures special abilities that allow them to effectively destroy undead. All subjects receive a *[[Death Ward (Spell)|death ward]]* effect. The subjects also have immunity to the special attacks and abilities of undead that deal ability damage, ability drain, fear effects, disease, paralysis, or poison. Targets can make melee and ranged attacks against ethereal or incorporeal undead as if they were using *[[Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* weapons. They also gain a +4 sacred bonus to AC against attacks by undead.
