*The crashing of waves echoes in your ears.*

This spell converts part of your body into elemental water, which makes you better able to navigate aquatic environments and slip through confined spaces. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed, which grants you certain benefits (including a +8 racial bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. You also gain the ability to breathe water (as if under the effect of a *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]* spell). Finally, you gain a +5 enhancement bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks.

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|freedom of movement]]* effect (as the spell) on yourself as a swift action. This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends.

If *heart of water* is active on you at the same time as *[[Heart of Air (Spell)|heart of air]]**,* *[[Heart of Earth (Spell)|heart of earth]]**,* or *[[Heart of Fire (Spell)|heart of fire]]**,* you gain light fortification.

If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Each *heart* spell in effect provides 25% fortification, if all of them are in effect simulataneously, the caster has immunity (100% fortification) to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
