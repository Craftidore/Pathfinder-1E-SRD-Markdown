*You shout out a plea, calling upon your deity to quell the power of another deity’s follower.*

This spell can be cast at a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be cast on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. A creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell, and spell resistance, if any, applies if the spell is cast on a creature.

*Divine interdiction* interferes with a cleric’s connection to her divine source of power, resulting in a temporary loss of the ability to turn or rebuke creatures and loss of granted domain powers. Paladins, blackguards, and other classes capable of rebuking and turning also suffer a temporary loss of this ability. This affects the subject’s ability to channel energy through the use of a turn or rebuke attempt, and so also interferes with the use of many divine feats.
