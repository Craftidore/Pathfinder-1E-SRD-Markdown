You seal an agreement between two or more willing creatures with an oath, using ritual blessings and toasts during which both oath and consequences are clearly set out. If any of the swearers break this solemn vow, they are struck by a curse. The caster may choose either an effect appropriate for [[Bestow Curse (Spell)|bestow curse]], a fate affliction, or another penalty at the GM’s discretion.

*Binding oath* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**,* *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]**,* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]**.* *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|Remove curse]]* functions only if its caster level is equal to or higher than the *binding oath*’s level. When the oath is broken or the effect removed from a participant, all targets are immediately aware that this has occurred (but know no other details). Depending on the nature of the oath sworn, this may invalidate the oath for the other targets—if so, the spells end for all other targets, but curses already bestowed remain.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 to Level.
