You make the area around your ship invisible (cf *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* spell). Creatures more than 30 feet from your ship cannot sense any activity going on inside the areaâ€”they cannot smell cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those onboard your ship can see out normally. Once a creature comes within 30 feet of your ship, it can see everything in and around the ship normally. Unlike *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, a cloaked ship is not given away by the appearance of apparently displaced water, fog, or mist since the power of the illusion makes the area occupied by the ship appear as its surroundings. The *cloak ship* spell does not prevent detection by magical means such as *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]**,* *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*. 

An individual aboard a ship cloaked by this illusion may attack freely, but doing so removes the invisibility effect of this spell with regard to him (and only him). The round in which he attacks he treats his target as if it were [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].
