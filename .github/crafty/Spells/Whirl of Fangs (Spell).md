     or a ringed wall of whirling jaws with a radius up to 5 ft./2 levels; either form 20 ft. high

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Serpent Kingdoms (WotC), pg. 158

You create an immobile curtain of snapping, serpent-fanged jaws shaped of pure force. You can choose to orient this barrier at any angle from vertical to horizontal at the time of casting. The force jaws race to bite at any creature other than you that comes into contact with them. Any creature passing through the curtain takes 12d4 points of damage, with a Reflex save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the curtain. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice, where feasible) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. A successful Reflex save means the creature has reached either side of the wall without taking any damage.

A creature inside a *whirl of fangs* takes 2d4 points of damage (Reflex save for half) on its turn each round that it remains in contact with the effect. You can move through or remain within your own *whirl of fangs* without taking damage. Accordingly, many Yuan-ti spellcasters “wear” this spell as a sort of immobile cloak when fighting formidable foes.
