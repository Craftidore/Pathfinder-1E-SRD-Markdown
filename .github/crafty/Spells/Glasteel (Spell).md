*Glasteel* is a magical substance created from normal, nonmagical crystal and glass. *Glasteel* is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel, but retains the transparency of the original material. Spells that affect metal or glass (such as *[[Shatter (Spell)|shatter]]* and *[[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]]*) do not function on *glasteel*. Using this spell with *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]* or a glass-related [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check, the caster can fashion glass or crystal items that function as steel items. Thus, glass plate armor and glass swords can be created that are as durable as their normal, steel counterparts.

**GM Note**

*Glasteel* has a hardness of 10 and 30 hp per inch of thickness (cf. Damaging Objects, Steel).
