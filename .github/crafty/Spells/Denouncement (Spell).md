*You point your finger and pronounce judgment.*

You instill feelings of shame and guilt In a target outsider, imposing a â€”4 insight penalty on its arrack rolls, saves, and checks. Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.) Outsiders with the good subtype are immune to *denounce.*

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *denounce* to* denouncement* to avoid duplication.
