This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An *arcane mark* spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

*[[See Invisibility (Spell)|See invisibility]]**,* *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*, a *[[Gem of Seeing|gem of seeing]]*, or a *[[Robe of Eyes|robe of eyes]]* *arcane mark.* A *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell.

If an *arcane mark* is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

*Arcane mark* must be cast on an object prior to casting *[[Instant Summons (Spell)|instant summons]]* on the same object (see that spell description for details).

**Mythic Rule**

Whenever the mark is read by a creature, you receive a fleeting mental impression of the creatureâ€™s face. Just glancing at the mark is not enough to trigger this effect. Rather, the creature must make some sort of attempt to take in the meaning of the mark. Thus animals and other unintelligent creatures are not affected. This is a scrying effect and it can be used a number of times equal to your mythic tier before discharging the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Each *arcane mark* (personal rune) is unique and unduplicatable. The rules of magic, the very [[Multiverse]] itself,  prevents the duplication. Bards and sages often keep extremely detailed descriptions of these runes so as to be able to identify them.
