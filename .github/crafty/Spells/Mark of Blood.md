# Mark of Blood
## Overview
Transmutation \[curse]

**Level:** Assassin 2, Bloodrager 2, Inquisitor 2, Sorcerer 2, Witch 2, Wizard 2

**BoXM:** Cleric 4, Wizard 4

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of your blood)

**Range:** Touch

**Targets:** One weapon touched

**Duration:** 1 minute and permanent (see text)

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Adventurer's Guide, pg. 160

You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next living creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you can spend a move action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save. You must strike a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted, but once the mark of blood takes effect it is permanent until dispelled or removed via an effect like *remove curse*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level.
