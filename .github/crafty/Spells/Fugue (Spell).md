*Upon completing the spell, a discordant cacophony of haunting and alien music rises up in the area you designate. Although the strange music reaches your ears, you feel no effect from it.*

Creatures that fail their save become affected by the haunting fugue in semirandom ways. On each affected creature’s turn (as long as it remains in the affected area), you make a [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check. The check result determines how the victim’s mind and body are affected by the spell. You can select any of the effects for which your [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check equals or exceeds the required DC.


| **DC** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 15 | Victim takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage |
| 20 | Victim takes 3d6 points of sonic damage |
| 25 | Victim is knocked prone |
| 30 | Victim is [[Nauseated\|nauseated]] for 1 round |
| 35 | Victim is [[Stunned\|stunned]] for 1 round |
| 40 | Victim attacks nearest target |

All creatures that succeed on their saves against the spell are disoriented and take a –2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks as long as they remain in the affected area.

*Focus:* A miniature violin bow made of platinum worth 250 gp.
