This spell functions like *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]*, except as noted above. Additionally, all of the following spells function reliably through the sensor: *[[Detect Chaos (Spell)|detect chaos]]*, *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]*, *[[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]]*, *[[Detect Law (Spell)|detect law]]*, *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*, *[[Message (Spell)|message]]*, *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]*, and *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]*.

**GM Note**

There are a few tricks to hide from a scrying foe, if you know what you are doing. The following circumstances modify the saving throw of a target being scried. Obviously, the best way to beat scrying is a spell like *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]].*
