*With an arcane word, you create a shimmering field of golden light around your body that pulses and wavers before vanishing.*

Whenever you are the target of a ranged attack or a ranged touch attack, you can cast this spell to deflect the attack toward another target within 30 feet. Use the same attack roll. If the redirected attack hits the new target, resolve it as normal. Otherwise, the attack fails.

If you extend the casting time to 1 full round, the duration changes from instantaneous to 1 round per caster level.
