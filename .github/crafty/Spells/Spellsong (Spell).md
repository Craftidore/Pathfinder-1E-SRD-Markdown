When you cast this spell, you immediately prepare one spell of 4th level or lower in this spell’s slot. The spell must be a spell you could normally prepare in that slot (for example, you could not prepare a wizard spell or a domain spell). The spell works like any spell prepared in the normal manner, including requiring the normal components.

Like a bard spell, casting *spellsong* always requires a verbal component, and you cannot use [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]] or similar effects to cast the spell without a verbal component.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Cleric 6, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Eilistraee 6.
