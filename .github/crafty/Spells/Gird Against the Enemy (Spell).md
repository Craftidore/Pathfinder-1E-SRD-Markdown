You grant living creatures potency against the undead, or undead creatures potency against the living.

All living subjects receive a *[[Death Ward (Spell)|death ward]]* effect. The subjects also become immune to special attacks and abilities of undead that deal ability damage, ability drain, fear effects*,* disease, paralysis, or poison. The weapons and armor of living subjects gain the *[[Ghost Touch (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* ability. Cast in this way, this is a good spell.

All undead subjects gain immunity to turning. They also become immune to any attack that specifically targets undead, including but not limited to holy water, the special damage that a *[[Searing Light (Spell)|searing light]]* spell inflicts, or a weapon with the *[[Disruption (MagWpnSpcAb)|disruption]]* quality. Other attacks that specifically target other aspects of the undead creature, such as a weapon with the holy quality affecting evil creatures, function normally. Cast in this way, this is an evil spell.

*Gird against the enemy* cannot be cast in such a way as to affect both the living and the undead at the same time.
