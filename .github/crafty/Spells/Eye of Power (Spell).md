*Your invocation creates a miniature floating eye of faintly glowing blue energy. Spying your enemy from the safety of your magical sensor, you unleash your spell.*

This spell functions like *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]*, except as noted here. You can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower that has a range other than personal through the eye. Any spell so cast functions as though it had been cast from the eyeâ€™s location rather than yours. Casting any spell of higher than 3rd level through the eye not only produces no effect (though the spell is still expended), but it destroys the *eye of power* and ends the spell.

Unlike an *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]],* an *eye of power* is visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed. The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 and 77 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for saving throws.
