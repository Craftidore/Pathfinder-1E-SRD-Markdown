This spell unleashes great necromantic power, raising a host of undead creatures. *Plague of undead* turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures within the spell’s range into undead skeletons or zombies with maximum hit points for their Hit Dice. The undead remain animated until destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can’t be animated again.)

Regardless of the specific numbers or kinds of undead created with this spell, a single casting of plague of undead can’t create more HD of undead than four times your caster level.

The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely and follow your spoken commands. However, no matter how many times you use this spell or *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]*, you can only control 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level; creatures you animate with either spell count against this limit. If you exceed this number, newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings of this spell or *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* become uncontrolled. Anytime this limit causes you to release some of the undead you control through this spell or *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]*, you choose which undead are released.

The bones and bodies required for this spell follow the same restrictions as *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]*. All the material to be animated by this spell must be within range when the spell is cast.

*Material Component:* A black sapphire worth 100 gp or several black sapphires with total value of 100 gp.
