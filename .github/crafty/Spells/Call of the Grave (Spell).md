This charm makes a target creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly), and the creature moves toward you even if the terrain is threatened, difficult, or otherwise dangerous. The creatures continue to move toward you on following rounds if you maintain concentration. Affected creatures must take one move action toward you, but they may take other actions (free, swift, immediate, or standard) as normal. Creatures cannot take full-round actions while affected by this spell. If you or your allies attack an affected creature, the creature receives a Will save with a +5 circumstance bonus to break free of this spell’s effects. A creature that succeeds on this save cannot be the target of call of the grave for another 24 hours.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed creatures as automatons, but they always consider your words and actions in the most favorable light. You can attempt to give orders or instructions, but you must succeed on an opposed Charisma check. (Retries are not allowed.) Foolhardy or dangerous suggestions are followed; suicidal directions are always ignored.
