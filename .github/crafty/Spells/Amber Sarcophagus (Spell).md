You infuse an amber sphere with magical power and hurl it toward the target. If you succeed on a ranged touch attack, the amber strikes the target and envelops it in coruscating energy that hardens immediately, trapping the target within a translucent, immobile amber shell. The target is perfectly preserved and held in stasis, unharmed yet unable to take any actions. Within the amber sarcophagus, the target is protected against all attacks, including purely mental ones.

The *amber sarcophagus* has hardness 5 and 10 hp per caster level (maximum 200 hp). If it is reduced to 0 hp, it shatters and crumbles to worthless amber dust, at which point the target is released from stasis (although it is [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until its next turn). Left alone, the *amber sarcophagus* traps the target for the duration of the spell, then disappears before releasing the target from captive stasis.
