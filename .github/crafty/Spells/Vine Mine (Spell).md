*You hold the crown of ivy leaves aloft, invoking the powers of nature, and an explosion of plant growth fills the area—plants over which you have control.*

You create and direct the rapid growth of vines. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects.

- Climbing aid (treat as knotted ropes)
- Bind helpless targets ([[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] DC 25 to escape)
- Hamper movement (as heavy undergrowth)
- Camouflage (add +4 competence bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (v3.5 Hide) checks)

As a standard action, you can redirect the vines’ growth (thus changing the effect).
