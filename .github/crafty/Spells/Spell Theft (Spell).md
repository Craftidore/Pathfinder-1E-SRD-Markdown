*Winding your magical grip around the dweomers that augment your opponent, you rip them away and feel their energy rise around you.*

You attempt to steal an opponent’s beneficial spell effects for yourself. Upon casting this spell, you instantly discern all spells currently affecting the target (including their effects). For each spell so discerned, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell’s caster level. If the check succeeds, you gain the effect of the spell for the remainder of its duration, as if it had been cast on you instead of the original target, and the opponent loses that effect.

Only spells capable of being dispelled can be affected by *spell theft*. In addition, if you are not a legal target of the spell to be stolen, your dispel check automatically fails. For example, if you cast *spell theft* on a dire bear affected by *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bull’s strength]]* and *[[Animal Growth (Spell)|animal growth]]*, you could steal only the effect of the first spell unless you were also of the animal type.
