You bring into existence a floating shield of semi-transparent energy. This shield protects you as if you wielded a heavy shield, giving you a +2 shield bonus to Armor Class, although you do not have to wield it.

The shield can automatically counter any single-target spell or spell-like ability, regardless of level, that has you as a target. Area spells and spells that do not actually have a target cannot be countered. Spells that you want to affect you bypass the shield. If the shield counters a number of spells equal to your caster level, it disappears, even if the duration has not yet expired.
