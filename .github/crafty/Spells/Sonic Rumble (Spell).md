*Your final words of the spell become a deep, rumbling hum, as loud as the din of a battlefield, and they blast outward from you in a cone.*

You create a cone of powerful sound. If used to attack, the cone deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per two levels (maximum 10d6) each round a creature is within the area; a successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. Targets within the area of a *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell are immune.

*Focus:* A hollow cone of brass and gold worth 50 gp.
