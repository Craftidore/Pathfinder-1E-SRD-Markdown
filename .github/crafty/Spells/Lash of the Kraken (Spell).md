This spell transforms one of your appendages into a lashing, barb-covered tentacle like that of a kraken. This rubbery appendage gives you reach and deals damage as indicated on the following chart. As a primary attack, the tentacle adds your Strength modifier to damage. The tentacle can also be used as a secondary natural attack in conjunction with a manufactured weapon. Such secondary attacks do not interfere with your primary attack as attacking with an off-hand weapon would, but you take the usual -5 penalty for the tentacle attack when used as a secondary natural attack.

If you hit with this tentacle attack, you may attempt a grapple check against your opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you succeed at the grapple attempt, you immediately constrict the foe and deal automatic tentacle damage as if you had hit the target again. Each round you maintain a grapple you automatically deal tentacle damage to your foe. A constricted enemy is [[Grappled|grappled]] as normal and may escape by making a successful grapple check on its turn.

A creature with a natural tentacle attack may use its own tentacle damage or that granted by the spell, whichever is greater. It gains the ability to grab and constrict with all of its tentacle attacks if it could not already.
