*Sparks flit among your fingers as you call electricity from the surrounding air.*

This spell conjures three glowing motes of electricity. You direct any number of the motes to fly off and strike targets within the spellâ€™s range. Multiple motes can be fired at the same target, or each can be sent against a separate target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with a mote to strike a target. Any creature struck by a mote takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6).

If you do not immediately fire all the motes created by the spell, you can choose to fire as many of the remaining ones as you wish as a standard action during the next round. If a round passes in which you do not fire one of your motes, the spell ends and all remaining motes vanish.
