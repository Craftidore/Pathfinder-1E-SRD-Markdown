*Heal* enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, [[Blinded|blinded]], [[Confused|confused]]*,* [[Dazed|dazed]], [[Dazzled|dazzled]], [[Deafened|deafened]], diseased, [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], feebleminded*,* insanity, [[Nauseated|nauseated]], poisoned, [[Sickened|sickened]], and [[Stunned|stunned]]. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

*Heal* does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, *heal* instead acts like *[[Harm (Spell)|harm]]*.
