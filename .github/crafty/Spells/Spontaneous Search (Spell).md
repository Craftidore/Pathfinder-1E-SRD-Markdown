*With a leisurely wave and a declaration of boredom, you complete the spell. You instantly become aware of the location and types of objects in the spellâ€™s area, as if you had made a quick search.*

The subject of this spell knows the contents of a 20-foot-radius burst, as if it had taken 10 on a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Search) check for each object and space in the burst radius, including noting the location of traps (though only a rogue can locate those traps with a DC greater than 20).
