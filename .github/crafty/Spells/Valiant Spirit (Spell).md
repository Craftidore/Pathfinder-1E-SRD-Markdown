You bestow the soul of a great ancient hero on the creature touched, giving him great skill in battle. As an immediate action, he can activate the *valiant spirit.* While active, the spiritâ€™s courage provides the recipient of the spell with a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, Fortitude saves, Strength checks, and Strength-based skill checks. The *valiant spirit* remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.

No creature can be the target of more than one *valiant spirit* spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.

*Essentia:* For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus provided by the spirit improves by 1.
