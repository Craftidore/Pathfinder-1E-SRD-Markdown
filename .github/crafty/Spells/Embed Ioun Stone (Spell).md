Upon completion of this spell, the caster is able to take a single ioun stone and implant it into his body in any one of the 14 mystical chakra points (crown, brow, throat, shoulder (right and left), arm (right and left forearm), hand (right and left palm or back of the hand), heart (chest), waist, feet (right and left) and soul (typically chin or immediately above the chest chakra). Doing so immediately renders the embedded stone safe from external spells (spells cast by any one other than the wearer of the stone) and effects (cf. sunder). 

No more than one ioun stone per caster level plus one ioun per point of the caster's primary casting ability modifier may be embedded (in total) using this spell.

Using this spell allows one to bypass the usual DC 25 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (with a –5 penalty if the owner is the one performing the surgery) and DC 25 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) check to succeed in implanting an ioun stone. However, at the time of casting the caster may choose to attempt to make the DC 25 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) check, if he succeeds, there is a 75% chance of the ioun stone resonanting (cf. *wayfinders* and ioun stone resonant powers). Unlike with a *wayfinder,* more than one ioun stone may resonant if implanted in a chakra point.

Furthermore it is worth noting the limitation on the number of stones that may be implanted using this spell may be exceeded using the surgical method.
