You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the *seamantle*, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have *[[Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]* effects. The cover granted by the *seamantle* does not enable you to make [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as *[[Cloudkill (Spell)|cloudkill]]*).

The *seamantle* blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the *seamantle*; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the *seamantle* rather than its usual effect.

The *seamantle* allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as *[[Flame Blade (Spell)|flame blade]]*, *[[Flaming Sphere (Spell)|flaming sphere]]*, or *[[Incendiary Cloud (Spell)|incendiary cloud]]*). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* or *[[Flaming Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming burst]]* weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.
