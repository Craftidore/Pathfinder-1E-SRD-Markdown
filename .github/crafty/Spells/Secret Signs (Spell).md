Using nonverbal means, you can communicate a simple message to one other intelligent creature within range. By simply waving a hand, placing a scroll on a table, raising an eyebrow, or making any other sign, the spell allows the target to understand any complete thought of twenty-five words or less, so long as you and the target could normally communicate. You can’t send a verbal message if you don’t speak the target’s language, but can transmit a simple emotional appeal (such as “help” or “danger”) that the recipient knows is from you. You can use this spell even if you are bound and gagged, so long as the focus is on your person.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added  Assassin 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1 to Level.
