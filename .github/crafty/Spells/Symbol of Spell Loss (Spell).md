*You trace the symbol and feel a pull as it tugs against the magical energy in your mind.* 

This spell functions like *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, except that when it is triggered, the symbol begins to attack the minds of spellcasters within 60 feet. Each must attempt a Will saving throw every round they are within range, at the beginning of their turn. Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highest-level spell slot, if the character casts spells spontaneously) is lost for the day. The symbol remains active for 10 minutes per level or until it has erased fifty levels of spells. The symbol attacks creatures with spell-like abilities as if they had spells, consuming a daily use of the highest-level ability the creature possesses, or suppressing an ability usable at will for 1 round.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Changed **Components** from V, S to V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 5,000 gp each) to reflect changes in Pathfinder game system (ie., all *symbol* spells have a costly material component.

*House Rule:* This is not so much a house rule as a clarification of the above '*this spell functions like* *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]**.'* Per the WotC FAQ dated March 2007.

*[[Read Magic (Spell)|Read magic]]* allows you to identify a *symbol* with a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 10 + the *symbol’s* spell level). Of course, if the *symbol* is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.

A *symbol of spell loss* can be removed by a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* targeted solely on the rune. An *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell has no effect on a *symbol of spell loss.* Destruction of the surface where a *symbol of spell loss* is inscribed destroys the *symbol* but also triggers it.

*Symbol of spell loss* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. A permanent *symbol of spell loss* that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of spell loss* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill to find a *symbol of spell loss* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of spell loss*.
