As *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]**,* with the following additional effects.

The target loses the living construct subtype for the duration of the spell. It becomes immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities and any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect is harmless or also affects objects). The target living construct is no longer affected by spells that affect living creatures (such as *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* and *[[Harm (Spell)|harm]]*), and spells from the healing subschool provide no benefit.

The target living construct has no Constitution score, although its hit points remain the same. If reduced to 0 to –9 hit points, it is not destroyed, but the spell ends. If reduced to –10 hit points, the living construct is killed as normal.

This spell counters and dispels *[[Humanoid Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater humanoid essence]]*, *[[Humanoid Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser humanoid essence]]* and *[[Humanoid Essence (Spell)|humanoid essence]]*. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Humanoid Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser humanoid essence]]* or *[[Humanoid Essence (Spell)|humanoid essence]]*, the latter spell is automatically ended. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Humanoid Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater humanoid essence]]*, both spells are dispelled and have no effect.
