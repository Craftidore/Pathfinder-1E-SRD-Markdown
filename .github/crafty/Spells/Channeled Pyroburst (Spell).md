*A sphere of fiery energy comes into being before you. You channel energy into it, causing it to bubble and seethe with power. When you have poured enough energy into the sphere, you send it flying into your foes.*

This spell creates a bolt of fiery energy that blasts your enemies. The spellâ€™s strength depends on the amount of time you spend channeling energy into it.

If you cast this spell as a swift action, it deals 1d4 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d4) against a single target of your choice.

If you cast this spell as a standard action, it deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures in a 10-foot-radius spread.
