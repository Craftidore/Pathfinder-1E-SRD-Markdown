This spell stores within you special programmed phantasms geared to protect you when you find yourself caught unprepared. When a foe attempts to make a sneak attack against you, or when anyone makes an attack against you while you are flat footed (even casts a spell with you as the target), a phantasm appears to distract the foe. The phantasm is a disturbing image designed to momentarily surprise, confuse, or otherwise distract the attacker. It could be an image of a wounded friend, a terrible monster, a blast of fire, or anything else (the specifics are determined by the attackerâ€™s subconscious, not by you).

The phantasm appears instantly in front of the attacker. As it interacts with the attacker directly, the attacker makes an immediate Will saving throw. If successful, the attack proceeds normally. If not successful, the attack is prevented.
