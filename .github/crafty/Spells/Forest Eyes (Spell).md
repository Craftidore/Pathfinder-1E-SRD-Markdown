*The moment your hand contacts the rough wood, your vision swims, blurs, and resolves into a different image.*

Upon casting this spell, you can touch a normal, Medium or larger plant or tree and designate another of the same kind. You immediately see the surroundings of the destination plant, regardless of the distance separating the two. You see the area as though you were standing in the exact spot where the destination plant stands. You cannot move your field of vision from that spot, but you can rotate it in all directions to observe the area around the destination plant. Unlike other scrying spells, *forest eyes* does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally dark, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the plant at the center of the spellâ€™s effect.

Both plants must be alive to allow use of this spell. You can either select a particular destination plant that is already familiar to you, or designate a direction and distance and let *forest eyes* find the appropriate type of plant nearest to the desired location.
