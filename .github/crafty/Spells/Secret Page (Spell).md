S*ecret page* alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|Explosive runes]]* or *[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]* can be cast upon the *secret page.*

A *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]* spell alone cannot reveal a *secret page*’s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its *secret page* form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. *[[True Seeing (Spell)|True seeing]]* reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]**.* A *secret page* spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell.
