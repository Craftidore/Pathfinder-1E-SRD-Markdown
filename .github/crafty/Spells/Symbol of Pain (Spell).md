This spell functions like *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, except that each creature within the radius of a *symbol of pain* instead suffers wracking pains that impose a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, *symbol of pain* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of pain* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of pain* are hard to detect and disable. A [[Rogue|rogue]] (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill to find a *symbol of pain* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for *symbol of pain*.
