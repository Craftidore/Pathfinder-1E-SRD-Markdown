This spell turns an area of natural sand into a pit of deadly slipsand (*Sandstorm* 25). Supernatural sandlike materials, such as black sand or slumber sand, are not affected by the spell. A creature unable to free itself from the slipsand immediately sinks to the bottom and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate.

If *slipsand* is cast on a structure of fused sand or on a sandy foundation, it causes the affected part (or more) of the structure to collapse. If the spell is cast on a building’s material, slipsand spreads out to fill the available space, possibly burying those within its area. The collapsing structure is also dangerous (see Cave-ins and Collapses, page 66 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).

*Slipsand* creates a magic trap that is difficult to detect. A character must succeed on a [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check (DC equals the save DC of the spell) to notice a pit of slipsand. Running or charging characters have no chance to detect the trap. A rogue can find the trap with a successful Search check, but cannot disable it. The DC is 25 + spell level, or 29 for *slipsand.*
