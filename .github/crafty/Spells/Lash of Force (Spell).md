*The air around you begins to thrash and churn with invisible forces.*

This spell brings into being an invisible, whip-like tendril of force. As an immediate action, you can command the lash to strike any creature within 10 feet of you. The lash strikes automatically and deals 5d6 points of damage. You must be able to see the target to be struck, but the lash otherwise ignores concealment. As a force effect, it can even strike incorporeal or ethereal creatures.

At any point during the spell's duration, you can use a standard action to unleash a single 30-foot line of force that deals 15d6 points of damage and knocks [[Prone|prone]] any creatures in its area. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the creature from being knocked [[Prone|prone]]. This effect instantly ends the spell's duration.
