*You open your mouth and emit a tremendous roar, a sound like a lion but as loud as a mountain falling.*

All enemies within the spell’s area take 1d8 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and are [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect.

In addition, all allies within the spell’s area gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+20 temporary hit points at caster level 20th).
