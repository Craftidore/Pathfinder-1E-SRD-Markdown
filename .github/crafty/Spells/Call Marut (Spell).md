*You call across the boundaries of the multiverse, and the powers of Mechanus respond. The marut warps into place in an eyeblink with a whirling throb of thunder. “Who denies death?” it asks with the voice of an avalanche.*

By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a marut inevitable. If you know an individual marut’s name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).

You can ask the marut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.

*XP Cost:* 500 XP.
