This spell creates a glittering ballista of pure force that hovers over your head.

Once per round, on your turn, as a swift action you may direct the ballista to fire one spear made of force energy at any target opponent in the spell’s range. The ballista has an attack bonus equal to your character level plus your caster level plus your Dexterity bonus. If you attempt to fire the ballista at an opponent out of the spell’s range, the attack automatically fails.

Each bolt deals 8d6 hp force damage, has a threat range of 19–20, and has a critical multiplier of 3. As a force effect, the bolts can strike ethereal targets. Physical attacks cannot damage the ballista, but magical attacks can, and *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]], [[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]], [[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, a [[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]], or the draining touch of a [[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]] can destroy it. The ballista’s AC is 10. It has hardness 15 and 90 hp.

**GM Note**

*Spell Secret:* A [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) changes the modifying ability from the caster's Dexterity to either his Intelligence or Charisma (determined at the time of casting).
