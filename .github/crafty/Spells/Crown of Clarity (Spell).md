*A crown of magical energy appears upon your head. For a moment, your vision blurs and a slight buzz fills your ears. These distractions pass, leaving you with sharpened senses.*

You create an arcane crown that grants the wearer a +2 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen and Spot) checks.

As an immediate action, the creature wearing a *crown of clarity* can discharge its magic to gain a +8 bonus on a single Perceptions (v3.5 Spot or Listen) check. The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.

The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm. If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.

*Focus:* A pewter hoop 6 inches in diameter.
