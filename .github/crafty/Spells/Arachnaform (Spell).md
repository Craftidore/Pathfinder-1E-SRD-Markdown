*You invest the power of the spell into yourself, twisting and bending your own form into that of a spider.*

You can polymorph into a drider or a Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large monstrous spider. You regain lost hit points as if you rested for a day on the initial transformation. The spell lasts until you decide to resume your normal shape.

You acquire the physical and natural abilities of the creature you polymorph into, including natural size, Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, armor, attack routines, and movement capabilities.

You also acquire the poisonous bite and web-spinning ability of whichever spider form you choose.

You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in Constitution), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores might affect final attack and save bonuses.) You can cast spells and use magic items if you choose drider form, but no other spider form is capable of spellcasting or manipulating devices.

If you choose drider form, your equipment remains and continues to function as long as it fits a driderâ€™s body shape. Retained items include anything worn on the upper body (head, neck, shoulders, hands, arms, and waist). Otherwise your equipment is subsumed into the new form and ceases to function for the duration of the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *spiderform* to *arachnaform* to avoid duplication.
