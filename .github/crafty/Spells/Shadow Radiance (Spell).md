*Whispering the final syllable of the complicated formula, you cast the spell. Instantly, a blast of bright light fills the targeted area. From your vantage point, the spell’s light glows like a torch, although you note some creatures turn away from it as if it were a blinding radiance.*

This spell creates an intensifying illusion of bright light that affects all creatures within the area (except those that are sightless or [[Blinded|blinded]]). Viewers that fail their saving throws see a burst of bright light on the first round and become [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round. On subsequent rounds for the rest of the spell’s duration, the affected creatures continue to perceive a bright light. If they take penalties in bright illumination, they take them for the duration of their exposure to this light. Additionally, they are [[Dazzled|dazzled]] while in the area of the spell. Those who escape the area of a *shadow radiance* spell completely recover within 1 round. Those who make their saves and those outside the initial burst see only the equivalent of torchlight emanating from the center of the area.

*Material Component:* A flame at least the size of a torch.
