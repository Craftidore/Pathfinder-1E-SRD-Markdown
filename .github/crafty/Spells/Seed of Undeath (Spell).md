*The subject's face briefly takes on a gaunt, pale look and a death's-head rictus before returning to normal.*

You plant a kernel of negative energy in a subject, which is held in check by the positive energy inherent to the subject's own life force. *Seed of undeath* does not, in and of itself, harm the subject. Should the subject die before the spell expires, however, it rises as a zombie 1 round later (as per the *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* spell), as long as a sufficient corpse remains.

Any undead created in this manner are automatically under your control. At any given time, you can have a number of HD worth of undead animated through *seed of undeath* equal to your own HD, and they count against the maximum number of HD worth of undead you can control at any time (as described under *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]**).*
