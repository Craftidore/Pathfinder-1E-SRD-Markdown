You transform an existing construct into a powerhouse of hardened iron, similar to the effect of the *[[Iron Body (Spell)|iron body]]* spell. The construct gains damage reduction 15/[[Adamantine|adamantine]]. It takes half damage from acid and fire attacks of all kinds. Even if it is not a golem, however, it becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.

The construct gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity of 1).

The construct’s weight increases by a factor of five.
