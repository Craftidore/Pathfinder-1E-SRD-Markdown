You gain a divine blessing for one action of any type. You must attempt the action before the spell expires. You do not need to designate the specific action affected during casting. Rather, you may choose it anytime while the blessed chance is active.

Once you choose the affected action, this spell allows three rolls to be made for it. You take the most favorable result. This magic can affect only actions you (the caster) take or attempts you make (such as aiding another).
