*You send a plea to Bahamut and are answered by the appearance of a long, sinuous dragon covered in silver-white scales that sparkle and gleam.*

If you are a nongood spellcaster, you cannot cast this spell. By casting this spell, you request [[Bahamut]] to send you one of his aspects. Otherwise, the aspect appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the aspect (it understands Celestial, Common, and Draconic), you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions before the duration elapses. More information on the aspect of [[Bahamut]] can be found on page 152 of the *Races of the Dragon* book.
