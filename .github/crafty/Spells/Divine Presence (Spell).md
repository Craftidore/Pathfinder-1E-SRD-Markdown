*Your back straightens, your eyes flash, and your aura pulses with divine might.*

You channel a tiny spark of the divine, granting yourself nearly inhuman presence. You gain a +5 sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks made against anyone who does not worship your deity. When making such checks against individuals who have one alignment component opposed to yours (chaos/law or good/evil), this bonus becomes +10. When making such checks against someone whose alignment is diametrically opposed to yours, the bonus becomes +15.
