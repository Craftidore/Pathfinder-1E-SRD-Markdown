*You press your palm against the shield and speak the words of power. A silver radiance, in the shape of your holy symbol spreads over the shield.*

The touched shield or buckler grants its wielder a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, +1 per five caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The bonus applies only when the shield is worn or carried normally (but not, for instance, if it is slung over the shoulder).
