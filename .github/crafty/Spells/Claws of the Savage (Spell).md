The caster grants one creature two long claws that replace its hands, tentacle tips, or whatever else is appropriate. The claws deal damage based on the creature’s size.


| **Creature Size** | **Claw Damage** |
|---|---|
| Fine | 1 |
| Diminutive | 1d2 |
| Tiny | 1d3 |
| Small | 1d4 |
| Medium-size | 1d6 |
| Large | 1d8 |
| Huge | 2d6 |
| Gargantuan | 2d8 |
| Colossal | 4d6 |

The creature can make attacks with both claws as if it were proficient with them. Just as with a creature that has natural weapons, the subject takes no penalty for making two claw attacks. The subject is treated as armed. Furthermore, these claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.

If the creature already has claws, those claws gain a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and the claws’ damage increases as if the creature were two size categories larger.
