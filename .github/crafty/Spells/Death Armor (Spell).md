*You smear yourself with white paste, drawing a skull on your bare flesh. Immediately, a wreath of black flames crackles to life around you.*

The black flames created by this spell injure creatures that contact them. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons takes 1d4 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). If the creature has spell resistance, it applies to the damage. Weapons with reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.

*Material Component:* Paste made from ground bones.

*Focus*: An onyx worth 50 gp.
