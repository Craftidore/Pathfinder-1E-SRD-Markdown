A sphere of intense cold energy rolls in whichever direction you point and damages those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d6 points of cold damage as well as 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates both the cold damage and Dexterity damage. A *numbing sphere* rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls. It instantly freezes water it encounters in 5-foot-cube sections, creating chunks of ice in large bodies of water.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely remains at rest. The sphere can be destroyed by attacks directed against it. It has 10 hit points and damage reduction 5/–.

The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by extreme cold. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A *numbing sphere* winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.
