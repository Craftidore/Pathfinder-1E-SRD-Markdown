*The ground at which you point erupts with countless puffball mushrooms.*

You cause the ground to become thick with spore-ridden fungus. The area affected by this spell becomes difficult terrain. Entering a square of difficult terrain costs 2 squares of movement, and creatures cannot charge or run through such squares. The uneven surface created by this spell also increases the DC of [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks by 5 and the DC of [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks by 2.

In addition, any creature that enters a square affected by this spell bursts several mushrooms, causing their choking spores to fill the air. The spores render the creature [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Treat the spore cloud as an inhaled poison for the purpose of bonuses on the save or immunity to poison. Entering more than one affected square during a turn doesnâ€™t force multiple saves.

You can cast *spore field* on any type of ground or flooring, regardless of the material that comprises it.
