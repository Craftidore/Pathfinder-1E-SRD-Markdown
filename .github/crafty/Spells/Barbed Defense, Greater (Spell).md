This spell causes your body to sprout sharp barbs. Creatures making grapple checks against you take 1d4 points of damage per level +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The barbs last 1 round per level before they retract into your skin. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance. Casting this spell is an immediate action. Using an immediate action is like casting a quickened spell, except that you can perform an immediate action even when it is not your turn. This spell counts toward the normal limit of one swift or immediate action per round.
