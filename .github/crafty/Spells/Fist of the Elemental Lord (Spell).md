You conjure a fist made of roaring fire, churning air, solid stone, or seething water. The fist has a diameter of 8 to 9 feet. It flies through the air at a speed of 90, as you direct (a free action in a given round). You can use the fist to attack a single target by making caster level checks as attack rolls. Attacking with the fist—as opposed to just directing it—is a move action. The fist inflicts 1d6 points of impact damage per caster level plus a special effect based on its element:

- *Air:* Creatures struck, regardless of size, must make Fortitude saves or be knocked back 10 feet and prone.
- *Earth:* Creatures struck that are smaller than Gargantuan must make Fortitude saves or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.
- *Fire:* Flammable objects (including creatures) within 5 feet of the fist catch fire and suffer 1d6 points of fire damage per round until someone uses a full-round action to put out the flames.
- *Water:* Creatures struck that are smaller than Large must make Reflex saving throws or be absorbed into the fist. Those absorbed move with the fist and begin to drown. A successful [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check (DC 20) frees a creature. The fist can hold two Medium, four Small, eight Tiny, or sixteen Fine creatures.

The spell takes on the descriptor of the element chosen.

If you wish it, the fist can attempt bull rush, charge, overrun, or sunder actions. It does not make attacks of opportunity.

The fist inflicts full damage against inanimate objects regardless of element.
