You create a 2-foot-diameter ice-blue claw that floats in the air. You direct it to move anywhere within range and make one ranged touch attack each round with it, using your own attack bonus. Those the claw touches suffer 3d6 points of cold damage and must make Fortitude saves. Failing the save freezes a victim solid. Frozen creatures remain alive but cannot take actions. They stay frozen until they suffer 20 points of fire damage, after which point they are free (but sustain the 20 points of damage). If the claw suffers 10 points of fire damage, the spell ends. (The claw has AC 12.)
