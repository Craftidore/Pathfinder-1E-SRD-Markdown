*A single spark of flame leaps from your finger into the target’s body, waiting silently for its death.*

You place a tiny quantity of pure elemental fire within a creature, which interacts with the energy released by its death to create a small explosion. When the target creature is killed, its body explodes in a burst of flame, dealing fire damage to each adjacent creature equal to twice the target’s HD or twice your caster level, whichever is less (maximum 20 points). Treat creatures with less than 1 HD as having 1/2 HD for the purpose of this spell’s effect (so the spell deals 1 point of fire damage when triggered). A successful Reflex save halves this damage. *Fatal flame* has no ill effect on the target’s body before its death.

The target receives a Will save to negate the spell’s effect.
