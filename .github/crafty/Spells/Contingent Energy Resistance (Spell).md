*As you finish chanting the words, a pearlescent film covers your body before fading into your skin, a pale rainbow of colors offering their protection against potential damage to come.*

This spell functions similarly to *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]*, but with a more limited scope. While *contingent energy resistance* is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for up to 10 minutes per caster level, or until the remainder of the spell’s duration, just as if you were under the effect of a *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]* spell of the appropriate type.

Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can’t be changed. You can’t have more than one *contingent energy resistance* in effect on yourself at the same time—if you cast the spell a second time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires.

The energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type (such as from the *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]* spell). However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]] (fire)* and *contingent energy resistance (electricity),* or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy.
