You instantly slay a single target and at the same moment animate the body so that it appears that nothing has happened to the creature. The target’s companions (if any) do not immediately realize what has transpired. The target receives a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the save fails, the target remains in its exact position with no apparent ill effects.

In reality, it is now a ghoul under your control. The target’s companions notice nothing unusual about the state of the target until they interact with it, at which time each companion receives a Will saving throw to notice discrepancies (“By Moradin’s beard, you move slowly today!”). The ghoul serves you indefinitely. You cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this spell, but other means that allow you to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead created with *demise unseen*.
