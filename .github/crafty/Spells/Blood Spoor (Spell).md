By touching a drop of your quarry’s fresh blood (spilled within the past hour), you can follow its trail unerringly across land or through water, no matter how fast you are moving. If your quarry takes flight, you can follow the trail from the ground or through the air if you have means to fly.

If your quarry moves magically (such as through a *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]* or *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell), you sense its trail as a straight line from where the magical movement started to where it ended, though the line may lead through impassable barriers. This spell even reveals a druid’s path, regardless of the trackless step ability.

Successful spells, item effects or other effects that prevent scrying also prevent this spell’s effects. In addition, if you quarry moves to another plane, its trail suddenly ends.
