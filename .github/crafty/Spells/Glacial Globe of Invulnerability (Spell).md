A frosty sphere of cold energy surrounds you and excludes all spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor of 3rd level or lower. This spell functions like *[[Globe of Invulnerability (Spell)|globe of invulnerability]]**,* except that it affects only fire spells. In addition, the frosty opaqueness of the globe grants concealment (20% miss chance) to those within the area against attacks from outside. Likewise, targets outside the globe gain concealment against attacks from those within the spellâ€™s area.
