You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.


| **Knowledge** | **Will Save**<br>**Modifier** |
|---|---|
| None\* | +10 |
| Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) | +5 |
| Firsthand (you have met the subject) | +0 |
| Familiar (you know the subject well) | –5 |

   \*You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of which you have no knowledge.


| **Connection** | **Will Save**<br>**Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Likeness or picture | –2 |
| Possession or garment | –4 |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. | –10 |

If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: *[[Detect Chaos (Spell)|detect chaos]]**,* *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]**,* *[[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]]**,* *[[Detect Law (Spell)|detect law]]**,* *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* and *[[Message (Spell)|message]]*.

If the save succeeds, you can’t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.

**GM Note**

There are a few tricks to hide from a scrying foe, if you know what you are doing. The following circumstances modify the saving throw of a target being scried. Obviously, the best way to beat scrying is a spell like *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]**.*


| **Saving Throw Mod.** | **Circumstance of Subject** |
|---|---|
| +8 | Standing within 20 feet of a large energy or heat source, such as a pool of lava, the heart of an energy well (see Requiem for a God), or an intraplanar gateway |
| +8 | Standing within 100 feet of a scry disruptor (see Chapter Eight Book of Eldritch Might) |
| +5 | Holding a source of magical power of at least lesser artifact strength |
| +5 | *Beast shape*, wild shape ability, etc... or *[[Shapechange (Spell)\|shapechange]]* in effect |
| +2 | Standing within 20 feet of a large amount (at least 100 lbs.) of lead, [[Mithral\|mithral]], or adamantite |
| +2 | *[[Disguise Self (Spell)\|Disguise self]]* or *[[Alter Self (Spell)\|alter self]]* in effect |
| +1/2 points | Using the [[Disguise (Skill)\|Disguise]] skill over a DC 25 check |
| +5 | Standing within 20 feet of a large energy or heat source (see above) |
| +2/ try | Previous attempt at same subject failed |
