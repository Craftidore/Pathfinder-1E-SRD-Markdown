This spell converts magical energy damage into healing power. First, it renders the target immune to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) specified when the spell is cast. Second, whenever the target is subjected to a magical attack of the selected energy type, he instead heals damage equal to 10% of the damage dealt (rounded down). For example, a creature protected by *energetic healing* (cold) that would normally take 35 points of cold damage from a *[[Cone of Cold (Spell)|cone of cold]]* heals 3 points of damage instead. Once the spell heals a number of hit points equal to 2 per caster level (maximum 30), it is discharged.

This spell does not convert nonmagical energy attacks (such as damage from alchemistâ€™s fire) into healing.
