*You exhale a blast of fire down the corridor, but none of the furnishings take any damage. On another plane of existence, a horde of ethereal marauders is now nothing more than smoldering meat.*

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as *dragon breath*. When you successfully cast this spell, you can modify your breath weapon to manifest on the [[Ethereal Plane]] instead of on the Material Plane. (You must be on the Material Plane, or on another plane with a coexistent [[Ethereal Plane]], for this spell to function.) Your breath weapon affects ethereal creatures as if they were material, and does not affect material creatures in its area.
