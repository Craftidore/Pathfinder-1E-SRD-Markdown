*For an instant, both your companions' eyes go wide as they sense the mental link that now exists between them.*

You allow one of the subjects to make use of the skill ranks of the other subject, in place of her own, up to a value equal to your caster level (maximum 10 ranks). You must decide which skill is affected when you cast the spell, and the spell lasts for long enough to attempt a single use of that skill, up to a maximum of 10 minutes. The beneficiary of the spell uses the other subject's skill ranks in place of her own but applies her own ability, racial, and other modifiers. The second subject does not lose access to his skill ranks while under the effect of this spell.
