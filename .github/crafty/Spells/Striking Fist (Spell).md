*A large glowing fist, the size of a human torso, appears in front of the creature and slams into it with great force.*

The attack bonus of this *striking fist* equals your caster level + your key ability modifier + 2 for the handâ€™s Strength score (14). The fist deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and attempts a bull rush. The fist has a bonus of +4 plus +1 per two caster levels on the bull rush attempt, and if successful it knocks the subject back in a direction of your choice. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A subject that succeeds on its Reflex save takes half damage and is not subject to the bull rush attempt.
