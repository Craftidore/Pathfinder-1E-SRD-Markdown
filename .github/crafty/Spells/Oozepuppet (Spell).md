*You point a crooked finger at the ooze, and it shivers with what could easily be mistaken for anticipation.*

You telekinetically take control of the targeted ooze if it fails its saving throw. Once control is established, you must have line of sight to the ooze to manipulate it, but distance is not otherwise a factor unless you and the ooze are on different planes (at which point the spell ends). Thus, you can manipulate the ooze while scrying upon it, for example.

You can force the ooze to move, attack, and otherwise perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. Controlling an oozeâ€™s actions for an entire round is a move action for you. When not directed to move, attack, or undertake any actions by you, the ooze is held immobile by telekinetic forces.

Although most oozes have no minds, they still instinctively resist this telekinetic control. Thus, if forced to take a self-destructive action, the ooze gains a new Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect of the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Replaces earlier version from Spell Compendium.
