## Overview
[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]] ([[Summoning Spells|summoning]])

**Level:** [[7th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 7]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 13th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 13]]

For the duration, you can choose to include prepared healing and restorative spells with uses of your Healing Touch or Divine Presence disciplines. For example, if you touch a creature and use Healing Touch, you can give that creature a *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]* spell at the same time, requiring no additional action on your part.

Adding a spell to the Healing Touch or Divine Presence disciplines is your choice, despite the fact that it may not occur on your action. A spell added to one of these disciplines is expended as if you had cast it.

The spells that can be laced in with the disciplines are as follows:

*- [[Break Enchantment (Spell)|Break enchantment]]
- [[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|Remove blindness/deafness]]
- [[Remove Curse (Spell)|Remove curse]]
