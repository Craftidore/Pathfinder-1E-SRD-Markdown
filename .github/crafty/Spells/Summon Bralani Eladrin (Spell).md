*A glowing blue seal appear on the ground and then subsides immediately. When it has vanished entirely, a bralani eladrin appears.*

This spell summons a bralani eladrin from the Olympian Glades of Arborea. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spellâ€™s effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.
