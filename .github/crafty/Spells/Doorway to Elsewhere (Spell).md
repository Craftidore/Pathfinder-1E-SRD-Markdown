This spell creates a doorway through which you view another location. The doorway is a 5-foot-by-8-foot, one-way magical opening that allows you or anyone else to step into the desired location. You cannot choose or change the position, orientation, or angle of the doorway. Any spell that protects an area from teleportation or scrying also prevents a *doorway to elsewhere* from opening into it.

Any creature in the destination location with an Intelligence of 12 or higher can notice the doorway by making an Intelligence check (DC 20). Even if the doorway is noticed, however, it remains one-way, and the creature cannot look or step in—she merely knows it is there.

When creating the doorway, choose a place known to you that it will lead (a place you have been or a locale you have had described to you). It can even be on another plane. To determine if the doorway appears where you want it to, make a percentile roll on the table below. The paragraphs that follow explain the table’s terms.


| | **On** | **Off** | **Similar** |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Familiarity** | **Target** | **Target** | **Area** | **Mishap** |
| Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-99 | 100 | - |
| Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-97 | 98-99 | 100 |
| Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-94 | 95-96 | 99-100 |
| Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-88 | 89-96 | 97-100 |
| Description | 01-52 | 53-76 | 77-92 | 93-100 |
| False destination (roll 1d20+80) | - | - | 81-93 | 93-100 |

**Familiarity:** “Very familiar” refers to a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you’ve been there often or because you have used other means (such as *scrying*) to study the place. “Seen casually” is a place you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps even from a precise map. “False destination” is a place that does not exist, such as if you have mistranslated an ancient tome and tried to step into a nonexistent treasure vault that you believe you read about, or if a traitorous guide has carefully described an enemy’s sanctum to you wholly inaccurately. When looking into a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling percentile dice, since there is no real location for you to hope to see or even be off target from.

**On Target:** The doorway opens into the place you want.

**Off Target:** The doorway opens into a location a random distance away from the desired location in a random direction. Distance off target measures 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance between you and the original location. If the door goes to another plane, the off-target location is another plane.

**Similar Area:** The doorway opens into a location that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.

Generally, you step into the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably step somewhere else across the globe.

**Mishap:** The doorway’s energy explodes around you, inflicting 3d6 points of damage to you and all within 10 feet of you.

**GM Note**

This spell is frequently used by wizards that have extraplanar strongholds and refuges. This spell is often used to allow entrance and exit to and from demiplanes created using *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]]**,* *[[Create Demiplane, Greater (Spell)|greater create demiplane]]**,* and *[[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|lesser create demiplane]]**.*

This spell is frequently used in conjunction with *[[Dimensional Wormhole (Spell)|dimensional wormhole]]**.*

Clever mages often use this spell in conjunction with the *[[Mirror, Hideaway|mirror hideaway]]* spell, placing the terminus of the* doorway to elsewhere* within the extradimensional space.
