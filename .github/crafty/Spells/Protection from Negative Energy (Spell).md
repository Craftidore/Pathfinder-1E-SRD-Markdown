*Swaddling your ally in a protective field drawn by your hand like a blanket, you guard him against negative energy attacks.*

The warded creature gains partial protection against negative energy effects. For as long as the spell lasts, it subtracts 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any negative energy effect (such as an *inflict* spell) that adversely affects it. 

Negative energy effects that donâ€™t deal hit point damage to the subject, such as an *[[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]]* spell, affect the subject normally.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level per *Dark Arts of Necromancy* (Anumbium).
