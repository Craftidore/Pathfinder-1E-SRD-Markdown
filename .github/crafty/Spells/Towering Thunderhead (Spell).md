*A cylinder of roiling clouds appears, shot through with punishing winds and sheets of lightning.*

This spell creates an enormous mass of dark clouds that provide concealment as *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]**.* Powerful and contrary currents of wind inside the cylinder have the effect of a *[[Wind Wall (Spell)|wind wall]]* spell. Movement within the cylinder is hampered; entering an affected square costs 2 squares of movement. You can see and move normally within your own *towering thunderhead* spell (though your ranged attacks are hindered as much as anyone else's).

Any sonic or electricity spell of 7th level or lower cast by a creature within a *towering thunderhead* is automatically empowered (as if affected by the [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]] feat, but with no adjustment to the spell's level or casting time). Spells already affected by [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]] don't gain this benefit.
