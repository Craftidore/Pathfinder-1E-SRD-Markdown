*You calm your target by exhaling a peaceful breeze.*

This spell allows you to exhale a calming breeze, soothing one creature of your choice. The creature is affected as if by a [[Calm Emotions (Spell)|calm emotions]] spell for as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. You cannot affect creatures with more Hit Dice than you have caster levels.

*Special Material:* If you blow dust of blue spinel (worth at least 50 gp) in the breeze when you cast the spell, its duration increases to 2 minutes per level.
