*You invoke the powers of good and law, and in response to your pleas, you glow with the golden radiance of the sun.*

You are bathed in an unearthly glow for the duration of the spell, as if a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell had been cast on you. You get a +4 sacred bonus to Charisma.

If you die, your body is converted into an explosive blast of energy in a 20-foot-radius burst centered where you fell, dealing 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all evil creatures in the burstâ€™s area. Good creatures in the area are healed by the same amount, and undead take double this damage. Spell resistance cannot prevent this damage, but a successful Reflex save reduces it to half. Your body is disintegrated, so you cannot be raised with a *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* spell. Spells that do not require an intact body, such as *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]*, can be used to bring you back to life as normal.
