*You feel, more than see, a black haze form at the corner of your eyes. Upon touching your intended subject the haze disappears and the creature’s eyes become shrouded in blackness.*

The subject of this spell gains the ability to see normally in natural and magical darkness, although it does not otherwise improve the subject’s ability to see in natural dark or shadowy conditions. The subject ignores the miss chance due to lack of illumination other than total darkness. While the spell is in effect, a jet-black film covers the subject’s eyes, a visual effect that gives the spell its name.

*Material Component:* A pinch of powdered black gemstone of any type.

GM Note

*House Rule: Ebon eyes* can be made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. 

*House Rule:* Unless a spell creating magical darkness specifically states that only its caster can see within its area *ebon eyes* will permit the ability to see normally.
