# Hunter's Friend
## Overview
Transmutation

**Level:** Druid 3, Ranger 2

**BoXM:** Druid 6

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, DF

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Your animal companion

**Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Animal Archive, pg. 24

Your animal companion works in perfect harmony with your mastery of nature.

You share one of the following class abilities with your companion for every 4 caster levels you possess: camouflage, favored enemy, favored terrain, hide in plain sight, resist nature’s lure, swift tracker, trackless step, venom immunity, and woodland stride. You must have the ability in question to share it with your companion, and it functions for your companion just as it functions for you, save that each favored enemy or favored terrain you share counts as a separate class ability for the purpose of this spell.

At the GM’s discretion, you may instead share an ability granted by an archetype that substitutes for one of the above abilities, such as the arctic endurance, arctic native, icewalking, and snowcaster abilities of an arctic druid.
