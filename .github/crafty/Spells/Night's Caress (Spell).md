A touch from your hand, which sheds darkness like the blackest night, disrupts the life force of a living creature. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (max 15d6), and 1d6+2 points of Constitution damage. (A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Constitution damage.)

The spell has a special effect on an undead creature. An undead touched by you takes no damage or Constitution loss, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if [[Panicked|panicked]] for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.
