You create a magical construct called an ashstar. It shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of the range. Each round, you can move the ashstar anywhere within range by spending a move action to concentrate on the new position. The ashstar gives off a reddish light, akin to the hazy light within a sandstorm, providing shadowy illumination in a 20-foot radius. A creature you designate within 10 feet of the ashstar that takes damage from any source must make a Fortitude saving throw. On a failed save, the damage is considered dessication damage, and the victim becomes dehydrated.

An ashstar can be attacked as if it were an object. It has hardness 10 and 20 hit points
