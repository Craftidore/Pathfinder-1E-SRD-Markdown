This spell surrounds you in an aura of crackling electricity, both offering protection against electrical attacks as well as causing damage to each creature who attacks you in melee.

Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d4 points of electrical damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum + 15). If they strike you with a metal weapon, or are wearing metal armor, or carrying a lot of metal. they take 2d4 points of electrical damage +2 points per caster level (maximum + 15). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you unless the weapon is at least 1/2 metal in composition (a spear or polearm is not).

Against electricity attacks, you take only half damage. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

When casting this spell, you appear to be sheathed in tiny lightning bolts that undulate across your body. The electricity provides equal illumination to a torch (20 feet). The color of the electricity is blue-white, though the color can be almost any hue as determined by the caster.

*Arcane Material Component:* Two thin copper bracelets, one worn on each wrist.
