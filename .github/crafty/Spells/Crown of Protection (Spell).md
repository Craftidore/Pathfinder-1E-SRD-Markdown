*A shimmering crown of force appears upon the recipient’s head. A barely visible shield of force projects forward from it, warding off attacks aimed at its wearer.*

This spell creates a crown of magical energy that grants the spell’s recipient a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on all saves.

As an immediate action, the creature wearing a *crown of protection* can discharge its magic to gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC or a +4 resistance bonus on saves for 1 round. The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.

The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm. If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
