*You speak a few curt words and your face is briefly overlaid with the image of a violet-shaded skull. The skull fades, but the nimbus of violet light remains around you.*

You become surrounded by an aura of fear, granting you a frightful presence not unlike that of a dragon. Whenever you charge or attack, you inspire fear in all creatures within 30 feet that have fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. Each potentially affected opponent must succeed on a Will save or become [[Shaken|shaken]]â€”a condition that lasts until the opponent is out of range. A successful save leaves that opponent immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.

If you cast this spell when you already have the frightful presence ability or a fear aura, the existing ability becomes more effective in the following ways:

- The radius of the area affected by the ability increases by 10 feet.
- The DC of your frightful presence ability increases by 2.
- Creatures that would normally be [[Shaken|shaken]] by your fear aura are [[Frightened|frightened]] instead, and creatures that would normally be [[Frightened|frightened]] are [[Panicked|panicked]].
