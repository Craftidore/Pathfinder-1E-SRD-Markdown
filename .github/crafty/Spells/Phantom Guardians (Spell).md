This spell creates the illusion of one or more Small or Medium figures of a chosen humanoid race. Each figure is effectively a *[[Minor Image (Spell)|minor image]]*, and can appear dressed in any way the caster chooses. When the spell is cast, each figure is given a brief set of orders to follow for the spell’s duration, such as “walk back and forth along that wall” or “stand by this gate.” The orders can be different for each figure. These instructions can’t be changed later. The illusory figures can’t speak or react to their surroundings—they are typically used to scare off would-be intruders (as the spell’s name suggests).
