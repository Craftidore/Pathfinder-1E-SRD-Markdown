This spell transforms your body, along with all equipment worn or carried, into living sand. You take the form of an ooze, and you gain immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorphing, and stunning for the duration of the spell. You are not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. Since, unlike an ooze, you are not mindless and retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, you can still be affected by mind-affecting spells and abilities. While in *sandform*, you don’t experience the environmental effects of heat or dehydration, but you can still take fire or dessication damage. You become blind, but you gain blindsight out to 60 feet. Your base attack bonus, base saves, alignment, level, class, hit points, type (and subtype), extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities remain unchanged, but your supernatural abilities are suppressed in *sandform*. You can cast spells for which you have components.

The new form can be disorienting. Any time you are in a demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes.

While in *sandform*, you have a base land speed of 20 feet. You can pass through openings as small as a quarter of an inch in diameter, although passing through a space two or more size categories smaller than yours takes a full-round action. You also gain a natural attack—an abrasive slam with a gritty pseudopod that grants 5 additional feet of reach. A successful hit deals bludgeoning damage according to your size:


| **Caster Size** | **Slam Damage** |
|---|---|
| Fine | — |
| Diminutive | 1 |
| Tiny | 1d4 |
| Small | 1d6 |
| Medium | 1d8 |
| Large | 2d6 |
| Huge | 3d6 |
| Gargantuan | 4d6 |
| Colossal | 5d6 |

The number of times you can attack with this pseudopod each round is determined by your base attack bonus, and you apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus on damage as though attacking with a two-handed weapon. However, you cannot wield weapons while in sandform.

In sandy terrain, you gain a burrow speed equal to your base land speed. You also gain a +10 circumstance bonus on all [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks and you have concealment. 

Upon death, you revert to your original form.
