You give the target creature large feathered wings in the manner of a pegasus, allowing it to fly with a speed of 100 feet (average maneuverability). The creature reacts to these wings as if they were naturally part of its body and can use them immediately. [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] checks to manipulate the mount are made as if it were not flying (so a rider familiar with horses can handle a flying horse just as easily as a normal one).

The spell gets its name from the Elvish name for Lurue: Yathaghera the Winged Queen, ruler of the pegasi and unicorns of Evermeet.
