*In an instant you cause glistening green vines to spring up at your command.*

This spell functions like *[[Vine Mine (Spell)|vine mine]]*, except that the vines you create are poisonous (contact, 1d6 Dex/2d6 Dex). A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the spell’s area (and again 1 minute later); creatures don’t have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within). You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your caster level to share this immunity.
