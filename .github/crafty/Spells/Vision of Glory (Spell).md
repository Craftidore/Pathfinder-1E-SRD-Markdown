*You touch your ally, and her eyes mist over momentarily. You know she is seeing an image of her deity, imploring her to battle in his name.*

You give the subject creature a brief vision of a divine entity that is giving it support and inspiring it to continue. The creature gets a morale bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on a single saving throw. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Using the bonus discharges the spell.
