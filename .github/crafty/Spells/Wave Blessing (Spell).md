On the seas, there is always the danger of falling overboard, especially to those wearing armor or who simply cannot swim.

The affected targets do not go under the water if they fail a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check for any reason, including being tied up, [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or heavily loaded. However, the targets can still be dragged under by the actions of other creatures.
