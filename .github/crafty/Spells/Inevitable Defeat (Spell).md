You draw a cloud over the subjectâ€™s mind, dealing 3d6 points of nonlethal damage. No saving throw is allowed against this effect. Each round on its turn, the subject must succeed on a Will save or take another 3d6 points of nonlethal damage. If the saving throw is successful, the damage for that round is negated and the spell ends.
