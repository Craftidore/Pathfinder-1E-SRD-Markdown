Whenever the target of this spell looks into a mirror or other reflective surface where it can see its own visage clearly, it sees a Red Mantis assassin (in full armor, face hidden by a mantis mask) looking back at it. The reflection is harmless and mimics the target’s motions perfectly; no one else can see this illusion. The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or shaken and take a –2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the spell’s duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster’s *mirror mantis* spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends.
