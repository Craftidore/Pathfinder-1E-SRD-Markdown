*You touch a spider’s body and think of the targets. As each target succumbs to the spell, a leg of the spider vanishes into nothingness.*

For the duration of the spell, as a standard action, you can eavesdrop on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired:

- A creature’s surface thoughts.
- Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.
- One nugget of information per caster level from all the minds regarding one particular topic, thing, or being.
- The thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.

Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature’s mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]*, using the original save DC. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]*.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider for that creature.

*Material Component:* A dead spider of any size or type. It must still have all eight legs.
