You change yourself into an ogre. Your type changes to giant. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of an ogre but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the ogre’s Armor Class, speed, darkvision, and low-light vision. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the ogre’s feats and racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You can speak, cast spells, and use disciplines.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *ogre’s form*, but it is nonfunctional.
