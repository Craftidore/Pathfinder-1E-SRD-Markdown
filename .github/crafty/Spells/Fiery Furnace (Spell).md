You raise the temperature in the affected area to the level of extreme heat. For every minute spent breathing the air in the area, a creature vulnerable to heat takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (no save). In addition, the creature must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a â€“4 penalty on their saves. In addition, those wearing metal armor, as well as those coming in contact with metal that has been in the area for at least 1 hour, are affected as if by a *[[Heat Metal (Spell)|heat metal]]* spell.

This spell was originally developed as a means of cooking food (cast inside cauldrons, brick ovens, and smoke houses), but wizards quickly determined that it could be used as a deterrent (on long hallways or in treasure vaults, for example) or for creating a comfortable environment for heat-loving pets.

*Fiery furnace* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Darsson's fiery furnace* to* fiery furnace* for campaign continuity.
