*Drawing upon the powers of unlife, you give yourself abilities similar to those of a vampire. You become gaunt and pale with feral, red eyes.*

You gain damage reduction 10/magic, and you can use any one of the following abilities each round as a standard action.

- *[[Enervation (Spell)|enervation]]*, as a melee touch attack
- *[[Vampiric Touch (Spell)|vampiric touch]]*, as a melee touch attack
*- [[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]
*- *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]* (self only)

While you are using this spell, *inflict* spells heal you and *cure* spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects. A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + turning character’s Cha modifier) or be [[Panicked|panicked]] (or cowering) for 10 rounds. A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + turning character’s Cha modifier) or be [[Stunned|stunned]] (or charmed as by *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]*) for 10 rounds.

Any charm effect you create with this spell ends when the spell ends, but all other effects remain until their normal duration expires.

*Material Component:* A black onyx worth at least 50 gp that has been carved with the image of a fang-mouthed face.
