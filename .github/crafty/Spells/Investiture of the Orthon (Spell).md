*A dull humming noise sounds briefly, and the air crackles with the terrible power of an orthon.*

While under the effect of this spell, a creature is infused with the disruptive power of an orthon. As an immediate action, the subject of this spell can erect a 20-foot-radius field that disrupts teleportation spells or effects. All creatures in the area are prevented from using any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that provides such movement, as if they were in the area of a *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]* spell. Each use of this field lasts 1 round.

In addition, the subject of the spell gains the benefit of a *[[Sonic Shield (Spell)|sonic shield]]* for as long as the spell remains in effect. This shield functions like the *[[Fire Shield (Spell)|fire shield]]* spell, except that it deals sonic damage instead of cold or fire, and the subject takes half damage from acid-based attacks. If exposed to an acid attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.

The subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the orthon*).

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
