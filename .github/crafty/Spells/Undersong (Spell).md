*When you cast this spell, a familiar and soothing song wells up in your mind.*

This spell brings to your mind a song that helps you retain your concentration. The song does not distract you from any task at handâ€”on the contrary, by humming along to the tune, you can focus your mind with ease.

As long as this spell is in effect, you can make a [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check in place of a Concentration check.
