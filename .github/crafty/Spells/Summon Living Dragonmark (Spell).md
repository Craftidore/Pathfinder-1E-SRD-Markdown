*You summon a writhing mass of energy with a vaguely dragonlike form, not unlike a three-dimensional version of your dragonmark.*

A living dragonmark appears where you designate within the spell’s range and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability, and you can direct it to attack particular enemies. It cannot perform any other actions.

You can summon only one living dragonmark at a time.

*Dragonmark:* Any lesser, greater, or Siberys true dragonmark.

| Lesser | 1d6+6 |

**Improved Grab (Ex)** To use this ability, a living dragonmark must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

**Constrict (Ex)** On a successful grapple check, a living dragonmark deals normal force slam damage (see above). It cannot constrict creatures larger than itself.
