You alter an item that provides a certain type of bonus so that it provides a different type of bonus to the same value or roll. For example, you could change a *[[Protection +1|ring of protection +1]]* so that it provided a natural armor bonus to Armor Class instead of a deflection bonus, or you could change a *cloak of resistance* so that it provided a circumstance bonus on saves instead of a resistance bonus. You cannot use this infusion to change an item so that it provides a sacred or profane bonus, nor can you change an item that already does so to make it provide a different kind of bonus. You also cannot make an item provide a dodge bonus to Armor Class.
