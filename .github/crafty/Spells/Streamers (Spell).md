You cause a number of glowing, red streamers to shoot forth from the your hand when you cast the spell. You may fire one streamer, plus one additional streamer for every three levels beyond 9th (to a maximum of four streamers at 18th level). Each streamer targets one creature; multiple streamers can each be targeted at a different creature, or many streamers can target one creature. A streamer moves on its own, pursuing its target without your concentration, hovering in the same space as the target with a readied touch attack. Whenever the target next takes any sort of action, the streamer makes a touch attack against it (at the casterâ€™s base attack bonus). On a successful attack roll, the streamer deals 5d10 points of damage. If a target takes no actions for the duration of the spell, the streamers around it disappear with no effect.

Streamers can be attacked (AC 20), but only magic weapons have any effect on them. Any successful attack destroys a streamer.

*Material Component:* 6-inch strand of red spider silk.
