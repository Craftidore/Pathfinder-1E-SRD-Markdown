The creature touched has its personal magical auras (though not those of magical items it bears) masked in such a manner that it appears as if no spells or magicks are affecting him. Spells such as *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]**,* *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*, or *[[Arcane Sight, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane sight]]* simply detect no magical auras from the affected creature.

If someone with a magical detection ability or spell such as one of those listed above chooses to “disbelieve” the *masking aura*, he may make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) to do so, but the difference between his own level and that of the caster of the *masking aura* is used as either a positive or negative modifier to this check.

This spell masks any magical auras upon the creature, not just those in effect at the time of its casting; if a spell with a duration were cast after *masking aura,* such as *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]**,* it also would be masked. Magical items remain unmasked but personal effects caused by them on the bearer are masked.

*Masking aura* prevents spells such as *[[Magical Backlash (Spell)|magical backlash]]**,* *[[Magical Backlash, Greater (Spell)|greater magical backlash]]**,* *[[Reciprocal Gyre (Spell)|reciprocal gyre]]**,* etc. from functioning while it is active.

**GM Note**

This spell is commonly known as *Nystul's masking aura* in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting.
