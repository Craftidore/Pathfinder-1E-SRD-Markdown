# Renew the Land (Spell)
## Overview
[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]]

**Level:** [[6th Level Druid Spells|Druid 6]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 12th-Level Druid Spells List|Druid 12]]

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Components:** V, S, M (any seed pod)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** 1 square mile/level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

Taking the seed pod in one and making the prerequisite gestures in the other, you cause the area affected to experience an immediate renewal of all natural life (animal and plant). Plants and trees are immediately restored to perfect health and any that bear nuts or fruit are immediately bountifully laden. Any plants or trees that have been cut back or down in the past month are immediately restored to full life. This spell works as well on both fresh and salt water bodies as it does land.

Insects and animals (Int 3 and lower) are returned to full vigorous health with any that have been slain in the past month also being returned to full life.

This spell never causes more life to be renewed than could sustain itself for a month in the environment. It will not bring life to barren deserts (though it would affect an oasis) or to bare lifeless stone.

Any area suffering the effects of any form of magical blight must make an opposed caster level check or have that blight removed and the land renewed.
