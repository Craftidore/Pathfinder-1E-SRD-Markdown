# Crystal Eruption (Spell)
## Overview
[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]] ([[Creation Spells|creation]])

**Level:** [[7th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 7]], [[7th Level Druid Spells|Druid 7]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S,M (crystal shard worth at least 50 gp.)

**Range:** Medium (100 feet + 10 feet/level)

**Area:** 50-foot-diameter circle on the ground

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half and partial

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 56

The area quakes and rumbles, and the ground begins to burst forth with massive crystalline shards. The shards rise up to 20 feet high. Anyone or anything in the area must make a save each round. Failure indicates that the subject suffers 1d6 points of impact damage per level (maximum 20d6) and is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round and knocked prone. On a successful save, the subject suffers half damage and is not [[Stunned|stunned]] or prone.

Structures built upon the affected area likely are destroyed. If the spell is cast underground in a cave or cavern with a ceiling of less than 20 feet, there is a 50 percent chance that it completely collapses the area.

After the duration expires, the crystal shards remain in the area where they rose up, but they crack and turn brown, making them worth practically nothing.
