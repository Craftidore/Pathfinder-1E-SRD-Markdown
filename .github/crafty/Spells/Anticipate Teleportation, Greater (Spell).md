*The arcane words that activate this spell linger in the air for a moment. As they fade from your hearing, you become more aware of both your surroundings and the possibility of intrusion.*

This spell functions like *[[Anticipate Teleportation (Spell)|anticipate teleportation]]**,* except that *greater anticipate teleportation* identifies the type of the arriving creature (and any companions accompanying it) and creates a delay of 3 rounds, providing the recipient with even more warning and preparation time.

*Focus:* A tiny hourglass of platinum and crystal filled with diamond dust, costing at least 1,000 gp. The hourglass must be carried or worn by the spellâ€™s recipient while the spell is in effect.
