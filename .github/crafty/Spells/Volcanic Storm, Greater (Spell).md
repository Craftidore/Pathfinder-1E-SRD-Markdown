*Greater volcanic storm* creates billowing clouds of volcanic ash and pelts the region with blocks of partially molten stone, subjecting the area to the effects of a localized volcanic eruption.

On the first round of this spell's duration, the area is blasted with a powerful pyroclastic wind. Living creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or be [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1d4 rounds. The winds are hurricane force and have the appropriate wind effect on all creatures in the area.

On the second round, the wind stops as a whistling shower of fist-sized chunks of rock pelt the area. All creatures and unattended objects in the area take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (max 10d6); a successful Reflex saving throw reduces the damage by half. Any creature that fails this save must make a Fortitude save or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds.

On the third and final round, these chunks of rock explode into torrents of lava. All creatures and unattended objects in the area take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (max 10d6), a successful Reflex saving throw reduces the damage by half.

*Material Component:* A javelin made of obsidian and tipped with a diamond head worth at least 100 gp. This javelin must be thrown as the spell is cast; it unerringly flies to the point directed by the caster to be the center of the spell's area as the spell is cast.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *volcanic storm* to *greater volcanic storm* to avoid duplication.
