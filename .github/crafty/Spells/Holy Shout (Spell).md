Letting loose with a *holy shout* has three effects. First, any evil creatures in the target area suffer 1d8 points of sonic damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d8). Nongood, nonevil creatures suffer only half damage. Good creatures suffer no damage.

Further, if you are on your home plane, the spell instantly banishes nongood extraplanar creatures within the target area back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least one day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the *holy shout*.

Lastly, creatures native to your plane who hear the *holy shout* and are not good suffer the following cumulative ill effects:


| **HD** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 14 or more | [[Deafened]] |
| Less than 14 | [[Blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |
| Less than 10 | [[Paralyzed]], [[Blinded\|blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |
| Less than 6 | Killed, [[Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[Blinded\|blinded]], [[Deafened\|deafened]] |

*[[Deafened]]**:* The creature is [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1d4 rounds.

*[[Blinded]]**:* The creature is [[Blinded|blinded]] for 2d4 rounds.

*[[Paralyzed]]**:* The creature is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] and [[Helpless|helpless]] for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.

*Killed:* Living and unliving creatures suffer 15d6 points of damage.
