The subject can see into and through solid matter. At a range of 20 feet, the subject can see as if it were looking at something in normal light—even if there is none. For example, if the subject looks into a locked chest, it can see inside even if there’s no light within. *X-ray vision* can penetrate matter based on the type of material and the caster’s level:


| **Substance Scanned** | **\*Thickness per Round** | **Maximum Thickness** |
|---|---|---|
| Organic matter (animal) | 2 feet/5 levels | 2 feet/level |
| Organic matter (vegetable) | 1 foot/5 levels | 2 feet/level |
| Stone | 6 inches/5 levels | 1 foot/level |
| Iron, steel, and so on | Half-inch/5 levels | 1 inch/level |
| Lead, gold, platinum | Cannot penetrate | N/A |

  \* *Thickness penetrated per round of X-raying*

It’s possible to scan an area of up to 100 square feet in 1 round. For example, during 1 round you could scan a stone wall 10 feet wide and 10 feet high. Alternatively, you could scan an area 5 feet wide and 20 feet high. You are 90 percent likely to locate secret compartments, drawers, recesses, and doors using *X-ray vision* scanning.

*Note:* This spell can replace *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* as the prerequisite for the *[[X-Ray Vision|ring of X-ray vision]]*.
