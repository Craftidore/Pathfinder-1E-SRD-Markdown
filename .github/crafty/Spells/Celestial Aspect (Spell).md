The target can assume one of several celestial traits, chosen from selection below. As a free action, the target can choose a different celestial trait, but the target cannot change traits more than once during a given round.

**Armblade of the Sword Archon:** One of the target’s arms reshapes into a blade that functions as a *+1* *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* *longsword* or *+1* *[[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]]* *longsword* (caster’s choice). The caster may also choose create a short sword version instead of the normal longsword-sized blade. The target cannot be holding anything in the affected arm, and the armblade cannot be disarmed or sundered.

**Eyes of the Firre:** Red flames fill the target’s eyes. Once per round, as a standard action, the target can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to any single creature or object within 60 feet, simply by gazing at it (no attack roll required).

**Horns of the Cervidal:** Ram-like horns sprout from the target’s head. The target can charge an opponent with its deadly horns. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this tactic allows the creature to make a single gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times the target’s Strength modifier. Any summoned or called creature struck by the horns is dismissed instantly.

**Wings of the Astral Deva:** Angelic wings sprout from the target’s back, allowing the target to fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). Although these attributes change the target’s appearance, other celestials do not recognize the target as a celestial being (unless the target happens to be one). If the creature tries to disguise itself as a celestial, consult the *Core Rulebook 1* for the appropriate [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check DC.

*Sacrifice:* 1d3 points of Strength damage.
