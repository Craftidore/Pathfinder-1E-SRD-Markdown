*With a few words and a gesture, you empower a weapon to strike true against incorporeal foes.*

*Ghost touch weapon* makes a weapon magically capable of dealing damage normally to incorporeal creatures, regardless of its enhancement bonus. (An incorporeal creatureâ€™s 50% chance to avoid damage does not apply to attacks made with weapons under the effect of this spell.) A ranged weapon affected by this spell does not bestow the ability on its ammunition.

The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a weapon under the effect of this spell counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial to the wielder.
