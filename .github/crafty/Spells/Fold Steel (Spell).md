You convert a masterwork steel weapon into its masterwork laminated steel equivalent. A masterwork sword becomes a masterwork laminated steel sword. 

Over the course of an hour, the caster causes multiple layers of steel to be interspersed with layers of a softer, more pliable metal, such as nickel. These layers are then welded and folded many times. Each fold doubles the number of layers in the steel, until they are practically microscopic. The end effect is a weapon that is both flexible and extremely hard. The soft metal provides the flexibility, and the steel provides the hardness. When the steel is polished and given its edge, the grinding reveals a distinctive wood-grain like pattern in the metal created by the dozens of layers. This process not only increases its durability but also its cutting power, because the numerous micro-thin layers create an invisible serrated edge.

This can be done with any type of slashing or piercing steel weapon. 

The benefits of a laminated steel weapon are that it gains a +1 to all its damage rolls and its critical hit multiplier goes up by one as well. For example, a laminated steel longsword deals 1d8+1 damage and has a x3 critical hit multiplier. Furthermore, the weapon gains +5 to its normal hardness.

The material components for the spell are magical reagents, steel and a softer, more pliable metal such as nickel worth 900 gp. If an object has multiple masterwork options (such as a double weapon), you choose one option of the object to affect (though you can cast the spell again to affect another option).

**GM Note**
