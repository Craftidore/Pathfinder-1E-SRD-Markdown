*With a word and a gesture, the target flares with crackling, violet*‐*colored energy.*

Like *[[Magical Backlash (Spell)|magical backlash]]*, this spell causes any spells affecting the target to resonate painfully. For each spell currently in effect on the target (not counting *greater magical backlash* itself), this spell deals 2 points of damage per level of that spell and lasts for 1 round per caster level (of the *greater magical backlash*).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Spells made permanent by using the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell would also resonate AS WOULD the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* itself (it must still be in effect on some level since it is dispellable (cf. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*).
