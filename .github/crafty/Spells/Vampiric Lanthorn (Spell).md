# Vampiric Lanthorn (Spell)
## Overview
[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]] ([[Shadow Spells|shadow]])

**Level:** [[4th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 4]], [[4th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 4]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 7th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 7]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, F (an inscribed and carefully prepared silver lantern fueled with pure oil and shadowstuff; 

     such a lantern always has hardness 4 and 30 hp, and it costs 400 gp)

**Effect:** One 30-ft.-radius circle

**Duration:** 1 round/level or until lantern destroyed

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

By lighting a ritually prepared lantern, you generate an area within which the life is drawn out of all creatures around you and channeled through the lantern into you. At the time of the spell’s casting, all creatures within the lantern’s light must make a Fortitude save each round that they remain in the area. Success means they are unaffected that round. Failure means they suffer 2d4 hit point loss, and you gain hit points equal to 1d4 per creature damaged in this way. You retain these points for 10 rounds after the spell ends.

If the lantern is destroyed, the spell ends immediately, and you lose all leeched hit points.
