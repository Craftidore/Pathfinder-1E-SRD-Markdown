- The target takes 1d8 points of Constitution damage immediately and another 1d8 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated with a separate Fortitude save.
- The target is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 2d6 minutes. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect.
