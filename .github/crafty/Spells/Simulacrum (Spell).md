*Simulacrum* creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature’s levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can’t create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check (opposed by the caster’s [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check) or a DC 20 [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check.

At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.

**GM NOTE**

Per the Paizo messageboards (which cannot be linked within a comment... argh!) James Jacobs states the following:

A 7th-level illusion spell cannot grant access to higher spells, spell-like abilities or supernatural abilities. 

*Simulacrum* only grants "the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD"** NOT** spell-like or supernatural abilities. 

Though not specifically stated, the caster (and caster only) must make a statue or sculpture of ice and/or snow. This should require a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (sculpting) check. The DC is 10 + 1/HD of the ***original*** creature the simulacrum is based upon.

J. Jacobs states in his final post this has not been errata'd due to the footprint change required for reprints but that eventually it will be (hopefully). His words not mine.

*House Rule:* A recommended house rule should be to add back the 3.5 requirement of: *some piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside the snow or ice*. No NPC creature will be willing to do so as there are other spells which grant an increased chance for controlling the creature via the same materials.

*House Rule:* A slain or defeated creature may have such material removed but it must be done within 12 hours (casting time of *simulacrum* incidentally) of their initial capture or death. Only one such harvesting of material per creature may be done. The spellcaster may have only one *simulacrum* per HD of himself. (A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell can be used to add an additional *simulacrum.*)

*House Rule:* *[[True Seeing (Spell)|True seeing]]* reveals a simulacrum to be a shadow-based illusion (GMs should adjudicate however they prefer but refer to *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* for one way to go about this); not an ice sculpture since the ice sculpture and powdered rubies are material components and hence, consumed at the time of casting.

*House Rule:* A simulacrum can have a *[[Stabilize (Spell)|stabilize]]* spell included in its creation and this will cause the simulacrum to fall [[Comatose (Spell)|comatose]] upon reaching 0 hit points rather than being destroyed. It remains so until it is repaired using the method outlined or it takes another 15 points of damage. This is done by casting the *[[Stabilize (Spell)|stabilize]]* spell IMMEDIATELY following the casting of *simulacrum.*
