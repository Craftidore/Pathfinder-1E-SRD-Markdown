When you drink this extract, your mind shatters and partitions itself into multiple personalities, some of which are less than sane.

For the duration of the extract, you gain a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. You are also immune to attempts to read your mind or detect your alignment. Attempts to do so via spells such as detect thoughts result only in hearing an endless stream of insane tittering and giggling. Spells such as detect evil/good detect only chaotic and indecipherable auras.

While under the influence of this extract, you suffer from a tendency to laugh inappropriately and argue with yourself. As a result, you suffer a –5 penalty to Stealth, Diplomacy, and Bluff checks and –2 penalty to Intelligence-based skill checks.
