This spell creates a small, localized wall of earth, which rises from the ground. You create on wall section 5 feet long, 5 feet tall, and 1 foot thick per level. For example a 7th-level caster could create a wall 5 feet tall and 1 foot thick that was 20 feet long and then turned and continued another 15 feet.

The *earthen shield* cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The *earthen shield* must be vertical and must rest upon a firm foundation, merging with existing earth. You can make the wall up to 10 feet all by stacking one section on top of another, but that is the maximum height the *earthen shield* can reach. You can make the wall 2 or more feet thick by stacking one section behind another.

The *earth shield* is defensive in nature, used to provide cover from attackers. Each 5-foot  length of the shield has 100 hit points per foot of thickness. Creatures can hit the shield automatically, and its hardness is 0. a section of shield whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single effort, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 5 per foot of thickness (on a successful check, a 5-foot  section of the wall is destroyed). The *earthen shield* requires a DC 15 [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check.
