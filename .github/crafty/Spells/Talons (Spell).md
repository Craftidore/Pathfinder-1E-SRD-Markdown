With this spell, you transform your hands into talon-like claws. The talons give you two natural claw attacks per round, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (plus Strength modifier) per successful melee attack. You can instead attack with a weapon in one hand and make a claw attack with your other hand as a secondary attack (-5 on your attack roll, and half Strength modifier on the damage roll) without penalizing your primary attack.

You are considered armed.
