**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Components:** V, S, M (a potion to be tattooed, special inks worth 500 gp)

**Range:** One potion

**Effect:** One *spell tattoo*

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Source:** Inner Sea Magic, pg. 62

When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of your choice. Once you finish casting *tattoo potion*, the potion begins bubbling and fizzing—if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is destroyed.

When a potion under the effects of *tattoo potion* is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo* on the drinker’s chest tattoo slot—if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location, the *tattoo potion* is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a *spell tattoo*, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a *spell tattoo*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level.

*House Rule:* The spell specifically states that the transformed potion remains permanently in place (and is subject to being *dispelled)* as a *spell tattoo. Spell tattoos* are silent, spell completion effects *(Inner Sea Magic 16).*
