This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles very similar to those created by the well-known *[[Black Tentacles (Spell)|black tentacles]]* spell. These waving members seem to spring up from the floor, soil, water, or whatever other surface is underfoot. They bash and slice creatures that enter the tentacle field, assaulting their targets with great strength. The tentacles are studded with irregular short fin-like spines, having edges as sharp as many swordblades.

The tentacles make one melee attack every round against every creature within the spell area. Treat the tentacles as a Medium creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. They deal 2d6+4 points of damage with each successful hit. This damage is half bludgeoning and half slashing.

Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles and can only move through the area at half normal speed. To you, the tentacles seem insubstantial: you can pass freely through them as if they don't exist, without impairing their attacks or your movement at all.

*Material Components:* A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid, and a fragment of spine or bone from any aquatic creature.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *battle tentacles* to *umber tentacles* for campaign continuity.

In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell is known as *Evard's umber tentacles.*
