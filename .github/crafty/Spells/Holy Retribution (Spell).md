You select a single form of attack (acid, cold electricity, fire, or force) when you cast this spell. For the duration of the spell, any attack based upon that element that strikes the caster is absorbed and instantly reflected upon the originator of the attack. Effect, area, and touch range spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that use the named form of energy are all equally affected. When it is reflected, the effect is altered, becoming either sacred or profane (depending upon the alignment of the cleric's deity), thus a creature that may normally be immune to its own attacks may now be vulnerable instead. This sacred/profane attack is equally effective, regardless of the actual alignment of the originator.

For example, a cleric casts *holy retribution* upon herself, selecting fire to be protected against, knowing she is to face a red dragon. When the red dragon uses his fire breath, the *holy retribution* absorbs the damage and returns it upon the dragon as a profane attack, though it resembles the same fierty breath and the dragon's chaotic evil alignment. The creature is still allowed spell resistance and a saving throw against its own attack.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *divine retribution* to *holy retribution* to avoid duplication.
