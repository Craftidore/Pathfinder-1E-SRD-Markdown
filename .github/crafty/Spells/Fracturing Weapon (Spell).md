*The weapon quivers at your touch, and a deep gong reverberates in the distance. As the sound fades, the weapon begins to emanate a dull gray radiance, making your vision swim when you attempt to look directly at it.*

Once per round for the spell’s duration, the wielder of the targeted weapon can declare a single melee attack to be a fracturing blow. If that attack successfully deals damage to an opponent, the foe takes a –5 penalty to Armor Class and damage reduction (if any, to a minimum of 0).

The penalties are applied after the damage from the *fracturing weapon* attack has been resolved. The penalties last for a single round, but the wielder can attack it again on his or her next turn and attempt to reinvoke the penalty.
