Your touch raises the effective body temperature of the target as though it were exposed to unearthly heat. Each round, the subject takes 1d6 points of lethal damage and 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A creature can make a Fortitude save each round for the spell’s duration to negate the damage. A creature that takes damage from the spell is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] (or [[Exhausted|exhausted]] if it is already [[Fatigued|fatigued]]). Partially protected creatures can reduce the effects and make Fortitude saves to avoid damage and fatigue each round (see Protection against Heat, *Sandstorm* 14). A creature wearing heavy clothing or armor takes a –4 penalty on its save.
