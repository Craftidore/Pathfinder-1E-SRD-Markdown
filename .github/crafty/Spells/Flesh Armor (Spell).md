Prior to casting *flesh armor,* the caster flays the skin from a creature of his size and lays it upon his own flesh, wearing it like clothing or armor. Once the caster casts *flesh armor,* his skin develops resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The caster gains damage reduction 10/+1. Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is discharged, and the skin slowly rots, shedding in patches like the skin of a molting snake.

*Material Component:* A bit of flesh torn from the caster’s body during the casting (dealing 1 point of damage).

*Focus:* The entire freshly harvested skin of another creature of the caster’s size.
