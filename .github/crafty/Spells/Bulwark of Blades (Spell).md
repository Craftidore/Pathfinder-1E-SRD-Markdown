You hold up a single dagger sized for you; it vanishes and is replaced by 1 dagger/caster level that orbits your body, remaining within your space but in no way impeding your actions. Each of these magically created daggers is made of the same material and quality as the original (although all magical enhancements, weapon abilities, and poison coatings are lost).

Any creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from you also suffers a single attack from one of these daggers. The dagger strikes with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, with Strength and Dexterity scores equal to your primary spellcasting attribute (Intelligence for a wizard, Charisma for a sorcerer, and so on).

No more than one dagger retaliates against any one action that provokes an attack of opportunity from you, but several of them can make these attacks in a single round. A single creature may provoke multiple attacks of opportunity if it takes multiple actions.

As a move-equivalent action, you can order a dagger to strike at a single target within melee range, or even to hurl itself at a foe at range. Hurled daggers vanish at the end of that round, whether a hit or miss, but the others remain available for the full duration.
