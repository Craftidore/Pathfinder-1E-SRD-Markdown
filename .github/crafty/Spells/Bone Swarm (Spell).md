**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect:** 5-ft.-cubic mass of animated bones

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 134

A 5-ft.-cubic mass of animated bones appears and attacks foes as directed.

These bones strike the opponent you designate, dealing 1d6 hp bludgeoning damage plus an additional 1d6 hp damage per four additional caster levels (1d6 at 4th level, 2d6 at 8th, 3d6 at 12th, etc.). A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

Each round after the first, you may use a move action to redirect the bones to a new target. The bones move 60 ft. per round. As part of this movement, the swarm can ascend up to 60 ft. If not directed to a new target, the bones attack the previous roundâ€™s target. Casting a spell or concentrating on a spell while within the area of a *bone swarm* requires a successful caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Similarly, using skills that involve patience or concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.
