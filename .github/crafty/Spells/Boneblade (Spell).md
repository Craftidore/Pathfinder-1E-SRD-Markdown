The caster changes a bone at least 6 inches long into a longsword, short sword, or greatsword (caster’s choice). This weapon has a +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage for every five caster levels (at least +1, maximum +4). Furthermore, this blade deals an extra +1d6 points of damage to living targets and an additional +1d6 points of damage to good-aligned targets.

This spell confers no proficiency with the blade, but the caster doesn’t need to be the one wielding the blade for it to be effective.
