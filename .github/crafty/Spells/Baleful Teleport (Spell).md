As *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*, except that you send the targeted creature (and only that creature) and carried objects to a designated destination. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy might make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

If the destination is “very familiar,” the target gets no saving throw bonus. If the destination is “studied carefully,” the target gets a +2 saving throw bonus. Likewise, if the destination is “seen casually,” “viewed once,” or “false destination,” the target gets a +4, +6, or +8 bonus, respectively.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Trobriand's baleful teleport* to *baleful teleport* for campaign continuity.
