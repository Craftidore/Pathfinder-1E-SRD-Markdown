*When you cast this spell, a small, localized tremor shakes the ground in the area. Detritus and loose debris rattle with the small quake, and creatures caught in the area stumble and fall.*

This minor quake is not strong enough to damage structures. The effect lasts for 1 round per three caster levels, during which time any spellcaster on the ground in the area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose any spell she is casting. A creature attempting to use a skill that would provoke attacks of opportunity (such as [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] (v3.5 Open Lock), [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]], and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] (v3.5 Use Rope), among others) must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check, or the action automatically fails and is wasted. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex save each round or be knocked [[Prone|prone]].
