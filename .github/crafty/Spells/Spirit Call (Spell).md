You call out to nature spirits associated with your spirit (not your wandering spirit) if you are a shaman, or your domain if you are a druid, beckoning them forth to pay attention to your current location. For the duration of the spell, all spells from your spirit magic list or domain list that are cast within the affected area have their caster level increased by 1, and all spellcasters casting such spells receive a +4 insight bonus on their concentration checks for those spells only.
