This spell enables you to transform ordinary stones (no larger than a sling bullet) into explosive, grenade-like weapons.

Throwing a stone is a standard action. The stones have a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target with one of the transmuted stones. Each stone bursts upon striking the target or any hard surface. A direct hit from one of the exploding stones deals 2d6 points of damage to

the target, and 1d6 points of damage to those within 5 feet of the point of impact. A creature struck directly with one of the stones is not entitled to a saving throw, but those within the blast area are allowed to make a Reflex saving throw to negate the damage.
