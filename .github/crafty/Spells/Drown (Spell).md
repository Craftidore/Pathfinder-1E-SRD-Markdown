*You speak the words and make the sign of the wave. Your foe sputters, water gushing from his mouth, then collapses.*

You create water in the lungs of the subject, causing it to begin drowning as if it had failed to continue holding its breath. The subject’s hit points immediately drop to 0, and it falls unconscious. In the next round, it loses another hit point (bringing its hit points to –1) and is dying. In the following round, it dies.

Coughing and other attempts by the subject to physically expel the water from its lungs are useless. However, another creature can stabilize the subject by making a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check on the creature before it dies.

Undead, constructs, creatures that do not need to breathe, and creatures that can breathe water are unaffected by this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6 to Level per Dragonlance Campaign Setting.

*House Rule:* Added Watery Death 6 to Level per Underdark.
