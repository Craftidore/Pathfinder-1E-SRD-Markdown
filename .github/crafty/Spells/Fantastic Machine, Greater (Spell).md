This spell functions like *[[Fantastic Machine (Spell)|fantastic machine]]*, but you can concentrate on controlling the machine’s every action or specify a simple program, such as to collect all the logs in an area and stack them in a neat pile, plow a field, drive piles, or the like. The machine can perform only fairly simple physical tasks. Directing the machine’s actions or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.)

Except where noted below, the machine functions as a Large animated object constructed from [[Adamantine|adamantine]]. It trundles over the ground at a speed of 60 feet. It can swim or fly at a speed of 20 feet (poor). It has 16 HD, 88 hit points, AC 20 (–1 size, +11 natural), and hardness 20. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +5, Reflex +5, and Will +0.

The machine has a Strength of 22. A light load for the machine is up to 346 pounds, a medium load is 347–692 pounds, and a heavy load is 693–1,040 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded.

The machine can lift a weight of up to 2,080 pounds to a height of 15 feet. It can push or drag 5,200 pounds. It can excavate 20,000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5-by-5-foot space in 1 round). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate.

The machine makes slam attacks with an attack bonus of +17/+12 for 1d8+9 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+27) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +12/+7. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments. A thrown rock deals 2d6+9 points of damage.
