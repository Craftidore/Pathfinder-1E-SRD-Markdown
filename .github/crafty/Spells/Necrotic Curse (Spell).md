*You feel a wave of cold pass through you as it seeps into the land, the air, and even the souls of those nearby.*

You imbue the area with negative energy so powerful it transforms positive energy into its opposite. Anyone in the area who casts a healing spell must succeed on a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level); if the check fails, the healing spell deals damage to each of its subjects equal to the caster's caster level instead of its normal effect.

Living creatures that rest in this area do not regain hit points or lost ability score points. Undead in the area heal damage at the rate of 1 point per Hit Die every 24 hours.

In addition to the normal means of ending a spell's duration, this effect can be ended by a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* (or similar spell) cast within its area for that purpose.
