*You invest the target with an infusion of divine energy. His wounds knit shut, while the power you grant to him helps ward off future injuries.*

You heal a living creature you touch of 1d4 points of damage +1 per two caster levels (maximum +3). In addition, the creature touched gains damage reduction 1/evil for 1 minute.

Like *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]*, this spell deals damage to undead creatures instead of curing them. In addition, on a failed save undead creatures take an extra 1 point of damage from any weapon or physical attack capable of overcoming good damage reduction for 1 minute.
