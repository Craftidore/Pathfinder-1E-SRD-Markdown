This spell delays a creature or object that tries to teleport any distance, even across the planes. The caster can only target one creature or object and must decide who, though it need not be the caster of the teleportation spell. The spell effect is suspended for 1 round per three caster levels, after which the spell will take effect as normal, unless the object or creature is otherwise hindered, perhaps by another spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *delay teleportation* to *lesser delay teleportation* to avoid duplication.

Level changed to Inquisitor 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 for game balance.
