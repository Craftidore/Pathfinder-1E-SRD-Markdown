By lighting a ritually prepared lantern, you generate an area within which one ability score is drawn out of all creatures around you and channeled through the lantern into you. At the time of the spell’s casting, you choose any single ability (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). All creatures within the lantern’s light must make a Fortitude save each round that they remain in the area. Success means they are unaffected that round. Failure means they suffer 1d4 ability damage in the relevant ability score, and you gain points in the same ability equal to 1 per creature damaged in this way.

You retain these points for 10 rounds after the spell ends.

If the lantern is destroyed, the spell ends immediately, and you lose all leeched ability score points.
