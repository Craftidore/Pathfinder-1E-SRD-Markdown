You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The *illusory script* appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it’s unintelligible to any other character*.*

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* implanted in the script by you at the time the *illusory script* spell was cast. The *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* lasts only 30 minutes. Typical *suggestions* include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of this note,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]],* the *illusory script* and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* spell with the *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* or *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]* spell.

**GM Note** 

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level per *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
