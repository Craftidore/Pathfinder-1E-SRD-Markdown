*A lightning strike and a tearing sound as loud as thunder fills the area as a hole in space opens. Wind rushes into the void, and objects nearby lift into the air as everything is drawn inexorably toward the rip in reality.*

You tear a temporary hole in reality itself that sucks all loose material and living creatures into it, sending them to a random plane (see sidebar). Everything sucked into the *reality maelstrom* goes to the same plane.

*Reality maelstrom* has a primary area and a secondary area. The primary area is the hole itself: a sphere with a 20-foot radius centered on the spell’s point of origin. Within that area, all unattended objects weighing 100 pounds or less are sucked into the maelstrom, as are all individuals who fail a Will saving throw.

The rip also creates a windstorm of air that affects objects and creatures in the secondary area of the spell. The secondary area is all the space farther than 20 feet from the spell’s point of origin but not farther than 40 feet away. All unattended objects within the secondary area that weigh 50 pounds or less are drawn into the primary area of the maelstrom. Individuals within the secondary area must make a Reflex saving throw. Those who fail are sucked into the primary area and must then make a Will saving throw to avoid being drawn into the maelstrom. 

Individuals who succeed on either saving throw can move and attack as normal.

A *reality maelstrom* is a one-way portal, so nothing ever emerges from the hole the spell makes.

**Random Planar Destinations**

Spells such as *[[Prismatic Spray (Spell)|prismatic spray]], reality maelstrom,* and *scramble portal,* and items such as an *[[Amulet of the Planes|amulet of the planes]]* and a *[[Power (Staff)|staff of power]]* can send an individual to a random plane. The list of available planes varies according to the cosmology you’ve chosen. An example using the D&D cosmology is presented in the next column.

Transitive Planes such as the [[Ethereal Plane]], the [[Astral Plane]], and the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] should not be considered for such random destinations.

The layer and exact location on the particular plane is up to the DM. Transportation to a random plane does not guarantee survival there, and individuals who risk such effects should be aware of the dangers.

If an individual is someplace other than the Material Plane when randomly switching planes, simply replace the plane of origin’s entry on the table with the Material Plane. Thus, a *[[Power (Staff)|staff of power]]* broken on the Elemental Plane of Fire sends the wielder to the Material Plane if a 91 is rolled.
