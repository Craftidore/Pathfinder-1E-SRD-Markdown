*Your dragonmark tingles as its energ y blocks the most potent attacks of your adversaries.*

Any critical hit or sneak attack made against you has a chance to be negated so that damage is instead rolled normally. The chance depends on the strength of your dragonmark.

|---|---|
| Least | 25% |

| Greater or Siberys | 100% |

The benefits of this spell do not stack with any other effect that grants a percentage chance to negate extra damage from a critical hit or sneak attack.

*Dragonmark:* Any true dragonmark.
