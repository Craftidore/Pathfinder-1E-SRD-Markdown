Immediately upon completion of this spell, the temperature drops to below freezing and a powerful blizzard erupts in the area. Visibility is reduced to zero, making [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and all ranged attacks impossible. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished and protected flames have a 75% chance of being doused. Creatures unprotected from the cold must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage.

One foot of new snow falls each round. Movement within the area is impeded, depending on the creatureâ€™s size and depth of snow.
