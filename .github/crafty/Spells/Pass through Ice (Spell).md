The transmuted creature is able to pass through ice or snow as easily as water, but not through stone or frozen mud. The creature moves at a speed of 15 feet and can rise or sink into ice at a rate of 5 feet per round.

When a *pass through ice* spell ends, the affected creature is ejected out to the nearest ice surface. If someone dispels *pass through ice* or you dismiss it while a creature is still in the ice, the creatures may be trapped in the ice unless they can reach the nearest surface within a single round of movement. Creatures trapped act as if caught in an *[[Entomb (Spell)|entomb]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*Errata:* Saving Throw changed to None per *Frostburn* errata.
