You increase the temperature of the region, drying up water and baking the soil within a 100-mile-radius area. 10 minutes after the spell is cast, the temperature band increases to warm or by one step (see page 12), whichever produces the hotter result. Open water and moisture in soil and plants evaporates, creating desert conditions that last until *global warming* is dispelled. If the region was ice-covered, the snow and ice melt rapidly, which might result in fl ooding.

*Global warming* counters and dispels *ice age* (described in the *Frostburn* supplement).

This is a ritual spell requiring eleven other spellcasters, each of whom must contribute an unused 9th-level spell slot to the casting.

*XP Cost:* 5,000 XP.
