Created by the renowned archmage Khelben Arunsun and shared only with those whom he trusts implicitly, *blackstaff* has three principal effects:

First, the spell gives the affected staff or quarterstaff a +4 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Second, any creature or object struck by a successful melee attack or melee touch attack with the *blackstaff* is subject to a *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* effect. This effect works exactly like a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* cast by the creator of the *blackstaff.*

Third, any spellcaster struck by a successful melee or melee touch attack with the *blackstaff* loses one prepared spell (or one unused spell slot, for spellcasters who do not prepare spells) of the highest spell level available. A successful Will save negates the spell loss, but not any damage or dispel effects caused by a strike of the *blackstaff.*

*Blackstaff* may be cast upon any nonmagical quarterstaff or on a magic staff in the caster’s possession. If cast on a magic staff, the wielder of the staff must decide as a free action on his turn each round whether he will use the staff’s normal abilities or the effects of the *blackstaff* spell. Nothing prevents the caster from giving a staff or quarterstaff under the effect of *blackstaff* to another character to wield after casting the spell.

*Focus:* A nonmagical quarterstaff or a magic staff.
