*You toss the bit of earth against the wall and it glitters and burns as it strikes the stone. The rock vaporizes where it hits and a passage opens before you, burrowing into the wall.*

As with *[[Passwall (Spell)|passwall]]*, this spell allows you to create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or harder materials. If a wallâ€™s thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single *excavate* spell simply makes a niche or short tunnel with the stated dimensions. Several *excavate* spells can be used in succession to breach very thick walls by forming a continuing passage. Unlike *[[Passwall (Spell)|passwall]]*, *excavate* is an instantaneous effect that does not end and cannot be dispelled; any passage it creates is permanent.
