*A swirling cloud of black mist surrounds you, shot through with bote of lightning and covering you in powerful magic.*

By casting this spell, you become more formidable in aerial combat, allowing you to deal with airborne enemies more easily. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability (or 30 feel if you wear medium or heavy armor, or carry a medium or heavy load). If you already have a fly speed of 40 feet or greater, your fly speed improves by 10 feet, and your maneuverability improves to good (unless it's already better than that).

While airborne, you can use a swift action each round to fire a bolt of magical lightning as a ranged touch attack against any other airborne target within 60 feet. This attack deals 1 point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20 points) and reduces the target's fly speed to 1/2 normal for the duration of the spell. This speed reduction doesn't stack, so attacking the same target multiple times yields no extra reduction in fly speed (but continues to deal damage).

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate one *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* (as the spell) as a standard action. Doing so ends the duration of lord *of the sky,* and if you do not have a natural fly speed, you drift to the ground as per the fly spell.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), this spell grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 if encumbered as described above). Dragonblooded casters who already have a fly speed of 60 feet or greater instead gain a +10-foot improvement to their fly speed.
