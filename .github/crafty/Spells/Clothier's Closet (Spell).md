When you and your companions need to attend a gala reception at the last minute, you need not despair over your clothing. When you cast clothier’s closet, you conjure a 3-inch-diameter wooden rod up to 10 feet long between any two upright supports you choose. For example, you could summon the rod to appear between two walls of a corridor or alcove. On the rod hang a number of outfits as determined by you, each of a size and type you specify while the spell is cast.

The conjured rod can hold a variety of separate outfits whose total price does not exceed 100 gp. The outfit types that you can specify include the following: artisan’s outfit (1 gp), cleric’s vestments (5 gp), cold weather outfit (8 gp), courtier’s outfit (30 gp), entertainer’s outfit (3 gp), explorer’s outfit (10 gp), monk’s outfit (5 gp), noble’s outfit (75 gp), scholar’s outfit (5 gp), or traveler’s outfit (1 gp). The conjured clothing is normal in all respects and does not radiate magic. Even after the duration elapses and the rod and hangers disappear, the clothes remain.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Hospitality dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Ghallanda), can cast this spell without the material component, but the conjured clothes last only as long as the spell’s duration.

*Material Component:* A gem worth at least 100 gp.
