*You extend your hand toward your foe, flicking a single sliver of wood into the air, and a splinter larger than a titanâ€™s javelin whistles through the air.*

You cause a long, thin, sharp beam of splinters to lance out of your outstretched hand to strike a target in range. You must make a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) to hit the target; if you hit, the splinterbolt deals 4d6 points of piercing damage. The splinterbolt threatens a critical hit on an 18-20 and deals x3 damage on a successful critical hit.

You can fire one additional splinterbolt for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three splinterbolts at 11th level). You can fire these splinterbolts at the same or different targets, but all splinterbolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

If you cast this spell in forested terrain, the splinterbolts are treated as cold iron magic weapons, and they deal an additional +4 points of damage on a hit.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is especially effective when cast in conjunction with the *acorn of far travel* spell.

This version of the spell replaces the one on page 203 of the Spell Compendium.
