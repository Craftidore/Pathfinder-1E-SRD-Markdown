Upon casting this spell, you immediately know a selection of the spells the target creature has prepared or knows. The number of spells revealed to you is equal to your caster level. The target’s lowest-level spells are revealed first—ignoring 0-level spells—in a random order. Once all of the target’s 1st-levels spells are revealed, the spell begins revealing 2nd-level spells, then 3rd-level spells, etc This spell does not reveal spells of 8th level or higher, but unlike *spell gauge*, it does it reveal spell-like abilities or other special abilities (at their appropriate level). If cast on a creature that is not a spellcaster, that only has spells of 0 level or of 8th level or higher prepared, that has expended all of its spells, or that has not prepared any spells that day, the spell is expended without effect.

**GM Note**

A subsequent casting of this spell by the caster at the same target reveals previously undiscovered spells rather than those already known.
