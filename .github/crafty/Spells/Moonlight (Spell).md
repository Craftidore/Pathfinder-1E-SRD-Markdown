You surround your hand or some other part of your body with light resembling moonlight. You can change the intensity from a faint glow equivalent to a candle to a clear, bright light equivalent to a torch. It varies in color as you desire, whether blue-white, soft green, white, or silver. You can use this moonfi re as a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Whether or not the attack hits, the spell effect is discharged.

You can cause the moonlight to leave your body and move about as a single light similar to *[[Dancing Lights (Spell)|dancing lights]]*. Once it leaves your body, the effect’s duration is 1 minute per level, and the effect can no longer be used to attack.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: Name changed from *Eilistraee’s moonfire* to *moonlight* for continuity.

*House Rule*: In the Forgotten Realms, this spell is most commonly know as *Eilistraee’s moonfire*.

*House Rule*: Level changed to Cleric 1, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Eilistraee 1.
