# Dancing Chains (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** Demonologist 3, [[4th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 4]], [[4th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 4]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 7th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 7]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets:** One chain per level within range

**Duration:** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Book of Vile Darkness (WotC), pg. 90

The caster can control one chain per level as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as she wishes. In addition, the caster can increase the chains’ length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as spiked chains that use the caster’s normal ranged attack bonus on attack rolls or grapple checks (treat each chain as Medium-size when grappling).

The caster can climb a chain she controls at normal speed without making a [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* *Dancing chains* does not alter the material of a given chain, merely its size (minimum size of 6 inches). That said, note that even a small diameter steel, mithral or adamantine chain will be extremely strong and difficult to break. 

Proficiency with spiked chain is not needed by the caster as the spell states "these chains attack as spiked chains."

As a tactical note, using this spell (even at the minimum level with 7 chains) and having one grapple while the other 6 assist the grapple can be VERY dangerous (cf. Covering Fire feat).
