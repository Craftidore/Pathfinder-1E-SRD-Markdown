The caster sees through the veil of reality to pose a single question to nameless malevolent entities that exist beyond normal consciousness. The question must be posed such that the answer is a simple yes or no. The answer given is correct 75% of the time. Answers the DM deems too obscure are never revealed. The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM can give a short answer instead (five words or less).

*Drug Component:* Mordayn vapor.
