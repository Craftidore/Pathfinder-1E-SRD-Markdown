You can force one ranged physical (nonspell) attack back at its source each round as a free action. The attack retains its initial attack roll to determine whether it hits the source and inflicts damage normally.

Thus, if an archer fires an arrow at you with an attack roll of +25, you reflect it back at the archer, striking if the archerâ€™s Armor Class is 25 or less. You must be aware of the attack and not flat footed, however.
