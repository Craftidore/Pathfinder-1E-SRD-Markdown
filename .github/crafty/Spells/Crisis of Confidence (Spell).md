You strip away the target’s leadership qualities, leaving the creature virtually incapable of commanding troops. The target may not add its Charisma bonus (if any) to rally checks. The target’s commander rating (if any) is reduced to 0, and it loses any commander aura(s) it possesses. The target can add its commander rating (if any) as a bonus on its Will save.

See Chapter 4 of *Heroes of Battle* for more details on rally checks, commander ratings, and commander auras.
