This spell creates an anchored plane of ectoplasm or a hemisphere of ectoplasm, depending upon the version selected. A wall of ectoplasm cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ectoplasm is semisolid (not raw)—about the consistency of packed snow—and retains its shape rather than collapsing into a formless mass. Because ectoplasm is a *[[Ghost Touch (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* material, it is an impenetrable barrier to incorporeal creatures (although they may attack the wall or go around it). The ectoplasm is opaque and blocks line of effect.

*Ectoplasm Plane:* A sheet of ectoplasm appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square per caster level (so a 6th-level wizard could create a *wall of ectoplasm* 30 feet long and 20 feet high, a wall 60 feet long and 10 feet high, and so on). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need be anchored only on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.

The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has hardness 0 and 2 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall without making an attack roll. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. A creature can break through the wall with a Strength check (DC 12 + caster level).

*Hemisphere:* The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. It is as hard to break through as the ectoplasm plane variation. You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures get a Reflex saving throw to avoid being trapped.
