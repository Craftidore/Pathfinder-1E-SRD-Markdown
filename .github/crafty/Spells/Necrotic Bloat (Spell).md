You cause the cyst of a subject already harboring a *[[Necrotic Cyst (Spell)|necrotic cyst]]* (see spell of the same name) to pulse and swell. This agitation of the necrotic cyst tears living tissue and expands the size of the cyst, dealing massive internal damage to the subject. The subject takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 10d6), and half the damage is considered vile damage because the cyst expands to envelop the newly necrotized tissue. The cyst is reduced to its original size when the vile damage is healed. Vile damage can only be healed by magic cast within the area of a *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]* or *[[Hallow (Spell)|hallow]]* magic, can the damage be repaired.

*Focus:* Caster must possess a mother cyst (*Libris Mortis* 28)
