This spell functions as *[[Mirror Travel (Spell)|mirror travel]],* except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you need to have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information) you enter the mirror and simply re-emerge from the same mirror. This spell is capable of teleporting the caster to another plane, as long as the destination has a suitable mirror.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Witch 8 to Level.
