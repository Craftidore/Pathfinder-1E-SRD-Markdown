*Strike construct* transmutes the structure of a construct to deal 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the construct successfully saves, *strike construct* deals half this amount, but it cannot reduce the target’s hit points to less than 1.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *disable construct* to* strike contruct* to avoid duplication.
