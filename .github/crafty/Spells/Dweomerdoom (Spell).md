You counterspell an opponent’s spell or spell-like ability before it is even cast and without knowing what spell you are countering.

If the target prepares spells, you counterspell the highest level spell currently prepared, eliminating it from the target’s list of prepared spells for that day. If the target casts spells spontaneously (and does not prepare spells), you effectively reduce by one the number of spells per day of the highest level spell slot available. If the target has spell-like abilities (and does not prepare spells or cast spells spontaneously), it loses one use of the highest-level spell-like ability available. Otherwise, this spell has no effect.

You must make a successful dispel check (as the spell *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]],* but the maximum caster level on your dispel check is +25 instead of +10) to successfully counter or remove your opponent’s prepared spell, spell slot, or use of a spell-like ability.

*Focus*: A crystal lens worth at least 1,000 gp.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Khelben's dweomerdoom* to *dweomerdoom* for campaign continuity. 

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Khelben’s dweomerdoom* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

*House Rule:* In the event of opposing *dweomerdooms*, use an opposed caster level check (d20 + caster level + primary attribute) with the higher roll not only canceling the other but also allowing the counterspelling as originally intended.
