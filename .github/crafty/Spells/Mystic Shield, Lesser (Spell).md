*With the casting of your spell, you feel a presence about you, warding off the spells of other casters.*

This spell creates an invisible aura around the recipient that moves with that individual. It prevents all spells and spell-like abilities of 3rd-level or lower from affecting the recipient. The protected individual can cast spells normally, even on himself. Magic items and spells that summon items to the caster such as *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|Leomund’s secret chest]]* and *[[Instant Summons (Spell)|Drawmij’s instant summons]]* likewise function normally.

A *lesser mystic shield* also negates the enhancement bonuses and special properties of magic weapons used against the target.
