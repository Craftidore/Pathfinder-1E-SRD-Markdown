*1st Round:* Presence or absence of creatures with necrotic cysts.

*2nd Round:* Number of creatures bearing necrotic cysts in the area.

*3rd Round:* The location of each creature bearing a necrotic cyst. If a cyst-bearer is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

*Focus:* Caster must possess a mother cyst (*Libris Mortis* 28).
