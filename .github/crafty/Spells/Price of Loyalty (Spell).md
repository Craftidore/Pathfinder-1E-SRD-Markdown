Gold and greed are the two tools of the Aurum, and this subtle charm uses one to harness the other. The effects of *price of loyalty* are identical to *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]**.* The drawbacks are the limited range and the fact that the target must accept your offer of a platinum piece (the spell's focus) for the spell to take effect. The advantage is the subtle nature of the enchantment. *Price of loyalty* requires no gestures or incantations, and there are no signs of magic; whether or not the target succeeds on his saving throw, he will never know that a spell was cast. However, the effect can still be discerned by *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* and similar spells.

*Focus:* One platinum piece.
