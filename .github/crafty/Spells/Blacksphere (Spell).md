This spell creates a burst of black force. The force burst causes 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and envelops the affected area in a sphere of force with a radius of 10 feet, trapping creatures within. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the entrapment effect. Creatures trapped inside cannot escape except by those methods that can bypass or destroy a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*.

This spell can be used in lieu of *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* as part of creating a *[[Bead of Force|bead of force]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's blacksphere* to *blacksphere* for campaign continuity.
