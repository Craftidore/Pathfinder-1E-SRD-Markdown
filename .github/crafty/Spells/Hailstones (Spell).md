*The crystal globes in your hand vibrate intensely before turning ice-cold. As you hurl them, they resemble balls of ice, an observation borne true when they strike and shatter into a shower of ice crystals.*

You create frigid hailstones that strike your enemies. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit with a globe. Each hailstone deals 5d6 points of cold damage. For every five caster levels, you gain an additional hailstone (maximum of four stones at 20th level), and all globes must be aimed at enemies that are all within 30 feet of each other.
