An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are [[Staggered|staggered]] and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A *slowed* creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple *slow* effects don’t stack. *Slow* counters and dispels *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*.
