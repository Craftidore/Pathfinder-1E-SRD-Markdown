You create a ghostly green radiance anywhere within range that shines with the brightness of a torch and is imbued with unearthly power, causing creatures within 30 feet to become [[Shaken|shaken]] unless they succeed on a Will save. The light can be shaped to any Medium or smaller form, and can move at a speed of 30 feet as long as you maintain concentration on the spell (so that you can shape the effect into a human form and make it seem to walk or fly, for example). The shape of a *ghost light* can be changed at any time during the spellâ€™s duration as a free action.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Grave 1, Maho 1 to Level per Oriental Adventures; added Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1 to Level.
