When you cast *soulmeld blessing,* you provide each affected creature with a surfeit of essentia. Affected creatures can immediately reallocate their essentia pool as if they had taken a swift action to do so (even though it isnâ€™t their turn and no action is required). Essentia that cannot be reallocated with a swift action (for example, essentia invested in an incarnum feat) cannot be redistributed.
