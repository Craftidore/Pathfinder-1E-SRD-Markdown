*Smearing blood between your fingers, you inscribe a ward in the air and cast the power of that ward over a wide area.*

You create a region that is temporarily protected against interplanar intrusion. This includes spells and abilities that use other planes, including *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]], [[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]], [[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]],* and travel through such planes as the [[Astral Plane]], the [[Ethereal Plane]], and the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]].

Summoning and calling spells do not function within a *zone of respite*, but summoned and called creatures outside a *zone of respite* can be sent inside it. *[[Gate (Spell)|Gate]]* spells and other portals cannot be created within a *zone of respite*, but existing portals are unaffected by the spell. Creatures on coterminous or coexistent planes must retreat to the edge of the *zone of respite* and cannot enter the corresponding area on the coterminous or coexistent plane.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* *Zone of respite* can be made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. When making this spell permanent over an area it covers one 20-ft. square/level.
