# Circlet of Enervation (Spell)
## Overview
[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 5]], [[5th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 10]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, F

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect:** 6-inch circlet of negative energy

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial; see text

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Shining South (WotC), pg. 44

You form a small ring of negative energy in your hand, which harms neither you nor your equipment. The circlet launches from your hand, and you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A struck creature takes 2d6 points of damage and gains one negative level (a Fortitude save negates the negative level). No sooner do you hurl the circlet than another one appears in your hand, ready to be launched again on your next turn.

Negative levels from *circlet of enervation* function exactly like those gained from the *[[Enervation (Spell)|enervation]]* spell.

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell heals 2d6 points of damage when it strikes an undead, rather than harming it. Further, each time an undead creature is struck by the circlet, it gains 5 temporary hit points. The spell has no effect on constructs or inanimate objects.

*Focus:* A jet bracelet worth 100 gp.
