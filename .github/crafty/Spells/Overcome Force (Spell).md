**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 10]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 10 minutes/level or until discharged

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 68

This spell protects a creature from damage by force effects, such as Eldritch Bolts (see the discipline in Chapter One: Classes of the *Book of Experimental Might I*), in a manner similar to *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]*. When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of force damage, *overcome force* ends.

The spell also provides the creature touched with a special ability. The creature can move through a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* once, ignoring it as if it were not there. If the creature uses this ability, the spell ends immediately afterward. *Overcome force* does not grant the creature the ability to make attacks through a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, only to move through it.
