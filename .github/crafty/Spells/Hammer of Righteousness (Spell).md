A great warhammer of positive energy springs into existence, launches toward a target that you can see within the range of the spell, and strikes unerringly.

The *hammer of righteousness* deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the target, or 1d8 points of damage per caster level if the target is evil. The caster can decide to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage with the hammer, or can split the damage evenly between the two types. How the damage is split must be decided before damage is rolled. The hammer is considered a force effect and has no miss chance when striking an incorporeal target. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage.

*Sacrifice:* 1d3 points of Strength damage.
