*You clutch the quartz in your hand, focusing the energy of the spell into a sharp spear. With a thought, you send it whistling through the air at your foe.*

You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to strike a target with an *icelance*. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. If you hit, the icelance deals 6d6 points of damage to the target. Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage. In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the result of the attack, the icelance shatters upon its first use.

*Focus:* A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone. Alternatively, if you are in a cold region, you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or snow for the quartz.
