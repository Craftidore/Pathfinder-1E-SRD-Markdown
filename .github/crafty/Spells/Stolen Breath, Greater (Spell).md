# Stolen Breath, Greater (Spell)
## Overview
[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]] \[[[Air Spells|air]]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 5]], [[5th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 9th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 9]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, F (a stoppered glass vial)

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target:** One living creature that breathes air

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates; Fortitude partial, see text

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** The Mage’s Tower 

*With a clenched fist, you make a tugging motion toward your target. A transparent, barely perceptible hand appears to plunge into your target’s mouth.*

You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the subject’s autonomic breathing cycle. The subject’s lungs do not automatically function again while the spell’s duration lasts.

If the target succeeds on a Will save when *greater stolen breath* is cast, it is unaffected. If it fails its Will save, it can still continue to breathe by taking a standard action in each round to gasp for breath. An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks blacking out from lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Fortitude save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one that goes by without a breath; the DC drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take a breath. If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it is [[Disabled|disabled]] (0 hp). In the following round, it drops to –1 hit points and is [[Dying|dying]]. Curing spells or powers can revive a [[Dying|dying]] subject normally, so long as this spell’s duration has expired; if the spell is still in effect, a revived creature is still subject to Fortitude saves in each round when it does not consciously breathe.
