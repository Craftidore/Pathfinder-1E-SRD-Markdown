The opponent you touch gains a 50 percent hit chance; in other words, 50 percent of attacks targeting the creature that normally would miss now hit. This curse negates the effect of a normal miss chance, whether it be from incorporeality, concealment, [[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]], or other condition. For such conditions, however, the effects of the curse are also negated. This curse can be removed with a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 6, Witch 6, Wizard 6 to Level.

*House Rule:* This spell also affects the miss chance of spells like *[[Blink (Spell)|blink]]* and *[[Mirror Image (Spell)|mirror image]]**.* In the case of the latter, should the attacker 'miss' due to striking an image rather than the actual target, roll percentile dice and should the roll be between 51-00, the attack hits normally and the image remains.
