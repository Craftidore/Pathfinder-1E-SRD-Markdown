*By pointing your finger at one of your favored enemies, you mark it with a glowing rune that only you can see.*

Your favored enemy bonuses against a foe with a *mark of the hunter* are 4 higher than they would otherwise be.

Furthermore, the rune limns your enemy, making the foe easier for you to attack. The subject of a *mark of the hunter* spell gains no bonus to Armor Class against your attacks from any cover less than total cover, nor does it gain a miss chance against your attacks from any concealment less than total concealment. Other effects that grant a miss chance (such as incorporeality) work normally.

*Material Component:* A bit of skin or bone from the relevant favored enemy type or subtype.
