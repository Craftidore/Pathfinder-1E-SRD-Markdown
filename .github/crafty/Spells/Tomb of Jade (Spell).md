When you cast this spell, you attempt to draw out the impure substance of a Tainted creature and replace it with your own pure substance. The spell is draining for you to cast, but it is deadly to creatures that are infected with the Shadowlands Taint.

You can only cast this spell on a Shadowlands creature (a creature with the Shadowlands subtype or with a Taint score). When you touch the creature, it must make a Fortitude saving throw. If it succeeds, it is unaffected by the spell. If it fails, its skin turns to jade and it is immobilized, standing [[Helpless|helpless]]. The creature is aware and breathes normally, but cannot take any physical actions, even speech. It can, however, execute purely mental actions (such as using a spell-like ability). The effect is similar to that of *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]*.

Each round you maintain the spell, the creature must attempt another Fortitude save. If it fails the save, it takes 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain. Each round you maintain the spell, however, you take 1d6 points of subdual damage. If you fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or if the creature succeeds at its Fortitude save, the spell ends.

*Material Component:* A finger of jade worth at least 50 gp.
