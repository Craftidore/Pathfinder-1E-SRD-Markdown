*You touch two allies, and for a moment their features change so that they seem to blend their appearances into one new creature.*

When you cast this spell on two subjects, you create a mystical link between them. For the duration of the spell, the subjects gain a +2 bonus on any skill checks they make, as long as at least one of the characters has 1 rank or more in the skill. In addition, if either character has ranks in a skill that is not normally usable by untrained characters (such as [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] \[3.5 Tumble]), the other character can make untrained checks using that skill.
