# Acid Rain (Spell)

[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]] ([[Creation Spells|creation]]) \[[[Acid Spells|acid]]]
**Level:** [[5th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 5]], [[5th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 5]]
**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 10]]
**Casting Time:** 1 standard action
**Components:** V, S, M (a flask of acid (cost 10 gp))
**Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
**Area:** 20-ft. radius cylinder, 40 ft. high
**Duration:** 1 full round and 1 round/level; see text
**Saving Throw:** None
**Spell Resistance:** No
**Source:** Heroes of Battle (WotC), pg. 124

You create a downpour of acid that douses the area for 1 full round, dealing 7d6 points of acid damage to every creature in the area.

The ground within the area becomes muddy and/or slick from the downpour, and remains in that condition for a number of rounds equal to the casterâ€™s class level. Movement in the area is halved, though a creature can move at normal speed by making a DC 10 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Balance) check. Failure on the check means it cannot move in that round, and failure by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone.
