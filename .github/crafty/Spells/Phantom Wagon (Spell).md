This spell is similar to *[[Phantom Carriage (Spell)|phantom carriage]]*, except that it conjures four Large, quasi-real horse-like creatures drawing a Huge, quasi-real heavy wagon (cf. Ultimate Combat, pg. 184). The wagon can be ridden by you and up to 8 other people (but its maximum load of 16,000 pounds + 200 pounds per caster level cannot be exceeded by the total weight of passengers and cargo).

The steeds have an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 15 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. The wagon has a hardness of 10 and 150 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If any two steeds lose all their hit points or the wagon is reduced to 0 hit points, the *phantom wagon* disappears. *A phantom wagon* has a speed of 20 feet per 2 caster levels, to a maximum of 200 feet. It can bear its passengers' weight plus cargo weighing 16,000 pounds plus up to 200 pounds per caster level.

Persons riding within the *phantom wagon* are considered to have cover (+4 to AC, +2 to Reflex saves) from all directions except the rear. Check for lines of effect as usual.

The *phantom wagon* may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. It contracts and lengthens as necessary in order to pass between obstacles as narrow as 5 feet. Thorns, briars and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect it.

The wagon gains certain powers according to caster level. A wagonâ€™s abilities include those of wagons of lower caster levels.

11th Level

The wagon can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

13th Level

The wagon can use *[[Water Walk (Spell)|water walk]]** at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).*

15th Level

The wagon can use *[[Air Walk (Spell)|air walk]]* at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

17th Level

The wagon can *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* at its speed (average maneuverability)

.

**GM Note**

Some wizards frequently cast *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* and *[[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]]* in conjunction with this spell.
