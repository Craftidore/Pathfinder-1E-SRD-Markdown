This spell conjures a dancing cloud of tiny dagger-like objects, one for each of the caster's levels (20 maximum). The caster immediately assigns the daggers to any opponents within range, dividing them up as he pleases. The daggers immediately attack the round summoned and continue to attack on the caster's action for the duration of the spell. Each dagger attacks using the caster's base attack bonus, with no Strength modifier (the daggers are considered to be wielded with Str 10) and a +4 size modifier to its attack roll. Upon a hit, each dagger inflicts 1d4 points of damage. The daggers are not considered magical weapons.

Once assigned to an opponent, the *dancing daggers* will not stop attacking that opponent, even if he is slain. Daggers will move 30 feet per round to pursue their assigned prey. Any daggers assigned to opponents who move beyond range from the caster will float at the edge of the spell's range like dogs at the end of their leashes. As a standard action, the caster may reassign any and all daggers to new opponents.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *daggers of Vaul* to *dancing daggers* for campaign continuity.

*Spell Secret:* Using a magical dagger (though not one only temporarily enchanted by another spell effect) and making a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) increases the power of the *dancing daggers* exponentially by causing each dancing dagger to add the caster's primary spellcasting attribute bonus as an untyped modifier to hit and damage.

*Greyhawk Campaigns:* The mage Dzur was notorious for intimidating other wizards into giving up their most closely held secrets. He devised this spell to harry and ultimately slay other spellcasters who refused his demands.

*Kalamar Campaigns:* Vaul was a battle mage of Calastia renowned for putting this spell, of his own invention, to prodigious use during the Titanswar. Swarms of Vaul's daggers would harry Mormo's witches, while Calastia's soldiers closed in on the hags.

More recently, Anteas, King Virduk's chief vizier, rediscovered the spell in Calastia's arcane library, and Calastia's battle mages now assault Virduk's enemies with *dancing daggers* during their king's battles for conquest.
