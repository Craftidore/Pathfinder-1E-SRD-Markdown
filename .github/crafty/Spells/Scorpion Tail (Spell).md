The affected creature sprouts a black, scorpionlike tail. As a free action each round, the target creature may attack any adjacent foe with the tailâ€™s stinger, using its full melee attack bonus and dealing 2d6 points of piercing damage (plus Strength modifier) on a successful hit. The tail is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; any creature wounded by the stinger must succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.
