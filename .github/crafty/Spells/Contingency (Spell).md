You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting *contingency*. The *contingency* spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast *contingency.*

The spell to be brought into effect by the *contingency* must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the *contingency* immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (*contingency* and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

*House Rule:* For further guidance on the *contingency* spell, see [[Contingent Spells|contingent spells]].
