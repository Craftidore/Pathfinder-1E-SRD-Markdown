This spell transforms the target into an axiomatic creature—a perfect version of itself. The spell rids the creature of noticeable flaws, makes its fur or scales appear shinier, and so forth. Animals touched by this spell become magical beasts, but otherwise the creature’s type is unchanged. If the target has an Intelligence of 2 or less, the spell imbues the target with an Intelligence of 3.

As an axiomatic creature, the target gains the following special attack:

**Smite Chaos (Su):** Once per day, the target can make a normal attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum +20) against a chaotic opponent.

The target gains the following special quality:

**Linked Minds (Ex):** The target can communicate telepathically with other axiomatic creatures of its type within 300 feet. If one in the group is not [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], none of them are, and no axiomatic creature in the group is considered flanked unless they all are.

The target also gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, spell resistance equal to double its HD (maximum 25), and resistance to cold, electricity, fire, and sonic attacks based on its HD, as shown below:


| **Target’s HD** | **Cold, Electricity, Fire, and Sonic Resistance** |
|---|---|
| 1–3 | 5 |
| 4–7 | 10 |
| 8–11 | 15 |
| 12+ | 20 |
