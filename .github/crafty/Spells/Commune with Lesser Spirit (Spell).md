You contact any local spirit creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice and can ask it up to one question per two caster levels. You must know the identity of the spirit, and you must be within 10 feet of the spirit’s location. The spirit’s knowledge is limited to matters within its immediate area (so that the spirit of a great tree in a village cannot answer questions about events outside the village, for example), and you must ask questions that could typically have one-word answers. “Unclear” is a legitimate answer, because spirits are not necessarily omniscient, but in cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the spirit’s interests, the DM can respond with a short phrase (five words or less) instead.

If the spirit has been subject to *commune with lesser spirit* (or *[[Commune with Greater Spirit (Spell)|commune with greater spirit]]*) within the past week, this spell fails. As well, if the spirit’s alignment is different from yours, it gets a Will save to resist the spell. Unasked questions are wasted if the spell’s duration expires.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Celestial 2, Nature 2, Shaman 2, Shugenja 2 (Water)—Kitsu School to Level (per Oriental Adventures), added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
