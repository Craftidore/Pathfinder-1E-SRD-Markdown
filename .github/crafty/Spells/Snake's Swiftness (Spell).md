*You toss the scales into the air, and they vanish in a sparkling mist as you indicate your target. Without hesitating, that creature draws and fires an arrow into the fray.*

The subject can immediately make one melee or ranged attack. Taking this action doesn’t affect the subject’s normal place in the initiative order. This is a single attack and follows the standard rules for attacking.

This spell does not allow the subject to make more than one additional attack in a round. If the subject has already made an additional attack, due to a prior casting of this spell, from the *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* spell, or from any other source, this spell fails.
