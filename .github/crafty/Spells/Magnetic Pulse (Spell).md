You call upon the powerful magnetic forces of the vast lodes of metal hidden deep within the mountains to focus on a specific point in range. All unattended ferrous metallic objects that weigh less than 10 pounds per caster level are immediately hurled in a random direction to a point just beyond the area of the spell's burst. All creatures in the area take 5d6 points of damage. Alternatively, you can direct the spell inward, and all unattended ferrous metallic objects are hurled toward the center of the area; this inflicts 3d6 points of damage to all of the objects and to all creatures in the area . A successful Reflex saving throw negates the damage done by either type of *magnetic pulse*.

Attended ferrous metal objects are affected differently by this spell. Fairly small ferrous metal objects worn on the body (such as jewelry) are whisked off the creature's body unless he makes a Reflex save. Most jewelry pieces (especially magic items), however, are not made of ferrous metal. Characters in ferrous metal armor (which is most metal armor) are subjected to a trip attack made by a Large creature with an effective Strength of 22 (the bonus on the trip attack is +4 for size and +6 for Strength for a total bonus of +10). Similarly, the spell makes a disarm attack (using your base attack bonus + 6 for the spell's effective Strength) against any ferrous weapons or objects held in an affected creature's hands. Creatures made primarily of ferrous metal (such as iron golems) are subjected to a bull rush attack from a Large creature. The effective Strength is 22 (+4 size and +6 Strength for +10 bonus on the check) in the direction of the pulse.

If this spell is cast in mountainous terrain, the area is doubled to a 60-foot-radius burst, and the pulse's effective Strength score increases to 30 (+10 Strength bonus).
