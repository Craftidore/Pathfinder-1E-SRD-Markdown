*The shimmering, transparent form of a unicorn flies forward, its corporeal horn lowered in a charge at its enemy.*

A translucent unicorn shape appears in midair and speeds toward the target of this spell. If you succeed on a ranged touch attack, the horn slams into the target and deals 1d8+8 points of damage. In addition, the target is subject to a bull rush, and must make a Strength check (with appropriate modifiers for a bull rush) against a DC of 21. If the check is failed, the subject is pushed back 5 feet, plus 5 feet for every 5 points by which it failed the check.

You can conjure an additional *unicorn arrow* for every three caster levels beyond 5th, up to five at 17th level. You can have them strike a single creature or several creatures, but each horn can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you make your attack rolls. A creature struck by more than one horn is only required to make one Strength check to avoid the bull rush, but the DC of the check increases by 2 for each horn beyond the first that strikes it.

*Focus:* An ivory replica of a unicorn (25 gp).

**GM Note**

In the world of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell is known as *Melf's unicorn arrow.*
