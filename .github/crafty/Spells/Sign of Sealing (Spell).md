*While pointing at the target, you trace the lines of a complicated sigil that visually appears where it is to seal. The sigil glows with latent magical energy.*

You seal a door, chest, or similar closure with a prominent magical sigil that bars entry and prevents opening. A door or object protected by this spell can be opened only by breaking (add 10 to the normal break DC) or by the use of *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* or *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. If the door or object is forced open by any means (magical or physical), the *sign of sealing* deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) in a 30-foot radius (Reflex half).

A *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell doesn’t negate or automatically bypass a *sign of sealing,* but will suppress the sign for 10 minutes on a successful caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the sign’s creator). A *sign of sealing* is a magic trap that can be disarmed with a DC 28 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check. You can pass your own sign safely, and it remains set behind you.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The sigil formed by this spell is unique to each caster and incorporates the caster’s *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]*.
