You create an invisible wall of force. The *lesser wall of force* cannot move. It has no hardness but can absorb up to 10 points of damage per caster level before being destroyed. Unlike greater versions of this spell, it does not prove immune to *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|Disintegrate]]* immediately destroys it, as does a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]*, a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]],* or *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mageâ€™s disjunction]]*. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either direction, but they may inflict damage normally upon the wall and can potentially destroy it as easily as physical attacks. *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|Dimension door]]**,* *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]**,* and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures (though ethereal creatures usually can get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings).

The *lesser wall of force* must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails.
