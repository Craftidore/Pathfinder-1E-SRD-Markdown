You cover the ground in thick, black dust pulled from impossibly distant, shining fields. The dust is roughly 2-ft. deep and completely obscures the ground, making it impossible to spot obstacles such as holes, pools, and the like. The black dust makes the area of effect difficult terrain. Flying creatures, [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]] creatures, and other creatures that do not touch the ground are immune to this effect.

In addition, creatures in the area of effect must make a Reflex save or be coated in the black dust. This outlines invisible things and creatures and bestows a +10 circumstance modifier to [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks made to track creatures leaving the area of affect. The dust lasts until the spellâ€™s duration ends.
