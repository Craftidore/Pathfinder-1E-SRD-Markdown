This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Soul Stasis, Lesser (Spell)|lesser soul stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being compelled (by any compulsion effect), cursed (any effect that can be removed by *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]*), [[Exhausted|exhausted]], possessed (such as through a *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* spell) or *[[Wounding (MagWpnSpcAb)|wounding]]* (the weapon special ability and similar abilities possessed by creatures). It also prevent changes from or to [[Disabled|disabled]] or [[Dying|dying]]. If the subject’s hit points fall below 0, the character can continue to take normal actions since he is not dying. Since he is not dying, he does not continue bleeding. Should he reach –10 hit points (due to additional damage), he dies. If the spell is cast on a [[Disabled|disabled]] or dying character, he cannot fall below –9 hit points although this stasis spell does not prevent the subject from stabilizing.

If cast on an undead creature, the creature becomes immune to any effect that would cause it to become or recover from being turned. This does not prevent turning actions that result in the undead’s destruction.

This spell also prevents all Constitution and Charisma drain received during its duration.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
