*You clutch at the air as though grabbing a nearby creature, and then you blow on your fist. As you do so, ice and snow appear around your foe.*

A target that fails its save takes 1d8 points of cold damage per round at the beginning of your turn. Each round, the subject can make a new Fortitude saving throw to avoid taking damage that round. The second time a subject takes damage from a single casting of *winterâ€™s embrace*, it becomes [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. The fourth time it takes damage from the same spell, it becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]].

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Cleric 3, Winter 3 to Level per Frostburn.
