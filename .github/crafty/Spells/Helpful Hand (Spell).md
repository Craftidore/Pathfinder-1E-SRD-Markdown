*A magical construct in the shape of a hand appears next to you. Its fi ngers open toward you, waiting for you to hand it an item.*

This spell creates a hand of magical force that holds items for you, helps you complete long, involved tasks, and otherwise aids you. The spell grants you a +2 competence bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] (v3.5: and Open Lock) checks for the duration of the spell. It can hold a single object weighing up to 20 pounds. You can grasp the object that the hand carries or place an object in its grasp as a swift action. The hand remains in your square at all times. It matches your speed, and you can bring the hand and the object along with you if you use *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*, *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*, and similar spells. You cannot order the hand to move away from you. If you are separated from the hand, the spell immediately ends.

The hand is about 1 foot long. It has hit points equal to half your full normal hit points, and its AC is 20 (+4 size, +6 natural). It makes saving throws using your total save bonuses and takes damage from spells and attacks as normal.

*Focus:* A soft glove.
