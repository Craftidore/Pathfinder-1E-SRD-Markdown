*A golden aura spreads out from your fingertips, suffusing your ally with a golden glow that brightens, then fades into her skin.*

You surround the subject with an aura that immediately heals the creature if it is subjected to an effect that would kill it (reduce its hit points to –10 or below). When this event occurs, the *fortunate fate* spell intervenes by immediately triggering a *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* spell upon the target. If the effect is one that causes harm in a way that a *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* spell can repair (disease, hit point damage, ability damage, or poison), the target does not actually die, saved by the *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]].* If the effect is one that *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* cannot countermand (such as ability drain, old age, negative levels, disintegration, ability drain, or death effects), the *fortunate fate* spell cannot prevent the creature’s death.
