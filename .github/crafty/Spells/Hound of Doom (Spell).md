You shape the essence of the Plane of Shadow to create a powerful dog-like companion that serves you loyally for the duration of the spell. The *hound of doom* has the statistics of a dire wolf with the following adjustments: It gains a deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to your Charisma (or Intelligence) bonus, its hit points when created are equal to your full normal hit points, and it uses your base attack bonus instead of its own (adding its +7 bonus from Strength and –1 penalty from size as normal).

You can command a *hound of doom* as a move action just as if it were fully trained to perform all the tricks listed in the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill.

If a *hound of doom*’s hit points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed. A *hound of doom* is treated as a magical beast for the purpose of spells and effects, but it can also be dispelled. You can only have one *hound of doom* in existence at a time. If you cast a second *hound of doom* spell while the first is still active, the fi rst hound is instantly dispelled.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Summoner 3, Unchained Summoner 3, Wizard 3 to Level.

*House Rule:* When this spell is cast upon the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]], its duration becomes 1 hour/level (D) and adds your Intelligence or Charisma modifier to its attack and damage rolls.
