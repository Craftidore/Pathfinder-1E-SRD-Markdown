Hermea’s benevolent Council of Enlightenment uses this spell to humanely preserve their society’s greatest minds from the ravages of time, though it has seen far more sinister employment when put to use by other organizations that have since discovered its utility. This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject’s life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject’s appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory—including those the target may have forgotten long ago—are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn’t understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject’s memories—such as by a *[[Modify Memory (Spell)|modify memory]]* spell—appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]] check is needed to identify this.

Spells that modify or remove text—such as *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* or *[[Secret Page (Spell)|secret page]]*—also affect the target’s memory if they persist after its release. *[[Modify Memory (Spell)|Modify memory]]* can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book. A creature imprisoned by *scribe’s binding* automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change or modify its memories.

A target bound by this spell can be freed by only *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*. *[[Polymorph Any Object (Spell)|Polymorph any object]]* restores the target’s normal form for 24 hours. *Scribe’s binding* makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (hardness 20, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had). Destroying the tome immediately slays the creature imprisoned within.

**GM Note**

It is said that using a *[[Stasis Clone (Spell)|stasis clone]]* spell in conjunction with a *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]* spell modifies the tome so that it continually updates itself without the subject's knowledge and should the subject be destroyed it can then be restored back to life (or existence in the case of constructs, extraplanar creatures, undead, etc.) through the use of *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or another *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*; though doing so destroys the magical tome created by the *scribe's binding*. 

If the subject is not restored the 'backup' copy remains available for continued use as a source of information. If the subject is returned to life through *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]], [[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]*, etc. they may be unaware that the copy stored within the *scribe's binding* tome is still there recorded every moment of their life. 

Some organizations use this method to guarantee the well-being of their most powerful members while other more nefarious organizations use *scribe's binding* as a way of imprisoning their enemies.
