The caster’s arms turn into serpents that can be used as natural weapons. The serpents provide the caster with 10-foot reach. They have an attack bonus of +10 (plus caster’s Strength modifier) and they deal 1d8 points of damage (plus her Strength modifier).

If the caster hits with a serpent, she has poisoned her foe. The poison deals 1d6 points of Strength damage immediately and another 1d6 points of Strength damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 16).

As a full attack action, the caster can strike with both serpents at her full attack bonus.

*Corruption Cost:* 1d6 points of Intelligence damage.
