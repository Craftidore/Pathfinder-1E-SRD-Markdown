*You kneel next to your afflicted comrade and speak the soft words of this spell. At your touch a golden radiance infuses your companion.*

This spell channels positive energy into a creature to wipe away its afflictions. It immediately ends any of the following conditions affecting the subject: [[Blinded|blinded]], *[[Confused|confused]]*, [[Dazed|dazed]], [[Dazzled|dazzled]], [[Deafened|deafened]], diseased, [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], [[Frightened|frightened]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], [[Panicked|panicked]], [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Shaken|shaken]], [[Sickened|sickened]], and [[Stunned|stunned]]. It negates sleep effects and the effect of the *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]* spell, and ends any additional effects from poison, as the *[[Neutralize Poison (Spell)|neutralize poison]]* spell. It also cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

*Panacea* does not remove ability damage, negative levels, or drained levels.

Used against an undead creature, *panacea* deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw), but it has no other effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Healer 4 to Level per Miniatures Handbook.
