*A moment ago* allows you to duplicate exactly (including rolled damage) the effects of any spell previously cast that is at least one level lower than *a moment ago*. *A moment ago* only works on spells cast the previous round, and only on the most recent spell. All of the spell's choices--such as range, direction, and number of targets--are identical. If the spell being copied allowed a saving throw or spell resistance, then those saves or resistance checks are re-rolled.
