*You call upon the fortitude of the powers of good, and your flesh turns an ivory-gray hue as you draw power up through the earth itself.*

The spell grants you a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The spell ends instantly if you lose contact with the ground. This means you cannot jump, tumble, charge, run, or move more than your speed in a round (because these acts cause both of your feet to leave the ground) without breaking the spell. A natural stone wall or ceiling counts as the ground for the purpose of this spell (so you could climb a cavern wall and not lose the spell).
