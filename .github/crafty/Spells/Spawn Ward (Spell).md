# Spawn Ward (Spell)
## Overview
[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 5]], [[5th Level Inquisitor Spells|Inquisitor 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 9th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 9]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 10 minutes/level

**Save:** Fortitude negates (harmless)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

**Source:** Advanced Race Guide, pg. 101

The target becomes resistant to the effects of [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]] and [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blood drain]] attacks made by undead creatures, and cannot be made into undead spawn if killed while the spell is in effect.

If the attacking undead’s Hit Dice is less than or equal to your caster level, the [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blood drain]] or [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]] has no effect. If the attacking undead’s Hit Dice are greater than your caster level, the undead must make a Fortitude save (against the DC of the spell) with each attack for those special abilities to have any effect. The spell only prevents the Constitution damage from [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blood drain]] and negative levels from [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]], but not any other effects of these attacks.
