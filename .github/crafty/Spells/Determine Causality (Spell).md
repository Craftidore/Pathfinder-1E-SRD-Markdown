*Determine causality* allows the caster to influence the outcome of a random event so that it is more favorable for him. Any event (such as the casting of a spell with a random result) that requires a random result table roll to determine its outcome allows the caster to add or subtract up to 5% per level as they desire. The GM should consult the result table and then advise the caster as to the possible outcomes he might obtain.
