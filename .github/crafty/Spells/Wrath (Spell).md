You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the creature’s spell resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
