*Your bow glows blue for an instant and now feels as light as a feather in your hand. In your mind’s eye you see the arrows in your quiver, and your hand feels drawn to them.*

You can cast this spell only at the beginning of your turn, before you take any other actions. After casting *flurry of arrows,* you can use a full-round action to make one ranged attack with a bow with which you are proficient against every foe within a distance equal to the weapon’s range increment. You can attack a maximum number of individual targets equal to your character level. If you choose not to spend a full-round action in this fashion after casting the spell, the spell has no effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *arrow storm* to *flurry of arrows* to avoid duplication.

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4 to Level.

*House Rule:* This spell is especially favored by arcane archers and rangers.
