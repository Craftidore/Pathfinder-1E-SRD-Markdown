*Blood fog* produces a bank of thin red mist that weakens the physical resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the *blood fog* take a –10 competence penalty on Strength checks and Fortitude saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1  round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

**GM Note**

*House Rules:* Some spellcasters use the [[Spell Thematics (Feat)|Spell Thematics]] feat to alter this spell so that it appears as a faint glowing radiance instead of a thin mist. This increases the DC of a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check to identify the spell by +5.

*Spell Secret:* Using the ichor of a vampire as a material component and succeeding on a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 25) causes the *blood fog* to become persistent, ie. a creature remaining in the *blood fog* must succeed each round they remain within it or be affected by it.
