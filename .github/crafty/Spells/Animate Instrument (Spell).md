*As you finish intoning this chant, your instrument leaves your hands and floats before you, continuing your song.*

You imbue your musical instrument with the ability to play at your command. This instrument can play a tune on your behalf even while you are busy with other actions. As long as this spell is in effect, you can cause the instrument to begin playing as a swift action, effectively mimicking and continuing your performance. The instrument uses your [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] modifier for the purpose of bardic music checks.

Once the animated instrument picks up the performance, you do not have to concentrate to maintain its effect. Thus, you can continue a performance or bardic music effect that relies on the use of a musical instrument and also cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion or command words, or even use another bardic music ability.

You can animate any nonmagical musical instrument, such as a piano, fiddle, or harp. If the instrument must be carried or held while played, it floats in the air in the square in which you cast the spell. The animated instrument cannot move. It continues to play until the spell expires or the instrument is damaged. An animated instrumentâ€™s AC is 10 + any relevant size modifiers; most handheld instruments are Tiny.
