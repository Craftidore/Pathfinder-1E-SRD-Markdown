*With a shuddering gasp, you dig your nails into your flesh as though pulling the skin from your bones. A glistening wyvern appears before you.*

This spell creates a wyvern that springs forth from your body. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. You must be able to speak Draconic to communicate with the wyvern, or have some form of telepathic communication that does not require a shared language. If you can communicate with the wyvern, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The conjured creature gains bonus hit points equal to twice your caster level. If it is killed, the caster takes 2d6 points of damage.
