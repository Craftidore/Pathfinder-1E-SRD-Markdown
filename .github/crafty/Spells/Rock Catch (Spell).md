A single creature you touch gains the ability to catch hurled rocks of Small to Large size (including projectiles of a similar shape and size, such as catapult ammunition). Once per round, as an immediate action (a free action taken during another creatureâ€™s turn), when the subject of this spell would normally be hit by a rock, he can make a Reflex save to catch it. The DC for catching a Small or smaller rock is 15, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. Caught rocks must be subsequently dropped as part of the action.
