You create a slender stone pillar 2 feet in diameter and 6 feet tall. It can be square, cylindrical, hexagonal, naturallooking, or any similar shape. It must be solid and complete (without hollow spaces or secret compartments). When you create the *runic marker,* you can also have a message of up to twenty-five words inscribed upon it.

The *runic marker* also bears a *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]* (blast glyph only). In addition to the normal trigger conditions available for a *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]**,* you can set it to activate if the pillar ever takes damage from a magical effect. When the *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]* effect activates, the *runic marker* is destroyed, leaving nothing behind.
