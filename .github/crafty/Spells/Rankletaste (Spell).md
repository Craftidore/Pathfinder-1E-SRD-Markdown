This spell generates a false and powerfully wretched taste on the target. The target gives off no noticeable odor, but anyone who tastes the target must make a Will save or be [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1 round. This includes any creature that makes a successful bite attack against the target; the bite attack does not need to damage the target to force the attacker to make a Will save. A creature that swallows something affected by *rankletaste* must make the Will save each round for the spell's duration or become [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1d4 rounds. Once the creature becomes [[Nauseated|nauseated]], it vomits the swallowed creature or object up and need not make further Will saves unless it again tastes the target.
