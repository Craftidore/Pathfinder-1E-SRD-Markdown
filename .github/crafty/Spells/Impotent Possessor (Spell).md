The caster renders one creature that can possess or inhabit other creatures, or a creature that can move its mind out of its body, powerless within the host it currently inhabits. Potential targets include possessing demons, malevolent ghosts, and a caster currently using a *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* spell. The only action the subject can take is to leave the body it currently inhabits. This spell, in conjunction with *[[Imprison Possessor (Spell)|imprison possessor]]**,* is one of the best ways to deal with a possessing fiend.
