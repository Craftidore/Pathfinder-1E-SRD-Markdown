You unleash deadly explosive power, similar to the effects of a retributive strike created by breaking a *[[Power (Staff)|staff of power]]*. The spell converts any remaining spell slots in your mind into a blast of magical energy. All creatures within 10 feet of you take 8 points of damage per spell slot remaining, creatures between 11 and 20 feet take 6 points per spell slot, and creatures between 21 and 30 feet take 4 points per remaining spell slot. You take maximum damage and are allowed no saving throw.

It is widely thought that Mycontil and his assistants used this spell in a circle magic ceremony to defeat the Arkaiun barbarian chieftain, Reinhar I of Dambrath, during Dambrathâ€™s invasion of Halruaa. Mycontil and his assistants vanished after the blast and were presumed destroyed. There has been no other recorded use of the spell.

*Material Component:* The finger bone of an archmage that has been packed in diamond dust worth 5,000 gp for 1 week.

GM Note

*House Rule:* In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting this spell is known as *Mycontil's last resort.*
