*Rings of blue-white energy travel from your feet to your head and back again, vanishing lifter encircling you in their glow.*

This spell calls upon the raw natural forces within you to grant the basic instincts possessed by your ancestors. You gain a +5 competence bonus on initiative and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks.

If *primal instinct* is active on you at the same time as *[[Primal Hunter (Spell)|primal hunter]]**,* *[[Primal Senses (Spell)|primal senses]]**,* or *[[Primal Speed (Spell)|primal speed]]**, you* gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature). It all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, you also gain a +5 competence bonus on any one kind of [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] check, chosen when you cast *primal instinct*, and you are treated as trained in that skill.
