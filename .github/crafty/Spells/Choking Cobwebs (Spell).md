*You fill an area with thin, dust-laden choking strands.*

This spell covers an area in layers of clinging filaments that resemble old, dusty cobwebs. Unlike a *[[Web (Spell)|web]]* spell, the strands of a *choking cobwebs* spell need not be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points, though they can be. Unsupported cobwebs flutter in the air as through held up by a rising current.

The cobwebs block sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment.

Entering a square of cobwebs costs 2 squares of movement. A living creature that enters *choking cobwebs* falls into a fit of horrific coughing, making it [[Sickened|sickened]] for as long as it remains in the area and for 1 round after it leaves. A successful Fortitude save negates the [[Sickened|sickened]] effect, but the save must be repeated each round the creature enters or remains within the area.

If two or more *choking cobwebs* spells overlap the same area, the overlapping area of the two spells becomes a nearly impenetrable barrier of stands. In addition to the effects described above, any creature within the overlapping area has cover against adjacent creatures, and total cover against creatures more than 5 feet away. Entering a square of overlapping cobwebs costs 4 squares of movement, and a living creature within this area is [[Nauseated|nauseated]] rather than [[Sickened|sickened]] (Fortitude negates) and also takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage in each round that it is [[Nauseated|nauseated]].
