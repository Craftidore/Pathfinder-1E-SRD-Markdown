You tap the incredible complexity of the draconic Prophecy, granting creatures in the area a burst of insight powerful enough to threaten their sanity. Creatures in the area take a –2d6 penalty to Wisdom and are *[[Confused|confused]]* for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the penalty by half and negates the confusion.

*Special:* Characters with the Dragon Prophesier feat (*Magic of Eberron* 46) have immunity to the effect of this spell. Furthermore, if within the area of the spell, such a character can choose to enter prophetic favor as an immediate action. This counts as one of the character’s daily uses of prophetic favor. Characters with a dragonmark take a –2 penalty on their saving throw against this spell.
