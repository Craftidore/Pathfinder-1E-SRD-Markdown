When *delay image* is cast, the recipient is surrounded by a thin magical aura that bends time slightly, causing the person's image to appear one second behind actual motion. This gives a +2 to the creature's AC, and +1 to saves against direct magical attacks.

This spell can be used in conjunction with other armor-class-affecting spells, but it is not cumulative with itself. A fortitude save is required from an unwilling target.
