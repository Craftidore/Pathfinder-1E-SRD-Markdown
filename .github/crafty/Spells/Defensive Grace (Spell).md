# Defensive Grace (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Investigator Spells|Investigator 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 9th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 9]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a living fly)

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D; see below)

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied strike).

If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead deal normal damage.
