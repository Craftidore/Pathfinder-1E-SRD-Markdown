*As you make the final spell gesture, the look in your rival's eyes gives evidence enough of the chaos rampaging through his mind.*

You affect the subject of the spell as if by the targeted variant *of* *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**.* 

Additionally, if the subject is a spellcaster who fails a Will save, she loses one randomly determined prepared spell or spell slot from her highest level of available spells remaining. This spell or spell slot is lost as if it had been cast or used for the day.
