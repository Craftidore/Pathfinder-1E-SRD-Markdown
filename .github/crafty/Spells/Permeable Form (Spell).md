By altering the essential nature of the matter composing your body, you make yourself incorporeal for a brief time. While incorporeal, you can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with *[[Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* weapons). You can enter or pass through solid objects as described under the incorporeal subtype. Tsochar spellcasters sometimes use this spell to quickly exit an inhabited creature without causing damage to the victim.

You cannot attack while in this state, but you can perform other actions as your incorporeal nature allows.

Casting this spell is an immediate action. You can cast it even when itâ€™s not your turn. You can only take one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn.
