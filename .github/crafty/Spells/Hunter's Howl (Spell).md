With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until the end of the spellâ€™s duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them, and a +2 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]], [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks against them. If an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies, it is [[Shaken|shaken]] instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
