*You wave your hand as if a conductor and hum an uplifting tune under your breath. As the energy of the spell releases, you hear the air around you fill with the song you are humming, as if performed by a small troupe.*

This spell brings forth a stirring martial tune that inspires all creatures within the area who are friendly to you. These creatures can reroll one Will save that they have just made each round for the duration of the spell. The reroll must be made before the DM declares whether the roll results in success or failure, and the result of the second roll must be used, even if it is a lower result.
