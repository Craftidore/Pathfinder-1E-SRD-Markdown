You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The *true telekinesis* spell provides a gentle, sustained force, moving a creature or object weighing up to 1,000 lbs. per caster level up to 100 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.

Using *true telekinesis*, you can move the weight vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the spellâ€™s range. The spell ends if the target is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the target falls or stops.

You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand: You can pull levers or telekinetically manipulate a bucket to fill itself with water from a well. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a Difficulty Class set by the DM. The spell can be used to wield a weapon using a caster level check as the attack roll (ranged or melee), with a +15 bonus to the damage roll.

Lastly, the spell can be used to exert a force, such as that needed to break open a barred door or keep it closed. In such cases, the telekinetic force has a Strength modifier equal to a quarter of your level + your Intelligence modifier.
