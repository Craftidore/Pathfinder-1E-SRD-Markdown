When you cast this spell, you spit forth a cloud of icy crystals that extends outward in a cone. Creatures in the area are covered with a thin layer of ice that deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). In addition, creatures are affected by a temporary frostbite condition, making them [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save negates both the damage and the frostbite effect.
