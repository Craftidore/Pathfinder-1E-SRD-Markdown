This spell conjures a horizontal ring of swirling metal blades around you. The ring extends 5 feet from you, into all squares adjacent to your space, and it moves with you as you move. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the blades deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to all creatures in the affected area.

The blades conjured by a lawful-aligned caster are cold iron, those conjured by a chaotic-aligned caster are silver, and those conjured by a caster who is neither lawful nor chaotic are steel.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
