This spell creates an immobile, finite plane with limited accessâ€”a demiplane.

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, minor planes. A character can cast this spell only on the [[Ethereal Plane]]. When he or she casts it, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of a 1-foot-radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as the fledgling plane draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.

The character determines the environment in the demiplane when he or she first casts *planar bastion*, reflecting most any desire he or she can visualize. The caster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the general terrain. However, the spell cannot create life, nor can it create construction. If desired, these must be brought in by some other means.

Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the character can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane if he or she is inside the boundaries of the demiplane. In such a case, the radius of the demiplane increases by 60 feet for each subsequent casting.

A second casting of this spell in the same demiplane gives an enhanced magic trait keyed directly to your own spells. All spells you cast while you are in the planar bastion demiplane are treated as they were maximized as long as their effects are local to the demiplane and do not extend beyond its borders.

A third casting of this in the same demiplane may also be used to alter the demiplane's traits to give it the highly alterable morphic planar trait while you are present, allowing you to change the appearance and environment of the plane with a very thought. The demiplane altered in this way responds directly to your thoughts and emotions, taking on physical form in reaction to your own desires. Although you may not create life in this way, you can create structures out of elemental matter or control the effects of weather.

A fourth (and any subsequent) castings of this spell in the same demiplane allow you to add a [[Planar|planar trait]] to the *planar bastion.*

If the spell is cast again while outside an existing demiplane, the casting creates a separate bubble that does not touch or overlap any previously created demiplane.

This spell is almost an exact duplicate of *[[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]]*, however it has one significant difference. Unlike most spells in the Pathfinder game setting, this spell has an experience point cost rather than an expensive material component. This cost may be paid by the caster, others using the *[[Crafter's Gift (Spell)|crafter's gift]]* spell, through the use of *soul gems* (which is an evil act) or possibly other means.
