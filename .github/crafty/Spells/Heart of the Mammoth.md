The target creature becomes stronger, hardier, and imbued with the courage of the greatest megafauna of the tundra. The spell grants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, immunity to fear, a +4 morale bonus to Will saves, and doubles the critical threat range of all its attacks against creatures of the dragon type (this does not stack with Improved Critical, *keen edge*, or similar effects).
