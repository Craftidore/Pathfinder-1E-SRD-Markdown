You pluck an arrow that has damaged you and shoot it back at your attacker. You needn’t be able to see your attacker—you don’t even need to know its location. After casting this spell, shoot the arrow into the air; the winds of vengeance propel it back toward its point of origin. The arrow always strikes its target, regardless of distance or intervening obstacles. The spell fails only if the target is warded against [[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]] or is located on another plane.

The avenged wound must be fresh—less than 1 hour old. The spell allows the caster to easily extract the arrow in a usable condition. When it strikes its target, it does its normal arrow damage in addition to the damage you originally suffered from it.
