*Acid fog* creates a billowing mass of misty vapors like the *[[Solid Fog (Spell)|solid fog]]* spell. In addition to slowing down creatures and obscuring sight, this spellâ€™s vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it.

**Mythic Rule**

The damage dealt increases to 4d6 points of acid damage. This spell otherwise functions like *mythic solid fog*, as described in Chapter 3 of *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures.*

*Augmented (3rd):* If you expend two uses of mythic power, each round as a move action you may cause the *mythic acid fog* to dissipate and reform up to 40 feet away. You may choose for the *mythic acid fog* to deal damage before or after you move it, but not both.

**Source:** Mythic Magic: Core Spells (Legendary Games), pg. 4

**GM NOTE**

The effects created by this spell do not move with a ship, but they do reduce the speed of a ship moving through them to half.

Added Magus 6, Unchained summoner 6 to Level.
