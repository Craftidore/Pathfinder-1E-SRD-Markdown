# Stunwave (Spell)

**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)

**Range:** Close (25 ft + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Source:** Sharn, City of Towers (WotC), pg. 168

Even if a battle is for a just cause, using a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* on a crowded city street places innocents at risk. The *stunwave* spell creates a burst of concussive force

that disorients victims without causing any permanent damage, dealing 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to every creature within the area and dazes them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the [[Dazed|dazed]] effect. The *stunwave* has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage cannot be dazed by the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *shockwave* to *stunwave* to avoid duplication.
