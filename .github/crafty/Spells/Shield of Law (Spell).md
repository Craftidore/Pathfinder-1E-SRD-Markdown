A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and *slowing* chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike *[[Protection From Chaos (Spell)|protection from chaos]]*, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as *[[Protection From Chaos (Spell)|protection from chaos]]* does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is *slowed* (Will save negates, as the *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* spell, but against *shield of law*â€™s save DC).
