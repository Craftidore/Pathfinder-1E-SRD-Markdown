*You summon forth semisolid shadowstuff and force it to coalesce into a shape only you can wield. The shadow-formed weapon looks real at first glance, though it appears darkened as if perpetually in shadows. Wisps of shadow tendrils constantly follow the weapon as you move it about.*

Using material from the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]], you can fashion a quasi-real melee weapon of any type with which you are proficient. This *spectral weapon* appears in your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of its type, with two exceptions. First, you resolve attacks with your *spectral weapon* as melee touch attacks instead of melee attacks. Second, any foe you hit is entitled to a Will save to recognize the weapon’s shadowy, semi-insubstantial nature. If the save is successful, that opponent takes only half damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 50% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon).

You can maintain only one *spectral weapon* at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell’s duration expires, whichever comes first.
