You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the spell’s area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity (*Core Rulebook* 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. *Alter winds* has no effect on magical wind effects.


| **Caster Level** | **Wind Force** |
|---|---|
| 1st–3rd | Light |
| 4th–9th | Moderate |
| 10th–15th | Strong |
| 16th or higher | Severe |
