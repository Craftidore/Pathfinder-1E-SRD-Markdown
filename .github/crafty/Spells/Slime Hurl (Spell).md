You conjure and hurl three roughly spherical globs of dark green slime. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target with a slime glob (roll separately for each glob, using your best ranged attack bonus). Any creature struck by a glob is coated in a patch of green slime and begins to experience its effects immediately. You can hit a creature with multiple globs, each of which must be dealt with separately. The conjured green slime does not disappear automatically and must be destroyed in the normal way.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: Level changed to Cleric 5, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Ghaunadaur 5.
