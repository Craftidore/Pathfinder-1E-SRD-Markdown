This spell transforms a willing creature into an animal, humanoid or elemental of your choosing; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures, nor can the creature being targeted by this spell influence the new form assumed (apart from conveying its wishes, if any, to you verbally).

If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, the spell functions as *[[Beast Shape II (Spell)|beast shape II]]*. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as *[[Elemental Body I (Spell)|elemental body I]]**.* If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as *[[Alter Self (Spell)|alter self]]*. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject.

**GM Note**

**Can you become advanced versions of creatures with polymorph (PH 263), or just the most basic as presented in the Monster Manual?**

The rules don’t explicitly prevent this, but for speed of play (and reasons of sanity) it’s entirely reasonable for a DM to disallow any forms other than those detailed in the Monster Manual (or other allowed volumes of monsters). If the DM chooses to allow advanced creatures, the player must supply full statistics for the advanced version before play begins. Remember that the Hit Die limit for the various polymorph spells still applies (a 7th-level wizard can’t use polymorph to assume the form of a 10-HD advanced sahugin).

**Can you use polymorph to turn into a creature with a template?**

Again, the rules don’t explicitly prevent this—and in fact, some creatures whose forms are possible to assume with shapechange (such as vampires) only exist as templated creatures—but a player who wants to use this option is responsible for providing full statistics for the templated creature to avoid slowing game play. As always, you must still abide by the rules for the spell in question (for example, an elf wizard can’t use *[[Alter Self (Spell)|alter self]]* to become a half-dragon orc, since that a dragon, not a humanoid).

***[[Alter Self (Spell)|Alter self]]***** (PH 197), the base spell in the polymorph chain, says that the new form must be within one size category of your normal size. Is the same true of other spell in the chain?**

Not necessarily, although the rules aren’t as clear as they could be. Polymorph, and any spell that refers back to it (such as *[[Polymorph Any Object (Spell)|polymorph any object]]*), allows the new form to be of any size of Fine or greater. *[[Shapechange (Spell)|Shapechange]]* specifically delineates its size limitations (Fine to Colossal), which is a much clearer way of saying the same thing.

**What happens to the equipment worn and carried by a character polymorphed into another creature capable of wearing and carrying the same gear? What if the new creature’s size is different?**

Unless stated otherwise, all spells in the polymorph chain function as described in the *[[Alter Self (Spell)|alter self]]* spell description, which states that if the new form is capable of wearing or holding the item, it remains worn or held; otherwise it melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. A human polymorphed into another Medium humanoid-shaped form (such as an elf, grimlock, or bearded devil) can wear or hold all his gear, so it remains in place.

However, this is one of those times when size definitely matters, since your gear doesn’t automatically change size as a result of polymorph (see earlier question). Assuming the new form has appropriate body locations—for instance, a human polymorphed into a troll or a pixie—most of your magic items (rings, cloaks, boots, and other items of magic clothing or jewelry) still fit just fine regardless of your new size (see “Size and Magic Items” on page 213 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Nonmagical clothing and accoutrements that don’t fit the new size meld into the character’s body when he is polymorphed. (The Sage recommends that DMs err on the side of leniency when determining what the new form can or can’t wear.)

Similarly, armor (even magic armor) doesn’t resize to fit wearers of different sizes. The human described above loses the benefit of his +1 full plate armor as it melds into his body, even though the new form is capable of wearing armor.

As long as your new form is capable of holding weapons (that is, it has hands or other similarly dexterous extremities), you hold on to whatever weapons you had before the change. However, since the weapons are no longer of a size appropriate to you, you take a penalty on attack rolls with them as described on page 113 of the Player’s Handbook. A human polymorphed into a troll can still hold his Medium weapons (although they’re now one size category too small for optimal use and thus he’ll suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls).

On the plus side, he can now wield that Medium greatsword with only one hand, meaning he could pick up a shield or a second weapon to wield simultaneously.

**Does a character’s gear change size if his size changes as the result of a polymorph spell?**

No. If the spell had this effect, it would specifically say so (see *[[Enlarge Person (Spell)|enlarge person]]*, PH 227 for an example).

If your barbarian is regularly polymorphed into a troll or stone giant, you might want to consider carrying an extra Large weapon for use in those situations.

**If my goliath is polymorphed into a stone giant, can he wield Huge weapons? What if the wizard just casts** ***[[Enlarge Person (Spell)|enlarge person]]***** on him instead?**

No and no. *[[Alter Self (Spell)|Alter self]]*, the base spell for the polymorph chain, states that you lose any extraordinary special attacks or qualities “from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.” Since powerful build is an extraordinary quality derived from your form (it’s a racial trait), it’s lost when you take a new form. (The same is true of half-giants who also have this trait.) The powerful build trait
