*Through an act of will and the utterance of a terrible word of power, you sacrifice a bit of your own life in order to open visible, blood red conduits through which you siphon off the life of others, capturing their very souls if they die.*

When cast, this spell opens a blood red conduit to a sentient, living creatures which have either souls or spirts. It can do so up to a number of creatures equal to one creature per caster level. This spell creates a blood red line of effect to each creature affected which causes 1d10 + 1/caster level points of damage per round for a number rounds equal to the caster's level. If the spell slays a target, its vital essence is captured and coalesces into a soulshard (a precious, ruby‐colored gem that pulsates with an inner light) which appears in the hand of the caster. If the caster has no free hand, it drops to the ground in front of him.

If the caster is slain or moves beyond the range of the spell, the spell ends immediately for all targeted creatures. Any effect (such as *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* or *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*) or object which breaks the line of effect also ends this spell. A target creature may end the spell with regard to itself by moving beyond its range. Concealment (to include *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*) does not terminate this spell, and only complete cover will do so.

A creature slain by this spell cannot be contacted via a *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* spell or similar effect unless the soulshard created at the time of their death is held by the caster while contacting them.

Those slain by *mass soul drain* cannot be returned to life by *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]**,* *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*, *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* or other means unless the soulshard created by the creature's death is used as a material component for the spell that returns them to life. A *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* can return them to life and complete health even without the soulshard.
