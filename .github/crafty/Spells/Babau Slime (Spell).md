*You press the viscous ball of demon sweat between your fingers and speak the eldritch words. Your flesh and equipment begin to weep hot red tears that quickly form a coating over your body.*

This demon-inspired transmutation causes the subject to secrete a slimy red layer of jelly that coats its skin, armor, and equipment. A creature that strikes a slime-protected subject with an unarmed strike, a touch attack (including a touch spell), or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage. Any creature in a grapple with the target of *babau slime* takes 1d8 points of acid damage at the beginning of its turn.

*Arcane Material Component:* A drop of babau slime.
