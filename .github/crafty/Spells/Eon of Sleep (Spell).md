*Eon of sleep* plunges the victim in to a deep and dreamless sleep that lasts for years. Upon casting, the spellcaster specifies a particular condition that allows a person to wake up: the kiss of a princess, 100 years of sleep, an enemy to be dead for 5 years, etc.. A sleeping person ages only one year for every five that they sleep.

Every year, on the anniversary of the casting of *eon of sleep*, the victim gets another Will saving throw at the initial DC +1 for each year spent asleep. If the save succeeds, the victim is aware of his sleeping state and can choose to wake up despite the preconditions set by the caster or remain in the magical slumber for another year or more.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Zurlein's eon of sleep* to *eon of sleep* for campaign continuity.
