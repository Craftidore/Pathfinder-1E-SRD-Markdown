*Your subject's skin splits open, revealing wood and bark. Leaves sprout from his limbs even as he starts to grow.*

You transform the subject of the spell into a Huge oak tree. For a number of days equal to your caster level, that oak tree animates as a treant (though it can't animate trees) and serves as you command. You can either command it to follow you, or you can leave it somewhere with a triggering phrase as described in the *[[Liveoak (Spell)|liveoak]]* spell. When the spell's duration expires, the subject becomes in all respects a normal tree, taking root where it stands if capable.

A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is instead *slowed* (as the spell) as his body fights off the transformation from within. When the spell's duration expires, the subject returns to normal.
