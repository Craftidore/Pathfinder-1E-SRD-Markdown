*You close your eyes, and instantly the area around the chosen object comes into focus.*

You enspell a small object to serve as a magic sensor, much like that created by *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance (Spell)|clairaudience/clairvoyance]]**.* Once you have touched the object and cast the spell, you have up to 1 hour/level to activate the magic, thus enabling you to plant the object in a location and then move to a different spot to spy on that location. Once you have activated the magic—that is, once you begin actually using the magic sensor to see—the spell lasts for 1 minute/level, or until you choose to end it. This spell otherwise functions as *clairvoyance.* If the object is moved, your sight moves with it, but the spell ends if the stone passes out of range.

*Focus:* Depending on your chosen element, you must use one of the following as a focus: a stone (earth), a lump of charcoal (fire), a piece of metal (metal), a puddle of water (water), or a chunk of wood (wood). In each case, the object must weigh between 1/2 and 1 pound. The focus is also the target of the spell.
