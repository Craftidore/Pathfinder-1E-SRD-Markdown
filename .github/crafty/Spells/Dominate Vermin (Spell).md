*The creature’s eyes change color to match your own. It trembles for a moment as it adjusts to your psychic presence.*

You invest your psyche into a single vermin creature, granting it your Intelligence. While it is so affected, you can direct it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Since you are in absolute control of the creature, it even follows suicidal commands.

You can continue to direct the vermin as long as it remains within range. You need not see it to control it. Changing your instructions or giving a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

If the vermin is slain, your mind is forced out of the creature violently. The experience deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to you.
