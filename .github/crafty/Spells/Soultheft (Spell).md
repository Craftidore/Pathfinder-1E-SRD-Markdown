Crackling black radiance surrounds your left hand. While the spell lasts, you can make touch attacks to steal the lifeforce of another creature in a manner that heals and renews you, diluting diseases and poisons, and prolonging your life span.

With a successful melee touch attack, you drain 1d4 points of Intelligence from the victim touched. This is permanent ability drain. For every point of Intelligence drained, you heal 5 points of damage. Healing in excess of your normal maximum is retained as temporary hit points that fade after 1 hour. In addition, you receive an immediate Fortitude save against any diseases or poisons currently ravaging your body when you drain a foe’s Intellligence, as long as the disease or poison in question allowed a Fortitude save in the first place. The DC for this saving throw is the same as the DC of the original effect that poisoned or infected you, and there is no penalty if you fail this new saving throw.

If a victim is reduced to 0 Intelligence as a result of this spell, it dies. A victim slain in this manner is forever dead and cannot be brought back by *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]*, *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]*, or similar magic unless used in conjunction with a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*. When you slay a victim in this manner, you do not age for a number of days equal to the number of points of Intelligence drained. If the victim was a spellcaster, the gain in lifespan is increased by the sum of the spell levels prepared by or available to the victim at the time of death. If the victim was a psion, the gain in lifespan is increased by a number of days equal to the victim’s power point reserve.

*Soultheft* lasts for 1 round per level, during which time you can attempt touch attacks as often as once per round. Some users of this spell arrange for the victim to be restrained or otherwise helpless, so that they can be easily drained for multiple rounds.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Ensul's soultheft* to *soultheft* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Ensul's soultheft* in the Forgotten Realms.
