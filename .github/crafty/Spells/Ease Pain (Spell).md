*Ease pain* immediately removes any lingering effects of pain, including penalties imposed by *[[Symbol of Pain (Spell)|symbol of pain]]**,* *[[Angry Ache (Spell)|angry ache]]**,* and similar spells. It does not heal any damage or other effects not directly related to pain.

If the target creature is under some effect that causes continuing damage, the pain is eased only for a moment. *Ease pain* cannot bypass the need for a Concentration check to cast a spell under such circumstances, nor can it allow a creature subject to *[[Death by Thorns (Spell)|death by thorns]]* to act normally (since the spellâ€™s damage is ongoing).
