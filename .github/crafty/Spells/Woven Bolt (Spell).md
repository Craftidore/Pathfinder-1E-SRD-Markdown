You summon an amount of elemental energy and weave it into the blast from your Eldritch Bolt discipline. This attack inflicts +1d6 points of either fire damage (if fire) or impact damage (if air, earth, or water) plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every four caster levels.

This spell is cast at the same time as you launch an Eldritch Bolt. It is a free action that can be used only on your turn, and never more than once per round. It cannot be used on the same round as a quickened spell or a quickened discipline.
