You can overhear the telepathic conversations of other creatures within the spell’s area. *Telepathy tap* does not allow you to detect the uncommunicated thoughts of creatures or understand conversations spoken in languages you do not comprehend.

In an area where numerous telepathic conversations are occurring at the same time, you must specify the creatures you wish to overhear during a given round. You can separate and decipher the telepathic messages of a number of creatures equal to 1 + your Intelligence bonus.

*Telepathy tap* does not allow you to overhear the telepathic conversations of creatures protected by a *[[Mind Blank (Spell)|mind blank]]* spell, nor does it grant the ability to telepathically communicate with other creatures.

*Sacrifice:* 1d3 points of Strength damage.
