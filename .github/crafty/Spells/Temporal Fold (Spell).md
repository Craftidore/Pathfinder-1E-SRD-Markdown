You bend and fold time, causing two rounds to pass for you for each one of regular time. Everything around you slows down, while you move at regular speed. During this time you may do whatever you normally could in two rounds for each round that passes, essentially doubling all attacks, movement, spellcasting actions, etc. Any effect on you with a duration passes more quickly as well.

During this spell's duration, the stress and strain placed on you by this unnatural manipulation of time may cause you to be damaged. Each round during this spell's duration, make a Fortitude save with a DC of 15 + the number of rounds in real time the spell has elapsed. On a missed saving throw, you suffer 1d8 damage per round that has passed cumulative, ie., 1d8 in the first round, 3d8 (1 + 2) in the second round, 6d8 (1 + 2 + 3) in the 3rd round, etc. To observers, wounds appear on your body from out of nowhere.
