*You admonish your chosen subject even  as you offer a supportive slap on the back. With that simple action, you complete the spell and see in your target a realization of its new abilities.*

You briefly grant some bard abilities to a creature of your choice. The subject of the spell can then function as a bard of one-half your current bard level with respect to bardic music and bardic knowledge. However, *protégé* imparts no spellcasting ability and does not grant access to spells not normally available to the subject. For [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] checks and bardic music prerequisites, the creature uses its own ranks in [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] or one-half of your ranks (modified by its own Charisma modifier), whichever is better.
