A shaft of roiling white vapor extends from your hand. You handle this beam almost as is if wielding a spear (gaining the benefit of any feats that apply, such as [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] or [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]]). Attacks you make with the cloud spear are melee touch attacks. The cloud spear cannot leave your hand while the spell lasts. A *cloud spear* deals 1d8 points of piercing damage on a successful hit, +1 per two caster levels (maximum of +7). Since the spear is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. Any creature that takes damage from a *cloud spear* must make a Fortitude save to resist being transformed into white vapor for 1 round. A creature so transformed is treated as if under the effects of a *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]* spell, but cannot move or voluntarily return to solid form.

Creatures with the Earth subtype take 2d6 points of damage, +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum of +15) when hit by a *cloud spear*, and they take a -2 penalty on saves against the *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]* effect.
