*You stand at the edge of the canyon and invoke the power. At your feet appears a thin black bridge that arches over the canyon.*

You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable bridge. A *dark way* must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on a *dark way* without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor.

A *dark way* can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on a *dark way* to exceed this limit fall through it as if it weren’t there. You never fall through a *dark way* unless your own weight exceeds the spell’s maximum capacity.
