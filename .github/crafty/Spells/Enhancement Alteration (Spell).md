This spell has two distinct versions, both involving an alteration of an existing enhancement bonus. If you imbue a shield with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to shield bash attacks made with the shield instead of to the wielder’s shield bonus to Armor Class. You can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion.

If you imbue a weapon with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to the wielder’s Armor Class if he chooses to fight defensively, uses the total defense action, uses the [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]] feat, or uses the weapon in his off hand and has the [[Two-Weapon Defense (Feat)|Two-Weapon Defense]] feat. The enhancement bonus you shift no longer applies to the wielder’s attack rolls and damage rolls with the weapon. As with the shield version, you can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion.

If the weapon or shield is attended, the wielder can make a Will saving throw to negate the effect.
