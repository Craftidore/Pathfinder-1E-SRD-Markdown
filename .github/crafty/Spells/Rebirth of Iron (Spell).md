*Flecks of rust melt together and lose their ruddy hue. The metal creaks as it re-forms and straightens itself.*

You instantly restore a single metal object that has been damaged or destroyed by rust. This works even if the object has been reduced to powder, such as by the *[[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]]* spell. Even if the object is partly missing, such as one partially consumed by a rust monster, the spell functions as long as at least 1/4 of the object remains.

This spell does not restore the magical properties of any magic item or construct destroyed by rust. A slain or destroyed metallic creature such as an iron golem is restored in physical form, but it remains “dead,” having lost all magical qualities.
