*You complete the spell and blow into the leather glove. Immediately a blue-white, translucent hand appears next to the enemy and smacks it across the side of the headâ€”not enough to hurt it, but hard enough to give others nearby a chance to attack.*

This spell distracts the subject, causing it to immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its space. The spell allows no saving throw, but a slapped creature can negate the effect with a DC 20 Concentration check.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the world of Greyhawk campaign, this spell is known as *Bigby's slapping hand*.
