*By presenting your weapon with an overly dramatic flourish and calling out with a sickly-sounding moan, you complete the spell. As you do so, your weapon becomes translucent almost to the point that you cannot see it, though it still weighs as heavily in your hand.*

While this spell is in effect, your melee attacks are resolved as melee touch attacks rather than normal melee attacks.

**GM Note**

Note: Sage Advice, Dragon Magazine #355, pg. 79:

**Does ghost touch armor protect against *wraithstrike*?**

   No. The *[[Ghost Touch (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* armor property allows you to add the armorâ€™s enhancement bonus and armor bonus to AC against the attacks of incorporeal creatures, but not all touch attacks (as noted in the FAQ). Despite the name of the spell, *wraithstrike* does not turn you into an incorporeal creature.
