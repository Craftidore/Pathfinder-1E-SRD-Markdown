*As you finish casting the spell on yourself, a mild ringing arises inside your head that changes pitch depending on the locations of objects and creatures around you.*

The subject gains augmented nonvisual senses out to a distance of 90 feet. The subject does not need to make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5: Spot or Listen) checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 90 feet, provided that it has line of effect to that creature.

This sense is so perfectly tuned that there is no miss chance when attacking foes that would normally be concealed and the recipient of this spell is not denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see visually.

Unlike *sense of the dragon* this spell may not be made permanent by any means short of a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*.
