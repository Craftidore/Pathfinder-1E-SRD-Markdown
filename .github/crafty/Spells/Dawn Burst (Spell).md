*A globe of brilliant radiance erupts silently, as though the light of dawn had arisen.*

All creatures in the area glow with light equivalent to a torch for the duration of the spell, making hiding difficult and even revealing the location of invisible creatures. (Invisible creatures are still considered to have concealment.)

In addition, undead and creatures within the area that have light sensitivity or light blindness take 1d6 points of damage, +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +5). A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Any creature affected by this spell attempting a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check takes a -20 penalty for the duration.
