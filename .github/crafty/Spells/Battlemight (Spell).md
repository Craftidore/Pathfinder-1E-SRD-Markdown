You or a touched creature gain a flickering aura of countless tiny, whirling, gold-and-silver bolts that provides a + 2 armor bonus to AC (this aura doesnâ€™t slow or hamper movement). You can confer this protection directly to another touched individual, or you can enjoy it yourself for part of the spell duration and then transfer it (as a swift action) by touching another creature and passing it to them.

You can regain the aura at the end of any round during which you touch an affected creature, though only one creature can claim the effect at any time. Unlike normal armor bonuses, the bonus to AC that battlemight provides stacks with other AC bonuses, but the bonus does not stack with itself. If you or any recipient of battlemight is wielding a magical weapon in combat, battlemight grants you a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls.
