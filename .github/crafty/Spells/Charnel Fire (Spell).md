With sinister flame and brimstone, the caster completely consumes one dead body so that absolutely nothing remains. A creature whose body is destroyed by a *charnel fire* spell can only be brought back to life through a *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell. If this spell is cast upon a corporeal undead, the creature gets a Will saving throw, and the caster must overcome its spell resistance (if any). If the undead creature fails its save, it is destroyed forever.
