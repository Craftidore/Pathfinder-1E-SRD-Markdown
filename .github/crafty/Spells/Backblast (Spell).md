Though this spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Faerûn, it has since been stolen by spellcasters of other races and can now be found in grimoires across Faerûn. *Backblast* protects you in the same manner as the *[[Spell Turning (Spell)|spell turning]]* spell, except that it turns only spells with the fire descriptor that are targeted on you. Effect and area spells are unaffected, as is any spell with a range of touch. The DM secretly rolls 1d4+2 to determine the total number of spell levels that can be turned. *Backblast* otherwise follows the rules for the *[[Spell Turning (Spell)|spell turning]]* spell.

In addition to the above, *backblast* grants you fire resistance 10. This effect persists until the end of the round in which the spell turning effect ends.
