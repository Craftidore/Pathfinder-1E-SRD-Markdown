*Smoke conduit* creates a magical conduit up to 1 foot in diameter and 5 feet per level long through any nonmagical material. This conduit removes all smoke, *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]*, and baneful gases, pulling them along the conduit to the other end of the tube. Each smoke conduit flows in a single direction.

*Smoke conduit* removes only smoke (including the particulate matter within it) and baneful gases, not heat or air; because of this it is often used near forges and even in existing fireplaces and hearths to increase their efficiency.

Normally *smoke conduit* must be cast on an area of solid material, creating a magical conduit (ie., the material still remains solid and non porous to everything save smoke and other gases) through it. However, *smoke conduit* can be cast within chimneys and smokestacks, creating its normal single directional flow.

A *smoke conduit* that exits into an open space deposits anything passing through it there; one that does not holds the material passing through until its duration ends and then deposits it back into the area it was originally connected to.

Casting more than one *smoke conduit* spell immediately after one another extends the reach (but not duration) of the first; in this way a caster might create a *smoke conduit* reaching several hundred feet in length.

*Smoke conduit* can be used to clear an area affected by any spell which creates either smoke or a baneful gas or vapour. It clears a 10 ft. by 10 ft. area per round until only clear air remains.

Clever spellcasters sometimes install a *smoke conduit* for use as an escape route via *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]* or similar magics. Others (particular those that are undead) have created sealed chambers filled with poisonous gases from which escape can be most difficult.

*Smoke conduit* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. Permanent *smoke conduits* must empty into an open area of some sort.
