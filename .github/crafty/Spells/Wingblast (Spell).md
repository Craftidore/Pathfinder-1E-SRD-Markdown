*Hazy wings of mist form at your sides. bearing you aloft. At your command, the wings transform into a great blast of wind or a cloud of fog.*

When you cast this spell, large wings of mist—resembling those of a dragon of your choice—form on your back. You can fly at a speed equal to your base land speed (maximum 60 feet) with good maneuverability. You can fly it carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor.

As a swift action, you can choose to transform the wings into one of the two effects given below. In either case, doing this immediately ends the spell's duration (if you are flying when this occurs, you fall).

- A 60-foot-long line-shaped gust of severe wind (as the *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* spell; a Fortitude save negates the effect and spell resistance applies). 
- A 20-foot-radius cloud of fog centered on you (as the *[[Obscuring Mist (Spell)|obscuring mist]]* spell; no save or spell resistance applies). The cloud created lasts for 1 minute.
