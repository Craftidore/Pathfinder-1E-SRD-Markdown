When you place specially prepared stones on the ground and speak a command to conclude the casting of this spell, the stones transform into creatures that look and fight just like liths (Chapter 6, *Underdark*). These stoneborn creatures are not true liths, however; they cannot converse with actual liths or use any of a lith’s psionic powers.

These stone-born liths defend you and obey any spoken commands. When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, a stone-born lith crumbles to powder, and the prepared stone used to create it is destroyed. Otherwise, the stone-born liths revert to prepared stones when the duration of the spell expires, and these stones can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The stone-born liths are always at full strength when created, despite any damage they may have taken the last time they appeared.

You can prepare up to one stone per four caster levels, to a maximum of five stones at 20th level. A stone can remain prepared indefinitely; the spell isn’t actually cast until you complete it by changing the stone into a lith.

*Focus:* The requisite number of stones, which must be specially prepared. The materials for polishing and smoothing each stone cost 200 gp. Once the stones are prepared, you must perform a rite of purification that requires one day per stone. You cannot adventure or engage in any other strenuous activity during the purification process.
