*With the sound of twisting wood, the weapon you touch grows sharp spikes like rose thorns.*

For the duration of the spell, the weapon deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus on its attacks and also gains a +1 enhancement bonus per caster level on melee damage rolls (maximum +10). This spell works only on melee weapons with wooden striking surfaces. For instance, it does not work on a bow, an arrow, or a metal mace.

**GM Note**

*Note:* Sage Advice, Dragon Magazine #331, pg. 80:

**What kind of damage does a slashing wooden weapon (such as a longsword crafted with the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* spell) deal if I cast *brambles* (Complete Divine 156) on it? What about a piercing wooden weapon?**

The *brambles* spell description assumes that the spell is being cast on a bludgeoning weapon (all example weapons are bludgeoning), so when it is says “the weapon deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage” it means that the weapon’s damage is now treated as piercing damage in addition to its normal type of damage.

However, the spell can be cast on any wooden weapon, not just a bludgeoning weapon. A slashing weapon that gained this effect would deal slashing and piercing damage. A piercing weapon that gained this effect would only deal piercing damage.

**Do the bonuses granted by *brambles* and *spikes* (Complete Divine 156 and 181) stack?**

No and yes. The two spells each grant an enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and thus only the higher enhancement bonus (that granted by *spikes*) would apply. However the damage bonus granted by each spell is untyped and would therefore stack with each other.
