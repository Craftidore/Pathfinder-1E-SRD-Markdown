You take control of the target animal's body. For as long as you maintain concentration, you see through the animal's eyes and control over the animal's actions. You receive the input of the animal's senses and can make use of all its special attacks and qualities. You can undertake any action the animal can physically accomplish, even if the animal would normally lack the intelligence to perform the action in question. You can control the animal at a distance of up to 1 mile (the spell's range only applies when you first establish control of the animal).

If you force the animal to perform actions contrary to its nature or exceedingly dangerous (such as forcing the animal to walk off a cliff, or fly down the gullet of a dragon, for example), the animal is allowed another saving throw. Attacking

foes who are one size larger than the animal or smaller) is not exceedingly dangerous and does not provide the animal with an opportunity to make another saving throw.

While you control the animal, you are limited to a single move action every round in your own body. You can still see through your own eyes and defend yourself normally.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.

*Spell Secret:* Special animal companions such as a druid's animal companion or a wizard's familiar which already have a special bond will find it much enhanced; the duration becomes 'Concentration, up to 1 hour/level (D).
