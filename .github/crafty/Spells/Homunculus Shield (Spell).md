By casting a *homunculus shield,* the caster separates a portion of his life force in the form of a tiny magical homunculus. This construct is invisible to all but the caster and appears as a miniature version of the caster perched atop one of the caster's shoulders.

The caster can move and act normally while this spell is in effect. The magical homunculus operates as an independent spellcaster (and need not remain atop the caster's shoulder, though it must remain within 1 foot of the caster's body at all times). It can cast *arcane healing,* *[[Arcane Healing, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane healing]]**,* *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]**,* *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**,* *[[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]**, infernal healing, greater infernal healing,* *[[Resist Dweomer (Spell)|resist dweomer]]**,* *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]**,* and protective (abjuration) spells of 4th level and lower. It casts only spells from the caster's prepared spells, but any spell cast by the homunculus is cast as an immediate action. The caster selects which spells are cast by the homunculus and they are transfered to it, wiping them from the caster's memory as if they had been cast.

The homunculus has 1 hp per two levels of the caster. These points are 'borrowed' from the caster; while the homunculus is present, the caster's hit points are reduced by this amount.

The homunculus cannot be struck by melee or missile weapons separately from the caster. It can be damaged separately (for example, by a *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* targeted at the homunculus or by area effect spells). The homunculus uses the saving throws (to include modifications by attributes and from magical items and effects) of the caster.

At the end of the spell's duration, the homunculus disappears and any hit points it had are restored to the caster. Hit points lost by the homunculus can be regained by the caster only by magical healing.

If the caster's hit points are reduced to the point where they are dead, the caster is dead even if the homunculus has hit points remaining.

A caster with an active *homunculus shield* suffers a -4 penalty to saving throws against *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* spells cast upon him due to the division of his life force.

**GM Note**

This **** spell has been updated from the second edition of D&D and was taken from the Wizard's Spell Compendium, pg. 435.
