The armor or shield you touch temporarily gains a special ability commonly found on magic armor or shields. You can choose any special ability whose market price is equivalent to a +1 bonus or up to 5,000 gp, such as *[[Fortification (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|light fortification]]* or *[[Shadow (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|shadow]]*. The armor or shield does not need to have an existing enhancement bonus, nor does it gain one when you imbue it with this infusion.
