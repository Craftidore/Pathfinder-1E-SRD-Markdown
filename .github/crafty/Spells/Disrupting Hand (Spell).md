*A small, spectral human hand springs into existence before your target. It hovers in the air, ready to deliver a backhanded blow.*

Like *[[Interposing Hand (Spell)|interposing hand]]**,* this spell creates a magical construct in the form of a human hand. The hand targets a single opponent of your choice within range. You choose this opponent as you cast the spell. You can target a different opponent with this spell by taking a move action to do so.

When the subject of *disrupting hand* attempts to cast a spell, the hand punches him. This attack causes no damage, but it forces the subject to make a Concentration check with a DC equal to this spell’s save DC. If the subject fails the check, the hand’s blow ruins his casting attempt.

The hand is about 1 foot long. It has hit points equal to half your full normal hit points, and its AC is 20 (+4 size, +6 natural). It makes saving throws using your total save bonuses and takes damage from spells and attacks as normal.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell is known as *Bigby's disrupting hand.*
