*Calling out the arcane words, you suddenly stand where your companion was, and he has taken your place, outside the reach of his foes.*

Two target creatures, of which you can be one, instantly swap positions. Both subjects must be within range. Objects carried by the creatures (up to the creaturesâ€™ maximum loads) go with them, but other creatures do not, even if they are carried. The movement is instantaneous and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
