When the spell is cast, you and any willing creatures you touch lift into the air on a magic chariot formed of cloud, then fly away in the direction you desire. You can bring one Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear and objects up to its maximum load) per four caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.

A *cloud chariot* flies at 10 miles per minute, so that you can cover a distance of 100 miles over the spellâ€™s full duration. You and your passengers feel none of the effects of this swift movement, though, and the ride is perfectly steady and calm in even the worst weather. When the spell is dismissed, the cloud settles gently to the ground and dissipates.

Should the spell duration expire while a *cloud chariot* is still aloft, the magic fails slowly, with cloud and riders floating downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If the cloud reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, and all creatures riding in it take falling damage. A *cloud chariot* descends slowly if the spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8 to Level.
