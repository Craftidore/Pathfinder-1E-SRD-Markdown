*By binding the subject to your deity, you give it the ability to crush the deity’s enemies.*

Once this spell is cast, the *zealot pact* remains dormant until the subject successfully hits a foe whose alignment is exactly opposite that of your deity. The subject’s subsequent melee attacks gain a +4 bonus and deal double damage. Once the spell is active, the subject must attack foes of opposite alignment every round if able to do so, or the spell effect ends. The subject knows which creatures within 60 feet are of opposite alignment.

If you create a *zealot pact* with a neutral deity (such as [[Obad-Hai]]), choose one alignment from among the following that triggers the *zealot pact:* lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or chaotic good.

A creature can be subject to only one *zealot pact* at a time. Casting *zealot pact* on a subject that already has an untriggered *zealot pact* voids the earlier pact.
