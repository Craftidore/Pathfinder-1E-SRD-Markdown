You ward a single ship against foundering and storm damage, making it easier to sail in dangerous weather. You add a +4 bonus on any checks made to sail in severe winds, windstorms, or gales. You also add this bonus to foundering checks and capsizing checks for that ship. This bonus improves by +1 per 4 caster levels, to a maximum of +8.

The *stormrunnerâ€™s ward* does nothing to protect the crew from the winds and green water that might roll over the side of the ship.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell may be made permanent using the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
