This spell manifests as a draping cloak of tiny, cascading stars that seem to flicker out before touching the ground. The cloak forms over the target’s existing apparel and sheds light as a torch, although this is not the mantle’s primary function.

The *starmantle* renders the wearer impervious to nonmagical weapon attacks and transforms any nonmagical weapon or missile that strikes it into harmless light, destroying it forever. Contact with the *starmantle* does not destroy magic weapons or missiles, but the *starmantle*’s wearer is entitled to a Reflex saving throw (DC 15) each time he is struck by such a weapon; success indicates that the wearer takes only half damage from the weapon (rounded down).
