You infuse one melee weapon with the power of the earth. The base damage of the weapon improves by one step (as if the weapon were one size category larger). Regardless of the weaponâ€™s normal material and damage type, the weapon deals bludgeoning damage and overcomes damage reduction as if it were made of [[Adamantine|adamantine]].

If this spell is cast on a weapon made of a different special material (such as alchemical silver), the properties of that material are replaced with those of [[Adamantine|adamantine]] for the duration of the spell.
