You bestow the soul of a great ancient spellcaster on the creature touched, giving him great skill with magic. As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the *adept spirit.* While active, the spiritâ€™s wisdom and learning provide the recipient of the spell with a +1 insight bonus to caster level and a +2 insight bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks. The *adept spirit* remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.

No creature can be the target of more than one *adept spirit* spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.

*Essentia:* For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks provided by the spirit improves by 1. (The bonus to caster level is not improved by essentia investment.)
