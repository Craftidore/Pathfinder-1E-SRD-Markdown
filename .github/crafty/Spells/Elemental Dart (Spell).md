From raw elemental matter, you form a magical dart of energy that streaks forward and strikes the target you designate. You choose to create an acid, cold, electricity, or fire dart when you cast the spell. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The dart deals 1d6 points of damage, +1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6 + 10). A creature struck by a dart can attempt a Fort save for half damage.

You can't single out specific parts of a creature to attack. Unlike *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]*, you can damage inanimate objects with an *elemental dart.*

At every odd caster level past 3rd, you gain an additional dart. You create two darts at 5th level, three at 7th level, four at 9th level, and the maximum number of five darts at 11th level or higher. You can attack with multiple darts in the same action in which you cast *elemental dart* at no penalty. If you fire multiple darts, you can have them strike a single target or several targets. a single dart can strike only one target. You must designate targets before you make attack rolls, check for spells resistance, or roll damage.

Since the darts are composed of elemental energy, they may deal greater damage against targets susceptbile to elemental damage--such as using a *fire dart* against a white dragon, for example. Additionally, it is possible to be protected against *elemental darts* by appropriate spells, such as *protection from elements, resist elements,* and the like.
