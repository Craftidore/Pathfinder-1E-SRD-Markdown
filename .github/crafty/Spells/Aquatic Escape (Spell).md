*Your arms and legs fuse with your body as bright silvery scales cover your skin.*

You take the form of a Diminutive fish. Use the statistics for the toad except for the following changes: Add the aquatic subtype, replace the land speed with a swim speed of 30 feet, remove the amphibious special quality, and replace the toad’s skills with [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] +4 and Swim +13. A fish adds its Dexterity modifier, not its Strength modifier, to Swim checks, and gains a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks due to its swim speed.

As its name suggests, this spell’s most common use is to make a quick getaway in a watery environment, but it also allows a clever druid to overcome a flooded corridor or similar obstacle.
