When this spell is cast upon a construct, it takes on more of the qualities of a living creature. The construct gains the full benefit of spells from the healing subschool.

This spell counters and dispels *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]*. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]*, both spells are dispelled and have no effect. It has no effect if cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]* or *[[Construct Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater construct essence]]*.
