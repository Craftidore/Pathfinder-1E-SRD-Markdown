When you “don” a *crown of vermin*, one thousand venomous, biting and stinging spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes apparently erupt from the very air around you. This swarm forms a living aura around you to a radius of 10 feet. You are immune to your own *crown of vermin*. The swarm goes where you go at your speed, even if you take to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water).

Each vermin in the *crown of vermin* bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or you force the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the *crown of vermin*. The vermin have damage reduction 1/+6, allowing them to affect creatures with high damage reduction. Likewise, the vermin are slightly more resistant to normal damage.

If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell’s effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.

You can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. You can completely suppress your vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell’s duration. Alternatively, you can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion you desire within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. For example, you could leave a corridor within the area free of vermin, or give a functional or fanciful shape to the mass.

The vermin cannot be wrested from your control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using your base saving throw bonuses. They gain your spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin.

You can see through your *crown of vermin* without difficulty, but you gain one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within your *crown of vermin*.
