This extract causes your beard (or your hair or eyebrows, if you don’t have a beard) to become incredibly absorbent. After drinking the extract, you may, as a standard action, pour a potion into your beard (or your hair or eyebrows) to store it for up to 24 hours At any time during those 24 hours, you may drink the potion as a swift action.

Alternatively, you may store water, ale, or any other liquid for easy retrieval. Drinking any liquid from your beard (or eyebrows) immediately ends the effect and a new extract must be imbibed to store a new potion. If you don’t have any hair on your head or face, this extract fizzles.
