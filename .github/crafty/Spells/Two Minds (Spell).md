For the duration of this spell, a wizard or sorcerer divides his consciousness into two entities that are both capable of normal mental activity. Basically, the caster doubles his nomal actions except where his actions would be limited to only having one body and one mouth. The caster may move and cast a spell at the same time with each of his minds directing one of the actions, but if the caster takes a move action while his second mind is casting a spell, he must make a Concentration check at DC 15 + spell level to succeed at the casting.

For example, a wizard under the of two *minds* might move his normal rate while casting *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* with his second mind. The [[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]] would require a Concentration check at DC 16. Then, in the second part of the same round, his first mind, which directed the move, might cast *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]**,* while his second mind took its move action. The *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* would necessitate a Concentration Check at DC 18. 

The wizard could not, however, cast both spells and then try to take two move actions, since he would be attempting to perform actions that required his one physical body and mouth to perform two different functions simultaneously. Since both *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* and *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* have verbal and somatic components, the wizard cannot perform both castings simultaneously. If he had prepared *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* with the [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]] metamagic feat and *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* with the [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]] metamagic feat, then he could cast the two simultaneously, as his mouth could supply the verbal component for one and his body the somatic component for the other. Similarly, the caster cannot use his normal movement twice at the same time at the end of his round to move twice as far; he must use one mind's move action at the start of a round and one at the end.

Clearly, the [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]] and [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]] metamagic feats are especially valuable in conjunction with *two minds,* while a *hasted* archmage with *two minds* is a terror to face.

Because his consciousness is divided and unfocused while under the effects of this spell, the caster receives a -4 circumstance penalty to saves versus mind-affecting spells.
