This spell transforms a mass of normal sand of any depth into solid glass permanently. Any creature in the sand is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area is hardened to glass. Creatures unable to escape the area become trapped and must be broken out. A creature so caught can break free by making a Strength check to break the glass or by dealing damage to the glass. Glass has hardness 1, 1 hit point per inch of thickness, and a break DC of 12, +1 per inch of thickness. A creature partially caught in the glass takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, and is unable to move. When breaking glass, a creature takes 1d6 points of damage each time it makes a successful Strength check to break free. If broken free by others, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage from broken glass. A creature trapped beneath the surface of the glass may begin to suffocate.

*Arcane Material Component:* A mixture of crushed glass and sand.
