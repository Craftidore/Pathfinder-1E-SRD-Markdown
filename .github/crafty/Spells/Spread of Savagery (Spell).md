All living creatures within the area become hostile to anyone not affected by the spell, whether in or out of the area, and regardless of alignment or former association. They are likely to attack such creatures, although they retain their intellect and thus retreat or avoid opponents obviously too powerful for them to overcome. 

Affected creatures are likely to continue with their normal activities until presented with someone not affected by the spell. Subjects of *spread of savagery* can identify unaffected creatures by sight through an instinctive, supernatural sense granted by the spell.

*Arcane Material Component:* Three drops of brain fluid from a beast.
