*With a rush of sinister green light, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from a bearded devil to fuel the spell.*

You cause the target to grow a long, ropy mass of callused tissue from its chin that vaguely resembles a beard. This beard flails about as though it were alive. If the subject successfully hits an adjacent opponent with at least one melee attack in a round, it also automatically hits with its beard, dealing an extra 2d8 points of damage.

The subject also gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the bearded devil*).

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *evil outsider* *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* special ability have full effect against the target of the investiture.

After the spellâ€™s duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
