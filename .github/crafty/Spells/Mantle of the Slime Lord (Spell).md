This spell causes a glossy nimbus of energy to surround you. This barrier looks like a gelatinous layer of thick, dirty water to observers, but it does not hinder you in the least. While the mantle is active, nonintelligent oozes will not attack you unless you attack them. In addition, you gain immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. Lastly, when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 75% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: Lvl changed to Cleric 7, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Ghaunadaur 7.
