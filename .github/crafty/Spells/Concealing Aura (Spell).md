*As the final gestures of the spell are completed, your entire body blurs and twists to the eyes of any onlookers and the sound of your voice becomes somewhat garbled and distorted.*

The creature touched is cloaked in a distorting glamer that causes its features and to some extant what it is saying and doing to be more difficult to discern.

While the concealing aura is in effect, the target creature receives a +5 arcane bonus to oppose any [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] ( v3.5: Listen or Spot) checks made against him. Additionally, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks to identify a spell being cast by the target while the *concealing aura* is in effect have their DC increased by +10. This reflects the distortion of both sight and sound caused by this glamer.

Spells (cf. *[[Spell Theft (Spell)|spell theft]]*) or items (cf. *[[Spell-Battle (Ring)|ring of spell battle]]*) which automatically identify spells being cast or in effect are must make a successful caster level check (10 + caster level of the *[[Spell Theft (Spell)|spell theft]]* or similar item/effect) versus the caster of the *concealing aura* in order to function properly.

**GM Note**

This spell is commonly known as *Nystul's concealing aura* in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting.
