*You utter a harsh incantation and point a finger at the target. Suddenly, your foe’s dragonmark begins to writhe and separate from its body.*

If the target fails its save, its dragonmark is stripped away for the spell’s duration. The affected subject cannot use any of its dragonmarked spell-like abilities (or other abilities that rely on dragonmarks) during this time.

If the target creature’s dragonmark is one step more powerful than yours, the creature gains a +2 bonus on its Will save. If the target creature’s dragonmark is two steps more powerful than yours, the creature gains a +4 bonus on its save.

*Material Component:* A pinch of Eberron dragonshard dust.

*Dragonmark:* Any true or aberrant dragonmark.
