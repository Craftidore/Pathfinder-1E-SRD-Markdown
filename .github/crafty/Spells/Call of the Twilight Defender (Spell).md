*The very ground erupts in a shower of stone and dirt, accompanied by a thunderclap. Standing in the center of the damaged ground is a creature of stone, wood, and plant parts resembling (lie regal form of a guardian dragon.*

This spell summons one twilight guardian to fight for you. The spell functions like a *summon natures ally* spell, but with one exception. At any time, a summoned twilight guardian can sacrifice itself by simply touching you (a standard action); the twilight guardian is immediately destroyed, and you gain a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the twilight guardian's remaining hit points before its sacrifice.

*Special:* A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks.
