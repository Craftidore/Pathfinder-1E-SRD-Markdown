# Ring of Lava (Spell)
## Overview

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Components:** V, S, M (a disc of basalt (5 gp))

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect:** 10-ft.-radius area of lava; see text

**Duration:** 1 round/2 levels

**Saving Throw:** Reflex partial

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Exemplars of Evil (WotC)­, pg. 28

*You utter deep, rumbling tones as you make arcane gestures over the basalt disc, causing it to glow white hot and evaporate in your hand. When you finish, the ground tears open and hot lava wells up from the depths of the earth.*

You create an area of lava. All creatures in the area that make successful Reflex saves take 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1 point per caster level. Creatures that fail their saves take 1d6 points of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 20d6 points. Creatures that take at least 1 point of damage from *ring of fire* take an extra 1d6 points of fire damage each round for 3 rounds.

Each round after the first, the area of lava expands by 10 feet, becoming a 20-foot-radius ring on the second round, a 30-foot-radius ring on the third round, and so on. As the *ring of lava* spreads, all creatures in its area must make new saving throws as described above.

When the spell’s duration expires, the lava cools rapidly. All creatures in the area at that time are held fast and cannot move until they make a successful Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check against the spell’s DC. Breaking free of the lava is a full-round action.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *ring of fire* to *ring of lava* to avoid duplication.
