# Burst Bonds (Spell)
## Overview
[[Evocation Spells|Evocation]]

**Level:** [[1st Level Inquisitor Spells|Inquisitor 1]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 2nd-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 2]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One object or creature restraining you

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude half (object)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide, pg. 208

You blast your restraints with divine wrath, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the target object (maximum 5d6), ignoring hardness of 10 or less. A Fortitude save halves the damage, although only magical restraints receive a saving throw.

You can also target a creature that is grappling or otherwise restraining you (such as by adhesive or the [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|swallow whole]] ability) with the spell. You donâ€™t need to make a touch attack to use *burst bonds* against a creature, and you can cast this spell without making a concentration check while [[Grappled|grappled]] or [[Pinned|pinned]]. The creature does not take damage as above. If you are [[Grappled|grappled]] and your target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a saving throw, *burst bonds* allows a new saving throw with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).
