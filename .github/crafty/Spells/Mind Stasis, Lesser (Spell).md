The subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being asleep, [[Dazed|dazed]] or [[Shaken|shaken]]. If a single effect caused both the [[Dazed|dazed]] condition and some other condition, such as *[[Color Spray (Spell)|color spray]]*, only the [[Dazed|dazed]] part of the spell is negated.

Sleeping characters cannot be awakened while affected by a *lesser mind statis*.

This spell also prevents all Intelligence and Wisdom damage received during its duration. Existing damage to these ability scores are unaffected by this spell.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
