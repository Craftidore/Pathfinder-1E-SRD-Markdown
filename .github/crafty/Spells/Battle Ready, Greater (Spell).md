*Greater battle ready* allows the caster to store spells for use in quick response. A small gem, used as the focus, becomes the vessel of the stored spells. While casting *greater battle ready*, the caster places within the vessel any single spell or a number of spells that have total combined levels equal to or less than his caster level (for example, a 9th-level caster could store *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]**,* *[[Bear's Endurance (Spell)|bear’s endurance]]**, [[Fire Shield (Spell)|fire shield]],* and *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*), to a maximum of 20 levels. No spell stored can be higher than 5th level.

Once stored, the spells in the vessel have a target of personal and can only be used to affect the caster. Each spell in the vessel can then later be cast, one per round, as a free action.
