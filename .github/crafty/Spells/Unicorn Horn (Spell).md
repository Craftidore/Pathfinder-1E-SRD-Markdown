*A horn like a unicorn's sprouts from your forehead.*

When you complete this spell, you grow a single horn about as long as your forearm from your forehead. As a standard action, you can use this horn to make a single gore attack as a natural weapon. A hit from the horn deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (if you are Medium) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus. The horn overcomes damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon.

Alternatively, you can use the horn in a charge attack. In this case, you deal double damage when you hit, or triple damage on a critical hit.

As a swift action while the spell lasts, you can invoke the power of good. Doing this gives the horn a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, allows it to overcome damage reduction as if it were good-aligned, and makes it deal an extra 3d6 points of damage against any evil-aligned creature of the following types: fey, giant, magical beast, or outsider. This effect lasts for 1 round, after which the spell's duration ends.

If this spell is in effect when you cast *[[Unicorn Blood (Spell)|unicorn blood]]* or *[[Unicorn Heart (Spell)|unicorn heart]]**,* the combined magic has an enhanced effect.
