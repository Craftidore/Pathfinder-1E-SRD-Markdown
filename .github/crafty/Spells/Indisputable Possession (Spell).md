This infusion creates a bond between you and an object. If that item ever leaves your possession, you can call it back to your hand as a move action. The bond is severed if the item is out of your possession for more than 1 minute per artificer level. A creature holding onto an item you are trying to retrieve can make a Will save to retain its grasp on the item, but that creature must be holding or wearing it, not merely carrying the object among its possessions.
