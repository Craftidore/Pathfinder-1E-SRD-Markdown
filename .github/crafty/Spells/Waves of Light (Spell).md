Waves of holy energy emanate from you. The energy affects only creatures of evil alignment, inflicting 1d6 points of damage for every two levels (max. 10d6) and carries other effects based on the creatures’ level or Hit Dice as follows:


| **Level/HD** | **Secondary Effect** |
|---|---|
| Less than 4 | Knocks creatures unconscious for 1d6 minutes |
| 4–8 | Stuns for 1d6+1 rounds |
| 8–12 | Stuns for 1d4 rounds |
| More than 12 | Stuns for 1 round |

The secondary effects are negated by a successful saving throw, but creatures that succeed at their save still suffer a –1 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws and checks for 1 round per level.
