If any conjuration (teleportation) supernatural, spell or spell-like ability is used within the area of this spell, or if the area of the spell is the target of a conjuration (teleportation) spell or effect, the destination of the teleport spell is redirected to a location you chose, within the warded area, when you cast *teleport transfer*. For example, a dragon could cast *teleportation transfer* in its lair, with a dungeon cell equipped with a crushing stone trap as a destination. Now, if anyone in the dragon’s lair attempts to cast [[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]], it ends up in the cell.

The whole area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A [[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]] cast on a specific area, if successful, allows for normal teleportation to work in that area. A successful [[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]] destroys the entire *teleport transfer* effect.
