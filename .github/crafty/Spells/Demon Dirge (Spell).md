The baatezu’s answer to Blood War-related demonic magic targeting their race, *demon dirge* deals 3d6 points of damage to any creature that has both the chaotic and evil subtypes (such as a howler or a demon). A successful Fortitude save negates this damage.

If the target creature also possesses the tanar’ri subtype, the spell has a much more powerful effect. The target’s blood seethes and churns, stunning it for 1d4 rounds and dealing 3d6 points of damage in each of those rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stun effect and reduces the duration to 1 round. Such creatures’ spell resistance does not apply against this effect.
