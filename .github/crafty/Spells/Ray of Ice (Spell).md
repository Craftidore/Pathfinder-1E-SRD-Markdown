*A cyan ray beams from your fingertips. You shudder with cold as the ray leaves your hand.*

You launch a ray of numbing cold at your enemy. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If successful, the ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). The target must also make a Reflex save or be frozen to the ground with its feet encased in ice. A frozen creature cannot move, receives no Dexterity bonus to AC, and incurs a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls.

A frozen creature can free itself with a DC 18 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the ice.

*Material Component:* Ice or a vial of melted mountain snow.
