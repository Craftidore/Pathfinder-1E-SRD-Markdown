*Calling upon the raw energies of Baator, you cause hellish fires to fill an area you designate.*

You create a small explosion of brimstone and fire. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to creatures in the affected area. The damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]** (fire),* *[[Fire Shield (Spell)|fire shield]]* (*chill shield*), and similar magic.
