*Meld into mirror* allows you to step into any mirror that is tall and wide enough to accommodate you and merge with its substance. No other creatures can accompany you, and you can take no more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear with you. The mirror must be within 10 feet of you and in line of sight at the time of casting, and you step in at any time before the spell duration expires.

While in the mirror, you can see through the surface by which you entered as if it were a window, but you are not visible to creatures outside it. Your other senses do not extend outside the mirror--that is, you cannot hear any sounds, smell any scents, or feel any sensations originating from outside. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells normally on yourself and on creatures and objects outside the mirror. The range of any spell cast from within a mirror begins at the mirror's surface, and the effect seems to come from within the mirror. Minor physical damage to the mirror (such as chips or scratches) does not harm you, but its complete destruction expels you, dealing 5d6 poitns of damage in the process.

Any time before the spell's duration expires, you can step out of the mirror through the surface by which you entered. If the spell's duration expires, or you can no longer fit through the surface by which you entered, or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit, the mirror shatters and you are violently expelled from it, taking 5d6 points of damage.

Certain spells affect you if cast upon the mirror while you occupy it. *[[Shatter (Spell)|Shatter]]* expels you, dealing 5d6 points of damage. *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|Disintegrate]]* expels you and then slays you instantly (Fortitude DC 18 negates the death effect only). *Animate object* does not affect you, but you cannot control an animated mirror from inside it. *[[Passwall (Spell)|Passwall]]* expels you without damage.
