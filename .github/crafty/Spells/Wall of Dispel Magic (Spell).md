*You cast the spell and a translucent wall springs up, a shimmering field of faded colors that swirls and merges with itself like the surface of a soap bubble.*

This spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier. Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* effect at your caster level. A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect.

A *wall of dispel magic* cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even with a *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* spell. *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|Detect magic]]* indicates the presence of the effect, and *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* reveals its presence.
