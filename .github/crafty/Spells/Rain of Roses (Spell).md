Red roses fall from the sky. Their sharp thorns graze the flesh of evil creatures, dealing 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage per round. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom falls unconscious as its mind succumbs to horrible nightmares. In addition, the beautiful rose petals sicken evil creatures touched by them; those that fail a Fortitude save are [[Sickened|sickened]] (–2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) until they leave the spell’s area. A successful Fortitude save renders a creature immune to the sickening effect of the roses, but not the ability damage caused by their thorns.
