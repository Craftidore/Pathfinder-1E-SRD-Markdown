*The heat in the room seems to rush toward you, leaving everyone around you in bonechilling pain while you feel amazingly refreshed and alive.*

You drain the heat from all living creatures within the affected area except you. This influx of warmth heals and empowers you. All affected living creatures take 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). For every living creature that takes damage from this spell, you gain 2 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per level.
