You can see fey crossroads within 60 feet, if your visibility isn’t blocked. A crossroads appears to you as a blue-hued, x-shaped shadow upon the ground. You recognize the crossroads for what it is, and won’t be fooled by a false or illusory one. *Detect crossroads* gives you no information on where the backroad leads.

If the nearest crossroads is less than a mile away, but blocked visually from you either by distance or barriers, you can still sense its general direction.

Each round, you can turn to detect in a new direction.
