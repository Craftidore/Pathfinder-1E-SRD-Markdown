Calling on the grim powers of death, you cause all corpses in the area to rise up as skeletons under your control. This spell affects corpses buried underground as well, up to a depth of 10 ft., although such undead take 1d4 minutes to claw their way up to the surface. These skeletons can be made into burning or bleeding skeletons at the time of casting by reducing the duration to 10 minutes per level. These undead do not count against your HD limit for the amount of undead you can control. These undead must be commanded as a single group and cannot be split up to perform multiple tasks.

If you are slain, these undead immediately crumble to dust.
