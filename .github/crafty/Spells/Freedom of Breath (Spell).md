The subject can breathe freely in conditions that ordinarily inhibit respiration, such as sandstorms. While *freedom of breath* is in effect, the subject does not make Constitution checks to avoid the onset of suffocation unless no breathable substance is available (such as for a human underwater or buried under sand). The spell also protects against stenches, such as those produced by a troglodyte or a *[[Stinking Cloud (Spell)|stinking cloud]]* spell. The subject does not have to make saves or checks against nausea and similar effects from strong odors. *Freedom of breath* also grants a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves and Constitution checks to resist poisonous vapors, such as those from a volcanic caldera or a *[[Cloudkill (Spell)|cloudkill]]* spell, for the duration of the spell.
