You attempt to call forth a valkyrie. If you know a valkyrie’s name, you can attempt to call that valkyrie specifically. The valkyrie always appears when called during or immediately before a great battle.

A valkyrie may choose to assist its caller in battle if the caller is particularly honorable or if the caller is fighting against particularly tricky or evil enemies. The valkyrie may always refuse to help, at the GM’s discretion.

You can attempt to force a valkyrie to perform a task; if you do, you must use a magic circle and follow the process of the planar binding spell. Compelling a valkyrie in this manner earns the caster the enmity of a good-aligned deity as well as the valkyrie.
