*A thick, sparkling cloud of billowing mist rolls into being from the point you indicate.*

This potent spell conjures a cloud of mist that functions as a *[[Solid Fog (Spell)|solid fog]]* spell. In addition, any spells cast within the fog have a –4 penalty to the spellcaster’s caster level, and the save DC of any such spell is reduced by 2. Creatures within the fog, or that enter the fog, must succeed on a Will save or suffer the reduction in caster level and DC even after they leave the fog, for the duration of the spell.
