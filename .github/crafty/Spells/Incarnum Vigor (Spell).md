For example, a cleric casting *[[Cure Serious Wounds, Mass (Spell)|mass cure serious wounds]]* would add either +14 (twice the level of the *[[Cure Serious Wounds, Mass (Spell)|mass cure serious wounds]]* spell) or the *incarnum vigor’s* caster level, whichever is lower, to the healing provided to each target of the spell.

*Essentia:* Every point of essentia you invest in this spell increases the fast healing granted by 1 point.
