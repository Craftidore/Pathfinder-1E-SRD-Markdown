*As you cast this spell, those around you sense an unnatural chill. This vanishes, though, as you release a burst of frost-filled power in the midst of your foes.*

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you select. The swarm of snowballs deals 2d6 points of cold damage to creatures and objects within the burst. For every two caster levels beyond 3rd, the snowballs deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, to a maximum of 5d6 at 9th level or higher.

*Material Component:* A piece of ice or a small white rock chip.
