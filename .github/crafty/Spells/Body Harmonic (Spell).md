*You rub the rim of a water-filled glass, causing it to emit a piercing tone. As you chant a simple poem you feel the glass in your hand crackle with energy, causing the hand holding it to become slightly numb.*

As you rub the glass, the targeted creature’s body begins to vibrate loudly and painfully in harmony with the tone. Each round you continue to concentrate on this spell, the victim takes 1d10 points of damage to one ability score. You must select a different ability score each round, and cannot damage any one ability score more than once every 5 rounds. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw each round to negate that round’s effect.

While the subject is under the effect of *body harmonic,* its body whines and hums discordantly. The victim takes a –20 penalty on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (3.5 Move Silently) checks.
