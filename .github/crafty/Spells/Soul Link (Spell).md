*You draw forth a scrap of parchment and speak the name written on it in blood. The parchment turns to dust as you touch the targeted creature with you other hand, creating a potent link between the two of you.*

You can use a *soul link* to monitor the subject’s condition and location, as though it were affected by a *[[Status (Spell)|status]]* spell. You and the subject can also communicate telepathically as long as you are both on the same plane. By concentrating, you can also use *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* upon the subject, which is permitted no saving throw to resist. In addition, the subject takes a –4 penalty on any saving throw made to resist a mind-affecting spell or ability you use against it.

At the time the spell is cast, you can choose to take a –2 penalty to one of your ability scores in order to grant the subject a +2 enhancement bonus to that same ability score. If you use this option, the subject chooses the ability score affected for both of you and takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the effects of this spell.

You can have only one soul link in effect at a time. If you cast this spell a second time, the soul link already active ends immediately, regardless of the outcome of the second casting.
