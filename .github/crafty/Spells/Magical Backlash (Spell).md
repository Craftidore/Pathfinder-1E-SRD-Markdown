*With a word and a gesture, the target flares with crackling, violet-colored energy.* 

*Magical backlash* causes any spells affecting the target to resonate painfully. For each spell currently in effect on the target (not counting *magical backlash* itself), *magical backlash* deals 2 points of damage per level of that spell.

For example, a creature targeted by *magical backlash* that is under the effects of *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bull’s strength]]**,* *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]**,* and *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* spells would take 4 points of damage for *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bull’s strength]]**,* 4 for *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]*, and 2 more for *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* for a total of 10 points of damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Spells made permanent by using the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell would resonate AS WOULD the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* itself for each spell made permanent (since it must still be in effect at some level since it is dispellable (cf. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*).
