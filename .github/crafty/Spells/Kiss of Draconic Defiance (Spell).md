*A ring of radiant energy spirals out from your body, shattering the magical energies of others.*

This spell projects magical interference from your body, making it more difficult for others to cast spells within its area. Any enemy attempting to cast a spell within the area of a *kiss of draconic defiance* must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw; failure means the spell is lost (as it cast) but has no effect. Any creature that successfully saves against this spell is immune to its effect for 24 hours thereafter. Check spell resistance the first time a creature attempts to cast a spell within the area.

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can automatically counter a single spell of 5th level or lower (as per the counterspell action) as an immediate action, as long as the caster is within the area of the *kiss of draconic defiance*. Doing so immediately ends the duration of this spell. You do not expend any of your own spell slots to counter the other spell and need not make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check to identity it (though you can choose to do so to ensure that it's not higher than 5th level).
