*Your mouth opens impossibly wide and engulfs your foe. You swallow loudly and your mouth returns to normal size, leaving no trace of your foe behind.*

When you cast this spell, you can send a creature to a pocket “stomach” dimension with a successful melee touch attack. The target you touch must make a successful Fortitude save. If it fails its saving throw, the creature is sent to the stomach dimension. The victim takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage and 12 points of acid damage per round while in the stomach dimension. The victim can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the stomach dimension (AC 21). A creature that successfully exits appears to cut its way free from thin air, appearing in a space adjacent to you.

Each time you cast this spell, you create a separate temporary stomach dimension.
