This spell functions like *[[Brand (Spell)|brand]]*, except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a *greater brand* blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is [[Sickened|sickened]]. Like the effects of *[[Bestow Curse (Spell)|bestow curse]]*, a *greater brand* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a *[[Mark of Justice (Spell)|mark of justice]]*.
