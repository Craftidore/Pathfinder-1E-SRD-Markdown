As *[[Humanoid Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser humanoid essence]]* with the following additional effects. The target constructâ€™s type changes to humanoid, and it loses the living construct subtype if it has it. The target is now subject to critical hits, sneak attacks, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects. It can also be affected by spells and effects that only affect humanoids, such as *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]**.*

In addition, a warforged affected by this spell loses its racial fortification against critical hits and sneak attacks (including any improvements to that fortification).

This spell counters and dispels *[[Construct Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater construct essence]]*, *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]* and *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]*.

If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]* or *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]*, the latter spell is automatically ended. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater construct essence]]*, both spells are dispelled and have no effect.
