*You brush the target with your finger, and she now perceives handholds and toeholds where others see smooth stone.*

The subject gains a +10 enhancement bonus on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks. The bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 9th. Unlike with *[[Spider Climb (Spell)|spider climb]]*, this spell does not allow the subject to climb on ceilings, and it does not give the creature a climb speed.
