The target gains the ability to make sneak attacks as a rogue against opponents denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class or flanked. The target deals +1d6 damage per three caster levels (+3d6 at 7th, +4d6 at 10th, +5d6 at 13th, etc.) when making such an attack. If the target can already make sneak attacks, that sneak attack damage increases by +1d6 per three caster levels.
