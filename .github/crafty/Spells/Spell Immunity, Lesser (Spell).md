*Silvery motes of light begin to snow down as you complete the spell, shifting to its recipient upon your successful touch. The motes coalesce into a nimbus that contracts and holds to the subject as a silvery sheen.*

This spell protects one creature from a single 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the chosen spell. *Lesser spell immunity* can’t protect a creature from a spell to which spell resistance doesn’t apply. This spell works against other spells, spell-like effects, and innate spell-like abilities. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells with similar effects; thus, a creature given immunity to *[[Inflict Light Wounds (Spell)|inflict light wounds]]* is still susceptible to *[[Inflict Moderate Wounds (Spell)|inflict moderate wounds]]*.

A creature can have only one *lesser spell immunity* or *[[Spell Immunity (Spell)|spell immunity]]* in effect at a time.
