The water within the area suddenly explodes outward in a massive surge, as if driven by a powerful explosion. Each creature or object in the area is subject to damage equal to 2d6 + caster level. Any creature struck by this attack must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be driven 10 feet away from the center of the blast.

If a ship is in the area, the captain must immediately make a sinking check (DC equal to spell save DC). See Sinking, (*Stormwrack* 32).

At least half of the spell’s area must contain water at least 10 feet deep, or else the spell fails. You must center the effect at or below the water’s surface.
