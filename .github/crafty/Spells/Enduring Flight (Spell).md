You can carry more weight aloft while flying, and your flight lasts longer than normal. You can fly at normal speed when wearing medium armor or carrying up to a medium load. If your ability to fly (whether natural or magical) has a limited duration, that duration is doubled. This spell lasts as long as you remain airborne; it ends the moment you land.
