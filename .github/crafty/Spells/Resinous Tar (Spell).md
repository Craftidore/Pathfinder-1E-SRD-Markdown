*A sticky layer of black liquid coats your target.*

The *resinous tar* spell makes a solid surface sticky. Movement costs across the area are doubled. Any prone creature in the area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength check to stand up.

The spell can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. Items not in use or in a creature's possession are always affected by this spell. An object wielded or held by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. A creature holding an affected item must use a full-round action to let go of the item, drop it, put it away, pick it up from the ground, or ready it for use.

A creature wielding an affected item gains a +5 circumstance bonus on opposed checks to avoid being disarmed.

A creature wearing armor or clothing affected by this spell takes a –5 penalty on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

*Resinous tar* counters and dispels *[[Grease (Spell)|grease]]* (and vice versa).
