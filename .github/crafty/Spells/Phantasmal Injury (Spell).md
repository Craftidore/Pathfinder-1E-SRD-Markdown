*You cast out your senses to fill your foe’s mind, causing him to believe that he has suffered a mortal wound.*

You create the sensation in the target’s mind that he has been [[Disabled|disabled]] (reduced to 0 hit points), restricting him to a single move action or standard action each turn. If the target takes a standard action (or any kind of strenuous action), he takes 1 point of damage from *phantasmal injury*. The target remains conscious unless the damage would actually reduce his hit points below 0. This damage is real and remains after the spell’s duration has expired.
