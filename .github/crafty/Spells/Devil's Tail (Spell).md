The caster grows a 3-foot-long tail. The tail is thin, black or red, and it ends in a spike. The caster can use this tail to make melee attacks using his attack bonus, dealing a base 1d4 points of damage, plus one-half his Strength bonus. If the caster takes a full attack action, he can use both the tail and his normal melee attacks, but all attacks have a â€“2 penalty.
