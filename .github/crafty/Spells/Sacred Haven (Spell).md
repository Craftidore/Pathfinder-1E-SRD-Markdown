*A rosy glow passes from your hand and briefly spreads around you.*

You and affected allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. In addition, while protected by this spell, an affected creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class when [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] or when struck by an invisible attacker.

For the duration of the spell, you gain awareness of the health of all affected creatures, as with the *[[Status (Spell)|status]]* spell, and you need not be able to touch the affected creatures to heal them with your lay on hands ability. Use of the lay on hands ability still requires a standard action, but it can be done at any range, as long as you and your target are on the same plane.
