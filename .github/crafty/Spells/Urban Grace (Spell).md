You become one with the city around you, allowing you to move more easily through its crowds and buildings. For the duration of this spell, your base land speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, it does not cost you 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds, though the crowd still provides cover to you. This ability does not allow you to enter the space of enemy creatures without making the appropriate [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check. In addition, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks made to move across uneven urban surfaces, such as roofs and broken pavement, and on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks made to scale walls and other artificial surfaces. Whenever you make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check to make a long jump between two buildings or artificial structures, you are always treated as if you had a running start, regardless of the actual distance traveled.
