By means of this spell the caster can move magically from mirror to mirror instantly. In order to cast this spell the caster must touch a mirror (any mirror will do, as long as it is a solid object with a particularly reflective surface. DMs have final say on what is, and is not, a mirror for the purposes of this spell) and recite the incantation, then select another mirror within 1,000 ft. per caster level (to a maximum of 20,000 ft. at 20th level). The caster and all equipment vanish into the first mirror and then emerge from the second mirror one round later.

This spell does not grant perfect familiarity with all mirrors in the area, and you must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. This functions the same as the *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell, except that the caster always emerges from a mirror of some kind.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 4, Witch 4 to Level.

*House Rule:* A *mirror travel* spell may be made permanent by using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. Doing so links two mirrors together and requires that both mirrors have at least 5,000 gp value. Mirrors may be linked using more than one *mirror travel* spell but each link to a new mirror requires an additional casting of both *mirror travel* and *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]].*
