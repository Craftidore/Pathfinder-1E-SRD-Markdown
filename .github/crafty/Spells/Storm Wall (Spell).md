An immobile, sparking curtain of radiant electricity springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth miniature bolts of lightning, causing 2d4 points of electrical damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of electrical damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d4 points of electrical damage +1 point of electrical damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to metal creatures, creatures wearing metal armor or carrying a lot of metal objects.

If you evoke the wall so that it appear where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the waII by making a successful Reflex save. ( If the creature ends up on the sparking side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.)

The *storm wall* can be smothered by using enough dirt or sand to ground the electricity. For each cubic foot of sand used, one corresponding foot of the wall wall be smothered.
