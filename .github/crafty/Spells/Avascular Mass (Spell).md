*You shoot a black ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing your foe to violently purge blood vessels through its skin. The purged blood vessels spread outward, creating a many-layered mass of bloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearby creatures in a gory horror.* 

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not [[Stunned|stunned]]. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell. 

The *avascular mass* instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points—such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls—or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius *avascular mass* become [[Entangled|entangled]]. The original target of the spell is automatically [[Entangled|entangled]]. Because the *avascular mass* is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an [[Entangled|entangled]] character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell.

Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the *avascular mass* and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of *avascular mass* between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of *avascular mass* between you, it provides total cover.

The *avascular mass* of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue.
