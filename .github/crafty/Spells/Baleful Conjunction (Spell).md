You inflict a debilitating fate upon your enemies that stymies them unless they gather together like stars in a constellation. If, while under the effects of this spell, a target is more than 30 ft. away from another target, it takes a –4 penalty to all attack rolls, ability checks, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. While targets are within 30 ft. of at least one other target of the spell, the penalty decreases to –1. The targets suffer no penalty only if all of the targets of the spell are within 5 ft. of at least one other of the spell’s targets, but such an occurrence does not end the spell’s duration.

*Baleful conjunction* counters and dispels *heroic conjunction*.
