*You leach the power of the wand you hold, causing a ghostly stream of blue mist to rise from the item and enter your body. Slowly, you feel your magical*

*energies being renewed.*

You drain the charges from a wand or staff you hold to replace spells you have already cast. As long as the wand or staff has at least 5 charges left, you can expend 5 of those charges to replace a cast spell. The spell replaced must be of a level equal to or lower than the highest-level spell the staff or wand holds.

If you prepare arcane spells, you can regain any one spell of the affected level that you have already cast that day; if you cast spells spontaneously, you can regain a spell slot of the appropriate level. For example, a wizard who has cast her only *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* spell for the day (a 3rd-level spell) can drain 5 charges from her* wand of* *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* (another 3rd-level spell) to regain *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* or any lower-level spell she has cast.

If the wand or staff holds enough charges, one casting of this spell can replace multiple spells at once. For example, a sorcerer who has expended three of his 5th-level spell slots can drain 15 charges from his *[[Frost (Staff)|staff of frost]]* to regain all three spell slots.

*Siphon* has no effect on wands or staffs that do not hold enough charges to replenish the desired number of spells.
