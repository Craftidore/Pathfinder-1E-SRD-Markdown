You create a glowing shield of brilliant daylight that you wield as you would a normal large shield. You cannot have this spell active while using a normal shield. The *shield of light* provides illumination in a 30-foot radius. If the shield comes into an area of magical darkness, it temporarily negates the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

The shield offers a +2 armor bonus and a +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class for every three caster levels (maximum +5 enhancement bonus, for a total AC bonus of up to +7).

Creatures that would be adversely affected by a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell are likewise affected when within 5 feet of you and the shield. Whether affected by *daylight* or not, all undead who attempt a melee attack against you must first succeed at a Will saving throw or cower for the duration of the spell. Even those undead that succeed at the save suffer a –4 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when attacking you in melee. Undead attacking at range need not make saving throws but they do suffer the –4 penalty. This penalty is cumulative with any modifiers from the *daylight* effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The shield can only temporarily negate magical darkness of 5th level or lower.
