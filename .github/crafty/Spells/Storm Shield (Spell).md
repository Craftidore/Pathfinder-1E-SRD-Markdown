This spell creates a small, glowing sphere of amber light at a point you designate. Any effect that deals electricity damage (such as a [[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]] or a blue dragon's breath weapon) that passes within 30 feet of the *storm shield* is attracted to it and strikes the shield instead of its intended target. In the case of area spells such as *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]*, this redirection occurs if any portion of the spell's area is within 30 feet of the *storm shield*. In such a case, the entire effect is drawn to the *storm shield*, and all creatures or objects that otherwise would have been in the spell's area remain unharmed.

The *storm shield* takes full damage (no saving throw) from any effect drawn into it. The shield can absorb up to 20 points of electricity damage per caster level before dissipating. Any remaining damage is applied to all creatures within 10 feet of the *storm shield's* position (Reflex half; spell resistance applies). For example, suppose a *storm shield* cast by a 5th-level cleric has already absorbed 78 points of electricity damage when it is struck by a *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* that deals 45 points of damage. The first 22 points of damage is enough to destroy the *storm shield*, so every creature within 10 feet of it takes 23 points of electricity damage (or 11 with a successful save).

Material Component: A small chip of amber.
