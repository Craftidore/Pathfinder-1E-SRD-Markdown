You instantly swap locations with a *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]*. You always arrive exactly where your image previously stood, and you leave a *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]* in your wake. To anyone incapable of discerning that the *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]* is an illusion, the *image swap* occurs without visible clue. To anyone capable of discerning that the *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]* is an illusion, the *image swap* is effectively identical to a *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*.

This spell has no effect if you do not have a *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]* in effect. Unlike normal *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spells, use of *image swap* does not count as breaking one’s line of sight with a *[[Project Image (Spell)|projected image]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's image swap* to *image swap* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Halaster’s image swap* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

*House Rule:* Due to the unique nature of this spell (ie., “point to point swapping”), no form of *[[Anticipate Teleportation (Spell)|anticipate teleportation]]* or *[[Delay Teleportation (Spell)|delay teleportation]]* has any effect upon it when used within areas affected by those spells. However, *[[Dimensional Anchor (Spell)|dimensional anchor]]* and *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]* are both effective when used.
