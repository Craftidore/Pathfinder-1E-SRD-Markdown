You ward a creature from attacks by soulmelds and incarnum creatures. The spell forms a barrier at a distance of 1 foot around the warded creature. The barrier is normally invisible, but it flashes electric blue when struck by an incarnum creatureâ€™s natural weapon attack or an effect generated by a soulmeld. While protected, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against natural weapon attacks made by incarnum creatures or effects created by soulmelds.

A side effect of this spell is that it prevents the subject from gaining essentia, even if such an effect would be considered beneficial. Such effects automatically fail if targeted on the protected subject.
