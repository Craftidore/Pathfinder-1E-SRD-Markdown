You can draw upon your physical endurance to increase the power of your spells. You voluntarily deal Constitution damage to yourself when you cast this spell. For each 2 points of damage dealt, your caster level increases by 1. You cannot take more Constitution damage than your caster level (maximum 10 points for a +5 caster level increase). Your maximum and current hit points drop appropriately for your lower Constitution score. A creature that has no Constitution score, or that has immunity to Constitution damage, cannot cast this spell.
