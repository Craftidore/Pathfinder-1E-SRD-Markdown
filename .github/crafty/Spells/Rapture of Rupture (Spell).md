With this spell, the casterâ€™s touch deals grievous wounds to multiple targets. After *rapture of rupture* is cast*,* the caster can touch one target per round until she has touched a number of targets equal to her caster level. The same creature cannot be affected twice by the same *rapture of rupture*. A creature with no discernible anatomy is unaffected by this spell.

When the caster touches a subject, his flesh bursts open suddenly in multiple places. Each subject takes 6d6 points of damage and is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round; a successful Fortitude save reduces damage by half and negates the stun effect. Subjects who fail their Fortitude save continue to take 1d6 points of damage per round until they receive magical healing, succeed at a [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (DC 20), or die. If a subject takes 6 points of damage from *rapture of rupture* in a single round, he is [[Stunned|stunned]] in the following round.

*Corruption Cost:* 1 point of Strength damage per target touched.
