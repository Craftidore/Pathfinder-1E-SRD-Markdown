You place your hand on the ground and instantly familiarize yourself with the surrounding area. You get a mental map of the terrain within the spellâ€™s area. The mental map shows major natural land features (such as mountains and rivers,) but nothing created by creatures (such as temples or cities). You become aware of rough distances between these land features, though this does not improve your ability to draw an accurate map. Additionally, you get a +10 insight bonus to [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *lay of the land* to *greater lay of the land* to avoid duplication.
