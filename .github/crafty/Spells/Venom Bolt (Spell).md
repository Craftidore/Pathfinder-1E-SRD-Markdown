You release a beam of fell energy from your eye, mouth, fingertip, or tail tip that travels in a straight line. Every creature in its path takes 2d8 points of acid damage, though the beam is not actually composed of any acidic substance. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.

Furthermore, every creature in the path of the *venom bolt* must also make a successful Fortitude save or be [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1d4+1 rounds. Success means the subject is *slowed* for 1 round. Creatures do not b lock the b eam, but walls and o ther solid barriers do.

Yuan-ti and their creations (such as tainted ones and broodguards) are immune to the effects of this spell, as are creatures with the Snake Blood feat. Other Scaled Ones are immune to the paralysis effect and need not save against it.

*Material Component:* A drop of venom from any sort of poisonous snake.
