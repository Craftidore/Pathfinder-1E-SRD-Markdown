*You utter the word “Halt!” and, in that instant, the creature’s feet stick to the floor.*

The subject creature’s feet (or whatever pass for its feet) become momentarily stuck to the fl oor. The creature must stop moving, and cannot move farther in its current turn. This spell has no effect on creatures that are not touching the ground (such as flying creatures), and the subject can still use a standard action (if it has one available in this round) to move by means of teleportation magic.

You can cast this spell even when it’s not your turn; however, you must cast it before your opponent finishes its movement on its current turn to gain the benefit.
