*You drop a tiny wooden block before you. It rapidly begins growing and hits the ground with a heavy thud, now a perfect 5-foot cube of dense wood.*

You call a cube of solid wood, 5 feet on a side, into being. The cube must be created upon solid ground in an empty square. If no solid surface exists that is large enough for the cube to fit on, or if no adjacent square is empty, the spell fails.

The cube weighs 2,000 pounds. It has a hardness of 5 and 600 hit points, and it completely fills one 5-foot square. Multiple cubes can be stacked. If it is pushed into water, the cube floats.

*Material Component:* A block of wood, less than 3 inches on a side.
