As *[[Stone Shape (Spell)|stone shape]]*, except as noted above and that you affect metal instead of stone. You may employ this spell in combat with a successful melee touch attack. *Shape metal* successfully used in this way against a target’s armor reduces the armor’s protection by 1d6 points of Armor Class (armor such as [[Studded leather|studded leather]] that mostly made of nonmetal materials take half damage from this spell). If used against a shield, weapon, or metallic creature, the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels, bypassing the target’s hardness (or damage reduction in the case of a creature).

Touching an unwilling creature or an item held by an unwilling creature requires a melee touch attack and provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. You may ready an action to touch a creature, its armor, its shield, or its weapon when it attempts to strike you; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity (you are using the creature’s movement to come into contact with it).

*Arcane Material Component:* A piece of wire, bent approximately into the desired shape and touched to the metal while the verbal component is uttered.
