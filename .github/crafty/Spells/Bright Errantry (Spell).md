You gain divine aid for all actions attempted during two consecutive rounds. You choose when the two rounds affected begin to elapse, starting within a number of rounds equal to your level.

*Bright errantry* allows three die rolls to be made at a +4 luck bonus for every attack or other action you attempt during the two “bright rounds” (so called because you give off a faint, pearly-white glow during them). Of the three rolls made for each action, you may always choose the most favorable result.

Affected actions include those involving games of chance, such as cards or dice (in game), finding something hidden (for example, under shells), or drawing a particular card. If a game of chance has been fixed to be impossible (a selection of cards has been altered, dice are “crooked,” or there’s no hidden marker under any shell), this magic tells you that.
