Created by enterprising merchants, this spell creates a magical beacon that allows merchants belonging to a particular trans-planar merchant league to transport themselves to you and do business on the spot. Most merchants summoned in this way are outsiders native to other planes (including, but not limited to, devils, genies, and mercanes), but some include humanoid creatures from the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]], as well. The spell allows the summoned merchant to view the surroundings into which she would be summoned, as though with the spell *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance (Spell)|clairaudience/clairvoyance]]*, and the merchant may choose not to answer the summons as a result. Similarly, any hostile action against the merchant (whether by the summoner or another creature) immediately ends the spell and causes all objects the merchant brought with her to return to whence they came, even if they are no longer in her possession. Casters who routinely cause trouble for merchants summoned in this way may find themselves blacklisted and unable to get any merchant to answer their summons.

Merchants summoned by this spell have a base value and purchase limit similar to a settlement. There is a 50% chance that any item whose market price is less than or equal to the merchant’s base value is in the merchant’s inventory and available for purchase. The merchant’s purchase limit is the amount of gold the merchant has available to buy items from you or your allies. In addition, each merchant summoned by this spell has a number of minor, medium, or major magic items available, besides what is allowed by its base value, which should be determined randomly or selected by the GM. For *summon merchant I*, the base value is 50 gp, the purchase limit is 500 gp, and the merchant has 1d2 minor magic items.

Additionally, for a fee of 5 gp, the merchant will appraise an object for you. She makes [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] checks at a +5 bonus. The merchant can also cast *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* for you for a fee of 5 gp, with a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] modifier of +5. In either case, if you sell the item that is appraised or which has *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* cast on it to the merchant, the fee is waived.
