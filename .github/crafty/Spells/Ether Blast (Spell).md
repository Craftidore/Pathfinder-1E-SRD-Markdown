Upon casting this spell, you detonate a small ether cyclone on the [[Ethereal Plane]] centered on you. Those on the Material Plane are unaffected by the blast (including you if you cast it from there). However, all those on the [[Ethereal Plane]] within the spellâ€™s area are affected as if caught by an ether cyclone. The cyclone lasts for the duration of the spell, and any who enter the area on the [[Ethereal Plane]] are caught by its force-winds and potentially swept away.

If you cast *ether blast* while on the [[Ethereal Plane]], you are affected by the spell as well. Undead are not affected by this spell, nor are big ethereal objects. Unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less are swept away by the [[Ethereal Plane]].

*Material Component*: The tooth of a creature that uses the [[Ethereal Plane]], such a blink dog or an ethereal marauder, or the claw of a phase spider.
