# Devil Snare
## Overview
Abjuration \[good]

**Level:** Cleric 4, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5

**BoXM:** Cleric 7, Wizard 9

**Casting Time:** 1 full-round action

**Components:** V, S, M (a pouch of silvered powder worth 25 gp)

**Range:** Touch

**Effect:** 10-ft.-radius circle

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text

**Source:** Agents of Evil, pg. 17

Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional travel (as per *dimensional anchor*). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells, and spell-like abilities. Despite the spellâ€™s name, *devil snare* captures outsiders of any type, not only devils.

As a standard action, you can dismiss the circle, expelling any outsiders still trapped within to their planes of origin (as per *dismissal*). An outsider can resist this effect with a successful Will save, enabling it to remain after the spell is dismissed.
