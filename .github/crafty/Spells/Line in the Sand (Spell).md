# Line in the Sand (Spell)
## Overview
[[Abjuration Spells|Abjuration]]

**Level:** [[1st Level Assassin Spells|Assassin 1]], [[1st Level Bloodrager Spells|Bloodrager 1]], [[1st Level Magus Spells|Magus 1]], [[1st Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 1]], [[1st Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 1]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 2nd-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 2]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** 5 ft.

**Area:** 5-ft. burst centered on you

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 186

You create a glowing crimson line around the area. Against creatures in the area, you can attempt a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards, Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers), although this does not allow you to make more than one attack against a creature per action that provokes.

**GM Note**

When paired with a contingent action (cf. *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]**)* and/or a weapon, effect or spell that extends the caster's reach (cf. *[[Long Arm (Spell)|long arm]]**),* this spell becomes especially powerful.

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 1 to Level.
