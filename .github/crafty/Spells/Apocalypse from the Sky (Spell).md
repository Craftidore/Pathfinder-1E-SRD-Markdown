The caster calls upon the darkest forces in all existence to rain destruction down upon the land. All creatures and objects in the spell’s area take 10d6 points of fire, acid, or sonic damage (caster’s choice). This damage typically levels forests, sends mountains tumbling, and wipes out entire populations of living creatures. The caster is subject to the damage as well as the corruption cost.

*Material Component:* An artifact, usually one of good perverted to this corrupt use.

*Corruption Cost:* 3d6 points of Constitution damage and 4d6 points of Wisdom drain. Just preparing this spell deals 1d3 points of Wisdom damage, with another 1d3 points of Wisdom damage for each day it remains among the caster’s prepared spells.
