The spell allows the caster to control a servitor he has built with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than his level. The caster possesses such a level of control that he can manipulate objects with his mechanical servitor as precisely as the servitor’s construction allows. The servitor uses the caster’s base attack bonus (modified by the servitor’s Strength and Dexterity scores) and saving throw modifiers for Reflex and Will saving throws. The caster can use the manipulators of the servitor to perform any number of skill-based tasks, using the servitor’s Strength and Dexterity modifiers when using skills based on those particular abilities. The caster’s body remains immobile, as if [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], for the duration of the spell.

The construct must remain within 100 ft. +10 ft. per level of the caster. If it moves beyond this distance the spell immediately ends and the caster’s mind returns to his body.

**GM Note**

This spell also appears in Deep Magic (Kobold Press)
