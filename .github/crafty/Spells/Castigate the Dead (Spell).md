When you use the Turn Undead discipline, you also inflict upon the undead 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 points for every two caster levels. If you already have the damage enhancement to the discipline, then the undead flee as well as suffer damage.

This spell is cast at the same time as you turn undead. It is a free action that can be used only on your turn, and never more than once per round. It cannot be used on the same round as a quickened spell or a quickened discipline.
