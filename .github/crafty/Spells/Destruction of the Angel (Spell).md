# Destruction of the Angel (Spell)
## Overview
[[Evocation Spells|Evocation]] \[[[Evil Spells|evil]]]

**Level:** [[9th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 9]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 17th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 17]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 feet + 10 feet/level)

**Target:** 1 good outsider/round

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 58

When you point your finger at a good outsider and speak unholy words whispered to you by servants of the divine, you consume the outsider utterly in an explosion of darkness and sin. Beings with less than 10 HD get no saving throw versus this effect. Those with 20 HD or more are not consumed but instead suffer 10d6 points of unholy damage if they fail their saving throw. Beings of godlike status are immune to the effects of this spell.

Despite its name, this spell works equally well on archons, djinni, and all good outsiders. When a good outsider is consumed, it is destroyed utterly and forever.
