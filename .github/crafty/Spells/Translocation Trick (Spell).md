*You utter the words, and in an instant you and your target are switchedâ€”you take its position and form, and it appears where you had stood moments before, looking to others as you appear.*

You and the other target switch locations, as if simultaneously using *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]* spells and exchange appearances, as if using *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]* spells to appear as each other. Your target can negate this spell with a successful saving throw.

If you or your target exceed the capacity of the *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]* spell or if you and your target have bodies that are so different that the *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]* spell could not disguise you as your target, this spell fails.

Magic that penetrates disguises (such as *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*) reveals the identities of you and your target. Otherwise, you are considered to be disguised as your target and vice versa for the duration of the spell. You get a +10 bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks to impersonate the target.

When the spell ends, you and your target revert to your true appearances in your current locations. You do not switch places again.
