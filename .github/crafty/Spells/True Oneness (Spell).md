With the casting of this spell, you temporarily link your and your ally's life energies on a fundamental level, allowing you all to draw upon each other's life and soul energies in times of need. For the duration of the spell, all affected allies share both their saving throws and their ability score modifiers with one another, meaning a sorcerer linked by this spell to a fighter can use the fighter's more favourable save bonus and Constitution modifier when attempting a Fortitude save and the fighter can use the sorcerer's more favourable bonus when forced to attempt a Will save. Likewise, if the sorcerer is [[Grappled|grappled]], he can use the fighter's Strength bonus instead of his own when making an opposed grapple checks to escape, or when simply attempting to strike his opponent with a dagger.

Those affected by the spell one automatically and unconsciously draw upon the highest ability score or save bonus when needed, with no limit to the number of times any ability may be drawn upon per round. Unlike the *one* spell, bonuses to ability scores or saves granted by spells or magic items also apply. Additionally, the caster and his allies share individual skills so that each may use the skills (and their modifiers) as needed. 

The caster (only) is able to tap into the feats and/or class abilities of his/her allies, not just their saving throw, ability score modifiers, and individual skills (and skill modifiers).

The spells effects last only so long as all participants remain within the radius of effect. Should any linked participant move outside that radius the spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, all participants are considered [[Fatigued|fatigued]].

*Material Components:* A bit of hair or skim from each participant. Alternately, all partictpants can link hands during the duration of the casting.
