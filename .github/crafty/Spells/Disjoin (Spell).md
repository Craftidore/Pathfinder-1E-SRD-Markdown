You choose a single magical effect or magic item to disjoin. A disjoined spell or magic item is separated into its individual magic components. This ends a spell or spell-like effect in the same manner as *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**.* A permanent magic item is suppressed (inoperative) for 1 round per caster level, and must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's whichever is better.

If you cast this spell on a creature, you can choose to target a specific item or spell effect on that creature. If you do not designate a specific spell effect or item, *disjoin* affects a randomly determined spell effect or magic tiem affecting the creature or in its possession.
