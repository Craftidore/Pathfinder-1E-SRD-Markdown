**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]* on a living creature). The effect is broken if the *halted* creatures are attacked or take damage.
