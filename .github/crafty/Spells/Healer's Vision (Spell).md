*Every thrumming vein, every strained muscle, and every pulsing organ of those nearby becomes visible to your eyes, showing you exactly where to place a healing hand... or a deadly strike.*

You gain a macabre change to your vision that seemingly peels away skin and sinew to reveal the flesh beneath. You gain a +5 insight bonus on Heal checks, and any *cure* spell you cast on a living creature heals 1 extra point of damage per level of the spell.

You also gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when making a precision-based attack (such as a sneak attack or a sudden strike) against a living creature, since you are able to pick out your target’s most vital points. (This effect makes the spell popular among less benevolent casters.) *Healer’s vision* does not grant you the ability to make a precision-based attack if you don’t already have that ability, nor does it allow you to make such attacks against creatures normally unaffected by them.

This spell does not reveal the true forms of creatures affected by illusions or other magical disguises, so it grants no benefit to Heal checks or attacks against such creatures.
