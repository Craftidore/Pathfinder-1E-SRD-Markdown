*At the corners of your vision you see a brightly glowing light. Wherever you look, that area fills with light as bright as a torch.*

This spell causes your eyes to glow with an unearthly radiance. The glow from your eyes provides light as per the *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of you is [[Dazzled|dazzled]] as long as they remain with range. Sightless creatures are unaffected.
