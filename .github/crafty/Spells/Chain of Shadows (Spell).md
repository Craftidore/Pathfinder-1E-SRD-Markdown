Identity, as most people know, is partly the result of material existence. Boundaries become uncertain when the light fades. This spell draws on the opportunities such uncertainty presents.

The caster is always included in this spell, along with whoever else he chooses to include. All the targets must have shadows that touch or overlap with at least one other target, since the effects flow through merged shadows. If the spell succeeds, all of those linked into a* chain of shadows* share their various defensive bonuses - everyone saves and resists with the highest score available to any of them. The effect remains at full strength for the duration of the spell if their shadows continue to touch. If the targets move so that their shadows no longer touch, the bonuses are reduced by one for characters whose shadows are within 10 feet of at least one other target, and by two for those farther away.
