# Draconic Suppression
## Overview
Abjuration

**Level:** Arcanist 5, Sorcerer 5, Witch 5, Wizard 5

**BoXM:** Wizard 10

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One dragon

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Dragonslayer's Handbook, pg. 28

A dragon that fails its saving throw cannot use its breath weapon for the duration of the spell and is treated as one age category younger for determining which special abilities it can use. For example, an ancient green dragon would revert to the special abilities of a very old dragon and lose access to its miasma ability and its dominate person spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on a dragonâ€™s armor class, feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks, saving throws, senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics.
