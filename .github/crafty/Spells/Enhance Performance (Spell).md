*You intone this simple spell and your control over your voice improves, your unruly hair straightens, and your flesh radiates a healthy glow. Youâ€™re ready for showtime.*

You acquire an even greater charisma when you perform. Anyone who hears or views your performance becomes favorably inclined toward you. This spell grants you a +1 competence bonus on your next Charisma-based check involving any one person who saw the performance. This effect lasts for the duration of your performance and up to 1 hour immediately following. You must begin the performance within 1 hour of casting the spell for it to have any effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *songbird* to *enhance performance* to avoid duplication
