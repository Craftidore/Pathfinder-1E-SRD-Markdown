The *antiplant shell* spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.

**Mythic Rule**

Spells or effects that create, summon, enlarge, animate, or otherwise manipulate plants or plant creatures have no effect within a *mythic antiplant shell*. Add your mythic tier to caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of non-mythic plant creatures seeking to enter the *mythic antiplant shell*. Even if you fail to overcome their spell resistance, any plant creatures beginning their turn within a *mythic antiplant shell* takes damage equal to your mythic tier (non-mythic plant creatures take double damage) and takes a penalty equal to half your mythic tier on saving throws.
