The rakshasa, masters of deception, have developed this spell to enhance their powers of disguise. A *cloak of illusion* conceals the caster’s alignment from any form of divination. More important, it shields a shapechanged or magically disguised creature from *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*, causing the disguise to appear to be the caster’s true form. However, this power has one significant restriction: The disguise must be maintained for 6 hours before the power of the cloak takes effect. As such, it is an extremely useful spell for a deep cover agent who rarely shifts his shape—but it is useless to a character casting a *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]* spell that only lasts for a few minutes.

*Errata:* In non-Eberron campaigns, change the arcane focus as follows: 

*Arcane Focus*: A small diamond, worth 50 gp. If this object is ever taken more than 1 foot away from the subject, the spell immediately ends. (WotC website)
