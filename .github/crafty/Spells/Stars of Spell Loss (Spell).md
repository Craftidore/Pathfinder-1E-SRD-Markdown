You create one twinkling star per three levels (maximum five stars). These minute starbursts orbit your head like *ioun stones.* Beginning on the turn you cast the spell, you can launch one star as a swift action at a target you designate within range. You must make a ranged touch attack for each star.

Each time an evil creature is hit by a star, it must make a saving throw or lose a prepared spell or spell slot as if the creature had used it to cast a spell. The level of the lost spell is 4th (or the highest spell level lower than 4th in which the caster has at least one remaining prepared spell or spell slot). If the target prepares spells, determine the specific lost spell randomly. If the creature has spellcasting ability from more than one class (such as a 4th-level cleric/4th-level ranger), determine the affected spellcasting class randomly.

The stars have no effect on nonspellcasters.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *stars of Mystra* to *stars of spell loss’*for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
