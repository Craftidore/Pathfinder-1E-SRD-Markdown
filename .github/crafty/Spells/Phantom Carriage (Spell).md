This spell is similar to *phantom chariot,* except that it conjures four Large, quasi-real horselike creatures drawing a Huge, quasi-real carriage. The carriage can be ridden only by you and up to 5 other persons or by six people for whom you specifically created the chariot. Two people must act as drivers, while four may sit within the enclosed cab.

The steeds have an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. The carriage has a hardness of 8 and 30 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If any steed loses all its hit points or the carriage is reduced to 0 hit points, the *phantom carriage* disappears. A *phantom carriage* has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 320 feet. It can bear its riders' weight plus up to 40 pounds per caster level.

Persons riding within the cab have improved cover (+8 to AC and +4 to Reflex saves) and effectively gain improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies.

The *phantom carriage* gains certain powers according to caster level. A carriage's abilities include those of carriages of lower caster levels.

*11th Level*

The carriage can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

*13th Level*

The carriage can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

*15th Level*

The carriage can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

*17th Level*

The carriage can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).
