You cause living, submerged coral to grow at an accelerated pace in a shape you control. Since you control the form, you can cause the coral to grow into a wall, a large ball, and so forth. You are limited in the size of the new coral, but this is not dependent upon the amount of existing materialâ€”a tiny piece can be used as a starter seed for the new growth, so long as that piece is alive.

*Coral growth* is popular for constructing buildings and statues out of coral in Halruaa. It is also a favorite of various aquatic races for building underwater cities.

*Material Component:* A small piece of coral.
