One of your natural weapons temporarily gains a special ability commonly found on magic weapons. You can choose any special ability whose market price is equivalent to a +1 bonus or up to 10,000 gp, such as *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* or *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]*. The natural weapon does not have to have an existing enhancement bonus, nor does it gain one when you imbue it with this infusion.
