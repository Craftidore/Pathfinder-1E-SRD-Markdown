*You evoke the greater powers of good, and your beard stiffens, turning metallic and reaching halfway down your chest, giving you greater protection.*

Your beard grows and turns to pure and magically hardened silver, providing you with a +2 sacred bonus to AC. If you do not have a beard, you grow one for the duration of this spell (even if you are a creature that cannot normally grow a beard, such as an elf or a female human). You get a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks against dwarves.
