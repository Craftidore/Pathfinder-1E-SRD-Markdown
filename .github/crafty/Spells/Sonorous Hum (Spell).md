*You finish casting this spell, and the area around you is abuzz with a low, droning hum that improves your concentration.*

After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast within the duration that requires concentration to maintain is maintained for you until the *sonorous hum* spell expires. This effect allows you to cast other spells, even another spell that also requires concentration. If the spell maintained by the *sonorous hum* has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would, and you gain no further benefits from this casting of *sonorous hum*. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen) check to detect). You can end the spell as a free action.

For example, you could cast this spell, then cast *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]],* and this spell maintains the concentration on *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* while you cast *[[Discern Lies (Spell)|discern lies]]* and maintain concentration on that spell yourself. You control all aspects of both spells, so you could change the orientation of the *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* effect and select a different target for your *[[Discern Lies (Spell)|discern lies]]* spell in the same round.

If you take damage, you must still make a Concentration check to maintain the spell.
