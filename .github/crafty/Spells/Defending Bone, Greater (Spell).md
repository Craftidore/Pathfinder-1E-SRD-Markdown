You animate a bone with necromantic energy, giving it the power to float near your body and interpose itself against attacks. This gives you damage reduction 10/bludgeoning. Once the bone has prevent a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 200 points), it is destroyed and the spell is discharged. This spell has no effect if you have damage reduction from another source.
