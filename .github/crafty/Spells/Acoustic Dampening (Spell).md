This spell creates an aura of white noise around the target’s senses that reduces the passage of sound. The target gains a +2 bonus on saves vs. sonic and sound‑based effects.

Additionally, the target immediately gains another saving throw against any existing sonic effect (including a harpy’s captivating song, deafness, etc.), if the effect initially granted a save. If this second save is successful, treat the target as if its first save had succeeded.

Each round, at the end of its turn, the target may attempt a new saving throw to end an ongoing sonic effect; this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target also receives a –2 penalty to [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill checks to hear sounds for the spell’s duration.
