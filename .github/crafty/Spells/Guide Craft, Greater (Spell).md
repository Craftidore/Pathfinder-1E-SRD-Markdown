A cart, wagon, boat, or ship moves as you command. The vehicle can be no larger than 100 feet long + 20 feet per level (a 10th-level wizard can steer a 300-foot-long vessel). The craft must have its normal means of locomotion, or you may cast *[[Power Craft (Spell)|power craft]]*. You do not need to concentrate to maintain this effect—so you could cast it on a horse-drawn wagon, command it to “go straight,” and take a nap. The horse will pull the wagon straight until you tell it otherwise or the duration ends.

Unlike *[[Guide Craft (Spell)|guide craft]]*, more complex instructions are possible. While the craft is affected by *greater guide craft*, it responds to situations and commands nearly as well as it would if you were actually at the controls (treat the craft as having half your Int and Wis scores and half your ranks in any relevant skills ([[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] Navigator, [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] Sailor, etc.).
