*Stabbing yourself with a pin fronted by a pair of metallic steel wings, you grow razor-sharp wings of the same material. You gain the ability to fly, natural attacks and a shield bonus.*

You grow a pair of razor-sharp metallic wings. These wings allow you to fly, fight and even shield you in combat to a degree. The table below provides the particulars of these wings.


| |  | **Fly** |  | **Number** | **Damage** | **Threat Range/** | **Shield** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Material** | **Cost** | **Speed** | **Maneuverability** | **of Attacks** | **per Attack** | **Crit Modifier** | **Bonus** |
| Adamantine | 500 g\[ | 80/60 | Perfect (+8) | 3/4 | 1d8 (S) 1d10 (M) | 18-20/x3 | +7 |

*Material:* Metal that pin and wings are composed of.

*Cost:* Cost of the pin (which is consumed upon casting).

*Fly Speed:* Fly speed granted / Fly speed granted if carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor.

*Maneuverability:* Maneuverability rating and Fly skill check modifier

*Number of Attacks:* Using a standard action while not flying you make either a single slash with one wing or take a full attack action to slash with both (treat as natural weapons adding your normal Strength modifier to damage). The wings are considered magic with regard to damage reduction and hardness, using the wings replaces any other attack or full attack action and does not allow additional attacks unless the receipent of the spell has the [[Multiattack (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Multiattack]] feat in which case the receipent may take their normal iterative attacks with either natural or other weapons and add the attacks granted by the spell as additions to their normal attacks.

*Damage per Attack*: Damage done by each wing slash (modified by caster's primary casting attribute modifier modifier).

*Threat Range/Critical Modifier:* Critical threat range and critical damage modifier of each wing slash.

*Shield Bonus:* Shield bonus to AC provided by the wings
