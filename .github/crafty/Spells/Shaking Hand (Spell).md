As *[[Interposing Hand (Spell)|interposing hand]],* except the hand can also grapple the magic hand created by the following spells: *[[Clenched Fist (Spell)|clenched fist]], [[Crushing Hand (Spell)|crushing hand]], [[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]],* and *[[Grasping Hand (Spell)|grasping hand]].* The *shaking hand* gets one grapple attack per round. Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), +9 for the hand’s Strength score (29), +4 for being Large.

Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the *shaking hand* by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the *shaking hand.* In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic hand has a Strength score of 17 + twice the level of the spell. Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your *shaking hand* from attempting another grapple attack.

For example, a wizard uses *shaking hand* to grapple a sorcerer’s *[[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]],* rolls a 10 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for the hand’s Strength score (29), and adds +4 for the hand’s size (Large), for a total of 27. The sorcerer seeks to break the handshake; he rolls a 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own Charisma score (18), adds +8 for the hand’s Strength score (27), and adds +4 for the hand’s size (Large) for a total of 30. The “handshake” (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round. If, however, the sorcerer had rolled a 15 or higher, the handshake would have been broken, at least until the *shaking hand* successfully grappled the *[[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]]* again.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's shaking hand* to *shaking hand* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Also known as *Halaster's shaking hand* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.
