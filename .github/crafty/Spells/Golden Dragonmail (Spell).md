You create a suit of shining golden full plate around your body. The armor is etched with a dragonscale pattern, an image of a gold dragon, or Tormâ€™s holy symbol (your choice when you cast the spell). It is treated as *+1* *[[Mithral|mithral]]** full plate* for all purposes (including arcane spell failure chance), and you are treated as proficient with this armor. Removing or destroying the armor dismisses the spell. This spell has no effect if you are already wearing armor.

Torm the True is served by gold and silver dragons, and some of these dragons are the founders of ancient sorcerer bloodlines among the younger races. If you are a sorcerer, the armor also gives you resistance to fire 10.

*Focus:* A gold coin and a piece of [[Mithral|mithral]] in the shape of a dragonscale.
