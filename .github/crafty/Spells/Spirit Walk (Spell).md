By focusing your energy, you are able to separate your spirit from your body, allowing it to travel anywhere on the same plane of existence. Distance is not a factor, but the locale to be visited in your spirit form must be known - a place familiar to you. While in your spirit form, you can see and hear thing, just as if you were there. You can also be seen and be heard, though you are unable to actually interact in that location. You cannot cast spells through your spirit form, nor does it allow magically enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see up to 10 feet away. Lead sheeting or magical protection (such as *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**,* *[[Mind Blank (Spell)|mind blank]]**,* or *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]**)* blocks you from noticing individuals in the area you have traveled to, though you can feel that your senses are being blocked somehow.

While your spirit is out of your body, your body is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] and completely helpless.

*Arcane Focus:* A quartz or obsidian figurine.
