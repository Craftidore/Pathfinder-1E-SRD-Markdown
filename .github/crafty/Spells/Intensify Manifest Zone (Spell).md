*You reach forth into the essence of the manifested plane, pulling more of its power into the area.*

You enhance the effects of a manifest zone of a specified plane.

The effects of the manifest zone increase by one “step.” Since each zone is different, this can have various effects. A zone that exists in rings (such as the Gloaming in the Eldeen Reaches) has stronger effects as one moves inward; this spell increases the effect of a ring to that of the next inmost. The innermost ring of such a zone instead takes on one trait of the associated plane that it does not already have; in the case of the Gloaming again, the spell confers the mildly negative-dominant trait on that ring. A zone that has a uniform effect over its area takes on one planar trait (of your choice) in the same way.

You cannot further enhance a manifest zone (or a ring within a zone) with additional *intensif y manifest zone* spells.

An *intensify manifest zone* effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**,* *[[Planar Bubble (Spell)|planar bubble]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell.

*Focus:* A gem, piece of precious metal, or concentrated essence of the plane associated with the manifest zone, worth at least 500 gp.

*XP Cost:* 500 XP.
