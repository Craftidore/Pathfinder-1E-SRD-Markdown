This spell is placed on two candles, which the caster must hold at the time of casting. Anything that is spoken into the flame of one candle can be heard issuing from the flame of the other. The candles’ ability to transmit and receive messages works over any distance, provided they’re both on the same plane of existence. Both candles must be lit for the message transfer to occur.

Although the spell’s effect can last for days, a *whispering flame* candle can burn only for a total of 8 hours before it melts away and loses its power, so keeping it lit for long periods of time is inadvisable.

A single candle cannot have more than one *whispering flame* spell cast on it.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
