This spell causes orange, star-like embers to rain steadily from above. Each round, the falling embers deal 10d6 points of damage to evil creatures within the spellâ€™s area. Half of the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]* (fire), *[[Fire Shield (Spell)|fire shield]]** (chill shield),* and similar magic. Creatures may leave the area to avoid taking additional damage, but a new saving throw is required each round a creature is caught in the fiery downpour.

A shield provides a cover bonus on the Reflex save, depending on its size: small +2, large +4, tower +7. A *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]* spell oriented upward provides a +4 cover bonus on the Reflex save. A creature using its shield (or *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]* spell) to block the *rain of embers* cannot use it for defense in combat.

*Sacrifice:* 1d2 points of Strength drain.
