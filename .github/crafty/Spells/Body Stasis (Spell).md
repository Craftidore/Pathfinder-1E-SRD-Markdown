This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Body Stasis, Lesser (Spell)|lesser body stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being [[Blinded|blinded]], diseased, [[Fatigued|fatigued]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], or [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]].

Subjects of this spell cannot be flanked, regardless of the position of their enemies when the spell is cast. This immunity to being flanked can be overcome by a rogue 4 levels higher than the subject as usual.

This spell also prevents all Strength and Dexterity drain received during its duration.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
