When you cast this spell, the subject creature temporarily transforms into a being of evil, serving you for the duration of the spell. The animal’s limbs and face contort, it sprouts tusks and bone spurs through its skin, and its eyes turn completely black. The animal gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and a +2 bonus to natural armor. Furthermore, the damage of its natural attacks increases as if it were one size category larger. An *unholy beast* serves you as if it were under the influence of a *[[Dominate Animal (Spell)|dominate animal]]* spell.
