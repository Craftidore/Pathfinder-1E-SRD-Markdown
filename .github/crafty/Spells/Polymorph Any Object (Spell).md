This spell functions like *[[Polymorph, Greater (Spell)|greater polymorph]]*, except that it changes one object or creature into another. You can use this

spell to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new forms—you aren’t limited to transforming a living creature into another living form. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its transmuted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines.


| **Changed Subject Is…** | **Increase to**<br>**Duration Factor\*** |
|---|---|
| Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral) | +5 |
| Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.) | +2 |
| Same size | +2 |
| Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) | +2 |
| Same or lower Intelligence | +2 |

  \*Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table.


| **Duration Factor** | **Duration** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 20 minutes | Pebble to human |
| 2 | 1 hour | Marionette to human |
| 4 | 3 hours | Human to marionette |
| 5 | 12 hours | Lizard to manticore |
| 6 | 2 days | Sheep to wool coat |
| 7 | 1 week | Shrew to manticore |
| 9+ | Permanent | Manticore to shrew |

If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), this spell grants a base score of 10 to each missing ability score. If the target of the spell does not have mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), this spell grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren’t affected by this spell.

This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.

This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of *[[Baleful Polymorph (Spell)|baleful polymorph]]**,* *[[Polymorph, Greater (Spell)|greater polymorph]]**,* *[[Flesh to Stone (Spell)|flesh to stone]]**, [[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]], [[Transmute Mud to Rock (Spell)|transmute mud to rock]],* *[[Transmute Metal to Wood (Spell)|transmute metal to wood]]**,* or *[[Transmute Rock to Mud (Spell)|transmute rock to mud]]*.

**GM Note**

**What properties of polymorph are inherited for the spell *polymorph any object* (PH 263)?** The guidelines suggest that it overrides the normal rules for creature type (an object isn’t any type of creature) and Hit Die limits (turning a pebble into a human or a shrew into a manticore, for example), but the spell doesn’t explicitly describe the changes.

You correctly note that *polymorph any object* isn’t as clear as it could be. The intent of the spell, however, becomes clear by reading the accompanying charts. *Polymorph any object* retains all the limitations of *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]* except as follows:

- It can affect an object, and also adds “object” to the list of new forms allowed. It doesn’t add any more eligible creature types for the new form (you couldn’t use *polymorph any object* to assume the form of a construct, elemental, outsider, or undead).
- The assumed form still can’t have more Hit Dice than your caster level (to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level), but the secondary limit of the subject’s original HD doesn’t apply. A pebble (with no HD) or a lizard (with 1 HD) can be transformed into any form whose HD don’t exceed 15 or the caster’s level, whichever is lower. The new form can even have no HD at all (as in the case of a creature polymorphed into an object).
