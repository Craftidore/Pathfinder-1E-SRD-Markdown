Around a subject you create a halo that can sustain 5 points of damage per caster level. All incoming damage (normal or nonlethal hit point damage but not ability score damage) is subtracted from the halo before any of it reaches the target. As long as the halo has any hit points left, it absorbs the entire attack. Thus, if a 10th-level cleric casts *halo of shelter* upon a subject, the halo has 50 hp. If the subject is then struck by a sword for 18 points of damage, the halo has 32 hp left. If the target then falls into a pit and suffers 20 points of damage, he sustains no damage himself and the halo has 10 hp left. If the subject then finds himself in the area of a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* that inflicts 24 points of damage, the halo is destroyed, but he remains unscathed.

The halo also blocks effects that accompany a damaging attack, such as a poisonous bite or the effects of an *axe of wounding*.

The subject of the *halo of shelter* glows (particularly around the head) with divine energy that illuminates a 5-foot radius.

Damage from artifacts, spells of 8th level (BoXM: 15th level) or above, and +5 weapons bypass the halo. The halo does not protect against nondamaging attacks like *[[Cause Fear (Spell)|cause fear]]**,* gaze attacks, or *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* (although it would absorb the damage inflicted by a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell if the subjectâ€™s save succeeds).
