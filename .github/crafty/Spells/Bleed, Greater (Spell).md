*Your touch thins the blood of your target, causing it to spill with unnatural ease.*

For the duration of the spell, the subject bleeds profusely through any open wound. Each new hit from a piercing or slashing weapon or effect that deals damage to the subject also deals 1 point of Constitution damage. This ability damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.

Because this spell thins the subject’s blood, repeated uses cause additional difficulty. In addition to the extra damage, a target subjected to a second use of this spell before the first has expired also takes a –4 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease, poison, or the [[Sickened|sickened]] and [[Nauseated|nauseated]] conditions. Creatures with no discernible anatomy (such as plants and oozes) and those immune to critical hits (such as undead and constructs) are immune to this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *bleed* to *greater bleed* to avoid duplication.

                        Added Assassin 4 to Level.
