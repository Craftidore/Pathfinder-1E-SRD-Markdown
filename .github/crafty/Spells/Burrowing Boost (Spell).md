This spell gives any affected creature a burrow speed of 10 ft. per round. When the spellâ€™s duration ends, the target becomes exhausted and cannot have this spell cast on it again until it loses this condition. The targets can burrow through dirt, stone, or any kind of earth except for metal. The burrowing leaves behind a tunnel the same size as the target (Small, Medium, Large, and so on) and disturbs the ground with ripples if it is within 20 ft. of the surface.

A *move earth* spell cast on the target while burrowing flings the target back 20 ft., stunning the creature for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Evil overlords and taskmasters often employ multiple casters to speed up mining operations using this spell.
