*You picture with your mind’s eye the target weapon returning to its owner. Upon completion of the spell, the weapon glows with a dull yellow radiance.*

The *hurl* spell enhances one melee weapon so that it returns to the thrower after being thrown. For the duration of the spell, when thrown, the weapon returns to its wielder at the beginning of the wielder’s next action. The weapon returns whether it hit or missed its target. On its return, the thrown weapon hovers for 1 round next to the wielder and can then be seized and thrown again. After 1 round, the weapon falls to the ground. The weapon returns to its wielder only if thrown; it doesn’t automatically fly back if dropped or seized by another creature. (An improvised weapon or a weapon not designed for throwing has a range increment of 10 feet.) Throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action.
