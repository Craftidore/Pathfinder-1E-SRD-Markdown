This spell makes your eyes glow with white light and allows you to see evil auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to a *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]* spell, but does not require concentration and discerns aura location and strength more quickly.

You know the location and strength of all evil auras within your sight. An auraâ€™s strength depends on the type and Hit Dice of any evil creature, as noted in the description of the *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]* spell.
