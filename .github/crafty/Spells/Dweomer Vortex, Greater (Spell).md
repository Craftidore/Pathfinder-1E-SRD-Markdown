*A shimmering, conical field of swirling magical energy forms before you. The pointed end is attached to you, and the rest of the cone twirls around you, like a magic-hungry serpent searching for an opportunity to strike. This cone moves in response to your mental commands.*

This spell creates a spinning cone of arcane energy that can negate spells or spell-like abilities it comes in contact with.

Any spell or spell-like ability of 9th level or lower that targets you or that has you within its area is automatically countered.

Also, as a swift action, you can have the spellâ€™s cone reach out to a single target creature or 5-foot square that is up to 60 feet away and within line of sight. Without the need for an attack roll or dispel check, the *greater dweomer vortex* dispels any spell or spell-like ability currently affecting the target creature or area. If the target creature or area has more than one spell or spell-like ability in effect upon it, *greater dweomer vortex* starts by dispelling the lowest-level spell (choose between spells of the same level randomly) and continues to dispel additional, higher-level spells until it reaches its limit (see below).

Once the *greater dweomer vortex* negates one level of spells per level of its caster, it is discharged, vanishing in a harmless whirl of winking motes. 0-level spells count as 1st-level spells for this purpose.

**GM Note**

*Spell Secret:* At least two spellcasters are known to have crafted a variant of this spell that only targets a specific spell to be automatically countered. This is a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 50). One of these casters uses this variant specifically to defend against *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage's disjunction]].*
