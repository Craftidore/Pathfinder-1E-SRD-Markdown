*The creature you point at explodes in a massive spray of fire.*

If the target fails its saving throw, this spell slays the creature, and the explosion extends out to a 20-foot-radius burst around it. Creatures in this area take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), though they can attempt Reflex saves for half damage. The exploded creatureâ€™s remains are scattered and vaporized, leaving nothing but dry ash.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, it is wracked by a series of small explosions and takes 7d6 points of fire damage. If this damage kills the creature, it explodes as described above.

*Detonation* has no effect on creatures that have immunity to fire.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *detonate* to *detonation* to avoid duplication.
