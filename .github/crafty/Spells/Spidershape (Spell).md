You change yourself into a Large monstrous spider. Your type changes to vermin. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a Large monstrous spider but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the spider’s bite damage, Armor Class, speed, climb ability, poison, webs, darkvision, and tremorsense. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the spider’s racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You can speak and cast spells with only verbal components. You can use disciplines that do not require a free hand.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *spidershape*, but it is nonfunctional.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *spider's form* to *spidershape* to avoid duplication.
