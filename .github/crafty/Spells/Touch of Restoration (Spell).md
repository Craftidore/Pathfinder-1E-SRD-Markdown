*When you pray for the power to restore that which your friend has lost, a beam of sun breaks through the clouds and bathes your hands in golden light.*

Casting *touch of restoration* lets you use your lay on hands ability to cure ability damage. While this spell is active, you can cure 1 point of ability damage per caster level by laying on hands, and you can split these points among different creatures if desired.

For every point of ability damage you cure in this manner, you must subtract 1 from your effective level when determining how many hit points of damage you can heal with your standard lay on hands ability for the remainder of the day.
