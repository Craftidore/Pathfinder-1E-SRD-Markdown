You provide a source of locomotion for a cart, wagon, boat, or ship. The vehicle can be no larger than 10 feet long + 5 feet per level (so a 9th-level wizard can power a 55-foot-long vessel). The vehicle can move at any speed up to its normal maximum speed as if it had a natural source of locomotion. Thus, a carriage could be made to move without a horse pulling it, up to the speed it could normally attain with a horse to pull it. Likewise, a sailing ship moves as if powered by a favorable wind. Prevailing conditions—wind, inclines, and so on—affect movement normally. Thus, this spell cannot move a sailing ship against a gale-force wind.

This spell merely provides motive power. It in no way bestows guidance or steerage. When made permanent, the motive power is always there, it is merely active or inactive based upon the desire of whoever is guiding or steering.

*Greater power craft* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
