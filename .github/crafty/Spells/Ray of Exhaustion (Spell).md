A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately [[Exhausted|exhausted]] for the spell’s duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only [[Fatigued|fatigued]].

A character that is already [[Fatigued|fatigued]] instead becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]].

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [[Exhausted|exhausted]]. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell’s duration expires.
