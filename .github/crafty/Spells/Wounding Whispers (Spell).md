*The words of this spell produce hissing, sibilant echoes that spin around you, invoking doom upon those who dare to harm you.*

Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Weapons with reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way.

You cannot use this spell to deal damage to another target (for instance, with an unarmed attack or by forcing the whispers against a target). Only if another creature touches you does the effect deal damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
