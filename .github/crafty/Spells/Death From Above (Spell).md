# Death From Above (Spell)
## Overview

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Target:** One creature

The subject gains the musculature and attacking ability of a hunting cat.

The subject of the spell receives a +30 enhancement bonus on all [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks (which does not stack with the effects of the *[[Jump (Spell)|jump]]* spell), and its base speed increases by 30 feet. Additionally, if the subject can leap onto an opponent during combat, it can take the full attack action even if it has already taken a move action.

The first attack of each leaping attack does double damage if successful (and this extends to any critical that occurs, extending the critical modifier by x1).
