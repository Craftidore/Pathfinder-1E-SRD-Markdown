Creatures with the cold subtype are immune to the effects of *lesser shivering touch.*

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* There has been much discussion on the WotC forums (as well as several others) regarding this spell; best to look at it simply as RAW (Rule as Written): It does 1d6 points dexterity damage for a period of 1 round/level. At the end of duration, the dexterity damage goes away.
