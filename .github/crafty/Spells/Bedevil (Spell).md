You summon a mischievous spirit and send it to bedevil your enemy. The spirit seeks out its assigned victim wherever she might be, as long as she is on the same plane as you when you cast the spell. It then proceeds to irritate and annoy her through a variety of manifestations. The victim of a *bedevil* spell finds herself constantly seeing movement out of the corner of her eye. Her sleep is frequently interrupted by bed shaking and blanket shifting and the sounds of voices that fade upon waking. When spellcasting, she suffers a variety of minor irritations that threaten to disrupt her spells, and she constantly feels haunted and watched. The result of this bedevilment is that she takes a –1 penalty on all ability checks, skill checks, and Will saving throws and has a 5% chance of arcane spell failure (which stacks with any spell failure chance from armor worn).

*[[Detect Evil (Spell)|Detect evil]]* cast upon the subject of this spell reveals the presence of the bedeviling spirit, while *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]* keeps the spirit from adversely affecting the victim. A *[[Dispel Evil (Spell)|dispel evil]]* spell destroys the mischievous spirit, but *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* or similar magic has no effect on it.

*Material Components:* A tiny iron statuette of a devil or imp, plus either a drop of the intended victim’s blood or one personal article belonging to the intended victim.
