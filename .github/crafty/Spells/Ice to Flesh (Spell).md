This spell restores a frozen creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any frozen creature, regardless of size, can be restored.

The spell also can convert a mass of ice into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, an ordinary ice sculpture would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of ice.
