*With a faint shimmering and a rushing breeze, an ornate carriage appears on the street, pulled by four snorting, faintly translucent horses.*

You conjure up a carriage capable of seating four passengers comfortably or six in cramped conditions, as well as the horses needed to pull it. These “horses” are similar to those created by the *[[Phantom Steed (Spell)|phantom steed]]* spell, though they do not gain any of the special, level-based abilities conferred by that spell. They respond to your thoughts alone, and they can pull the carriage at a speed of up to 50 feet.

The carriage resists flames as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants). The interior contains lush, cushioned seats. The side windows can be opened to allow for missile fire or spellcasting. If the windows are open, everyone inside is considered to have cover, but they are not impervious to missiles as they would otherwise be.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell is known as *Leomund's spacious carriage.*
