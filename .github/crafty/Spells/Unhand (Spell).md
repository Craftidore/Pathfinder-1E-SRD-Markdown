This spell allows you to attempt to disarm a creature with a blast of force. You and the defender make opposed rolls. You make a caster level check adding both your Dexterity modifier and your Intelligence modifier (d20 + caster level + Dexterity modifier + Intelligence modifier). The defender uses his attack bonus with the weapon in question (if the object is not a weapon, use the defender’s base attack bonus plus Strength modifier). The size of the weapon or object is irrelevant. If the defender uses his weapon in two hands, he gets an additional +4 bonus.

If you beat the defender’s check, the defender is disarmed. The object falls to the ground at the defender’s feet.

**GM Note**

*Spell Secret:* You actually move the object away from the defender with a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] DC 35;  instead of falling to the ground at the defender's feet, you cause the object to fly away, landing a distance equal to d20 + your caster level + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier in any direction you desire. Any obstruction more substantial than 1 inch of wood causes the object to drop to the ground.
