*A spectral human hand springs into existence. It pushes into the target, forcing him back as he attempts to move.*

This spell creates a hand of pure force that hinders the subject’s ability to move. You designate a target when casting this spell. You can change the spell’s target by taking a move action to do so. This spell has no effect on Huge or larger creatures.

If the target of the spell attempts to move, it must make a Strength check (DC 12 + your key ability modifier). If this check fails, the creature moves at half speed. The target must make a new check each round to overcome the hand’s hindering force.

The hand is about 1 foot long. It has hit points equal to half your full normal hit points, and its AC is 20 (+4 size, +6 natural). It makes saving throws using your total save bonuses and takes damage from spells and attacks as normal.

GM Note

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting this spell is known as *Bigby's warding hand.*
