*Green and yellow sparks fly off your body as a light breeze picks up, lifting loose debris and swirling around with a faint howl.*

This spell speeds the flow of magic through you, hastening your spellcasting ability. Casting times for arcane spells are reduced as follows:


| **Normal**<br>**Casting Time** | **New**<br>**Casting Time** |
|---|---|
| 1 standard action | 1 swift action |
| 1 full round | 1 standard action |
| 2â€“10 rounds | 1 round less than normal |

*Arcane spellsurge* has no effect on any spell with a casting time of greater than 1 minute or a casting time not listed on the table.

You can't choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can't opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can't take more than one swift action in a round, you won't be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of *arcane spellsurge*. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round.) However, a sorcerer or other spontaneous arcane caster could cast a metamagic spell (as a standard action) and a normal spell (as a swift action) in the same round.

This spell doesn't stack with any other effect that reduces a spell's casting time.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype (Dragon Magic 4), you can cast this spell as a swift action.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell works in conjunction with the [[Spontaneous Casting (Feat)|Spontaneous Casting]] feat, reducing the time for the exchange of spells down to a swift action and allowing the exchanged spell to be cast as a 1 standard action in the same round it was exchanged.
