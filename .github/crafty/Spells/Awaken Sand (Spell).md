You awaken a region of sand, or similar material, to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a DC 18 Will save. The *awakened* sand is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with sand you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desire to it.

The sand creature you awaken has the same statistics as a Huge animated object with a base land speed of 40 feet and a burrow speed of 20 feet. Unlike normal animated objects, *awakened* sand beings have the earth subtype, and their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. A sand being has immunity to polymorphing. The awakened sand can speak one language you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any) it has.

A sand creature can engulf Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The sand creature merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents are considered [[Grappled|grappled]] and are trapped within the sand creature’s body. The sand creature deals 1d6+3 points of damage to trapped opponents each round after the one in which it engulfed them. Opponents that need to breathe risk suffocation. The save DC is Strength-based.

Sand creatures are amorphous and can do anything sand would be expected to do—hide perfectly atop other sand, form into dunes and drifts, and pour through small openings (although passing through an opening two size categories smaller than the creature takes a full-round action).
