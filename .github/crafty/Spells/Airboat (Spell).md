You cast this spell on a cloud within one mile. It rapidly approaches you, forming a vessel of your imagining. It can hold up to one large sized creature per level of the caster, or more smaller creatures (double number for each decrease of in size- so two medium creatures/level, four small creatures/level, etc.) The airboat can move 5 mph/level, directed by your mental commands (changing course is a standard action). When you are not concentrating on the airboat it continues following your last mental command. The airboatâ€™s maneuverability is clumsy. If it has not done so sooner, one minute before it is to expire the airboat will descend to the ground to allow passengers to disembark.

*Note:* An *airboat* can be boarded by other creatures up to its maximum capacity, but excess creatures find it is not solid enough to support them.

**GM Note**

This is a conversion of a spell from the Wizard's Spell Compendium Vol. 1 (WotC), pg. 29
