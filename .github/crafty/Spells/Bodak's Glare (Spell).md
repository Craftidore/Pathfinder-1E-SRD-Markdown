*You invoke the powers of deep darkness and your eyes vanish, looking like holes in the universe itself*.

Upon completion of the spell, you target a creature within range that can see you. That creature dies instantly unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.

The target need not meet your gaze. If you slay a humanoid creature with this attack, 24 hours later it transforms into a bodak unless it has been resurrected in the meantime. The bodak is not under your command, but can be controlled as normal with a rebuke undead check.
