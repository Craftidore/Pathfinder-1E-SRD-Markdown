This spell allows you to drive off elementals of a specific type by uttering a fearsome cry. When you cast the spell, any elemental within the spell’s area must leave the area unless it makes a successful Will save. If you try to force the barrier against an elemental that has failed its saving throw, the spell fails.

*Material Component:* A small quantity of the element opposed to the type being warded against—fire for water elementals, earth for air elementals, air for earth elementals, or water for fire elementals.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Nature 4 to Level per Oriental Adventures; added Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4 to Level.
