*You finish the last detail and lean back to look at your work. The tattoo looks good. It should prove useful.*

This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo—at least 1 rank of [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (drawing), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (painting), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (calligraphy), or a similar [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check. The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below.

If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects ([[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] DC 10).

- +2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will).
- +1 luck bonus on attack rolls.
- +1 deflection bonus to AC.

At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe ([[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] DC 15).

- +2 resistance bonus on saving throws.
- +2 competence bonus on attack rolls.

When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe ([[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] DC 20).

Spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 per three caster levels.

- +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score.
- +1 spellcaster level. This effect increases the subject’s effective level, but not the total number of spells. For example, an 11th-level caster who receives this tattoo functions as a 12th-level caster for the purpose of determining level-based spell variables (such as range, area, effect, and so on), but he does not receive any extra spells.

A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails.

A successful *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell removes a single magic tattoo. A successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing them.

*Material Components:* Tattoo inks in appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp.

*Focus:* Tattoo needles.
