You create a phantom to perform certain tasks for you. When you cast this spell, choose either phantom craftsman, phantom professional, phantom performer, or phantom researcher. 

If you choose phantom craftsman, you can instruct it to work on a single crafting project. The phantom craftsman makes a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (for magical construction) check of the appropriate type using your bonus (maximum +10) for the day’s work. The phantom craftsman is treated as having any item creation feats you possess, and you can expend spells to create the item for the phantom craftsman, allowing you to pursue other activities or aid the phantom craftsman in producing the item. Alternatively you can have the phantom craftsman aid (cf. aid another action) you on a crafting project.

If you choose phantom professional, you may command it to perform a single professional task, making a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] check of the appropriate type using your bonus (maximum +10) for a day’s work and earning the appropriate amount of gold, based on the check result. If you choose phantom performer, you may choose to have it perform alone, making a Perform check of the appropriate type at using your bonus (maximum +10) and earning an appropriate amount of gold. 

If you prefer, you may instead choose to join the phantom performer, each making a Perform check of the appropriate type and using the higher of your 2 rolls to determine the amount of gold earned (the phantom performer still uses your bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +10). 

If you choose the phantom researcher, you can instruct it to work on a single spell research project and it is treated as having any research related feats or abilities you possess, and you can expend spells to assist in that research (even if the spells in question have a target of personal). The phantom researcher makes the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks just as if it were you.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Artificer 1 to Level.

*House Rule:* You can have multiple *phantom workers* working on separate projects but each casting takes an hour and they cannot work on the same project unless you possess either the [[Cooperative Crafting (Feat)|Cooperative Crafting]] or [[Cooperative Research (Feat)|Cooperative Research]] feats.

*House Rule:* Any spells (cf. *[[Canny Effort (Spell)|canny effort]]*, *[[Craftsmanship, Lesser (Spell)|lesser craftsmanship]]*, *[[Instant Knowledge (Spell)|instant knowledge]]*, *[[Investigative Mind (Spell)|investigative mind]]*, *[[Magecraft (Spell)|magecraft]], [[Maestro's Favor (Spell)|maestro's favor]]*, *[[Magician's Workshop (Spell)|magician's workshop]]**)*

the crafter casts to enhance his chances of successfully creating the desired item also affect the chances of a *phantom worker* (cast by the crafter).

This version of the spell is considered errata and replaces the one originally published and was taken from the Necromancer's of the Northwest forums. An alternate version of this spell also published there offers the option of making each type of worker into a separate spell with the same statistics.
