*The door squeaks slightly as you force it. You pause and wave your finger in a pattern along the opening and it silences.*

This simple cantrip negates the sound of opening and closing a single portal (door, window, gate, drawer, chest lid, or the like). Even the squeakiest door opens without a sound when under the effect of this spell. *Silent portal* covers only the normal means of opening and closing the targeted portal. Breaking a window or kicking in a door still makes noise, but opening a door that is loosely hanging by its hinges does not (since this is the normal way a door would be opened). Portals composed of magical energy are not affected by this spell. 

In the case of magic or even intelligent portals, spell resistance and a Will save (DC 10 + casterâ€™s ability modifier + other modifiers as appropriate) apply.
