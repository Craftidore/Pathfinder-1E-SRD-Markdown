You release a joyous, boisterous laugh that strengthens the resolve of good creatures and weakens the resolve of evil creatures.

Good creatures within the spell’s area gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell: a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+20 at caster level 20th).

Evil creatures within the spell’s area that fail a Will save take a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls and saves against fear effects for the duration of the spell.

Creatures must be able to hear the laugh to be affected by the spell. Creatures that are neither good nor evil are unaffected by *boisterious laugh*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Chaav's laugh* to *boisterous noise* for campaign continuity.
