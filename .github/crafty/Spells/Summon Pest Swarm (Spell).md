*With a cacophony of shrieks and squeals, a horde of flying, running, and crawling pests appears from the shadows and swarms across your foes.*

*Summon pest swarm* creates a horde of small mammals, birds, and vermin that appear throughout the target area, tear into any creature present, then move in a crawling mass at your volition.

The pest swarm stays in one place unless you actively direct it (a move action for you). If the pest swarm moves beyond the spellâ€™s range, it disappears. It takes actions at the beginning of your turn. The pest swarm attacks any creature other than you that occupies all or part of its space.
