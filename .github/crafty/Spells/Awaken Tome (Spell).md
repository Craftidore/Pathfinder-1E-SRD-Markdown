You awaken your spellbook to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + your current level). The awakened spellbook is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with the spellbook you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it.

An awakened spellbook has characteristics as if it were an intelligent item. It also gains the ability to move its pages and propel itself across the ground at a base movement speed of 5 feet. It possesses language and senses similar to a humanâ€™s senses. An awakened spellbook can speak one language you know plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence (if any).

An awakened spellbook gains 3d6 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as well as an additional 2d6 hit points.

Awakened spellbooks have distinctive personalities of their own. These personalities can reflect the personality of the caster, spells contained within, or be completely random. Some example personalities include: cautious, crazy, curious, helpful, ornery, passionate, philosophical, or sarcastic.

*XP Cost:* 250 XP

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: The bonded book of a Poleheira Adherent wizard no longer becomes an ordinary book upon the wizard's death; rather it has a chance (equal to the combined level and intelligence of the Poleheira Adherent wizard) to become a unique free-willed intelligent magic item. If the wizard has any sort of preparation that will result in their subsequent return to life (or undeath) then this will not happen even if they are not successful.
