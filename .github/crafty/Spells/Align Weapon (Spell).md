*Align weapon* makes a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.

You canâ€™t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. When you make a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, align weapon is a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful spell, respectively.

**Mythic Rule**

The target weapon gains a +1 sacred (if good) or profane (if evil) bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures of the opposite alignment. Lawful or chaotic weapons may gain either a sacred or profane bonus, chosen when the spell is cast. In addition, if a creature struck by the weapon has multiple types of damage reduction that include the alignment type of the weapon (e.g., DR 10/cold iron and good), reduce the value of that damage reduction by an amount equal to your mythic tier even if your weapon would not normally overcome damage reduction of that type.

**Augmented (6th):** If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant the target weapon the *[[Anarchic (MagWpnSpcAb)|anarchic]]**,* *[[Axiomatic (MagWpnSpcAb)|axiomatic]]**,* *[[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]]**,* or *[[Unholy (MagWpnSpcAb)|unholy]]* magical weapon property for the duration of the effect.

**GM NOTE**

This spell also affects siege engines and siege engine ammunition.
