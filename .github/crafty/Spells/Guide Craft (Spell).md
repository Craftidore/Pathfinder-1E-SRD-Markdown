A cart, wagon, boat, or ship moves as you command. The vehicle can be no larger than 10 feet long + 2 feet per level (thus, a 10th-level wizard can steer a 30-foot-long vessel). The craft must have its normal means of locomotion, or you may cast *[[Power Craft (Spell)|power craft]]*. You do not need to concentrate to maintain this effect—so you could cast it on a horse-drawn wagon, command it to “go straight,” and take a nap. The horse will pull the wagon straight until you tell it otherwise or the duration ends.

The spell does not imbue a craft (or the animals pulling it) with intelligence. It cannot avoid obstacles that you do not tell it to avoid. Nor can it follow a command that requires intelligence, such as, “Sail to the port city of Andrecon” or even, “Follow the road.” Only simple instructions work, such as “straight,” “left,” “right,” and so on.
