The spell deals 2d6 points of temporary Charisma damage and 1d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage immediately, and another 1d6 points of temporary Charisma damage 1 minute later. A successful Will save negates each instance of damage.

*Soul scour* is not a poison and cannot be ameliorated or neutralized by spells that halt poison damage.
