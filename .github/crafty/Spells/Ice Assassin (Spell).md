The *ice assassin* spell is in many ways an improved version of *[[Simulacrum (Spell)|simulacrum]]*. Developed by powerful frost mages who have more than their fair share of enemies to fight, an *ice assassin* is an effective way to destroy an enemy without putting yourself at risk.

An *ice assassin* spell creates a living, breathing creature that is a near-perfect duplicate of an existing creature. The duplicate is formed entirely out of ice, but once the spell is in effect, it appears as an exact duplicate to all but its source, who always sees the *ice assassin* as an animated ice statue of himself. The *ice assassin* possesses all the skills, abilities, and memories possessed by the original, but its personality is warped and twisted by an all-consuming need to slay the original. It also constantly uses *[[Locate Creature (Spell)|locate creature]]* on its duplicate at a caster level equal to your own. If its quarry is outside the range of this effect, the *ice assassin* must rely on its own cleverness or advice from you to track the original.

The *ice assassin* has the cold subtype. Creatures familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check. You must make a [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check (gaining a +10 circumstance bonus from the power of the spell) when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.

The *ice assassin* is under your absolute command. You possess a telepathic link to the *ice assassin*, and when you concentrate, you receive a clear image of the area surrounding the *ice assassin* as if you were scrying it. Further, you can have any spell you cast on yourself affect the *ice assassin* as well; this includes spells with a target of “You” only. These benefits persist as long as you and the *ice assassin* remain within a mile of each other. If the *ice assassin* travels beyond this range, it continues to function and seek out its nemesis, but you have no direct control over it.

An *ice assassin* has no ability to become more powerful; it cannot increase its level or abilities. Damage caused to the *ice assassin* can be repaired only via a complex process requiring 1 day, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory. If the *ice assassin* is reduced to 0 hit points by any damage except for fire damage, it explodes into a burst of icy shrapnel in a 20-foot radius that causes 1d6 points of cold damage for every two caster levels you possess; a successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage. An *ice assassin* slain by fire damage simply melts into a pool of water.

*Material Component:* This spell is cast over the ice statue of the creature to be duplicated. Some portion of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, and so on) must be placed inside the ice statue as it is constructed. In addition, the spell requires powdered diamond worth 20,000 gp.
