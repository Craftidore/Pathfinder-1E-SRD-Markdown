This spell causes a sudden and violent current to tear through all liquids in the spell's area. Water in open containers splashes outward; open containers carried by creatures do not spill if their carrier makes a Fortitude saving throw.

The currents created by this spell in larger bodies of water (or other liquid) are quite strong. All creatures in contact with the water must make a Fortitude saving throw or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *undertow to ripcurrent* to avoid duplication.
