*You infuse the creature touched with raw chaos channeled from the Abyss. Somehow it looks more fiendish than before.*

The subject immediately gains one Abyssal heritor feat for which it qualifies, chosen by you at the time of casting. If the subject does not qualify for the designated feat, the spell fails. This Abyssal heritor feat replaces one feat of the subjectâ€™s choice that it already possesses. The replaced feat need not have been an Abyssal heritor feat. If the lost feat was a prerequisite for other feats or prestige classes, the subject loses access to those feats or prestige class abilities until it once again meets all the prerequisites.

Once the subject has the Abyssal heritor feat, only a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**,* *[[Shun the Dark Chaos (Spell)|shun the dark chaos]]**,* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell can reverse the change.

*XP Cost:* 250 XP.
