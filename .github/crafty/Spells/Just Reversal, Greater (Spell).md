When a foe casts an enchantment (charm) upon you while you’re under the effects of *greater just reversal*, make a saving throw as normal for the charm. If you succeed, the foe must immediately make a saving throw as if you had cast the charm upon him (with the same Difficulty Check you faced). Should the foe fail the save, the charm takes effect as if you had cast it upon him.
