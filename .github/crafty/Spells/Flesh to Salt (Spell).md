You call the essence of salt forth in the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). If the target takes more than half of its current hit points in damage from the spell, it must make a Fortitude saving throw or its body completely crystallizes. The subject, but not its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If a statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject has similar damage or deformities if ever returned to its original state. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as *[[Deathwatch (Spell)|deathwatch]]**.*

The transformed creature takes on the consistency of rock salt (hardness 2, 5 hp per inch of thickness). Salt statues are extremely susceptible to dissolution by waterâ€”if exposed to flooding or heavy rain, they take damage that is not reduced by hardness. A constant blast of water (for example, a geyser from a *[[Decanter of Endless Water|decanter of endless water]]*) deals 10 points of damage per minute. A steady rain deals 1 point of damage per minute.

A *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]]* spell affects salt as if it were stone, returning an affected creature to its original state.
