This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. *Tongues* does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who donâ€™t speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way.

*Tongues* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
