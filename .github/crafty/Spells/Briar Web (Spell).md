*With a sound like a thousand knives being unsheathed, the plants in the area grow sharp thorns and warp into a thick briar patch.*

This spell causes grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees to grow thorns and wrap and twist around creatures in or entering the area. The spellâ€™s area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures move at half speed within the affected area. Any creature moving through the area also takes 1 point of nonmagical piercing damage for each 5 feet moved.

A creature with *[[Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]* or the woodland stride ability is unaffected by this spell.
