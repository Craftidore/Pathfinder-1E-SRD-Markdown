This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spellâ€™s area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

**GM NOTE**

This powerful spell becomes even more so when linked with an *[[Arcane Engine (Spell)|arcane engine]]* spell. Doing so allows a clever caster to make his tower (for example) nearly impervious to snooping.
