You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the [[Blinded|blinded]] condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as *[[Create Water (Spell)|create water]]* or *hydraulic push*) removes all the mud in 1 round.

A *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*. *[[Slow (Spell)|Slow]]* does not stack with the effects of *slowing mud*. This spell cannot counter or dispel *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*.
