*Hoping that your friend will not have need of the spell, you ensure that his death in the coming battle won’t result in an even greater abomination.*

The subject does not rise as an undead spawn should it perish from an undead’s attack that normally would turn it into a spawn, such as from the bite of a ghoul. This spell doesn’t prevent the subject from perishing or provide anything other than insurance that the subject’s body and spirit cannot be hijacked by an acquisitive undead creature.

The protection applies if the duration is still in effect when the subject first dies; the spell need not linger in its effect during the period immediately prior to a spawn’s rise. This spell cannot be cast on the body of a creature that has already been killed by a spawn-creating undead.
