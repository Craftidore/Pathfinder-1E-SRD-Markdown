**Saving Throw:** None

**Source:** Unapproachable East (WotC), pg. 49

You conjure into existence a quarterstaff of force, approximately 8 feet long and 2 inches in diameter. The *decastave* lasts only so long as you keep it in hand; if you give it to another character or drop it, it vanishes. (You can cast other spells with somatic components by holding the staff in one hand.)

You can use the *decastave* in combat to strike with a melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage per hit. Since the *decastave* is made of force, it affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally (provided you can see such creatures). The *decastave* possesses the *[[Thundering (MagWpnSpcAb)|thundering]]* weapon ability and deals 1d8 points of bonus sonic damage on a critical hit. Subjects dealt a critical hit by the *decastave* must also succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be [[Deafened|deafened]] permanently.
