*Utterdark* spreads outward from you, creating an area of cold, cloying magical darkness. This darkness is similar to that created by the *[[Deeper Darkness (Spell)|deeper darkness]]* spell, but it cannot be dispelled by magical light (although a *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell or similar effect of equal or higher level can temporarily suppress the *utterdark* where their areas overlap, restoring normal illumination to the affected area for as long as the *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell or effect lasts). Furthermore, evil-aligned creatures can see in this darkness as if it were simply a dimly lighted area.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:*****  Added Demonic 8 to Level per Book of Vile Darkness.
