When you cast this spell, a massive, flaming chariot—pulled by a pair of giant, fiery stallions—appears in the spot you designate. The chariot can carry you and three creatures (up to Medium size) of your choosing. The chariot has a 60-ft. movement rate on the ground and a 120-ft. flying speed (average maneuverability), and moves as you will it on your turn (a move action for you). The flames of the chariot and its team do not harm you or your chosen passengers, but any other creature within 5 ft. suffers 2d6 hp fire damage per round. You must designate your passengers when you cast this spell.

Mounting the chariot is a free action, as the vehicle simply moves through a designated passenger’s square, sweeping them up as it goes. Anyone else in the path of the *blazing chariot* is [[Overrun|overrun]] as if the chariot were a Gargantuan creature with the [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|trample]] ability. This deals 2d8 hp bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 hp fire, with a successful Reflex save for half.

The stallions are treated as [[Huge Fire Elemental (Bestiary PF1)|huge fire elementals]] with the [[Celestial Creature (Template)|celestial template]] (though they only serve to pull the chariot and attack only as part of the chariot’s [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|trample]] ability). The chariot itself has hardness 10 and 150 hp (hardness is bypassed by cold attacks). If both stallions are killed or if the chariot is destroyed, then the summoning ends.
