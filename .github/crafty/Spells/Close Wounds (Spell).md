# Close Wounds (Spell)
## Overview
[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]] ([[Healing Spells|healing]])

**Level:** [[2nd Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 2]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 4th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 4]]

**Casting Time:** 1 immediate action

**Components:** V

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One creature

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will half (harmless); see text

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

**Source:** Spell Compendium (WotC), pg. 48

*Your ally falls from a crushing blow, but you don’t have time to reach him. You quickly speak words of power, and the worst of his injuries glow golden and begin to heal.*

This spell cures 1d4 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

If you cast this spell immediately after the subject takes damage, it effectively prevents the damage. It would keep alive someone who had just dropped to –10 hit points, for example, leaving the character at negative hit points but stable.

Used against an undead creature, *close wounds* deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw).
