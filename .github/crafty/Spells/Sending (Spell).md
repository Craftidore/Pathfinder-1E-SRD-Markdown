You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the *sending,* though the subjectâ€™s ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the *sending* is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the *sending* does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)
