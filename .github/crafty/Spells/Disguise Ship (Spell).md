You cloak a ship in illusion, making it appear as a ship of another type of your choice. You can choose what it appears as down to small details such as what weaponry it bears and what flags it is flying. You can make the ship to be any other water-going vessel, though it cannot seem to be more than 50% smaller or larger.

Creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance, nor are their possessions.
