One thing the lost cities share, despite their diverse locations, is a history of loss and despair. Had no tragedy occurred, the city would have remained vibrant. Yet something -- some terrible fate, be it plague, disaster, war, madness, or worse -- befell the ancient citizens of the now empty city, and an echo or remnant of their final hours is firmly imprinted in what ruined stones still remain in their one-time homes.

*Ghost storm* calls upon the residual energies of anguish, fear, terror, and despair embedded in the stones of the region and magnifies them to a terrifying degree. As the spell is cast, dozens of wrathful, shrieking spirits rise out of the ground and ruined walls of the surroundings, filling the area with a whirling storm of wretchedness and agony. As the spirits move around and through any creatures caught in the area, their anguish and pain is transferred to any living creatures in the area.

All living creatures in a *ghost storm* who make a Fortitude save simply become [[Shaken|shaken]] for 1 round. A new saving throw is required each round the creature stays in the *ghost storm*. Living creatures that fail this saving throw flail and claw at the ghosts in a hopeless attempt to prevent the spirits from assaulting them. The only action such a creature can take is a single move action per turn, and the creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any). Worse, the unhealthy contact with the necromantic spirits of a *ghost storm* inflict one negative level for each failed Fortitude save. Negative levels imparted by a *ghost storm* fade at the rate of one per minute once a character exits the *ghost storm* area; no saving throw is required to remove negative levels gained from this spell, but otherwise the negative levels have their normal effects. Any creature who gains negative levels equal to his Hit Dice is immediately slain.

Once created, a *ghost storm* remains stationary. A creature that enters the area must immediately save against its effects, even if he has already made a previous saving throw against the same spell.

This spell is far less effective in areas other than lost cities (a "city" is a community with a population 5,000; see page 137 in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If the spell is cast in a location where a city never existed, the ghosts produced fill only a single 10-foot square.
