# Agonizing Sphere (Spell)

[[Evocation Spells|Evocation]] \[[[Electricity Spells|electricity]]]
**Level:** [[2nd Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 2]], [[2nd Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 2]]
**BoXM:** [[BoXM 3rd-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 3]]
**Casting Time:** 1 standard action
**Components:** V, S
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. / 2 levels)
**Target:** Creature or object
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial
**Spell Resistance:** Yes
**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 116

A palm-sized translucent sphere with a black core shoots forward. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. If it hits, the sphere inflicts 2d6 hp electrical damage + 1d6 for every two caster levels beyond third (maximum 5d6 at 13th level).

A creature struck by the sphere is also [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round plus an additional round per three caster levels as electricity courses through it. On a critical hit, the target is initially [[Stunned|stunned]] for 2 rounds plus the additional round per three caster levels.

A successful Fortitude save negates the [[Stunned|stunned]] condition, but it does not reduce the damage.
