You create a magical glowing lantern. In its eternal light, which is equal to a that of a normal lantern (30-foot radius), all foes suffer a –2 morale penalty to attacks, saves, and checks. The lantern can float in mid-air or rest upon a surface, but once created it does not move (unless the surface it is cast upon is moved).

It is not a physical object, just a manifestation of light and energy. As such, it cannot be damaged, although it can be extinguished.

You—and those whom you teach the specific command word unique to the lantern—can douse the light with a word. The illumination returns upon command whenever desired.

Many temples or frequent campsites in the wilderness are protected by one or more *aeonian lanterns*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Ranger 4, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 to Level.

*Note:* When the lantern is doused, it is effectively invisible. Only creatures able to *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* are able to locate its presence.
