This spell channels the caster’s mystic power to increase the duration of another spell he casts.

This spell extends the duration of a single nondamage-inflicting spell with a timed duration that you cast to 24 hours.

The spell to be extended must be at least one level lower than *greater extend arcana* and must be cast before the end of the following round.

For example, a 13th-level wizard who casts *[[Cat's Grace (Spell)|cat's grace]]* in the round after he casts *greater extend arcana* increases the duration of *[[Cat's Grace (Spell)|cat's grace]]* from 13 minutes to 24 hours.

The extended spell must have a personal range or a fixed range. Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this spell, nor can spells whose effects are discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the things detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity
