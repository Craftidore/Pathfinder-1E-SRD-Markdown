# Scale Weakening (Spell)

[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[2nd Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 2]], [[2nd Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 2]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 4th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 4]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a shed snakeskin)

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect:** Ray

**Duration:** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Spell Compendium (WotC), pg. 180

*As you cast this spell, the snakeskin vaporizes. A dull gray ray projects from your hand. Where the ray strikes, your foe’s skin seems brittle and more frail.*

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject’s natural armor bonus is reduced by 1 point per three caster levels (maximum reduction 5 points at 15th level). This spell can’t reduce a creature’s natural armor bonus to less than 0, nor does it have any effect on an enhancement bonus to natural armor (such as that granted by the *[[Barkskin (Spell)|barkskin]]* spell).
