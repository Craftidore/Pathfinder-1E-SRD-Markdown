*Completing the powerful spell, you bring into being floating spheres of silver, like bubbles of mercury.*

When you cast this spell, you bring forth one floating, silvery sphere per caster level, each about the size of your head. These spheres hover around you to provide protection from magical effects. As a standard action, you can shift the spellâ€™s effect (and thus all the spheres) to any other creature within range. You can shift the effect once per round.

Each of these spheres can absorb and completely negate any spell or spell-like ability, regardless of level, that directly targets the subject. The spheres do not automatically absorb all spells; the subject can choose whether or not to let them absorb any given spell cast upon it. (This option allows the creature to benefit from helpful spells.) Area spells and spells that do not actually have a target cannot be absorbed. Once a sphere has absorbed a spell or spell-like ability, it simply fades away. Only spells and spell-like abilities of deific power can overcome the protection provided by *effulgent epuration.*

**GM Note**

In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, this spell is known as *Elminster's effulgent epuration.*
