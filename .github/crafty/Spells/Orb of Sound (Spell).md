*Symbols recognizable as musical notation*—*the visual representation of sound*—*appear in midair within the curve of your palm accompanied by the fractious sounds they represent. The notes begin to whirl and stretch, forming into a spherical whirlwind of cacophonic chaos, as you make ready to release the spell. At last, you send the sphere of noise toward your chosen target.*

This spell functions like *[[Orb of Acid (Spell)|orb of acid]],* except that it deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per level (maximum 15d4). In addition, a creature struck by an *orb of sound* must make a Fortitude save or be [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round instead of being [[Sickened|sickened]].

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Warmage 4 to Level per Complete Arcane.
