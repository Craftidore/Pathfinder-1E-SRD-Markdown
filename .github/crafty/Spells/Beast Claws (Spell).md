*With crackle of popping joints and tendons, three long curving claws extend from your knuckles.*

You gain two claw attacks that act as slashing melee weapons, dealing 1d4 points of damage with a threat range of 19–20. Attacks with your transformed hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks—you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. 

If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another natural attack, you can’t make any claw attacks in that round. The claws do not hinder your manual dexterity or spellcasting.

*Material Component:* The claw of a bird of prey, such as an eagle or falcon.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2 to Level.
