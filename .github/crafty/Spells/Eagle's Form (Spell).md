You change yourself into an eagle. Your type changes to animal. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of an eagle but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the eagle’s bite and talon damage, Armor Class, speed, flying ability, and low-light vision. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the eagle’s feats and racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You can speak and cast spells with only verbal components while in eagle form. You can use disciplines that do not require a free hand.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *eagle’s form*, but it is nonfunctional.
