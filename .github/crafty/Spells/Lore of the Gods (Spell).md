**BoXM:** [[BoXM 4th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 4]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

*Your mind opens to the secrets of the cosmos and briefly touches the omniscience of the gods.*

You gain a +5 insight bonus on all [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] checks. At any point before the duration expires, you can make a check with a [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] skill in which you have no ranks, or retry a [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] check you have previously failed. The +5 insight bonus still applies in both of those cases, but utilizing this option reduces the spell’s remaining duration to 1 minute/level.

If you worship a deity who grants access to the [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] domain, the bonus is +10 rather than +5—even if you did not choose that domain.
