You point at a puddle that contains at least a quart of ordinary blood. For a moment, it flashes with sparkling light before regaining its former hue. Affected blood radiates a powerful compulsion effect. Only predators and creatures that feed on blood are affected by the compulsion, but even blood-feeding undead, which are normally immune to mind-affecting spells, are susceptible to it. (Immunity to mind-affecting effects granted from a source other than creature type still blocks this spell).

Any creature that feeds on raw flesh or blood that moves within 60 ft. of the affected blood can smell it. If the creature has the [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] ability, the range of detection is 180 ft. As soon as a creature smells the affected blood, it must make a Will save or be drawn toward it. The creature is [[Fascinated|fascinated]] for as long as it can smell the blood, and it moves unerringly towards the source unless impeded.

Once it reaches the blood, it attempts to feed on it, foregoing all other actions until the blood is consumed. A successful attack on the affected creature ends the effect, as does the complete consumption of the blood source, which is a full-round action. Creatures with the [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] ability or that feed on the blood take a –2 penalty to the Will save to resist this spell, while any undead creature that feeds on blood gains a +4 bonus.

**Mythic: I**t takes three full-round actions for a creature [[Fascinated|fascinated]] by this spell’s effect to consume the entire pool of blood enchanted by this spell. When a creature consuming the blood is subject to an attack, the duration only ends if that creature makes a successful Will save.
