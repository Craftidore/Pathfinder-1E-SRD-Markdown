*A faint gray shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand.*

When you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a *thunderlance* retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a *thunderlance* to make powerful melee attacks.

You can wield a *thunderlance* in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/Ã—3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]* or *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* spell, the *thunderlance* might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The *thunderlance* remains whether you succeed or fail on this check.
