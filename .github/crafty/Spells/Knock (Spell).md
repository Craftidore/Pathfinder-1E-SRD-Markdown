K*nock* opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to *[[Hold Portal (Spell)|hold portal]]* or *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]*. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, *knock* opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an *arcane locked* door, the spell does not remove the *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]* but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. *Knock* does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.
