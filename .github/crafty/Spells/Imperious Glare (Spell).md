*You regard your foes with a steely glare that would peel paint from a wagon. Motes of dark energy dance before your eyes and they, to a body, freeze in fear.*

The targets must make successful Will saves or cower. The saving throw DC to resist this effect is either the normal save DC for the spell or the save DC for your natural frightful presence ability, whichever is higher. You cannot cast this spell if you do not have a frightful presence ability, either natural or magically bestowed (such as from the *[[Aura of Terror (Spell)|aura of terror]]* spell, for example).
