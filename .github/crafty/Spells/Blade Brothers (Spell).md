*You reach out and touch two creatures, and a sparkling tether of multicolored light briefly forms between them.*

One time during the duration of this spell, when one subject of the spell attempts a saving throw, both recipients can roll and apply the more favorable result. When rolling, each subject uses his own save bonus and save modifiers. If both saving throws fail, both creatures suffer the consequences of a failed save, even if the effect that prompted the saving throw only affected one of the subjects. If the affected creatures move more than 120 feet away from each other after the spell is cast, the effect ends.
