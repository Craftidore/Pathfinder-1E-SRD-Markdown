*With an inhuman roar, your face extends and expands, and your hands enlarge into clawed paws. Powerful muscle builds under your skin, and you become a half-bear creature.*

You gain a +16 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +8 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +7 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a bear, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a â€“2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d8 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]] and [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] feats, as well. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks.

*Material Component:* A tuft of bear fur.
