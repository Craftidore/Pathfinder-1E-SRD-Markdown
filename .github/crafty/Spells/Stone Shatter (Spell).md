*You call up energies from deep within you and utter a perfect note. The stone rocks as it is struck, and cracks appear in its form.*

You aim a single note of perfect pitch toward an unattended stone object weighing no more than 2 pounds per caster level, or toward a stone creature, causing it to shatter. A stone object is destroyed, whereas a stone creature (of any weight) takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.
