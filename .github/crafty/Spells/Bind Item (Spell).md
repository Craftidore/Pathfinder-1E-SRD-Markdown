The subject of this spell is encased in a globe of force no larger than 3 feet in diameter. If a creature holds the target object, the creature can make a Reflex saving throw to resist the effects of the spell. The globe remains impervious to harm, much like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. However, the globe is weightless and can be moved (assuming enough force is available to move the weight of the object encased in the globe).

This spell often proves useful in transporting dangerous substances.
