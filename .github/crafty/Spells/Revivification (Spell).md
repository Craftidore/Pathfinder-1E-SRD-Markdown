Your hands glow with bright green energy, which you transfer to a corpse that you touch. The energy brings one dead creature immediately back to life. If the target has been dead less than 1 round, then it never truly died; it retains 1 hp per Hit Die. Any ability scores damaged to 0 increase to 1. Any spell slots available at the time of death are still available to the target now. Spells active on the target whose durations have not ended remain active. The process of revivifying the subject does not cure normal poison and normal disease, nor does it undo magical diseases and curses. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the revivified creature must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature comes back to life. This spell does not affect any of the dead creatureâ€™s equipment or possessions in any way.

If the target has been dead for more than a round but less than one minute per caster level, the target stays alive for one minute per level, after which time it dies again (regardless of any healing gained) unless someone casts the *[[Stabilize Soul (Spell)|stabilize soul]]* spell on the target. *Revivification* does not work on targets who die a second time in this way. (If a creature returns from the dead thanks to *raise the dead* or is stabilized with *[[Stabilize Soul (Spell)|stabilize soul]]*, then dies again in different circumstances, *revivification* will work again.)
