You call upon the heavenly powers to bind a creature in writhing chains of scintillating light. The creature is [[Entangled|entangled]], taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to effective Dexterity. Moreover, the chains are anchored to the nearest immobile object (usually the floor), preventing the bound creature from moving. An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature attempting to cast a spell must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.

The *chains* automatically constrict the bound creature for 3d6 points of nonlethal damage per round unless the caster (as a free action) commands the chains not to deal damage during any given round.

The *constricting chains* have AC 20, 5 hp per caster level (maximum 100 hp), and damage reduction 10/magic. They are immune to energy-based attacks, nonlethal damage, and all spells except *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* and similar effects. They are not subject to critical hits. Half of all damage dealt to the chains (rounded down) is transferred to the target.

A successful DC 32 Strength check breaks the *chains* and ends the spell. An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can also attempt to escape (requiring 1 minute) with a DC 40 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check.

*Focus:* A small silver chain (10 gp).

*Sacrifice:* 1d2 points of Strength drain.
