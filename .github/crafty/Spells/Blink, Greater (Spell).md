*An immaterial fog descends over your eyes as you complete the spell. You perceive the closeness of a parallel, ethereal reality, and you know that you can pass freely between that world and the one upon which you stand.*

This spell functions like *[[Blink (Spell)|blink]],* except that you have control over the timing of your “blinking” back and forth between the [[Ethereal Plane]] and the Material Plane. You can also ready an action to blink away from any physical or magical attack. The attack misses automatically unless it also affects ethereal targets (as a force effect does). While blinking, you have no chance of interfering

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Celerity 8 to Level per Complete Divine.

Sometimes called *improved blink*.
