The subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being charmed, [[Fatigued|fatigued]] or [[Staggered|staggered]]. If the character is reduced in hit points to a condition where he would become [[Staggered|staggered]], the character remains unstaggered and may continue to take normal actions each round. This stasis spell also prevents the character from becoming [[Unconscious|unconscious]] should his subdual damage exceed his current hit point total.

This spell also prevents all Constitution and Charisma damage received during its duration. Existing damage to these ability scores are unaffected by this spell.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
