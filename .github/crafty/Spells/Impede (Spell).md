*Your will clamps down on the subject’s mind, making the slightest movement a strenuous effort.*

This spell locks the subject in place. An affected creature is capable of taking actions, such as attacking or casting spells, but it cannot step from its current square (or squares, if it occupies more than one). The subject also takes a –1 penalty on melee attack rolls and a –2 penalty on Reflex saves while so rooted.

If the subject succeeds on the initial Will save, it suffers no ill effects and the spell ends immediately. If it fails the initial save, it can attempt a new Will save every round thereafter. Once the subject succeeds on one of these secondary saves, it can move, but its base speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) for the duration of the spell. If the subject has multiple modes of movement, each is reduced accordingly.

If the subject is already under an effect that curtails its ability to move (such as *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* or *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]*), it also takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity for the duration of this spell, even if the other effect ends before this one does.
