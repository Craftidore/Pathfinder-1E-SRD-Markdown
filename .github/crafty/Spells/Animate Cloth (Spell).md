You bring a semblance of life to your clothing, making it aid you in combat and otherwise. Your clothing grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to CMB for dirty trick, [[Disarm|disarm]], [[Grapple|grapple]], [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|steal]], or [[Trip|trip]] [[Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuvers]]. The cloth also provides you with a +1 shield bonus to AC. Finally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] and [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks, [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] checks that would benefit from your animated cloth (such as dancing, acting, or physical comedy, at the GMâ€™s discretion), and [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks to [[Feint|feint]]. The animated cloth can only assist you in a single action each round, and you cannot direct the cloth to perform independent actions.

*Animate cloth* has no effect when you wear medium or heavy armor.
