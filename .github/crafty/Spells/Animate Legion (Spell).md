You use negative energy to temporarily animate one or more corpses. You can create undead skeletons or zombies with this spell, but you canâ€™t create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level. Bestiary I has game statistics for skeletons and zombies. The undead created are mindless and are not initially under your command. Unless otherwise influenced (by way of a rebuke attempt or the *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]*, the undead created will attack the nearest living creatures.

See *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* for information on what is required to create a skeleton or zombie from a corpse.
