*You touch the target and it vanishes in a shower of golden sparks. Almost instantly, it appears a short distance away.*

You teleport a target to a random, safe location up to 100 feet distant and visible to you. 

To randomly determine the subject’s destination, roll 1d8 to determine the direction, then roll 1d10×10 to determine the distance from the subject’s previous location. Roll direction and distance again if this new destination is outside your line of sight, within a solid object, or more than 5 feet above the ground.

If your target is being held (whether an object held by a character or a character being [[Grappled|grappled]] by a creature), the holding or grappling creature also receives a Will saving throw to resist.
