Imbibing this extract elevates your consciousness to a higher realm, allowing you to perceive the flow of time differently. As a result, you can anticipate the actions of others, granting bonuses to your armor class. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC plus an additional +1 per 4 levels after 1st (maximum bonus of +5 at 17th level).
