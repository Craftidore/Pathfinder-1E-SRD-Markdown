The caster can take on the appearance and form—including clothing and equipment—of a corporeal humanoid that is freshly dead. The caster assumes the form of the creature as it looked when it lived. The caster must eat the flesh of the corpse whose form is to be assumed as he casts the spell. Once the spell is complete, the caster can assume the new likeness at will. By changing to this new form, the caster’s body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs, and his weight can be changed up to one-half. If the form selected has wings, the caster can fly at a speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. If the form has gills, he can breathe underwater. The caster cannot assume the likeness of something that is a different size than he is.

The caster’s attack bonuses, natural armor bonus, and saves do not change. The spell does not confer special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms of the chosen form. If the caster takes damage or dies, he automatically reverts to his normal form. The caster can also take a standard action to voluntarily assume his normal form.

If the caster uses this spell to create a disguise, he gets a +10 bonus on his [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check.

*Focus:* A fresh or preserved (still bloody) 1-ounce portion of another creature’s flesh.

*Corruption Cost:* 2d6 points of Wisdom drain.
