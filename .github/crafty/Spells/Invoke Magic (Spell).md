You cause a flicker of magic to momentarily exist in a place where magic cannot normally function, such as within the area of an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**,* a dead magic area, or a null-magic plane. This allows you the ability to cast a single spell of 4th level or lower, which then ends the spellâ€™s effect.

Casting *invoke magic* is a swift action, like casting a quickened spell. You can perform only one swift action each round. Normally, you cast *invoke magic* and then immediately follow it by casting another spell as a standard action.
