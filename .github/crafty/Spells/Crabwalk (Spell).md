*The creature you touch now moves much faster, scuttling about with disconcerting ease.*

When the subject of this spell charges, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll and takes no penalty to Armor Class. This benefit replaces the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls and –2 penalty to AC that a charge attack normally confers. If the creature is capable of multiple attacks after a charge, such as a lion with the pounce ability, the bonus applies only to the first attack.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2 to Level per Wizards of the Coast website.
