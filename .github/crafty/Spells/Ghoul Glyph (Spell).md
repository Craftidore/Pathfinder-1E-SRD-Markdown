*The faint, green glow of the glyph flares to life. A sickly green light fills the room, illuminating the paralyzed forms of its victims, and bringing with it the stench of death.*

You inscribe a glyph, approximately 1 foot across, that paralyzes any living creature of Large or smaller size that comes within 5 feet of the glyph. You can scribe the glyph to be visible as faintly glowing lines, or invisible. You can inscribe a *ghoul glyph* on a portable object, but if the object is moved more than 5 feet, the glyph fades.

Conditions for triggering a *ghoul glyph* are stringent. It takes effect on any creature except yourself that moves within 5 feet. It affects invisible creatures normally but is not triggered by those that travel past it ethereally. Only a single *ghoul glyph* can be inscribed in a 5-foot square.

*Ghoul glyphs* cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. *[[Mislead (Spell)|Mislead]]* and *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]* can fool a *ghoul glyph*.

*[[Read Magic (Spell)|Read magic]]* allows identification of a *ghoul glyph* with a successful DC 13 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check, if the glyph is noticed before it is activated. A rogue can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5 Search) skill to find a *ghoul glyph* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 27.

When a glyph is activated, the target is paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. Additionally, if the target fails a Fortitude save, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes distress in all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Those in the radius, including the target, must make a Fortitude save or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the paralysis effect wears off.

*Material Component:* You trace the glyph with earth from a ghoul’s lair.
