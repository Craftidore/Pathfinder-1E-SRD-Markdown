You specify a single effect that has occurred within the previous round and reverse it entirely. The effect can be an extraordinary ability, spell, a spell-like ability, a supernatural ability, a physical attack, a poison, a disease, a trap, a hazard, a disaster, or anything similar. *Undo* functions as if a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* had been cast to remove the effect. Damage inflicted by the effect is repaired or healed, slain victims are restored to life (to the condition they were in before the effect), a curse is lifted, and so on—whatever the effect did, this spell undoes it.

Note that this spell does not make it so that the effect was never instigated; it only undoes its consequences. So if you the caster of the *[[Meteor Swarm (Spell)|meteor swarm]]* really did cast it (and used the spell slot), but the damage is all repaired.

Effects from 9th-level or higher spells (or effects from an extraordinary or supernatural effect where the creator’s CR is 17 or higher) require that you make a caster level check to undo them (DC 15 + creator’s caster level or if it’s an extraordinary or supernatural ability, the creator’s CR). Thus, if you wish to undo the effects of an ancient red dragon’s breath weapon you would need to touch the ancient red dragon or touch a creature injured by that breath weapon, and make a DC 34 caster level check.

**GM Note**

Canny spellcasters often use this spell to undo the casting of a *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage's disjunction]]*.
