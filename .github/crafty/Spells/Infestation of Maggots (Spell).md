*You touch your foe with the dust of dead flies on your fingers, giving birth to hundreds of writhing maggots in his flesh.*

With a successful melee touch attack, you infest a creature with maggotlike creatures. If the touched creature fails a Fortitude saving throw, the magical maggots deal 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of your turn. The subject makes a new Fortitude save each round to negate the damage in that round and end the effect.

The infestation can be removed with a *[[Remove Disease (Spell)|remove disease]]* or *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* spell.
