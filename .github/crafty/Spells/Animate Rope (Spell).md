You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope’s diameter by half.

The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become [[Entangled|entangled]]. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level to cast a spell. An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can slip free with a DC 20 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

**Mythic Rule**

Your rope can extend and attack a target anywhere within the spell’s range. Add your mythic tier to the Armor Class, hardness, and break DC of the rope, as well as the concentration DC of a creature [[Entangled|entangled]] by the rope that attempts to cast a spell. The rope gains hit points equal to your caster level plus your mythic tier.
