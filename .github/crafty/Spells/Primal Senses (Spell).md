*Translucent, catlike eyes appear over your own, flaring brightly for a moment before fading to invisibility.*

This spell calls upon the primal forces of creation to grant you the senses of your primitive ancestors. You gain lowlight vision and a +5 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks.

If *primal senses* is active on you at the same time as *[[Primal Hunter (Spell)|primal hunter]]**,* *[[Primal Instinct (Spell)|primal instinct]]**,* or *[[Primal Speed (Spell)|primal speed]]*, you gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature). If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, you also gain blindsense out to 10 feet.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The blindsense gained if the caster is of the dragonblood subtype stacks within any other blindsense the caster might have.
