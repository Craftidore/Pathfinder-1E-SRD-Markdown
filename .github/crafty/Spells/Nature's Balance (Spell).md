*Touching your friend, you concentrate, imagining a light flowing from your body into his. As you do so, a blue glow flickers to life in the center of your chest, and it travels down your arm into his form, granting him a portion of your power.*

You take a â€“4 penalty to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and your subject gains an equivalent bonus to the same ability score. You get no saving throw to avoid the loss, but your subject can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the gain, if desired.
