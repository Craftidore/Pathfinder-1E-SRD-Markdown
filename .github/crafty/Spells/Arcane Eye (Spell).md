You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the *arcane eye* at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An *arcane eye* travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.

The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye canâ€™t enter another plane of existence, even through a *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* or similar magical portal.

You must concentrate to use an *arcane eye.* If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.

**Mythic Rule**

The duration increases to 10 minutes per level. You can assign a *mythic arcane eye* to follow a creature or move in a specific direction without concentrating on it. You must begin concentrating again to see what the *mythic arcane eye* sees, but in the meantime it continues following your prior directions.

**Augmented (3rd):** If you expend two uses of mythic power, the *mythic arcane eye* sees with *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*.
