This spell unleashes the anger of the sun deity in a blinding flash originating with you and expanding outward. Any creature within the area of the spell that can see you must make a saving throw or be temporarily blinded. The blindness lasts for 1 minute per caster level.

In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment),

loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers’ attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a –4 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Search) checks and most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *Yakamo’s anger*.
