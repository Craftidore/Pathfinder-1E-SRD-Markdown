*As you crook your finger, your enemy feels his vitals rupture within him.*

You magically disrupt the subject's internal organs, causing it great pain. Each round on your turn, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage and becomes [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and lessens the [[Nauseated|nauseated]] condition to [[Sickened|sickened]].
