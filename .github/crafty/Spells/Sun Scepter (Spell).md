You conjure a radiant, mace-like scepter of solid light, approximately 3 feet long and 1 inch in diameter, with a dazzling, spherical ball measuring 5 inches in diameter at one end. The *sun scepter* functions as a physical weapon that deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and has the *[[Axiomatic (MagWpnSpcAb)|axiomatic]]*, *[[Disruption (MagWpnSpcAb)|disruption]]*, and *[[Flaming Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming burst]]* special abilities. You can strike with it as a melee touch attack. The *sun scepter* lasts only as long as you hold it in your hand; it instantly fades away if you drop it or hand it off to an ally.
