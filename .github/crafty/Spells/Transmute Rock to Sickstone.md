In the deepest reaches of the trenches of the Underdark, the very stones are said to be imbued with a fell energy. These stones glow with an unhealthy color that does not exist on the surface world, and any who tread too near these stones sicken and die over the course of several days. This material is known as *sickstone*, and this spell imbues normal stone with these deadly properties and then magnifies these properties even further so the debilitative effects occur almost instantly.

*Sickstone* glows with a nauseating not-quite-green, not-quite-silver light that provides illumination to a radius of 40 feet. Any creature in range of this illumination must make a Fortitude saving throw each round or take 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. Only 1 point of temporary Constitution damage is taken if the saving throw is successful. Anyone who actually physically contacts the *sickstone* takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw, and any Constitution damage taken as a result becomes permanent Constitution drain. The damage caused by *sickstone* is caused by a magical disease, so creatures that are immune to magical diseases are immune to the effects of *sickstone*.

Some particularly cruel wizards have been known to grant stone minions like golems, elementals, or shield guardians the ability to transform themselves into *sickstone*. A stone creature under the effects of a *sickstone* spell does 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain to anything it strikes, unless the target makes a Fortitude save against this spell, in which case only 1 point of permanent Constitution drain is dealt.

Once the spell expires, the affected stone becomes chalky and powdery. Its hardness is permanently cut in half (round fractions down) as a result. A stone creature with damage reduction has its damage reduction score lessened by 5/+1, as well. Stone lessened to a hardness of 0 or stone that gets lessened to a -1 in either part of the damage reduction score crumbles to dust. For example, if a stone creature originally has a damage reduction score of 5/+1, it gets lessened to 0/0 when the spell expires. If the creature had 10/silver as its damage reduction score, it changes to 5/-1 (silver), which means that it crumbles to dust.
