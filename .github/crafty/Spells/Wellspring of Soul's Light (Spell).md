You call upon the honored dead who have fallen in the service of good to come forth and aid the cause of good once again. This spell conjures an area of holy light that inflicts 10d6 points of damage on all evil creatures or those particularly sensitive to light.

Further, in the middle of the area, one 10th-level paladin for every four caster levels appears to serve you, as long as you command them to commit only good acts. Each has typical gear and a warhorse. These spiritual paladins have corporeal form. They can be dispelled or banished. Treat them as typical 10th-level paladins (as described in the Game Mastery Guide), except that they are outsiders. When they are slain or the duration ends, their gear disappears with them.
