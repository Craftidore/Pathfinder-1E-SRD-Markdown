The caster is able to divine the answer to a single question, as long as the answer is a single person’s name. Thus, the question must be a “who?” type question. For example, “Who broke into the temple last night and stole the *wand of inflict moderate wounds*?” Questions that cannot be answered with a single name are not answered at all.

The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + 1% per caster level. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (precautions against divination spells have been taken, for example). The caster knows if he didn’t get a correct answer, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

As with *[[Augury (Spell)|augury]]* or *[[Divination (Spell)|divination]]*, multiple *identify transgressor* spells about the same question by the same caster use the same die roll result as the first spell and yield the same answer each time.

*Drug Component:* Vodare.

*Location Component:* An area under the effect of a *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* or *[[Unhallow (Spell)|unhallow]]* spell.
