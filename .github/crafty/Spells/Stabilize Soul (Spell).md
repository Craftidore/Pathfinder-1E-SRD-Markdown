**BoXM:** [[BoXM 14th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 14]]

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Components:** V, S, M (silver dust worth at least 500 gp)

**Target:** One creature or one corpse

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

If you cast this spell upon a revivified creature (see page 72 of the Book of Experimental Might I), the creature remains alive even after the *[[Revivification (Spell)|revivification]]* spell ends, and suffers 1 point of Constitution drain rather than the loss of a level.

If you cast this spell upon the corpse of a creature whose spirit is an incorporeal undead, the target must make a successful save or be returned to the afterlife.
