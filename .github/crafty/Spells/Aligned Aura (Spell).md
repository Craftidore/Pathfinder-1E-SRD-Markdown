*A rush of divine energy flows through your holy symbol, infusing your body with the essence of the divine ethos.*

When you cast this spell, choose one non-neutral aspect of your own alignment—chaos, evil, good, or law. (If you are neutral, you can select whichever alignment you wish each time you cast this spell.) You are immediately surrounded in a 20-foot aura of invisible energy associated with the chosen alignment component. Anyone in that area who shares that alignment component gains a bonus, and anyone with the opposed alignment component must make a Fortitude save or take a penalty. The values of these modifi ers and the features to which they apply are given on the following table. These modifiers end when the affected creature leaves the spell’s area.


| **Alignment** | **Bonus** | **Penalty** |
|---|---|---|
| Chaos | +1 on attack rolls | –1 on saving throws |
| Evil | +1 on damage rolls | –1 to Armor Class |
| Good | +1 on saving throws | –1 on attack rolls |
| Law | +1 to Armor Class | –1 on damage rolls |

At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to unleash the spell’s remaining power in a 60-foot burst that deals 1d4 points of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15d4) to each creature of the opposed alignment in the area. Each affected creature can attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. The burst also heals 1 point of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15 points) for each creature of the same alignment in the area. Once this option is invoked, the spell ends immediately.
