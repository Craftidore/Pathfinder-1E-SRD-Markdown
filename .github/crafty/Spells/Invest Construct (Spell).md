If the target (construct) of this spell fails to resist its effects with a Will save your consciousness is transferred into it. You can see through its eyes, hear through its ears, and utilize any all of its senses as if they were your own and you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Deafened|deafened]]. 

If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is 0 or greater can originate from the invested construct (so long as it is able to verbalize (has a mouth) and gesticulate (has some form of appendages) instead of from you.

The invested construct can cast any spells on itself whose range is 0, personal or touch that would normally affect you (in your own body). The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the invested construct.

You must maintain line of effect to the target construct at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**,* *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]**,* *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]**,* or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect even momentarily, the spell ends.

While your consciousness resides in the target construct, you are subject to any and all vulnerabilities of the particular construct form.

Constructs of your own creation to include homunculi, simulacrum, etc. receive no saving throw versus this spell.
