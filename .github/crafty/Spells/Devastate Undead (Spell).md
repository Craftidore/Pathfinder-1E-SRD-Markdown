**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, F (a *disruption* weapon of any kind)

**Source:** Lords of Darkness (WotC), pg. 186

This spell was created by the lich Larloch to power himself at the expense of his own undead minions. The target undead creatures must succeed at Fortitude saving throws or be destroyed, just as if hit by a *[[Disruption (MagWpnSpcAb)|disruption]]* weapon. Creatures that are not undead, and undead with Hit Dice greater than the casterâ€™s caster level, are unaffected by this spell.

If an undead creature is destroyed by this spell, a portion of the negative energy that gave it unlife flows back to the caster. This negative energy deals (if the caster is living) or cures (if the caster is undead) 5 hit points of damage per hit die of the destroyed undead.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Any undead created or being commanded by the caster receives no saving throw versus this spell.
