A golden ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit your intended target.

A corpse or undead creature struck by the ray takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8). Any Large or smaller creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. The ray has no effect on objects that are not corpses; thus, the creatureâ€™s equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful Fortitude takes half damage.
