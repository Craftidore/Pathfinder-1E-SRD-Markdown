This spell lets a group of creatures resist effects that convince them they should not be following their present course of action. The creatures affected gain a +4 resistance bonus on saves against charm, compulsion, and fear effects.

The *proud arrogance* spell only functions for creatures of the same race as the caster. In other words, a human wizard casting the spell can target only humans with it.
