*A phalanx of spectral swordfi ghters appears. Their blades are drawn, and they stand ready to strike.*

A ghostly, incorporeal swordfighter appears in each square covered by this spellâ€™s area. A swordfighter can share a space with another creature or object. Each swordfighter threatens the squares adjacent to it and can make one attack of opportunity per round. The swordfighters do not hinder movement, block terrain, or block line of effect. They can flank an opponent with each other and with your allies.

Each swordfighter has hit points equal to twice your caster level and an Armor Class of 25. It makes saving throws or checks with a bonus equal to your caster level.
