For hundreds of years explorers and adventurers found weapons and armor that were as clear as glass and hard as steel, yet no amount of alchemical experimentation would produce the same results as these ancient artifacts. It was not until the Third Age, the Lost Age, that the process was repeated in the short-lived country of Portulack. Despite this magic - or perhaps because of it - the country was destroyed and the spell taken as part of the spoils of war.

When this spell is cast, the object(s) to be affected glitter slightly, then the color drains from them until they are transparent. The new crystalline substance that has the same properties (weight, hardness, etc.) as the original metal, save that it is clear as glass.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Changed duration from Permanent to Instantaneous.

*House Rule:* *Crysteel* can be used to transform an item affected by *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* or *[[Ironwood, Greater (Spell)|greater ironwood]]* into a *crysteel* version of itself.

*House Rule:* *Crysteel* can be colored; this requires the addition of a material component in the form of finely powdered gems of the appropriate color(s).
