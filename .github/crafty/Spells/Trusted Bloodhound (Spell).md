*You conjure a phantom hound, that can track and bring down your prey.*

This spell functions like *[[Mage's Faithful Hound (Spell)|mage's faithful hound]]**,* except that the phantom bloodhound created can also track a creature as if it had the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] feat. Its [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] modifier is equal to your caster level for this purpose, but it can't use the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill for any other tasks. A *trusted bloodhound* has a land speed equal to yours, and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to track.

A *trusted bloodhound* can't attack, provide a flank, or have any other effect on combat. However, as a standard action, you can instruct a *trusted bloodhound* to serve as a watchdog; in this role it functions identically to *mages's faithful hound,* except that its attack bonus equals your caster level. You can command a *trusted bloodhound* to resume its tracking again as a standard action.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell commonly known as *Mordenkainen's trusted bloodhound*.
