You fill the target creatureâ€™s thoughts and ears with the sublime music of the deep waters. The creature is completely immersed in this sensation and does nothing but experience it fully. It enters a comatose state and cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, so elves and dragons are not immune to it. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|Dispel magic]]* and *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]]* cannot remove this effect, but a *[[Heal (Skill)|heal]], [[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]], [[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell restores the creature to consciousness.

An air-breathing creature in the water affected by this spell begins to sink and will drown if not rescued. A flying creature immediately falls and might take falling damage. Damage does not awaken the charmed creatures.
