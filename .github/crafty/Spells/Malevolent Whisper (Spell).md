*You whisper a horrific word of power that rends the soul of your subject.*

A weaker (and perhaps older) variant of the *power word* spells, this horrible malediction was supposedly created by the Whispered One himself, long before his ascension to godhood. The subject of the spell is reduced to â€“9 hit points (no roll to check for becoming stable is necessary).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting this spell is known as *Vecna's malevolent whisper.*
