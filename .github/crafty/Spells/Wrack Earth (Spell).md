*You stomp your foot, causing a shockwave to shoot out from you.*

When you cast this spell, earth and stone blast upward along a 30-foot line, smashing creatures and knocking them out of the way. This spell deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to every creature it contacts and creates a 5-foot-wide mound of stone and rubble along the path of the line. Creatures within the area that fail their Reflex saves are moved to a random side of the rubble. The rubble created is difficult terrain that requires 2 squares of movement to enter. Creatures that succeed on their saving throws take half damage and are not moved by the mound of rubble.
