The target gains buoyancy and floats upon the water for the duration of the spell. Creatures that must breathe water can still do so, but cannot swim under the surface. If the target is underwater at the time this spell is cast, it rises toward the surface at a speed of 30 feet.

For every 5 levels above 5th level, the caster can affect one size category larger creature (or 500 additional cubic feet of material in a single object). The maximum weight of a single object affected is 1,000 lbs per level.

*Greater float* may be made permanent on objects with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
