# Reciprocal Gyre (Spell)
## Overview
[[Abjuration Spells|Abjuration]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 5]], [[5th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 10]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny closed loop of copper wire)

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target:** One creature or object

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will half, then Fortitude negates; see text

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Spell Compendium (WotC), pg. 170

*You finger the tiny loop of wire in your hands as you complete the spell. You manipulate the magical aura of the target, creating a damaging feedback reaction, and the target explodes with white sparks.*

The subject takes 1d12 points of damage per functioning spell or spell-like ability currently affecting it (maximum 25d12). In addition, any creature so affected that fails its Will save must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1d6 rounds.

Only spells specifically targeted on the creature in question can be used to create the backlash of a *reciprocal gyre,* so spells that affect an area can’t be used to deal reciprocal damage to creatures within their area. Likewise, persistent or continuous effects from magic items can’t be used to deal reciprocal damage, but targeted spell effects can be.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Spells made permanent by using the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell would resonate AS WOULD the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* itself for each spell made permanent (since it must still be in effect at some level since it is dispellable (cf. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*).

Please note that this version replaces the one from *Complete Arcane.*
