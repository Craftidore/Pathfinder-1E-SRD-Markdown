The subject of this spell can travel on any solid surface as though that surface possessed its own gravity. For example, the subject could walk or even run up a wall as though the wall were a perfectly level floor. The subject can switch “down” as often as it likes during the spell’s duration, though only once per round, as a free action. Unattended objects fall, as normal.

The subject of *greater false gravity* can fly by choosing a solid surface and letting itself fall through the air toward it. A character “flying” in this fashion moves at 30 feet per round and can make one turn, in any direction, once per round, by redefining its personal gravity.

A creature falling in this fashion loses all “downward” momentum when it changes its gravity.
