*A flickering red fire bursts in the area you intended. Creatures in the area are outlined in the flame, some more intensely than others.*

Outlined subjects shed light as torches. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (although a 3rd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]*, *[[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]]*, *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, or similar effects. In addition, if they fail a Fortitude save, affected creatures take 1d4 points of fire damage each round as their passions manifest as physically damaging fire. Creatures that make a successful Fortitude save take only half damage each round for the duration of the spell (minimum 1 point per round). Spellcasters affected by this spell who try to cast spells must make Concentration checks (DC 10 + half the continuous damage last dealt) each round as they take continuous damage from the spell. The fire created by this spell can be extinguished by normal means; doing so ends the outlining effect.
