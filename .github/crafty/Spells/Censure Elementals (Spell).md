When artificers began construction of some of the first great elemental vessels, they wanted a way to keep elementals from wreaking havoc prior to being bound. This infusion was developed as a means of conditioning the elementals through negative reinforcement.

Typically cast into a pole or other prod, this infusion creates a field that can harm elemental creatures. When held aloft (a standard action), the infused item deals 2d4 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) to any elemental creatures within a 20-foot-radius area. This damage repeats each round at the start of the artificerâ€™s turn as long as the item is held aloft (a standard action). A successful Will save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies against this effect.

The caster can designate up to one elemental creature per level to have immunity to the effects of the infusion.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Making dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Cannith), casts this spell at +1 caster level.

*Material Component:* A pinch of kiln-hardened mud.
