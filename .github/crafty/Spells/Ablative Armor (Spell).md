Armor imbued with this infusion absorbs 5 points of damage from the next attack that deals damage to the creature that wears it (treat this as one-time damage reduction 5/—). Forms of damage that aren’t affected by damage reduction likewise overcome *ablative armor*. Once the infused item has prevented damage from a single attack (even if not all the damage reduction is needed), the magic fades.

The damage reduction increases by 1 for every caster level above 1st, to a maximum of 15/— at 10th level.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Sentinel dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Deneith), casts this infusion at +1 caster level.
