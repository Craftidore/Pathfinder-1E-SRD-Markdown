*You raise your voice in a paean to your god, a sound that reverberates upward. You see your allies’ lips moving in concert, and their eyes widen with the glory of the divine.*

For the duration of *soldiers of sanctity,* you gain a bonus on turning checks and turning damage rolls made when you have allies within 30 feet of you. This is a sacred bonus, equal to the number of allies within 30 feet, to a maximum of +6.

In addition, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC against all attacks made by undead creatures. This bonus applies for the duration of the spell as long as an ally is within 30 feet of you.
