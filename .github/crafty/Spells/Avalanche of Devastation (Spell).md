*Avalanche of destruction* causes jagged pinnacles of stone to erupt from the ground before the caster. The pinnacles rise to a height of 10 feet, then immediately crumble into rubble that flows and fills a 40-foot cone (aimed along the ground in the direction the caster chooses). The spell creates the effects of an avalanche within the cone. Each round the spell lasts, the avalanche advances another 40 feet, extending the cone (in both length and width). The leading 40 feet of this swath is the active portion of the avalanche, and the area behind the leading edge is filled with rubble. For example, i the second round, the avalanche fills an 80-foot cone, the 40-foot section closest to the point of origin is just rubble, and the outer 40 feet is filled with moving, grinding rock. On the third round, the spell fills a 120-foot cone, the 80-foot section closest to the point of origin is just rubble, and the outer 40 feet is filled moving, grinding rock.

If you move away from your initial position while concentrating on maintaining this spell, its effects continue but do not move along with you. The starting location of the *avalanche of devastation* is fixed at the point where you cast the spell. Once the spell ends, the stones (both the moving, grinding stones and the rubble behind them) vanish instantly, leaving behind a swath of ruin and devastation.

Any creatures, objects, or structures caught in the active portion of the avalanche must make a successful Reflex save or take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Structures are particularly vulnerable to this damage, and they do not apply their hardness to the damage inflicted unless their hardness is 11 or higher. A Huge or smaller creature or object that takes damage from this spell (even on a successful Reflex save) is buried by rubble. A buried creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a buried character falls [[Unconscious|unconscious]], he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of normal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. A creature can dig to freedom automatically if it has a burrow speed, otherwise it must make a successful Strength check (DC 24) to extract itself. Attempting a Strength check in this manner is a full-round action, and failure to escape automatically inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on the character.

The area behind the 40-foot-long active portion of this spell remains buried with rubble to depths of up to 10 feet as long as the spell lasts. Creatures buried here continue to take nonlethal damage, and those who enter this area of unstable ground move at half normal speed.

This spell can be cast only when you are standing on solid ground. If you cast it while in mountainous terrain, its effects continue for 3 rounds after you cease concentrating.
