Living beings view the subject of this spell with instinctive hostility. All NPC reactions begin one category worse than they otherwise would, and any [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to moderate those reactions take a â€“10 circumstance penalty. Furthermore, people view the target in the worst possible light. If, for example, a community is hunting for an unknown murderer, they will assume that the subject of the spell is guilty of the crime. Player characters and NPCs who know the subject well, such as old friends or loved ones, are unaffected.
