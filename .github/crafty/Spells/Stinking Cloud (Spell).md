*Stinking cloud* creates a bank of fog like that created by *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]*, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become [[Nauseated|nauseated]]. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each [[Nauseated|nauseated]] character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.

*Stinking cloud* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. A permanent *stinking cloud* dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
