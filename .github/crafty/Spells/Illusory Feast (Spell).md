*Your stomach growls as an entire feast appears in the distance. You perceive the composition of the feast continuously shifting, its contents sometimes appealing to the point where you almost forget it is an illusion.*

Tantalizing food and drink appears, causing creatures in the area to stop what they are doing and eat. A creature in the area that fails its save stops its current activities, drops held or carried items, and begins consuming the illusory food and drink. The food looks, feels, smells, tastes, and even sounds real to the affected creature, and it appears to be whatever kind of food the creature prefers. The creature is considered [[Dazed|dazed]]. An attack on an affected creature frees it from the spell immediately. Sightless creatures are affected by this spell due to its effect on all the senses. Creatures that do not eat are unaffected by this spell.

*Material Component:* A piece of trail rations.
