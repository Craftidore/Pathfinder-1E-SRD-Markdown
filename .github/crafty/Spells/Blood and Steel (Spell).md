When you cast this spell, you cut yourself with any immediately available implement (including your fingers, if necessary), and the blood from that wound seeps into the target construct. This cut deals 1d4 hp damage that cannot be healed until after the target construct is destroyed or the spell ends. This wound has no effect on the spellâ€™s casting and does not require the spellcaster to make a concentration check.

If the target construct fails a Fortitude save, the blood binds with it to form a false soul, causing the construct to have thoughts and emotions. If the construct is not already under your control, you gain control of it for 1 round/level, starting with the round after you cast this spell.

If the construct is already under your control, you instead give it an Intelligence of 10 for 1 hour/level (unless it already somehow had a higher Intelligence score, in which case it retains its existing Intelligence), and you may assign it one rank for each of its HD in two skills of your choice. The construct is now capable of acting independently, though it remains loyal to you. You may also assign the construct one feat for every 3 HD it has.

The first time you cast this spell, once you have determined which skills and feats to grant the target construct, you always assign those skills and feats whenever you cast the spell. The spell may be learned more than once (counting as an additional spell known each time it is taken, for sorcerers), with each version of the spell granting different skills and feats.

Constructs normally immune to all spells (such as most golems) are not immune to this spell, but do gain a +10 bonus to their saving throw to ignore its effects.  A construct you control may be instructed to intentionally fail its saving throw.

When cast on a construct you control, the spell may be made permanent with the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell, for a cost of 15,000 gp and a minimum caster level of 13th.

**Mythic:** When made permanent, this spell acts as an *[[Awaken (Spell)|awaken]]* spell for the construct, and allows it to develop a personality, earn class levels, become a cohort, etc.
