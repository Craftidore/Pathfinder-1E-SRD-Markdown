The creature warded by this spell gains partial protection from the effects of positive energy, including magical healing and regeneration. It may be cast upon undead to offer additional protection against the turning abilities of clerics.

The *positive energy protection* spell uses negative energy to offset the effects of positive energy. Each time the warded creature is struck by a positive energy effect, it rolls 1d20 + caster level against a DC of 11 + the HD of the originator of the effect. For example, the DC for the level check would be 19 if an 8th-level cleric were trying to turn someone with *positive energy protection*.

If the warded creature succeeds, the positive and negative energies cancel each other with a roiling ball of darkness and a thunderclap. The spell or effect does not function, and if the source of the positive energy effect was touching the warded creature, the source takes 2d6 points of damage. If the warded creature fails the level check, then the positive energy effect occurs normally.

This spell may be placed on undead creatures, effectively allowing them an better chance to avoid the effects of a good clericâ€™s turning ability. First, determine how many creatures would be turned normally. Those who are potentially turned get level checks to avoid the effect.

This spell offers protection from the blinding effect of the Positive Energy Plane, and warded creatures gain no temporary hit points while there.
