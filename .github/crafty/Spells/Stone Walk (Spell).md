You magically link one location to another so that you or another may speak a command word at one end and be teleported to the other end.

Before you cast the spell you must prepare the ends of the link, both of which must be areas of stone 5 feet square. This preparation takes 1 hour, and functions for repeated castings of the spell as long as the stones are not damaged.

When the spell is cast, the stones become attuned to a command word you designate. Any creature that speaks the command word while standing upon one of the stones is teleported without error to the other end instantaneously. The stones function once for every four caster levels, and can carry 50 pounds per caster level each time. Creatures that exceed the weight limitation are not transported and count as one of the uses of the spell.

*Material Component:* The preparation of each of the ends of the link requires a paste made from rubies and amber worth 2,500 gp. Casting the spell requires a 2,500 gp diamond. Activating one of the linked stones once the spell is cast does not require any material component.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell may be cast several times using one of a pair of linked stones to link another pair together with a different command word. In this manner, it is possible to stand on a linked stone and choose one of several different destinations by using a different command word.

This spell originally appeared in *Magic of Faerûn*.
