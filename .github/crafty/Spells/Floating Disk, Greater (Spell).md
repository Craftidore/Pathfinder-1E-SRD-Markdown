*Letting the mercury drip to the ground you create a slightly concave disk of energy. It hovers several feet above the ground.*

This spell functions like *[[Floating Disk (Spell)|floating disk]]*, except that the created disk does not need to stay within 3 feet of the surface beneath it. However, the disk must remain within 15 feet of you at all times. You can concentrate (as a standard action) on the disk to make it move with a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect). This allows you to sit on the disk and command it to carry you about.
