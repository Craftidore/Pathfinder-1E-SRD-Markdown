*You shake your head, and your face reshapes itself into the visage of a boar. As this happens, your body becomes bulkier, and your shoulders and back bristle with hair.*

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +8 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your face becomes that of a boar, and you gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You also gain the benefit of the [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]] feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks.

*Material Component:* Four boar bristles.
