*Needle-sharp quills emerge from your skin as you begin casting this spell, then fly outward in every direction when you complete the spell.*

Creatures within the spread of a *quill blast* are hit by one or more quills, depending on their size: Tiny or smaller, 4 quills; Small, 6 quills; Medium, 8 quills; Large, 10 quills; and Huge or larger, 12 quills.   

Small or larger creatures that make their saves are struck by half as many quills; Tiny or smaller creatures that make their saves avoid the quills completely.

Each quill deals 1d6 points of damage and lodges itself into the creature it hits. Lodged quills impose a noncumulative â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. All quills can be removed safely as a standard action with a DC 20 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check. Otherwise, removing the quills deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
