*With the last words of power, you make the convert’s oath binding and ensure your deity’s aid when the worst befalls his new servant.*

This spell allows the target to enter into a binding agreement with your deity that brings the target back to life if it is slain.

When this spell is cast, the subject’s Constitution is permanently lowered by 2 points. In exchange for this, if the subject should die, a *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell is immediately cast upon the subject. However, the resurrected creature does not regain the 2 Constitution points when returned to life.

If the spell is dispelled before the subject dies, it does not regain its 2 lost Constitution points. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell can return the lost Constitution, but only after the *delayed resurrection* has been activated or dispelled.

*Material Component:* A diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *death pact* to *delayed resurrection* to avoid duplication.
