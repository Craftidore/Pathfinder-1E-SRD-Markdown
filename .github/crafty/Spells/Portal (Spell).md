Casting *portal* opens an interdimensional connection between two places on the same plane of existence, allowing travel between the locations in either direction. The *portal* itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is two-dimensional window and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. The *portal* has a front and back. Creatures moving through the portal from the front are transported to the other location; creatures moving through it from the back are not.

The interdimensional connection is forged through the [[Astral Plane]], so anything that blocks astral travel will also block the usage of the *portal.* Much like the *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell, you must have a clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can't create a *portal* if you don't know where the terminus will end up. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the *portal* will form. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make traversing a *portal* more hazardous or even impossible. Use the following table to determine the success of the *portal's* opening:


| **Destination Familiarity** | **Successful Portal** | **Failed Portal** |
|---|---|---|
| Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-100 |
| Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-100 |
| Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-100 |
| Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-100 |
| Description | 01-60 | 61-100 |

*Material Component:* Ruby dust that is used to form the outline of the *portal* (cost 1,000 gp).

*XP Cost:* 500 XP
