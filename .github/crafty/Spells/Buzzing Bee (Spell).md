This spell creates an unnerving noise that disrupts the subject’s concentration. The subject is distracted and takes a –10 penalty on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (v3.5 Move Silently) checks. Creatures that can’t hear are not distracted. The DC of Concentration checks to cast spells or maintain concentration while distracted is equal to this spell’s DC + the level of the spell being cast.

The bee has a fly speed of 180 feet (perfect). It remains near the subject in spite of darkness, *[[Invisibility (Ring)|invisibility]]*, polymorphing, cover, concealment, or any other attempt at disguising or hiding. The bee remains until the spell’s duration expires or the subject moves out of range.

The bee can’t be attacked, but it can be dispelled.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk setting this spell is most often known as *Mordenkainen's buzzing bee.*
