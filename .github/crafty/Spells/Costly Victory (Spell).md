Choose between two effects: Either you cause affected opponents to burst into flames when they slay an ally, or you set your own allies alight. This effect must be chosen when you cast this spell and cannot be reversed.

If you choose to target opponents with this spell, each foe that fails its Will save and subsequently kills one of your allies while this spell is in effect takes 1d8 hp damage per caster level (maximum 30d8). Half the damage is fire damage, while the other half results from divine power and is not subject to fire resistance. If the target creature takes fire damage, it catches on fire.

If you choose to target allies with this spell, the spell creates a nimbus of fire around each recipient. The fire deals no damage to the spell’s recipients, but it deals 2d6 hp damage—half fire, half divine—in a 10-ft. radius to all other creatures. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage.
