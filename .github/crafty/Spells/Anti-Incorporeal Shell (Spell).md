**Components:** V, S, DF

**Range:** 10 ft.

**Area:** 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that incorporeal creatures cannot enter.

This spell can be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The hemispherical energy field created by this spell does not extend through walls, floors and such; however, it still prevents incorporeal creatures from moving through them and then striking at the caster.
