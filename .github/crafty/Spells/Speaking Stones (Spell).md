This spell allows you to fashion a magical link between two stones (or any other mundane, nonmagical objects weighing up to 1 pound each). This link allows each stone to pass a single message to the other, no matter how great the distance between them after the spell is first cast.

Once the stones are transmuted with this spell, a creature holding one stone can send a message of no more than twenty-five words as a standard action. The message instantly sounds from the other stone, loud enough to be heard by anyone within 5 feet of it. The spell ends after each stone passes one message to its twin, or the spell’s duration elapses, whichever occurs first.

Messages are not transmitted across planar boundaries. If the bearer of one *speaking stone* attempts to pass a message while the other stone is on another plane, the message rebounds and plays back on the original stone. This playback counts as that stone’s single message transmission. 

No object can have more than one *speaking stones* spell cast upon it. A second *speaking stones* cast upon the same object ends the first spell.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Scribing dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Sivis), can send a message of up to 100 words through any object upon which she has cast this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* *Speaking stones* may be made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

When made permanent, *speaking stones* are usually enchanted twice for each set so as to allow two-way communication with each capable of sending a message to the other every other round.
