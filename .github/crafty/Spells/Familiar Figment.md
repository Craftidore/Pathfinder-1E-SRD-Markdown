You create an illusory duplicate of your familiar that moves erratically around your familiar’s space, frequently moving through the familiar’s body with a blurring effect that makes it indistinguishable from the real creature.

Attacks against your familiar have a 50% miss chance; attacks that miss instead target the familiar figment, which reacts as if damaged as appropriate to the attack but unlike a *mirror image* is not destroyed when struck. This spell does not grant your familiar concealment or prevent it from being targeted by spell effects that do not require an attack roll.

In addition, as a swift action, your familiar can direct the familiar figment to attempt a melee touch attack, using your base attack bonus and the familiar’s Dexterity modifier. If this attack hits, your familiar (but not other creatures) treats that target as flanked until the end of its turn.
