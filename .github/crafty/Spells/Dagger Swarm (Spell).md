This spell enchants one or more daggers with sustained telekinetic energy that allows them to fly about and attack targets within range of the spell as the caster desires. The damage done by each dagger is normal, unless it is enchanted somehow prior to casting this spell or while attacking by means of a *[[Magic Weapon (Spell)|magic weapon]]*, *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]*, or similar magic.

The caster of the spell can direct each dagger in the swarm to attack a single target within range and can move the *dagger swarm* to another target as a move equivalent action during their turn. The *dagger swarm* cannot be used to flank, aid an attack, or sneak attack, but each one maintains the critical threat range of a normal dagger. If the daggers are directed to a target beyond the spell’s maximum range, they cease attacking and return to hover over the caster, awaiting a command to attack another target. The daggers attack using the caster’s base attack bonus plus his key ability modifier for spellcasting.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level.

*House Rule:* Daggers in a *dagger swarm* do not get attacks of opportunity (cf. *[[Spiritual Weapon (Spell)|spiritual weapon]]*).
