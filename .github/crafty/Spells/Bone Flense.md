Choose a creature that you can see. When that creature is struck by a weapon wielded by a member of the Red Mantis, a sawtooth sabre, or by the claw of a [[Mantis, Giant (Bestiary PF1)|giant mantis]], the bone nearest to the wound instantly sprouts jagged, razor-sharp spurs that flense the muscle and flesh from the inside out unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. The creature takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level. While the bone returns to normal immediately after dealing damage, the creature takes 1d4 points of [[Bleed|bleed]] damage for 1 round per 2 caster levels. The victim is [[Sickened|sickened]] by the pain for the duration of the bleeding. If the target creature has no bones, this spell has no effect.
