This spell may only be cast in an outdoor area; it fails if cast indoors or underground. When you cast this spell, you cause three frozen comets to strike down upon any three different creatures or objects in range. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit each target. Each target struck takes 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d4 points of cold damage per level (maximum 10d4), and is stunned for one round. A successful Reflex save negates the bludgeoning damage and the stunning effects, but not the cold damage. Each round the spell persists, another three frozen comets rain down upon the original three targets; as a standard action you can select new targets for one, two, or all three comets.
