With this spell the caster marks a backpack with his *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]*; this can be a mundane backpack with no special qualities or an enchanted one (cf. *[[Handy Haversack|handy haversack]]**)*. The link enables the caster to summon this backpack whenever he wants. Perhaps the caster has left his backpack somewhere, with this spell in effect he need not worry about going back for it. With no more than a thought, the backpack is summoned to his hands, though what is in it, thatâ€™s another matter entirely. If someone has emptied it, the backpack will be empty, or perhaps someone took it and has been using it, well who is to say what has been picked up.

The link is in place for 1 day per level, in which case, the caster can summon his backpack anytime he wants. Though, the backpack must be within 500 miles per caster level as well as being on the same plane.
