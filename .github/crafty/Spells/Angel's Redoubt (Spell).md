You conjure a fortified tower made of stone. There are two floors and a flat roof with battlements, all connected by narrow stairs on the interior. In all respects the structure resembles a normal tower, with an iron door and three shuttered windows on the upper interior level (stairs lead from the ground level outside to the door), and a small fireplace.

The shelter has a comfortable temperature and atmosphere no matter what the conditions are like outside. The tower provides considerable securityâ€”the walls are 4-foot-thick stone and the door is 2-inch-thick iron. The structure itself resists spells cast directly upon it as if it had SR 25. It is impervious to normal missiles, though not the sort cast by siege machinery or giants.

The door, shutters, and even chimney remain secure against intrusion, the former two being *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane locked]]* and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top of a narrow flue. Finally, the spell conjures seven celestial dogs to watch over and protect the tower for its duration.

The tower contains elegant furnishings: twelve bunks, a trestle table, eight chairs, two benches, and a writing desk. The interior is filled with reliefs and tapestries depicting angels and holy beings.
