You magically delay the effects of a potion or oil. Once imbued with this infusion, a potion can be consumed or an oil applied, but the effects of the potion or oil do not take place immediately. Instead, the creature that consumed the potion or had the oil applied to it can activate its effects as a swift action at any time before the end of the infusionâ€™s duration. If the consumed potion or oil is not activated before the duration expires, it takes effect at that point.

An oil that is applied to an object is normally activated by the wielder of the object, rather than the character who applied the oil. However, if an oil imbued with this infusion is applied to an intelligent construct (such as a warforged or homunculus), only the construct can activate the effects of the oil. If an oil imbued with this infusion is applied to a nonintelligent construct (such as a golem), only the character who applied the oil can activate it.

No creature or object can have more than one delayed-effect potion or oil in effect at the same time. If a second delayed-effect potion or oil is consumed by the same creature or applied to the same object, the duration of the first *pending potion* infusion ends, and the potion or oil takes effect immediately.
