This spell functions like *[[Secure Shelter (Spell)|secure shelter]]**,* except as noted above and as follows. The structure is a simple flat-roofed fort rather than a cottage. It has a sturdy door and a fi replace but no windows; access to the roof is through a ladder and a sturdy hatch. The fortress resonates with the power of your deity’s home plane, and it is protected by *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]* and *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]**.*

The fortress’s appearance reflects your deity and deity’s realm.

*Sacrifice Component:* 1d2 points of Constitution damage.
