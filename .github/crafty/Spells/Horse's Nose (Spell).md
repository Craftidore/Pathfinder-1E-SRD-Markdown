You gain the Scent special ability. You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can detect opponents by sense of smell within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet; if it is downwind, the range is only 15 feet. Strong and overpowering scents increase the range (as noted in the *DMG*). You can note a creature’s presence; determining the direction of the scent requires a move-equivalent action, and you can pinpoint the creature’s location if you move to within 5 feet of it.

You can make a Wisdom check to find or follow a track by scent. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. Modifiers to the DC are listed in the *DMG*. Water ruins the trail.

You can identify familiar odors just like you identify familiar sights. However, an odor is not necessarily familiar to you if your only previous exposure to it was while you were not under the influence of *horse’s nose*. You only recognize odors that you could detect normally (without the aid of this spell).
