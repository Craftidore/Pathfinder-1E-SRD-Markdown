The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a *fly* spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a *fly* spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the *fly* spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: You can't run while under the effect of a *fly* spell. The fact that they mention you can't run here makes me think that they intended for you to be able to run with normal flying. 

A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack works just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon attacks, but these deal double damage. **A creature can use the run action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.**

*[[Wings of Flying|Wings of flying]]* give a fly speed without saying something like "as per the *fly* spell" so I would be inclined to think that you can run with *[[Wings of Flying|wings of flying]]*.
