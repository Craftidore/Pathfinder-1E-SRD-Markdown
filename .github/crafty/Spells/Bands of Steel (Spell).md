*The interlocking hoops become briefly hot then disappear even as similar, larger bands streak from your outstretched hand toward the creature you indicate. With a satisfying metallic clank, the bands wrap around the indicated creature.*

The victim must succeed on a Reflex save or be immobilized and thus unable to move. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is only partially trapped by the bands, and is [[Entangled|entangled]].

A creature immobilized by the bands can attempt to escape as a full-round action, either by bursting free (Strength DC 18) or wriggling out ([[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] DC 18).

An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can use a full-round action to break free (Strength DC 13) or disentangle itself ([[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] DC 13).

*Material Component:* Three small silver hoops, interlocked.
