Upon casting this spell, a shimmering, golden portal appears somewhere within 30 feet of the caster (though the caster has no control over where the portal appears). This golden disk appears upon the fourth round of casting, and it grows, expanding as if it were an opening eye until it reaches its maximum diameter. At the completion of the casting, the 10-foot circular opening goes translucent as the golden light of its edges dissipates back inside its radius, making the portal suddenly seem to lead into a long tunnel filled with electric silver-and-blue flashes of light. Creatures that gaze into the opening for more than one round see quick glimpses of their pasts cascading along the walls of the tunnel, but no memories or revisited scenes cause any damage. The portal remains for one round per level of the wizard or until the wizard enters the conduit, whichever occurs first.

During the casting, the wizard names the age and year that the *time conduit* is to transport those who enter it. For example, a wizard who wanted to visit Netheril (in the Forgotten Realms) around the time of the birth of Karsus would state: 'The conduit shall exit during the Shadowed Age of Netheril in the year 3163 in Netheril Years.' Bear in mind that the phrasing or the choice of calendar is less important than the wizard’s focus on and knowledge of the time he wishes to visit and his calculating of the years between his time and the one he wishes to visit. The same time could be reached with these phrases: The conduit shall exit during the Fifth Rysar of Cormanthor in the 14th winter of the Coronal Tannivh (travel to old elven realms); The conduit shall exit during the Fourth Age of Calimshan in the 72nd year of the rule of the Pasha Vydraq (travel to ancient Calimshan); or The conduit shall exit during the 696th year before the advent of Dalereckoning (travel back 2,000 years without focus on geographic destination).

Travel using this spell is never specific; the location arrived at is usually at a specific region or geographic feature. Successfully making a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (Arcana) DC 45 allows the caster to arrive at a specific urban area within a given geographic region.

The *time conduit's* 'reach' backwards in time is determined by the caster's level; for each level of the caster, the *time conduit* may extend back 100 years, so a 20th-level wizard could go back 2,000 years in a single casting.

**GM NOTE**

This spell is an extraordinarily rare and difficult spell to obtain, let alone master. Lifelong campaigns could be run by mages seeking such a spell, whether by acquisition from another wizard or researching the magic themselves.

While it is certainly possible that the spell could be placed on a scroll in a long-lost tomb, it is more likely that the few who know the *time conduit* spell must be approached and wooed by the seeking wizard. Major campaign NPCs such as the lich Larloch, the wizards among Mystra’s Chosen, the Magister or agents of Azuth, members of the Circle of Eight,and others might trade the knowledge of this spell for such costs as a favor in the future, a small errand, or the payment of a valuable possession of the character (from another equally rare spell of equivalent rank to items or worldly possessions such as real estate). Many of the folk who might have access to this spell are also quite particular over whom would learn it, and many who finally discover the NPC with the knowledge they covet also find she has no desire to grant it to the PC. This situation can only be handled through roleplaying.
