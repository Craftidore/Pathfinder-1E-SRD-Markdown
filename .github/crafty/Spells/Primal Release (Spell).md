You release the primal savage within a single creature. The target grows more bestial and gains a +10 inherent bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +2 inherent bonus to Dexterity, and a –6 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma, as well as a –2 penalty to Wisdom. The target cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities for the duration, but its base attack bonus increases to +1 per Hit Die (if its current base attack bonus is less than that). The creature can fight as though it had the [[Cleave (Feat)|Cleave]] feat (its normal and improved versions), the [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] feat, and the [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]] feat.
