*By pointing and making a number of loud, nonsensical sounds you release the power of the spell. The target attempts to speak, but spews forth only gibberish instead.*

For the duration of this spell, the subject has a 50% chance to miscast spells that have verbal components, and any time the subject speaks (including the use of magic items activated by command words), there is a 50% chance that the utterance is completely incomprehensible and therefore ineffective.
