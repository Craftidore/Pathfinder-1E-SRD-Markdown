*Rushing to the body of your fallen ally, you call out magic words that will bring back life and breath to your friend.*

*Last breath* restores life to a recently deceased creature, creating a new body for the returning spirit to inhabit. However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim’s death. This spell functions like *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*, except that the reincarnated creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature has –1 hit points (but is stable).
