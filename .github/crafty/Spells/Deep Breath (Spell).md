*You let out a quick cry and instantly feel your chest swell with air, as if you had taken a deep breath. Strangely, you feel no need to exhale.*

Your lungs instantly fill with air, and continue to refill with air for the duration of the spell. When the spellâ€™s duration expires, you can continue to hold your breath as if you had just gulped down a lungful of air.

You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself from drowning after being suddenly plunged into water.
