*As you touch the creature, a chill sweeps through you and down your arm. As the spell takes effect, the creatureâ€™s body changes hue, becoming an icy blue.*

The subject creature gains the cold subtype, granting it immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire (the creature takes half again as much damage from fire effects). A fire creature subjected to this spell does not gain the cold subtype, but it loses the fire subtype for the duration.

*Material Component:* A pinch of sapphire dust worth 10 gp.
