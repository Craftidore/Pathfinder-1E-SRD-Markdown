*You call upon your deity to mark your foes as enemies of the faith. Divine energy surges through the area, and for a brief moment a holy symbol of your deity shines from the forehead of each targeted creature.*

You and your allies see the *mark of judgment* on a creature and know to strike it in preference over other unmarked targets. Whenever a creature succeeds on a melee or ranged attack against any subject of a *mark of judgment* spell, that attacker heals 2 points of damage.

The targets of this spell must have an alignment that opposes yours on at least one axisâ€”evil if you are good, lawful if you are chaotic, and so on. For example, a lawful good cleric can place a *mark of judgment* upon a chaotic good, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil opponent. A neutral caster can use this spell against any good, evil, lawful, or chaotic foe.
