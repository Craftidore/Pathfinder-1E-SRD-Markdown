You cause the cyst of a subject already harboring a *necrotic cyst* (see spell of the same name) to explosively enlarge itself at the expense of the subject’s body tissue, harming both the subject (and nearby creatures if the subject fails his save). If the subject succeeds on his saving throw, he takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6), and half the damage is considered vile damage (see *[[Necrotic Bloat (Spell)|necrotic bloat]]*). The subject’s cyst-derived saving throw penalty against effects from the school of necromancy applies.

If the subject fails his saving throw, the cyst expands beyond control, killing the subject. All creatures within 20 feet of the subject take 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6; Reflex half), and half the damage taken is considered vile damage. All creatures in range that take this secondary damage are also exposed to the effect of the base *necrotic cyst* spell. On the round following the subject’s death, the cyst exits the flesh of the slain subject as a free-willed undead called a skulking cyst (*Libris Mortis* 120).

*Focus:* Caster must possess a mother cyst (*Libris Mortis* 28).
