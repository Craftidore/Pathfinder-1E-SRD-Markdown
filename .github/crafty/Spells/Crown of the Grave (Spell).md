*A ring of ghostly fog surrounds the target’s head. With a swirl, the fog dissipates, leaving behind a crown made of human bones.*

This spell creates a magic crown that grants its wearer the power to command undead. Once per minute, the crown’s wearer can issue a one-word order to an undead creature, as per the *[[Command (Spell)|command]]* spell. The undead creature must make a Will save to resist this effect. Even though *[[Command (Spell)|command]]* is normally a mind-affecting spell, the crown channels holy or unholy energy (depending on your alignment; neutral casters choose one or the other) to compel obedience. In addition, a cleric who wears the crown can expend a use of his turn or rebuke undead ability to increase this ability’s save DC by 4.

As an immediate action, the creature wearing a *crown of the grave* can discharge its magic to gain a +4 bonus on a single turn or rebuke undead attempt. The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.

The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm. If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.

*Material Component:* A pinch of grave dirt.

*Focus:* A wooden hoop 6 inches in diameter.
