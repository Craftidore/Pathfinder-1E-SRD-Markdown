*A swarm of shimmering motes streams from your fingers and engulfs your target.*

You create a swarm of faintly luminous motes of pure force that engulf one creature, obscuring its vision. If the target relies on sight, all its attacks have a 20% miss chance while the motes last. The motes also deal 1d6 points of damage each round. The target can attempt a Reflex save each round to avoid the damage.

If a subject under the effects of *luminous swarm* is targeted by *[[Fever Dream (Spell)|fever dream]]*, the two spells interact to create a greater effect. See the *[[Fever Dream (Spell)|fever dream]]* spell for details.
