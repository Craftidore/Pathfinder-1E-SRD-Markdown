In a flash of recognition, you learn about the geography of your surroundings within a radius of 1 mile per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 mile). This instant familiarity grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +5) on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography) checks and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to avoid getting lost so long as you remain in the affected area.

Additionally, for the duration of the spell you can make [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography) checks regarding the affected area as though you were trained in that skill.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.

*Lay of the land* does not reveal caves or caverns, nor does it reveal any subterranean features. It also provides no information regarding urban settlements other than their existence.
