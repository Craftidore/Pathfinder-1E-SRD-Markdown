You influence the actions of the targeted creature by offering profound and thoughtful advice grounded in your wisdom and experience. You must word your advice in such a manner as to make it sound reasonable, even if it is not, but you are not limited to a few sentences. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it does its best to follow your advice, carrying out the suggested course of action to the best of its ability. If the action would place the creature in great peril or cause its death, the victim can attempt a second saving throw—this time with a +4 circumstance bonus—just before taking the final plunge to its doom.
