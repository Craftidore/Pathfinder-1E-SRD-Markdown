With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to

clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a

windstorm (*Core Rulebook* 439). During the first round of the

spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything

of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of

the spell’s effect (50% chance of landing on either side). You

may move within the effect without penalty, though all other

creatures are subject to the wind’s effects. On the second and

all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated

as a wind wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other

liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the

surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action, you can

move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its

ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with

its current orientation (toward you or away from you).
