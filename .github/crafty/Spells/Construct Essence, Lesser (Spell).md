*As you lay your hand on the living construct standing before you, its form becomes more durable and unyielding.*

When this spell is cast upon a living construct, it takes on more of the qualities of a true construct. The living construct gains the moderate fortification armor special quality, negating critical hits and sneak attacks 75% of the time. As well, the living construct gains low-light vision and immunity to nonlethal damage and stunning.

If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Humanoid Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser humanoid essence]]*, both spells are dispelled and have no effect. It has no effect if cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Humanoid Essence (Spell)|humanoid essence]]* or *[[Humanoid Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater humanoid essence]].*
