You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesnâ€™t escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the *maze* spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* and *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**,* do not help a creature escape a *maze* spell, although a *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
