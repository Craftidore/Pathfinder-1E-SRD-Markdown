*You kneel beside your animal companion and press a sprig of mistletoe against its forehead, calling upon the power of nature.*

*Align fang* makes a creature’s natural weapons good-, evil-, lawful-, or chaotic-aligned, as you choose. A natural weapon that is aligned can overcome 

the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. This spell has no effect on a natural weapon that is already treated as being aligned, such as the claw or bite attack of most demons.

You can’t cast this spell on a manufactured weapon, such as a sword.

When you cast this spell to make a natural weapon good-, evil-, lawful-, or chaotic-aligned, *align fang* is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.
