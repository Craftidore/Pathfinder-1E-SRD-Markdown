This spell transforms one of your hands into a smoky claw like that of a belker. With a successful touch attack, you fill a living targetâ€™s lungs with smoke. The smoke inside the victim solidifies into miniature claws and begins to rip at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage dealt. For every three caster levels, the smoke lasts for another round (to a maximum of 4 rounds at 12th level), dealing another 3d4 points of damage.

You can use this melee touch attack once per round for every three caster levels, up to a maximum of four times at 12th level.
