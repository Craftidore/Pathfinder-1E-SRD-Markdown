*You fire a brilliant ray of white, black, green, blue, and red at the dragon.*

This spell calls upon the might of evil dragonkind to suppress the powers of a good dragon or dragonblood creature. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. If the attack is successful, the dragon must make a successful Will save or become unable to use all its racial supernatural and spell-like abilities. This does not include the spells a dragon casts from its sorcerer spell progression.

*Special:* If you receive your divine spells from Mask or Tiamat, you receive a +1 profane bonus on the ranged touch attack.
