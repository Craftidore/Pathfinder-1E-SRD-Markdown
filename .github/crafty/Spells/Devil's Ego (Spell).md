*You intone profane words of prayer and run your fingers across your face. As they pass, your features soften, becoming attractive and appealing, You feel a powerful confidence building inside you.*

You gain a +4 profane bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma -based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. If you have levels in a noncleric spellcasting class that relies on Charisma, this spell does not grant additional bonus spells, though it could increase the save DCs for spells you cast from that class.

In addition, for the duration of this spell, your type changes to outsider, making you immune to spells and effects that specifically target humanoids, such as *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]* and *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]**.*

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Supercedes version from the *Book of Vile Darkness.*
