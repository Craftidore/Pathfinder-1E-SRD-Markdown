*A burst of purple light reveals all that is hidden.*

*Momentary revelation* creates an area in which all things appear as they actually are. The burst reveals objects in the same way as a *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* spell, though it lasts for only 1 round. Unlike with *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*, all creatures in visual range can see the effect of the spell. The spell does not dispel any magical effectsâ€”it only temporarily reveals them. Should a creature pass through the burst during its duration, any hidden elements on it are revealed, though they are again hidden as soon as the creature steps out of the area.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *revelation* to *momentary revelation* to avoid duplication.
