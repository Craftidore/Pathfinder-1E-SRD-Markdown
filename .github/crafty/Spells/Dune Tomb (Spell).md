This spell can affect only creatures who are in contact with a sand dune that is at least twice as large as the largest creature targeted. You can target up to one creature per level, but all of the targets must be within 60 feet of each other. All targeted creatures who fail to resist the *dune tomb* effect sink down into the dune to a depth equal to twice their height and are magically *held* for as long as the spell persists. During this time, they do not need to eat, drink, or breathe, and they do not heal damage (to hit points or to ability scores), but they do continue to age normally. Each day that passes after the initial casting, a victim must make another Will save or suffer 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain as their mind slowly begins to fall apart under the strain of the inky isolation.

As long as the spell remains in effect, the caster can communicate to any of the entrapped victims in a manner identical to that provided by the *[[Sending (Spell)|sending]]* spell, save that there is no limit to the number of words that can be transmitted. Communicating in this manner requires concentration, and it removes the need for the victim to make a Will save to prevent Wisdom drain until another 24 hours pass after the communication ends. The victims can reply as they wish, but the caster can always opt to end the conversation as a free action, plunging the victim back into isolation. The caster can release any or all of the victims at will by dismissing the magic entrapping the victim in question. A mental ping informs you if the victim leaves the tomb.

The *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]* spell can free the imprisoned person, but only if it's cast within 60 feet of where the person is entombed. Magical search by a *[[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]]*, a *[[Locate Object (Spell)|locate object]]* spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is entombed, but *[[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]]* does.

Desert spellcasters often use this spell to entrap enemies, promising them freedom in return for information.
