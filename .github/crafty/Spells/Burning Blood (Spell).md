*The taste of copper fills your mouth and bloody spatters punctuate the last few words that unlock the spell. You gag slightly as the blood in your mouth congeals, but disappears even as you release the spell.*

You taint a living creatureâ€™s blood with a hot, corrosive infusion, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage and 1d8 points of fire damage per round. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage, but a successful save does not prevent damage in future rounds. Searing pain limits the subject to a single move action in any round when it fails its Fortitude save.

*Burning blood* does not affect creatures of the construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead types.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Nar demonbinder 4 to Level per Unapproachable East.

Sometimes known as *Beltyn's burning blood.*
