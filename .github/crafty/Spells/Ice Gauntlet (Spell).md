*All warmth leaves your hand as at first a sheen of white frost covers it, then larger crystals of clear ice form around it. In seconds a large bristling ball of rock-hard ice spikes surrounds your fist, a cold mist enshrouding your forearm.*

You can attack with your fist in all respects as if you were wearing a *+1 [[Gauntlet, Spiked|spiked gauntlet]]*. The *+1 [[Gauntlet, Spiked|spiked gauntlet]]* deals normal damage for your size and 1d4 points of cold damage. Damage reduction applies to the ice gauntletâ€™s normal damage, but it does not affect the cold damage. If you fail a saving throw against a fire effect, the ice gauntlet melts and the spell ends.
