**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of dried humanoid sinew)

**Target:** One creature

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial

You encase the heart of the target creature in a block of ice. The target becomes immediately [[Exhausted|exhausted]] and dies in 1d3+2 rounds. The subject is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the target succeeds on the save, it instead takes 5d8 points of cold damage and is not [[Exhausted|exhausted]]. (The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on the saving throw.) A character attempting to save the victim of a *heartfreeze* spell must use a healing spell or effect on the victim as well as succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, otherwise the victim will succumb to the *heartfreeze* and die.

A creature immune to critical hits and sneak attacks is unaffected by *heartfreeze.*
