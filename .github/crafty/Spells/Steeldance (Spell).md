*You place the two daggers in your outstretched palm and cast the spell. They rise from your hands, glowing with a dim blue radiance.*

The two daggers hover about you, attacking foes that come near. On your turn, each blade can make an attack at an adjacent opponent, with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your relevant ability modifier. The damage they deal is equal to the normal weapon damage (1d4 for daggers) + your ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards and Charisma for sorcerers). The weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Your blades can be attacked with sunder or disarm attempts as if you were wielding them, and they use the above attack bonus to resolve such situations. Disarming a weapon under the effect of *steeldance* ends the spell for that weapon.

**GM NOTE**

*Spell Secret:* At the time of casting, the caster can attempt a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 30) to successfully transfer any enchantments and/or spells in effect (upon the focus) from the spell's focus (the two bladed weapons) onto the daggers created by *steeldance* for the duration of the spell. 

If this [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check is successful, it also increases the difficulty to identify (by using [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]) the *steeldance* spell by +1 for each enchantment or spell that has been transferred.
