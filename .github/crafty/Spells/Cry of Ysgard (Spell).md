You call 2d4 bariaur defenders of Ysgard from the plains of Ysgard to your location. They serve you for up to a year, and you may dismiss them at any time. They are intelligent, so you can assign them different tasks. They can refuse to complete a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens without your supervision.

No matter how many times you cast this spell, you can control no more than four bariaur rangers; others are released from service and return to Ysgard immediately. You choose which creatures to release.

*Sacrifice:* 1d3 points of Strength drain.
