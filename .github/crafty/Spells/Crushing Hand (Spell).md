This spell functions as *[[Interposing Hand (Spell)|interposing hand]]*, except that it can also grapple one opponent as *[[Grasping Hand (Spell)|grasping hand]]*. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to the CMD). A *crushing hand* deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The *crushing hand* can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as *[[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]]*), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as *[[Interposing Hand (Spell)|interposing hand]]* does.

**GM Note**

In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting this spell is known as *Bigby's crushing hand.*
