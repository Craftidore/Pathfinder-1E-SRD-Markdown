The targetâ€™s flesh becomes flexible and rubbery. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Grapple|grapple]] combat maneuver checks and [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks, as well as to its CMD against combat maneuver checks to [[Grapple|grapple]]. Anytime the target would take [[Falling (Environment Rules)|falling]] damage, it treats falls as 20 feet shorter (minimum 0) for the purpose of determining damage. In addition, if the target falls against a hard surface, it can attempt an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check (DC = the distance fallen) to attempt to bounce upward; success means the creature bounces upward half the distance fallen.
