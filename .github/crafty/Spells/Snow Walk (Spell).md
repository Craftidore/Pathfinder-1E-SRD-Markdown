The subjects can walk on top of snow rather than through it, avoiding the usual movement penalties and leaving neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subject is impossible by nonmagical means, and the gliding along the surface of the snow adds 10 feet to the target creature’s land speed. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.)
