This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. *Break enchantment* can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, *break enchantment* works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.

If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, *break enchantment* does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the itemâ€™s effects.
