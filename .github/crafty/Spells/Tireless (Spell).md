This allows the target to move three times its normal overland movement rate, perform three times the usual amount of labor (such as crafting a magical item or potion), or read and learn material at three times the normal rate. Creatures under the effects of this spell are immune to non-magical fatigue and exhaustion and suffer no consequences for not sleeping or for overexertion. *Tireless* has no effect on magical fatigue or exhaustion.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* For purposes of magical crafting, this spell allows the subject to complete up to three 8 hour crafting blocks in a single 8 hour session. If crafting while adventuring, 6 hours of crafting may be completed in a normal 4 hour session.
