This spell functions like *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*, except it affects a small structure, vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures within a *secret vault* don’t cause the spell to fail. While the vault is stored on the [[Ethereal Plane]], living creatures within the vault don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can’t leave the vault except via magic such as *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]*. The vault used as a focus for *secret vault* must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica costs 250 gp. A *secret vault* has only a 1% cumulative chance per day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360 days.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* At the time of casting, the GM should have the caster roll a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check to determine if he has unknowingly succeeded in casting a more perfect variant of this spell. 

- DC 30: Caster may access his *secret vault* one time plus once more per primary casting attribute within the 360 days duration. 
- DC 40: Caster may access his *secret vault* once per level plus once more per primary casting attribute during the 360 days duration. 
- DC 50: The duration of the spell is 1 year and there is no chance per day during this time that the vault will be irretrievably lost. Caster may access his *secret vault* once per day.
