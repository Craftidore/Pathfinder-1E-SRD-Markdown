Each subject of *triple strike* can take two extra attacks when making a full attack action, provided that it attacks with a melee weapon it is holding. These extra attacks are made using the subject's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. In addition, each affected creature's melee weapon bursts into pure white flame, gaining the *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* and *[[Flaming Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming burst]]* special abilities for the duration of the spell. This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* spell or a *[[Speed (MagWpnSpcAb)|weapon of speed]]*, nor does it grant an extra action.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *'Sakkratar's triple strike'* to *'triple strike'* for campaign continuity. This spell is known as “*Sakkratar’s triple strike*” in the Forgotten Realms.
