The target of this spell gains total control over his dreams. While having normal (nonmagical) dreams, the subject can control what he experiences in every way he wishes. After waking from such dreams, the subject gains a +4 moral bonus on all ability checks and skill checks for the remainder of the spell’s duration. He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws against spells with the \[dreaming] descriptor. If the target of this spell is a caster who must prepare spells, he may do so in his dreams and when he awakens, his spell preparation for the day will be complete.

Additionally, if the subject of a *greater lucid dreamer* spell finds himself in the Dreamscape, he can use his skills normally, without being limited to a total bonus equal to his [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (the planes) skill.

Typically this spell is cast just before the target rests (goes to sleep) at the end of the day. The duration begins at this point and lasts for 24 hours afterward. In some campaigns, this may be an exception to how a spell in effect works.
