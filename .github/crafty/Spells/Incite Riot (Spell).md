Each creature that fails its saving throw attacks the nearest creature on its next turn, whether friend or foe. An affected creature attacks with whatever weapon is in hand, or with natural weapons. An unarmed creature attacks with an unarmed strike. An affected creature not already adjacent to another creature will move or (if possible) charge the nearest creature; if the nearest creature is not within range of a charge, the subject moves toward the nearest creature along the most efficient route.
