*Your mind seems to expand as a mystical sixth sense begins observing the target area.*

This spell functions like *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]**,* except that you immediately know the type and number of creatures that triggered the spell. This effect applies only to creatures that cross the boundary during the round in which the spell is triggered; creatures that come afterward are not automatically detected.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Like *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]], attentive alarm* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. It resets itself 10 minutes after being triggered.
