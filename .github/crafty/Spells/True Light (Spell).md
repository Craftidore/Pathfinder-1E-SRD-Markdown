Besides providing basic illumination, the glow from *true light* also functions as the *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* spell. The conditions revealed by *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* are similarly revealed (but not dispelled) under the light’s 20-foot-radius brightness—normal and magical darkness are nullified within the area, magically hidden secret doors are revealed if touched by the light, etc. Changed or otherwise cloaked creatures (under the terms of *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*) entering *true light*’s central area of effect are allowed round-by-round [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] \[v3.5 Spot] check (DC 15) to notice that their concealment is not functioning. The dim light that stretches out an additional 20 feet from the center area does not possess the *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* quality but it does affect creatures who are utilizing one of the concealment types detected for by coating them in *[[Faerie Fire (Spell)|faerie fire]]* (which itself eliminates such benefits as *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]*, *[[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]]*, or *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*).
