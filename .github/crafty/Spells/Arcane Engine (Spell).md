You create a zone of transformational magic that absorbs magical energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location.

The *arcane engine* absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its area of effect. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the engine equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell or a charge from a *wand of fireballs* would add three spell levels to the field’s store, a *potion of cure light wounds* would add one, and a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* from a *[[Three Wishes|ring of three wishes]]* would add nine. Items that don’t have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so *an* *[[Immovable|immovable rod]]* would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]* prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.

The *arcane engine* absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a *+1 mace*, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a *[[Continual Flame (Spell)|continual flame]]* would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.

A successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) allows the caster to change the area of the spell, confining it within an lead coffer bound with thin strips of [[Mithral|mithral]] (dimensions no more than 8 ft. by 4 ft. by 4 ft.) valued at 5,000 gp. Any continually functioning item placed within the coffer will have its enchantment consumed and the item itself will be reduced to a pinch of dust. Each 1,000 gp of value provides arcane energy equal to one spell level. Charged items such as a *wand of fireballs* add spell levels equal the number of charges multiplied by the highest spell it can cast. The rate at which the coffer 'burns' items is 1 per hour, beginning with the most valuable and once it is consumed the coffer begins with the next and so on. The coffer can contain absorbed spell levels equal the caster's level multiplied by his primary spellcasting modifier. For example, a *arcane engine* coffer created by a 14th-level wizard with an Intelligence modifier of 4 would be able to contain 56 spells levels of energy. This can be extremely dangerous should the *arcane engine's* coffer be sundered or *disjuncted* as doing so releases the stored energy in a 60-ft.-radius blast. This blast does 1d6 points of untyped damage per stored spell level with no saving throw or spell resistance being allowed.

An *arcane engine* has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of *the arcane engine*. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The *arcane engine* automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting is about to expire. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the engine expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field’s concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.

Typical spells linked to an *arcane engine* are *[[Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|blindness/deafness]]*, *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*, *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]*, *summon monster*, or *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the engine (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment). *Arcane engines* are also used to maintain spells that the caster might wish to keep in effect while absent or so as not to have to divert his attention for something else (ie., spell research, etc.). Some crafty wizards have been known to use multiple *arcane engines* within various areas within their sanctums, with a few even using them to maintain their sanctums (cf. *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|Mage's magnificent mansion]]* and *[[Capable Caravel (Spell)|capable caravel]]**).*

For example, you could have an *arcane engine* tied to *a* *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|magnificent mansion]]* spell that would renew it when the field had absorbed enough magic.

Only *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|Mage’s disjunction]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*, or similar spells can destroy *the arcane engine*. Spells of lower level, such as *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* and *[[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]*, are absorbed by it, and an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more *arcane engine* spells share an overlapping area, each has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area.

Spells having a component costing more than 5,000 gp must have that component available either in the area of the transformational magic or if the *arcane engine* is bound within a coffer, the component(s) must be placed within 5 ft of the coffer itself.
