*A sickly black fluid dribbles from the corner of your mouth.*

You gain the ability to create a virulent poison in your mouth. You can then either spit the poison at a foe or apply it to a weapon. In either case, a Fortitude save negates each instance of damage, as normal for poison.

Spitting the poison at a foe requires a standard action and a successful ranged touch attack; the range is 30 feet. In this form, the poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage as its initial and secondary damage.

Applying the poison to a weapon requires a swift action (and requires you to touch the weapon). This form of the poison deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage as its initial and secondary damage. You can apply the poison either to a manufactured or natural weapon, including your own bite attack (if you have one). The poison remains on your weapon until you make a successful attack or until the spell's duration ends, whichever comes first.

Each dose of poison you create reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 1 minute. The poison has no effect if ingested.
