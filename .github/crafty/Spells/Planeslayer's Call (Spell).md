## Overview

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 10]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, DF

**Range:** 20 ft.

**Targets:** Allies within a 40-ft.-radius burst centered on you

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 190

The magic of your allies in the area becomes more potent against certain outsiders. Chose one alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). Against outsiders with that alignment component or subtype, your allies in the area gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and their spells ignore the first 10 points of energy resistance (but not energy immunity).

This spell gains the alignment descriptor that is opposite the outsider alignment chosen. For example, if you choose for the spell to affect evil outsiders, then this spell has the good descriptor.
