One of the funeral rites of the Kariv requires burning the deceased’s wagon and belongings after the owners’ death (jewelry, china and money go to the family beforehand). Some witches use ashes taken from such pyres to create a ghost-ash wagon, which is placed among the other vehicles of a caravan.

Any non-Kariv approaching within 30 feet of this ghostly wagon is struck by a *[[Fear (Spell)|fear]]* spell of the caster’s level. If the characters overcome this initial effect and enter the ghost ash wagon they are confronted by the five burning [[Skeleton (Bestiary PF1)|skeletons]] that hide inside (see PF Bestiary for [[Skeleton (Bestiary PF1)|skeleton]] statistics); the spellcaster can command these [[Skeleton (Bestiary PF1)|skeletons]] as a free action.

A ghost ash wagon can be drawn by a *[[Phantom Steed (Spell)|phantom steed]]* or by an undead steed, common horses are too terrified to do so.
