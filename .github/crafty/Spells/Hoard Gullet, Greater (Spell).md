*You move your hands to your throat, chanting in low murmurs as you trace an imaginary line from your lower jaw down to your abdomen.*

You gain a magical second stomach, which can be used to transport objects securely. You can safely swallow and transport any object you could normally swallow (including items at least three size categories smaller than you or one size category larger). The capacity of your *greater hoard gullet* is 200 pounds and/or 10 cubic feet per caster level (up to a maximum of 2,000 pounds and 200 cubic feet). Unlike *hoard gullet,* you can remove individual items from your *greater hoard gullet*, as a standard action, or expel its entire contents into your square as a full-round action. It otherwise functions as a *bag of holding*.

At the end of the spell's duration, anything still in your second stomach is immediately and instantly brought up, falling to the ground next to you. You can't have more than one *greater hoard gullet* active at one time; casting this spell before its duration ends the duration of the previous casting. For example, if a 9th-level wizard with 2 days left on his *greater hoard gullet* casts the spell again, the spell's duration resets to 9 days.

Dragons often use this spell to transport their treasure hoards safely, but it is equally useful to those who would loot such hoards.
