*With a thunderous boom, a black storm cloud appears over your enemies, striking them with a terrifying combination of effects from the Elemental Planes.*

Each round, the storm generates one of the following effects, starting with the first effect, then progressing to the second, until it has run its 4-round course.

*1st Round:* A *storm of elemental fury* buffets the area immediately beneath it with a whirling windstorm*.* Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible, and Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blown away. Medium creatures must make their Fortitude save or be knocked prone, and Large or larger creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save to move that round. Flying creatures that fail their saves are instead blown in a random direction, traveling 1d6×5 feet if Large or larger, 1d6×10 feet if Medium, and 2d6×10 feet if Small or smaller. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the *storm of elemental fury*’s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

*2nd Round:* Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to all creatures in the storm.

*3rd Round:* A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50% chance). The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement in half.

*4th Round:* Flame pelts the area beneath the storm cloud, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) (Reflex half).
