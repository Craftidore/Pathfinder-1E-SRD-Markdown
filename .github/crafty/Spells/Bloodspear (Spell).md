This spell allows you to channel the fury of [[Gruumsh]] into the god’s favored weapon—a spear. The weapon’s tip begins to drip blood, and the spear acts as if it had the *[[Wounding (MagWpnSpcAb)|wounding]]* special ability for the duration of the spell. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one *bloodspear* in effect at a time.

This spell has no effect on a spear that already has the *[[Wounding (MagWpnSpcAb)|wounding]]* special ability, and it does not work on artifacts.

**GM Note**

*House Rule*: Level changed to Cleric 3, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Gruumsh 3 (HR).
