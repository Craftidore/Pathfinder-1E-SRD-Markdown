*You speak the ancient words of this spell and an aura of black, crackling negative energy surrounds you.*

Each round on your turn, every living creature within 10 feet of you loses 1 hit point per three caster levels (maximum 5). Undead creatures instead gain 2 hit points per round (though they canâ€™t exceed their full normal hit point total from this effect). Characters with immunity to negative energy effects are not affected by this aura. The aura does not affect you.
