Your mind fills with knowledge relating to a specific subject. Choose a single skill (if there are multiple different versions of the chosen skill, such as [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]], select one of them). You gain a number of temporary ranks in the chosen skill equal to your caster level. This cannot increase the number of ranks you have in that skill beyond your caster level. The temporary skill ranks last for the spell’s duration.

If cast as an alchemist formula, then for the spell’s duration you also no longer suffer any penalties to your mental ability scores as a result of your mutagen class feature.

If cast as a druid spell, you must select the skill to gain temporary ranks in from the following list: [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (gardener), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (herbalist), or [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]].

If cast as an inquisitor spell, and the skill is Intelligence- or Charisma-based, you may use your Wisdom modifier, instead of the appropriate ability score modifier, to determine the result of skill checks made with the chosen skill for the spell’s duration.

If cast as a sorcerer/wizard spell, you must select the skill to gain temporary ranks in from the following list: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes), [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]], [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (scribe), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]], or [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]].

If cast as a summoner spell, you may also have your eidolon gain the benefits of the spell. The eidolon gains temporary ranks in the same skill that you do.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Ardesalf’s instant knowledge* to *instant knowledge* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Added Witch 1 to Level. Witches gain temporary ranks as sorcerers or wizards.
