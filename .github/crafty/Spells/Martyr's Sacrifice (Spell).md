You may transfer your own hit points directly to a target creature within range. You must transfer at least 20 points. Transferred hit points are damage to you. The creature takes your transferred hit points as if receiving a *cure wounds* spell and cannot gain more it points than its maximum allows; any excess points are lost. This spell transfers only actual hit points, not temporary hit points. An unconscious target is considered a “willing creature” for purposes of this spell.

GM Note

*House Rule:* Name changed from *blood of the martyr* to *martyr's sacrifice* to avoid duplication.
