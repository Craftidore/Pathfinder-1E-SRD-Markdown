This spell creates a gleaming wall of salt crystal that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall can seal off a passage or breach, or be used to construct new walls. A *wall of salt* is 1 inch thick per caster level. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.

You can form a *wall of salt* into nearly any shape desired. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp. If such a span is more than 20 feet long, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. For example, a 10th-level caster could create a salt span with a surface area of five 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth, by likewise reducing the area.

The wall can be destroyed normally by a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell or by chipping and breaking. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 3 hit points per inch and hardness 2. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 1 per inch of thickness. Directing a constant blast of water at a *wall of salt* (for example, a geyser from a *[[Decanter of Endless Water|decanter of endless water]]*) dissolves the mineral, dealing 10 points of damage per minute (which hardness does not reduce).

It is possible, but diffi cult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a *wall of salt,* provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves. 

*Arcane Material Component:* A crystal of rock salt.
