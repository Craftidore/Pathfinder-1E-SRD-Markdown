This spell functions as *[[Mirror Hideaway (Spell)|mirror hideaway]]*, except any creature that enters the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through another mirror within 500 feet as if using *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*; this is a one-way transport. The creature can exit through a mirror only if it could fit through an opening the same size as the mirror. Each transport through the target mirror reduces the spellâ€™s duration by 1 hour.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* *Mirror transport* can be made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

*House Rule:* This spell is VERY effective when combine with spells that cloak or cover existing magical effects.
