*You feel the mighty force of elemental wyrms flood your spirit and reinforce your body. Your flesh hardens, and your eyes gleam.*

Few creatures represent both the mystic and the elemental more than dragons. You tap into the spiritual might of these magnificent creatures to gain a breath weapon and a defensive ability based on your favored element (and the dragon variety channeled by the spell). See the table below for details.

The breath weapon takes the form of a 15-foot cone-shaped burst. Using the breath weapon requires a standard action, and each time you breathe, you must wait 1d4 rounds before breathing again. Spell resistance does not apply against the breath weapon's effect.


| **Element** **(Dragon)** | **Breath Weapon** | **Defensive Ability** |
|---|---|---|
| Earth (copper) | Slow, 1d6 rounds (Will negates) | DR5/adamantine |
| Fire (red) | 7d6 fire (Ref half) | Resistance to fire 30 |
| Metal (silver) | Paralysis, 1 round (Will negates) | DR5/adamantine |
