*A pathway of solid ice races along the ground from your feet, creating a frozen strip that gives off wisps of moisture.*

This spell creates a pathway or area of slippery ice on the ground. Entering an affected square costs 2 squares of movement; a creature can avoid this hindrance by succeeding on a DC 10 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 [[Balance (Domain)|Balance]]) check. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more, it not only spends 2 squares of movement to enter the affected square, but it also falls [[Prone|prone]] in that square.

In addition, any creature that starts its turn in an affected square or that enters an affected square takes 1 point of cold damage. If a creature enters more than one affected square on its turn, it takes damage for each square.

This spell can be cast only on solid ground and has no effect when cast on the surface of water or other liquids.

If you cast *path of frost* again before the duration of the first spell ends, any squares within the area of both castings deal 2 points of cold damage. More than two overlapping areas don't stack.

*Special:* A white dragon capable of casting 3rd-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
