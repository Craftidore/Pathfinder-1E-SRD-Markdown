Upon casting this spell, you are able to gain knowledge from the land itself. As you walk through the terrain, it whisper information in a language you understand, though the whispering is so rambling it is hard to distinguish useful information. This whispering grants you a +4 insight bonus on a single [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill type appropriate to the type of terrain you are in. If you are within a cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountain, plains, swamp, or water environment, you gain the bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks. If you are within an underground environment, you gain the bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) checks. If you are within an urban environment, you gain the bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) checks. If you are on a plane other than the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]], you gain the bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) checks. If you enter a new terrain, you lose the previous terrain’s skill bonus and gain the new bonus.
