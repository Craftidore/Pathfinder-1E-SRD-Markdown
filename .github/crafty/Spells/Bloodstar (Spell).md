*In a ruby flash a blood-colored, glowing crystal appears near your foes to suck the blood from their wounds.*

You create a magic construct called a bloodstar that shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of the range (each round, you can move the bloodstar anywhere within range with a standard action spent concentrating on the new position). The bloodstar pulses with ruby light (providing illumination in a 20-foot radius). Any creature you initially designate within 10 feet of the bloodstar that takes damage from any source must make a saving throw. On a failed save, the victim takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Each time victims are damaged, they can attempt new saves.

The bloodstar cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks.
