By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you the spirit of a good-aligned outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity’s choice to inhabit a corpse within range, which becomes animated by the spirit. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature’s name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). The Hit Dice of the corpse to be animated (not counting class levels) cannot exceed your caster level.

The possessed body attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the possessing spirit, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

While the body is inhabited by the spirit, it is treated as if were still alive but possessed. It uses the outsider’s Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, mental abilities, and any class levels it might have. The body regains the Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and innate abilities of the creature the corpse represented when it was alive. For example, a sahuagin’s body breathes water and a troll’s body regenerates. The spirit can’t choose to activate the host body’s extraordinary or supernatural abilities, and the host body’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.

The spirit remains within the body until the spell is dismissed, the duration ends, or the host body is slain, at which point it returns to its original body with no ill effects.

*Sacrifice Component:* 1d3 points of Strength drain.
