*As you complete the spell, your senses dull somewhat. Upon releasing the spell’s energy on your desired subject, your senses clear, although the spell’s recipient can no longer be perceived.*

This powerful glamer functions like *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, except that it masks image, scent, and sound alike, concealing the subject from all senses except touch. As with *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]**,* this spell doesn’t end if the subject attacks. While invisible, the subject exudes no scent and is undetectable by scent, blindsense, tremorsense, and blindsight.

*Superior invisibility* renders the recipient immune to detection by *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]**,* *[[Faerie Fire (Spell)|faerie fire]]**,* *[[Glitterdust (Spell)|glitterdust]]**,* *[[Invisibility Purge (Spell)|invisibility purge]]**,* and *[[Dust of Appearance|dust of appearance]]**,* although creatures under the effect of the spell can be detected by *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]**.* Certain mundane conditions (such as leaving footprints) can also render a subject detectable.
