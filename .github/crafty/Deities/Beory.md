**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Beory (bay-OH-ree) is usually considered a manifestation of the will of Oerth itself. Little concerns her except the actual fate and prosperity of the entire world, and she is a very distant goddess, even from her clerics. Named by the Flan, Beory’s name is known throughout the [[Flanaess]]. Beory has little time or interest for most other divine beings, even those of similar interests, for her connection to the Oerth consumes most of her attention. Her symbol is either a green disk marked with a circle or a rotund woman figurine. "The Oerth is a wellspring of all life. Whether on the surface, below the waves, or underground, all life is part of Beory. She inspires every living thing to grow, nurtures them with blessed rain, and calls them to herself when it is time to die. Disasters that cause widespread destruction are agony to her. The actions of individuals are of no consequence unless they threaten the Oerth." Clerics of Beory are contemplative and spend their time communing with nature. They often associate with druids. Then they gather, they defer to the wisest and oldest. As they try to see the greater picture, they tend to be slow to act, but when they do act it is direct and focused on the solution. They wander to feel the different sensations of the Oerth, and use their power to relieve the Oerth’s pains where it has been wounded.
