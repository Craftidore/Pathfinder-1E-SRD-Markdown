**Special Notes:**

God of the evil depths, master of the last gasping breath, and lord of the deep darkness, Yeathan is a god of the sea. Once a simple water deity, Yeathan gradually brooded on darker, more mysterious matters until he became a neutral evil god of all things foul and malevolent about the sea. Some sahuagin, a few kuo-toas, and a fair number of aboleths and their skum servants revere Yeathan, who is largely unknown among land-dwellers.

Yeathanâ€™s temples are always submerged and unlighted, filled with sharks, octopi, and strange denizens usually found in only the deepest undersea trenches. His symbol is a dark bluish-green spiral with a black center. Yeathan is associated with the Evil, Destruction, and Water domains, and his favored weapon is the trident. Yeathan is neutral evil.

Clerics of Yeathan are quiet, brooding individuals with quick tempers. They wear dark green and black. If they are not native water-breathers, they are nevertheless accomplished swimmers.
