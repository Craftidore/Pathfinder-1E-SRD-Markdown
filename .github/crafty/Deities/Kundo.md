Description: Kundo is the union of storm and metal - an assault upon the ears and protective shelter. He is a guardian

god, loud and boisterous, obsessed with building and construction. Depictions of Kundo show him as a laughing Touv

man bearing a great shield on one arm and a cluster of saplings under the other. The priests of Kundo build shelters for

the poor, teach traditional songs, and strive to protect the people from the dangers of the world. They see themselves as

protectors of the weak, and a priest of Kundo will go to great lengths to save those in danger. Ceremonial garb includes

highly ornate, but functional, shields and/or breastplates.
