Special Notes:

Description: Kurtulmak (kurt-uhk-mak) appears as a particularly large kobold, about 5 feet tall, with scaly skin mottled

black and green. His ratlike tail is long and tipped with a wicked stinger. Kurtulmak is a savage deity who teaches the

kobolds to defend themselves and assault the unwary by any means necessary, including the traps of which he's fond.

He has a particular hatred for gnomes, especially since Garl Glittergold collapsed Kurtulmak's cavernous home as a joke.

Kurtulmak taught the kobolds the arts of mining, ambushing, and trapmaking. Kurtulmak insists that his clerics train

under military discipline, learning doctrines for setting ambushes, building defenses, and otherwise defending the

kobold people. The final test for a would-be cleric is to survive a run down a corridor filled with deadly traps. Anything

that enhances the stature of the kobolds is a boon to Kurtulmak. Collapsing a series of gnome burrows, convincing a

dragon to live among a kobold tribe, and building a trap-filled set of kobold warrens are all typical quests. Many of

Kurtulmak's prayers reference dragons and reptiles, such as "O Watcher, I slither before your scaly majesty."

Kurtulmak's temples are claustrophobic warrens bristling with traps, but they often have the accumulated wealth of a

kobold community in their treasury. Kurtulmak blesses births and honors deaths, but his ceremonies often feature a

simulated or actual trap. Kobold youths, for example, contend with the Blessing of the Pit as a rite of passage.

Kurtulmak is a savage deity who is always attentive to events on the Material Plane and eager to secure any advantage for

his people. He teaches the kobolds that fair fights are for fools or for the unlucky. It is better to flee and fight again than

to be defeated, and no fight is truly over if even one kobold lives. Revenge is sweet, says Kurtulmak, even if it takes

years to arrange. No kobold community is complete without a temple or shrine to Kurtulmak.
