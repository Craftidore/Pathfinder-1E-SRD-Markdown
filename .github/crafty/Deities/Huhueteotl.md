Special Notes:

Description: This fearsome-looking god embodies the flow of time and the evil and destructive aspects of fire. He is

always shown as a fire-shrouded, armor-clad humanoid with a demonic reptilian head. He demands many sacrifices

from his followers and does not hesitate to punish them with bolts of flame when he is displeased. The priests of the

Olman fire-god are warlike, hot-tempered, and inclined to act rather than wait. They excel in rousing violent emotions

in soldiers and usually receive positions in the military for this reason. Ceremonial garb includes a headdress of red

metal and red gems.
