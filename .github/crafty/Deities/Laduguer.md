Special Notes:

Description: The deity of the duerar, Laduguer occasionally still answers the prayers of other dwarves. The Gray

Protector, as he is called, demands constant toil and a rigid hierarchy from his subjects, many of whom are slavers or

would-be warlords. Would-be clerics of Laduguer engage in hour after hour of repetitive prayer, punctuated only by

hard physical labor or similar hardships. Those who don't wash out of the process become clerics and inflict similar

mind-numbing initiations on the next generation of followers. Laduguer's quests often involve awakening - and

hopefully controlling - some long-buried evil. If an army of slaves is trying to unearth a fallen, ancient labyrinth-temple,

Laduguer is probably behind it. Prayers to Laduguer are simple one- or two-sentence affairs, but they're repeated dozens

of times with the same rhythm and intonation. Laduguer has simple temples unadorned with decoration. Many have

torture chambers, prison cells, or battle arenas attached to them. Laduguer offers his followers few rites, because time

spent in ceremonies is time spent away from more proper duties. "Rituals? Get back to work!" says the cleric of

Laduguer.
