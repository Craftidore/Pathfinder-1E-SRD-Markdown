Special Notes:

Description: Heironeous (hi-ROE-nee-us) is the Oeridian battlefield champion of all that is right and good. He wages

war against evil of all sorts, especially his half-brother and nemesis, Hextor. He is tall, with coppery skin, auburn hair,

and amber eyes, and wears fine chain. At his birth, Heironeous' skin was imbued with a secret solution called meersalm

that protects him from all but the most powerful weapons. His symbol is a silver lightning bolt. His allies are other gods

who fight evil, and his foes are those who encourage evil or suffering. Known for his great magic battleaxe, he recently

has been promoting usage of the longsword in order to appeal to common soldiers as well as paladins and leaders. "The

world is a dangerous place that poses a never-ending series of challenges to those who fight for justice and protecÂ¬tion

of the weak and innocent. One must act honorably at all times, and uphold the virtues of justice and chivalry in word

and deed. Danger must be faced with certainty and calm, and glory is the reward for defeating evil, while virtue is the

reward for upholding the tenets of Heironeous." Heironeous' church is very militaristic, championing causes and

crusading to eliminate evils. His clerics travel the world, fighting evil as dictated by their church commanders. Older

clerics work as judges, strategists, and military instructors. Many of the most powerful clerics of Heironeous have

themselves embalmed alive with meersalm to gain its protective benefits, although some have not survived the process.

Many of Heironeous's clerics begin their training as pages to a cleric or paladin of Heironeous, absorbing the code of

chivalry as they see it lived before their very eyes. Pages that show promise become squires. then full-fledged clerics. The

traditional chivalric quests are the bread and butter of a follower of Heironeous. They joust against the mysterious Black

Knight, rescue the princess from the dragon, and lead the vanguard of a shining army of good. Many of Heironeous's

teachings are collected in a series of numbered analects, which worshipers are fond of quoting: "The 34th Analect states,

'Never die easy; strive always for a valorous end.'" A typical temple to Heironeous looks like a fortified castle. Most

feature a large, grassy area where knights can joust and soldiers can drill. Most temples provide healing arid other

spellcasting for those fighting the forces of evil. Heironeous's followers are eager to recognize bravery, chivalry, and

other battlefield virtues in a ceremony that culminates in a medal or other decoration given from the clergy to a warriorsometimes

posthumously. The religious hierarchy of Heironeous is organized like a military order. It has clear chain of

command, lines of supply, and well-stocked armories.
