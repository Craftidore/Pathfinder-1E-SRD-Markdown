Special Notes:

Description: Kiaransali (kee-uh-ran-sa-lee) is the divine sponsor of the drow slave trade in all its varied aspects. She

appears as a sinuous drow female wearing only silver jewelry and black silk veils. Her only obvious weapon is her

curved dagger, but her long, sharp fingernails are just as dangerous, and her touch is said to be as cold as that of a lich.

This goddess has flirted with madness, even thinking to defy her queen. But Lolth's power is inexorable, and Kiaransali

has taken of the queen's venom, returning once more to sanity and servitude. They symbol of Kiaransali is a hand of a

female drow with three silver rings on each finger and one on the thumb, with the entire image surrounded by the

silver strands of a spiderweb. "Forgive neither a slight, not a debt; remember that payment must always be collected,

whether in treasure or in vengeance. Life is the greatest crime, and perpetual slavery the fittest punishment. Let there

be no freedom for the enslaved, even in death. Death comes for all; when it comes for you, take your slaves and your

treasure with you to the grave. The riches of the grave are the dowry of the mistress." Worship of Kiaransali has

changed since the drow civil war. Prior to that, she was known as Kiaransalee, but the final glyph of her name was

altered in all texts and inscriptions, and her liturgy was abridged to conform to more acceptable doctrines. Her religion

no longer claims any authority that does not derive from the Queen of the Spiders, though some long-term worshippers

still maintain the traditional resentments. Clerics of Kiaransali often work as slavers, and occasionally as torturers or

executioners. They are meticulous, almost paranoid, about record keeping, as well as being miserly with wealth. They

commonly work their slaves to death and then animate the corpses so they may continue to serve. They keep their

other servants in a state as close to slavery as they can manage, and withhold wages for the slightest offense. However,

despite their stinginess, they are the first to offer bounty on escaped slaves and prisoners, and they will pay these

rewards in full.
