**Special Notes:**

Rallaster, the Razor God, is a deity of murder, torture, and psychotic behavior. Religious scholars refer to him as the Insane God and the God of Madmen, but Rallaster’s followers find him completely sane and comprehensible.

Rallaster is normally pictured as a tall, glistening, ebony-skinned humanoid without hair or wrinkles. Closer inspection reveals that his entire body is made of razors dripping with blood and oil to keep the blades sharp and rust-free. Rallaster’s symbol is a toothy mouth clamped down on a bloody, razor-thin blade, and his favored weapon is the short sword. The domains that Rallaster is associated with are Evil, Destruction, and Pain. He is chaotic evil.

Rallaster’s clerics are psychopaths and mass murderers who lurk in the shadows or discreetly in plain sight. Many act perfectly normal, maintaining a second identity as shop clerks or artisans. Whether they camouflage themselves within society or remain apart from it, Rallaster’s minions delight in torturing and killing their victims, usually in seclusion.

Rallaster has very few temples. His followers are usually loners, and as such they keep secret shrines just for themselves. Each shrine has a small altar made entirely of razors.
