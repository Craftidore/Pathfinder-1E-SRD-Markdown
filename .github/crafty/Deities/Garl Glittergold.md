Special Notes:

Description: Garl Glittergold (garl gliht-er-gold) appears as a handsome, golden-skinned gnome with glittering

gemstones for eyes. He is well dressed, usually in a silk jacket with long tails and silk hose. He always wears a lot of gold

jewelry and accoutrements. He is renowned for the jokes and pranks he pulls on other deities, though not all his

victims laugh off his jests. Garl once collapsed the cavern of the kobold god Kurtulmak; since then, the two deities are

sworn enemies. Most of Garl Glittergold's rituals involve the whole community, so his clerics have plenty of

opportunities to recruit those who show a particular combination of duty to community and mischievous humor. An

older cleric typically teaches three or four students by example, explaining Garl Glittergold's ways as he attends to the

needs of the gnomes in his care. Followers of Garl Glittergold find themselves guarding the welfare of gnome

communities, delving deep for gems, and fighting the goblinoid enemies of the race. Typical quests include battling a

tribe of kobold raiders, pulling a good-natured prank on an arrogant human king, and seeking the long-lost Ebondark

Gem Mine on the Elemental Plane of Earth. Many of Garl Glittergold's prayers are performed call-and-response style,

with the leader posing a riddle and everyone answering it in Unison. "Glittergold asks: What is our joy?/To delve for

treasures and guard our hearth." Garl Glittergold's temples take the form of unassuming, often magically hidden shrines

and chapels. Many are underground. The temple clergy are usually eager to help a traveling gnome any way they can.

The ceremonies of Garl Glittergold are flashy affairs full of illusion and mystery, often attracting curious gnomes from

miles around. Most rites extol the gnome virtues of cleverness and craftsmanship-blessing a masterwork item, a new

gem mine, or the top students in a school are common. Garl promotes a doctrine of practicality tempered with humor.

Ignorance and complacency are dangerous, warns Garl, and he urges his people to explore not only the world around

them but new ways of doing things. Garl also emphasizes brains over brawn. Garl's clerics favor gold jewelry, like their

patron.
