Special Notes:

Description: Rillifane is likened by his clerics to a giant ethereal oak tree so huge that its roots mingle with the roots of

every other plant in the world. On a more mundane level, Rillifane can appear as a green-skinned elf clad in bark armor

and carrying a magic bow. Arrows shot from this bow by Rillifane always slay their target if they hit. Rillifane is

primarily concerned that all creatures have the opportunity to act out their roles in nature without abusing them.

Rillifaneâ€™s clerics are deadly enemies of those who hunt for sport and those who harm trees maliciously or

unnecessarily.
