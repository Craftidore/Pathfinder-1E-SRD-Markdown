Special Notes:

Description: Lolth (lohlth), the Queen of the Demonweb Pits, first spread evil among the elves, leading the drow away

from the rest of the elves thousands of years ago. Now she focuses on using the drow to conquer the vast cavern-realms

beneath the surface of the earth. She relishes the chance to test her followers by pitting them against each other that the

strong may cull out the weak. She appears as a tall, beautiful female drow or a massive black spider with a female drow's

head. More so than any other deity, Lolth delights in perpetual tests of her exclusively female clerics, pitting them

against each other. Every cleric of Lolth knows that the path to promotion lies by stabbing ones; superior in the back,

and every cleric is likewise alert that her underlings are plotting to do the same to her. Lolth's temples among the drow

generally dominate (in every sense of the word) the communities that surround them. These temples are

extraordinarily defended by capable and clever spider-worshipers, but also serve as storehouses of dark lore and

powerful magic. Lolth uses a number of competitive rites to identify particularly worthy followers. Those who succeed

in her rites - which involve competitive spellcasting or all-out combat - get access to more powerful magic. Those who

fail are demoted, killed, or turned into driders. Nearly every drow home has at least a small shrine to Lolth, even if it is

just a spider statue or modest altar. Larger temples to Lolth are often laid out in the shape of a spider. They serve as

meeting places, sacrificial sites, and centers of entertainment for high-ranking drow.
