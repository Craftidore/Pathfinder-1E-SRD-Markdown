Special Notes:

Description: Myhriss (MEE-ris) is shown as a Flan woman just reaching adulthood, a garland of flowers in her hair, or

else as a fair-skinned, dark-haired provocative beauty or a sun-blonde tanned woman of approachable prettiness. Her

dark-haired form is associated with the whip, her other aspect favors the shortbow. She is friendly and affectionate

toward all benign gods but avoids those who are hideous, crude, or hateful. Although Wee Jas dislikes her, Myhriss

appreciates the vain Suel goddess for her obvious attractiveness. "Love can cure the world's ills. Quarreling rivals and

warring nations can be brought together with a well-placed romance, and beauty can turn the heart of a dumb beast or a

despondent tyrant. Beauty is often fragile, so protect it from accidental harm, as the destruction of something beautiful

is a great tragedy. Beauty comes in many forms, for even the most evil red dragon is a sight of terrifying splendor when

it is on the wing. Celebrate love, affection, romance, and beauty wherever you find it." Clerics of Myhriss are starry-eyed

and always looking for signs of love and beauty in the people and places around them. They bless young lovers, perform

marriage ceremonies, create works of art, and travel to see beautiful people and fantastic sights. A few take roles as

diplomats, as their looks and charisma make even the most hostile folk stop to listen to them. Some are crusaders against

hate and ugliness, seeking out those who destroy love or vanquishing those of repulsive presence.
