Special Notes:

Description: Ehlonna (eh-LOHN-nah) is a very old goddess. She combats those who would harm or despoil the forest

of its resources and beauty. Shown as either a dark-haired human woman or a golden-haired elf maid (in which form she

is known to many as Ehlenestra), she is served by Novelee, a planetar whose heart is so pure it makes unicorns weep.

She has a hostile rivalry with Obad-Hai, but is friendly with the elven gods and most good-aligned deities. Her symbol is

the unicorn. "The woodlands are a beautiful place full of life. The secrets of the forests should be learned and taught so

that people can live in harmony with nature. Those who would harm or exploit the woodlands must be driven out or

destroyed. The plants and animals of the forest are things that nature gives as gifts, not things to be stolen." Most of

Ehlonna's clergy are female, whether human, elven, or fey. They live in the forests, are friendly with rangers and druids,

and watch for encroaching nonhumans, hunters, and loggers. They educate those who wish to live in harmony with the

forest, just as the animals do. They are gentle in their first warning to those who would harm the forest and ruthless in

stopping those who persist. They travel to spread their teachings or to protect a forest in danger. Clerics of Ehlonna are

often trained one-on-one by higher-level clerics, and the forest is the classroom. Even a low-level cleric can identify a

tree by its leaf and a bird by its song. Anything that threatens the health and growth of the forest is anathema to

Ehlonna's followers. They root out goblin warhands hiding in the woods, stop raging forest fires. and defeat evil

blighters who twist the forest to their evil ends. A typical prayer to Ehlonna first references two positive aspects of the

forest. For example, a sunset prayer might start with "Golden leaves/And tall trees/Shelter us this night." Almost every

temple to Ehlonna is a camouflaged lodge deep in the forest. They're good places to find healing and rangers who can

track evil interlopers in the forest or guide visitors safely through the woods. Ehlonna's ceremonies take place in the

forest when possible. Most cover various aspects of fertility, and children figure prominently in many. Ehlonna's clerics

usually choose servicable attire of forest green.
