**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Cyndor (SIN-dohr) has three duties: meditate upon how manipulating time-space alters the uninverse, record the actions of every creature on Oerth in his Perpetual Libram, and guard the time-stream from powerful beings that might alter it to their advantage. This Oeridian god endorses the concept of predestination, although his perspective differs from that of Istus or even his sometime ally (and superior) Lender. He is shown as a towering man-form with no features and block-like limbs of terrible strength, representing the unknowable and inevitable advance of time. His symbol is a rounded hourglass of black and white set on its side, much like the symbol for infinity. "Time is not a static thing, but rather something liquid that stretches from the forgotten past to the present and into the distant future. Events of the past cause events in the pres¬ent, which have consequences that last far beyond the life¬times of their progenitors. There is no need to worry about the choices one makes in life, for all actions are determined and your fate is set based upon those choices. Augury is useful only as a moral balm to allow realization and accept¬ance of one's place in the stream of life." Clerics of Cyndor converge near sites of pending importance or disruptions in the time-flow. They study old lore to plot the course of history and learn the future, and many work as advisers or seers. They debunk charlatan fortune-tellers and other false prophets. They travel with people whom they perceive will have interesting futures.
