Special Notes:

Description: Roykyn (ROY-kihn) is a gnome goddess of cruelty, particularly cruel pranks. Sponsored to divinity by

Erythnul (possibly as an attempt to broaden his appeal to more than just outright violence), she doesn't care who her

targets are, as long as they suffer suitably. A former cleric of Urdlen, gnome god of bloodlust, evil, and uncontrolled

impulses, she abandoned her faith and turned over an entire temple of her own clergy to a conclave of mind flayers as a

cruel joke and insult to her former patron, whom she felt didn't reward her enough for her work. Roykyn is capricious

and not above inflicting a cruel joke upon any being, evil or good. She is depicted as a black-haired gnome with a

wicked gleam in her eye, but can appear in almost any humanoid form. Her favorite weapon is a spiked gauntlet with

poisoned barbs, her favorite animal is a feral cat, and her holy symbol is a furled scroll dripping dark fluid. "The greatest

joy is in causing pain and suffering to others, whether in the spirit, mind, or body. Let no day pass without giving

someone the kindness of a small cruel joke. Be merciless if you find someone who can be humbled with the proper act,

for what makes us equal is our capacity for humiliation. The ability to harm another with an unkind word or deed is the

greatest power, for cruelty is a tyrant that is always attended with fear. It is fed, not weakened, by tears, and upon the

tears of your victims you will grow strong." Roykyn's clerics scandalize public officials with scandalous letters,

embarrassing rumors, and betrayals by lovers and allies. They love nothing more than to see the high brought low and

the low forced to sleep in their own misery. They adventure to find new people to harm and for the opportunity to see a

terrible fate befall someone undeserving, such as a pious paladin slain by a poisoned spike trap.
