Special Notes: Divine spellcasters of Murlynd have their spells look different from other casting of those spells by

other casters. When describing the appearance of a spell from a divine spellcaster of Murlynd, add elements of a

technical nature. For example, casting create water might involve a magical faucet spout appearing to produce the

water. The appearance of the spell does not change the effect of the spell or the way it interacts with its environment in

any way.

Description: Sponsored to godhood by Heironeous, Murlynd (MURR-lind) is paladin with unusual abilities. From his

planar travels he has acquired knowledge of technology unavailable in the Flanaess, and his usage of such devices makes

him something of an outcast (although he has been known to travel with Celestian, Heironeous, Zagyg, and certain

other hero-deities). He appears as a handsome Oeridian man with weathered features, worn leather clothing, and a

light-colored hat of a style unseen elsewhere in the Flanaess. Although he appears taciturn and aloof, he is actually quite

personable among his allies and only dangerous if provoked by evil folk. He is familiar with the battleaxe and

longsword, but is also fond of crossbows and similar weapons of more exotic make. His symbol is a six-pointed star with

rounded points, and his holy book (often titled Murlynd’s Early Adventures & Subsequent Ventures) bears this stamp.

Murlynd was one of the beings who helped imprison Iuz beneath Castle Greyhawk, and this fact is never far from the

Old One’s mind. "Learn from the advancements of the civilized races, both mundane and magical, and apply this

knowledge to helping the common folk. Never use an inferior item when you have access to a superior one, whether a

spell, sword, or tool. Protect the weak and innocent, act honorably at all times, and facec danger with certainty and calm.

Treat followers of Heironeous as your allies and those of this brother your enemies." Murlynd’s clerics seek to uphold

the tenets of law and good, similar to the church of Heironeous, and members of the two faiths often work together.

They use their knowledge to help commoners and are never too busy to defend a village against raiding monsters. They

adventure to forward the cause of good, throw down the outposts of evil, and destroy magical or technological devices

capable of great harm (which often teams them with worshippers of Phaulkon). They are incessant inventors, and

throughout their travels they build, repair, and improve mills, forges, and other sorts of tools and machinery.
