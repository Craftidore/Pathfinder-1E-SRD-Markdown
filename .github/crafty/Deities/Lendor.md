Special Notes:

Description: Lendor (LEN-dor), the leader and progenitor of the Suel pantheon, is depicted as a white-haired and

bearded husky older man. Largely withdrawn from the affairs of the world to care for larger issues, Lendor considers

himself superior other gods and especially to his children, as he has the ability to banish any of his children or undo

their magic. A blow from his flaming sword Afterglow is said to be the force that started the flow of time at the dawn of

the universe. His holy symbol is a crescent moon in front of a new moon surrounded by fourteen stars (sometimes less

or more). "Time stretches to infinity, and issues that seem pressing are merely a smaller part of a larger whole. In order

to make sense of the universe, one must look at the entire mosaic instead of just a part of it. Age brings experience,

wisdom, and the impetus to take things slow." Lender's clergy are mostly older, particularly sages, village elders, and

record keepers. They tend to have little interaction with the outside world, remaining cloistered in their libraries and

temples for years at a time. Occasionally a younger person will be drawn to this faith, taking the role of wandering

adviser, preaching the need to keep the present in perspective; these preachers often become advisers to conservative

leaders or mount expeditions to recover ancient tomes and artifacts lost for generations. Ceremonial garb includes

silver robes adorned with a black circle containing Lendor's symbol.
