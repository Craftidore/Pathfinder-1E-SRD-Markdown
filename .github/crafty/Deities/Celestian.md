**Description:** Celestian (seh-LES-tee-an) is a benign Oeridian god. The brother of Fharlanghn (his only close ally), he chose the distances of the stars and planes rather than Oerth. He appears as a middle-aged man of completely black coloration, always wearing his symbol: piece of jewelry with a shining ruby, jacinth, topaz, emerald, sapphire, amethyst, and diamond. He has few ardent worshipers on Oerth, but counts among his following the many strange beings that live in and above the starry night. 

"The distant stars are an inspiration to travel; be encouraged to wander far from home, just as the stars do. The stars are eternal and are pleased to be a guide for both legs of a journey. The stars may reveal their secrets if you study them." The clerics are divided into seven orders of ascending knowledge and power, bearing no special titles other than the number of their order; each order's holy symbol differs in which gem is placed at the center.

Most of Celestian's clerics are scholars, astronomers and planar explorers, with a few sailors. They search the world, sky, and planes for artifacts of the stars fragments of meteorites, and lore relating to the stars, space, or the planes. Many of his clerics make a pilgrimage to a holy site in the Barrier Peaks. Celestian is a favored deity of good-aligned members of evil nonhuman races; while their eyes are unable to tolerÂ¬ate daylight, they find acceptance and hope in the light of the stars.
