Special Notes:

Description: Lydia (LIH-dee-ah) is a wise Suel goddess, shown as a dynamic older woman with white hair and clear

blue eyes. Her symbol is a spray of colors from an open hand. She interacts with many other gods, exchanging

information and songs. In some ways she is the converse of Pholtus, pressing for individual liberty so that others may

see the light of truth without being blinded by it; this pleases Trithereon, who also strives for the freedom of the

individual. "People must gain knowledge to better themselves. Music is a key to learning, and the light of day lets one

see their own ignorance." Lydia's church has an open policy on all records, for the goddess hates secrets and those who

would hoard information to the detriment of others. Her teachings are presented in song form so that they may be easily

remembered, and her church often converts current and historical texts into ballads. Her church uses education to

uplift women from lesser stations in life; this tends to make her unpopular with patriarchies. Most of her clerics are

women. They discover and spread information wherever they travel, and are often found in the company of clerics of

Fharlanghn. They are required to help women in need of education, and they spend much of their time in villages

teaching women and children how to read and acting as midwives. They travel to discover lost caches of information

and song, preferring historical accounts of actual deeds rather than fictionalizations and hearsay tales. Ceremonial garb

includes white robes trimmed with gold and silver.
