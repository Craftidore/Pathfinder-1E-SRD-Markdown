Special Notes:

Description: Nerull (NEH-rul) is an ancient Flan god; few anywhere do not know and fear his name. He is a rust-red

skeletal being with thick, blackish-green hair, a cowl and cloak of rusty black, and eyes, teeth, and nails the color of

poisonous verdigris. His sablewood staff Lifecutter forms a scythelike blade of red force that slays anyone it touches.

Fiends answer his call out of fear rather than loyalty, for he hates all life and is not above destroying servants out of

displeasure or spite. His symbol is a skull and scythe. Of all other divine beings, the only one he tolerates is Incabulos

whose gifts send many to his realm. "All are equal in Nerull's cold realm. Every living thing is an affront to the Reaper,

and every death brings a dark spark of joy to his long-dead heart. Those who pray to Nerull to appease him only attract

his attention and their own doom. Those who kill in his name shall be rewarded." Clerics of Nerull are secretive and

solitary, as few sane people would tolerate their presence. Except in the most evil lands, no organized church of Nerull

exists. Nerull's clerics commit murder as offerings to their god; when their actions are discovered, they flee their hiding

places and move far away to carry out their evil deeds, appearing innocent while occasionally killing wayfarers on their

long journey. Among followers of the Old Faith, Nerull is also seen as a god of winter. Some are obsessed with death,

even as children, and those are potential recruits to the clergy of Nerull. All must survive the final initiation rite: being

buried alive. Nerull's followers desecrate ancient tombs looking for lost lore, establish cults to provide willing food for

vampires, and raise undead armies to terrify the world of the living. Much of Nerull's liturgy is spoken in the past tense,

even if it hasn't happened yet. For example, a cleric of Nerull might pray, "You granted me ultimate dominion over the

dead..." Nerull's temples are generally secret places hidden underground and crawling with undead. For unscrupulous

adventurers who can stomach Nerull's hatred of the living, they're good places for "no questions asked" raise dead spells.

Nerull finds little worth celebrating, other than death. The number of different funeral rites Nerull has, depending on

who died and how, is staggering. Nerull's clerics wear rust-red garb when not in disguise.
