**Description:** Breeka is the daughter of Nola and Vogan - the mixture of rain and sunlight with the earth, producing the animals and plants of the world. Unlike Uvot, who represents the rewards the land gives, Breeka manifests all aspects of nature, helpful, indifferent, and harmful. She is a troubled goddess, beset by nightmares, accidental parent to an evil god and many terrible monsters. She is depicted as a middle-aged Touv woman with dark green skin and many worry lines on her face. Breekaâ€™s priests are distant, brooding types, reflecting on their duties to the Touv people and to the natural world. If a settlement must clear land for farming or for cattle, the priest of Breeka warns the animals away, transplants important vegetation, or directs the humans to a site that will cause the least amount of disruption. Ceremonial garb includes a headdress of wooden beads and animal teeth.
