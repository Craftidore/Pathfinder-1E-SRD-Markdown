Description: Gruumsh (groomsh) appears as a hulking orc in black full plate armor. He has one unblinking central

eye. He harbors a special hatred for Corellon Larethian (who took his other eye), Moradin, and their followers. Most

orc warbands have a cleric of Gruumsh attached to them, and sometimes she'll "adopt" a soldier, passing on the

teachings of Gruumsh while the army is on the march. At some point, generally during a major battle, the studentsoldier

graduates by casting his first spell. Followers of Gruumsh feel they have a duty to direct and organize the natural

proclivity of orcs for warfare. They'll hunt down elves in their forest homes, encourage tribal chieftains to sack human

cities, and act as emissaries to the goblinoid tribes that often join their great hordes. Every single known prayer to

Gruumsh begins with "Kharg-hark," the Orcish word for "revenge," even if the prayer is not related to vengeance.

Gruumslis temples are essentially military camps with as many fighters and barbarians as clerics. The largest temples

feature gladiatorial arenas where wagering is common and the best gladiators can earn great treasure. The most famous

rite in Gruumsh-worship is the Ritual of the Poles. After a battle, ores mark their new territory by pounding longspears

into the ground at the boundary, point up. Placed on each spear-point is the head of a fallen toe. Gruumsh demands that

his followers be strong, that they cull the weak from their numbers, and that they take all the territory that Gruumsh

thinks is rightfully theirs (which is almost everything). He tolerates no sign of friendliness from his people. Unceasing

warfare is his creed, though Gruumsh does not object to simple colonization if that can be arranged. Gruumsh dislikes

everything that is not an orc or of orcish make, and he is particular spiteful to elves and dwarves. Gruumsh's clerics

usually wear fighting gear.
