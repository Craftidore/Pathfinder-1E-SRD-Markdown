Special Notes:

Description: Norebo (noh-REE-boh) is one of the more popular Suel gods, known for his willingness to make a bet on

anything and his fondness for dice games; his symbol (a pair of eight-sided dice) stems from this. He has been paired

with most of the female members of his pantheon, but has been linked to Wee Jas for the past one thousand years

despite their alignment differences. He particularly despises Ralishaz for giving gambling and risks a bad name. Norebo

is shown as a man of average height, weight, and features, but can assume animal forms, especially when he wishes to be

hidden. "Life is full of risks and gambling with fate is the only thing that makes life worth living. Owning property and

life itself are fleeting things, and best be enjoyed while you have them." His worship is popular in the barbarian lands

and large cities, and donations to his temples (called Churches of the Big Gamble) are usually in the form of lost bets (as

gambling operations are run on-site). Some patrons donate to his temple in the hopes of warding off thieves and

assassins. Clerics of the Norebo are willing to make wagers on anything and are usually employed at least part of the

time in a gambling house. Others wander the world to bring chance and elements of risk into people's lives; they

especially love bothering clerics and followers of rigid gods such as Allitur, Pholtus, and St. Cuthbert. Ceremonial garb

includes brown or dark green robes.
