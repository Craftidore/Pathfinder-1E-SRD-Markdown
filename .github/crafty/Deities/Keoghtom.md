Special Notes:

Description: Thought to have been born in the Sheldomar Valley some three hundred years after the Great Migrations,

the enigmatic man known as Keoghtom (KEO-tom) has traveled the whole of the Flanaess and now walks the

ephemeral boundaries and unending trails of the Outer Planes. A jack of all trades who has mastered the arts of the

hunt, alchemy, and the mysterious Old Lore, Keoghtom seeks to unlock the secrets of the natural world in an attempt to

determine man’s role in the vastness of nature. In mortal life he learned about the Old Faith and the Faerie Mysteries,

even discovering the inner secrets of the Silent Ones, all without ever becoming fully indoctrinated by any of them. His

travels eventually led him to the service and friendship of Fharlanghn, and into the famed company of adventurers led

by the mortal Zagig Yragerne. After that being’s apotheosis, Keoghtom retreated to the Celadon Forest, and thence from

Oerth itself. His quest, he realizes, is an eternal one, and thus Keoghtom seeks the everlasting life of a true god.

Keoghtom appears as a young man of slight build dressed in elven leathers or silken finery. He seldom appears on the

Prime, preferring to stay true to the planar path on which he believes he will find enlightenment. His symbol is a round

disk bisected by an arrow pointing upward. "There is a fundamental pattern to the natural world. Train yourself to listen

to the clues of the raging river and the silent glade. Follow the dewdrop trail of time and progress, and break the code of

the elements. We are all of us a part of that code, and discovering our ultimate role is the greatest secret in the universe."

Keoghtom’s cult is small, though geographically and ideologically diverse. Though the god himself dabbles in many

areas of study, he is most popular among alchemists, who tend to focus on pursuits their god would find mundane (such

as the transmogrification of lead to gold) rather than the more humanistic and natural aspects of his doctrine.
