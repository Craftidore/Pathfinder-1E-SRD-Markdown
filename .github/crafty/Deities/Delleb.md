**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Delleb (DEL-leb) is an Oeridian god depicted as a noble scribe or well-dressed gray-haired man with a large white book (his holy symbol). Although he prefers debate to combat, he used his phoenix-feather quill as a dart to fend off a young and murderous Hextor. He is interested in any sort of useful or interesting lore, but dislikes fiction or overly verbose language. He is friendly to all others but those who are evil or oppose knowledge. It is rumored that Delleb sponsored [[Daern]], hero-goddess of defenses and fortifications, to her present position. "The accumulation of knowledge is the purpose of existence. What cannot be learned from others may be discovered in books, and when books fail the truly studious will turn to experimentation. An hour studying is an hour well spent. Allowing emotion to cloud your judgment risks danger. The ignorant and inexperienced should be educated." Delleb's clerics ask questions of strangers, listen to bard's tales with a grain of salt, pore over old books, and study lost languages in the hopes of uncovering valuable forgotten knowledge. They use their knowledge to help others, whether designing a more efficient stove for a farmer or planning a great bridge for a city; they may not have the skill to build such things, but they know how to design them. They travel to study recently unearthed tomes, converse with ancient learned people, and adventure to explore old places of lost writings.
