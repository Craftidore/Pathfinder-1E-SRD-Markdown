Special Notes:

Description: Kurell (kuh-REL) is an Oeridian god once loved by Atroa, but he spurned her to pursue Sotillion, his

brother Zilchusâ€™ lover. This failure caused him to lose both goddesses as well as the favor of his brother. Now, his

jealous feelings keep him alone, even though the others involved would surely forgive him if he would ask. His only

allies are the more temperamental, morose, and reactionary deities Joramy, Ralishaz, and Trithereon. His symbol is a

grasping hand holding a broken coin. He is a patron of thieves although other gods such as Norebo and Olidammara are

more popular than he, which makes him jealous and fills him with an irrational fervor to steal away their worshippers.

"Desires must be seized, for experiencing the act of taking brings joy. Suffering must be avenged, for only retribution

alleviates loss. Those that have wealth do not deserve it, nor the power and luck who brought them to where they are,

and for that they should be scorned. You must take what is rightfully yours when the time is right or forever be

shackled to misery, poverty, and nothingness." Clerics of Kurell are very self-centered and not particularly interested in

proselytizing unless they perceive an immediate benefit for themselves. Their instruction involves teaching by example

rather than quoting doctrine. Many make their living as thieves, and spend their time planning acts of revenge against

their enemies. They travel in search of great things to steal, to escape their rivals, or to forget their past.
