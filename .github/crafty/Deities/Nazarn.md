Special Notes:

Description: Nazarn (NAZZ-arn) is a half-orc god of ritualistic and public combat, such as honorable duels and

gladiator matches. Once a popular gladiator slave owned by a member of the Scarlet Brotherhood, Nazarn escaped from

his racist captors to find a better place for himself in the world. He was fortunate to encounter and impress a half-giant

descendant of Kord, and eventually convinced the Brawler to elevate him to godhood after defeating all opponents

(including a young green dragon) in a Hepmonaland arena run by yuan-ti. Nazarn is honorable but cares little for moral

debate, seeking only the freedom to do what he wants and have a fair fight in the arena. He appears as an older half-orc

with a strongly orcish appearance and hair that is rapidly graying to white. He is usually shown with his short sword

Crowdpleaser. His symbol is a chain wrapped around a short sword. "Answer a challenge with honor and bravery.

Never fight at anything but your best. Know when you should please the crows and when you should focus on your foe,

for a flamboyant warrior often ends up dead if he underestimates his adversary. Avoid dirty fighting unless it is purely

for sport. Offer mercy to a defeated foe if you can, but finish them if they have fought without honor or broken the

combat's accepted rules of conduct. Be inspiring to those who fight on your side and those who would emulate you in

the future, for your legacy will survive you." Nazarn's clerics work as professional duelists or gladiators, act as officiators

and seconds in formal duels, and minister to gladiators and similar combatants. They adventure to seek out new heroes

of the arena in distant cities, to test their mettle against unusual foes, and to collect trophies and scars that add to their

reputations.
