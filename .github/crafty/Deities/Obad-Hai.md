Special Notes:

Description: Obad-Hai (OH-bahd HI) carries a hornwood staff called the Shalmstaff, which allows the bearer swift and

easy passage through floral and faunal hazards, and a shalm (the double-reeded woodwind instrument from which he

takes his title). He shown as a lean and weathered man of indeterminately old age, dressed in brown or russet and

looking like a hermit, although nonhuman communities show him as one of their own race. His symbol is an oak leaf

and acorn. Because of their difference in perspective, Ehlonna and Obad-Hai are unfriendly rivals, and he also counts

Phyton as his enemy. "One should live in harmony with nature in all of its variety. Those who destroy or otherwise harm

nature deserve swift vengeance in an appropriate manner. Those who are one with nature have little to fear, although

the well-meaning but foolish are sometimes brought down by a danger they could not avoid or divert. The wilds can be

ugly, dangerous, or terrible, but these things are a part of nature and should be respected as much as those that are

beautiful, harmless, or wonderful." Most of the Shalm's clerics are male, whether human, gnome, halfling, or fey. Most

tend get along very well with rangers and druids. They serve as protectors of nature, acting as the agents of retribution

when their protection is insufficient or too late. They teach hunting in the way that nature's creatures do (choosing the

weakest of the herd, etc.). Obad-Hai's adherents learn to become one with the Shalm in isolation, surrounded by

wilderness, Only at the beginning and end of a new cleric's training does he receive guidance from a senior member of

ObadHai's clergy. The rest of the time is spent living oft the land and developing an instinctive connection to Obad-

Hai's will. Not surprisingly, Obad-Hai counts more druids among his followers than clerics. If it takes place in the

wilderness, Obad-Hai's followers are interested. Quests that protect a forest from woodcutters, cleanse the corrupted

heart of a swamp, or prevent a dwarf mine from unleashing a volcanic eruption are smiled upon by the Shalm. Obad-

Hai's prayers and psalms often start with a reference to birth or growth and end with a reference to death or ending. One

common prayer for guidance begins, "Shalm. my thirst for knowledge grows/Lend me your wisdom and bury my

doubts." Groves of oak trees deep in the wilderness mark Obad-Hai's shrines. These temples are defended by dozens of

guardian animals and other denizens of the wilderness, many of whom are content to observe visitors from a distance.

Obad-Hai's rites are exclusively seasonal and are triggered by a real-world event: the first songbird of spring and the first

snowflake of winter, for example. Clerics of Obad-Hai have no formal hierarchy. They treat all those of their order as

equals. They wear russet-colored clothing and maintain hidden woodland shrines that are usually located far from

civilization.
