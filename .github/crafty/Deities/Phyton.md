Special Notes:

Description: Phyton (FIE-tahn) is a tall, slender, youthful-looking Suel god who can take the form of any forest

creature. Once like most nature deities, he now represents man's dominion over nature, and this puts him at odds with

those who would protect a forest from the actions of mankind, just as his dominion over beauty angers Wee Jas. He

clears forests to make room for crops, cuts tracks through mountains to make roads, and dams rivers to form fishing

ponds. His symbol, a scimitar in front of an oak tree, hearkens back to his old purpose. "Nothing in nature is so beautiful

as what man can make of it. A field of crops, a garden of herbs, and a swamp drained to form fertile soil are all marvels of

nature as much as the forest and mountains. Natural animals that can be domesticated should be, but those that are

dangerous to man or his works should be slain." Clerics of Phyton act as protectors for farming settlements and look for

ways to make use of nearby land. Each normally chooses a region to watch over, typically a circle one day's walk in

diameter. They might use their powers to redirect a river to suit a town's needs, or to cull a forest of its uglier plants to

leave a more pleasant locale. Some clerics wander the unsettled parts of the world, looking for destructive creatures to

kill, abandoned sites of old civilizations, or wild places that might be useful to mankind. Ceremonial garb includes

brown or green (lighter colors in autumn).
