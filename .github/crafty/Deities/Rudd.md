Special Notes:

Description: Rudd (RUD) is a woman who ascended to godhood with Olidammara's help. She appears to be a trim,

athletic Oeridian woman wearing form-fitting clothing and a long blue cloak. Some say she was one of the nine

demigods trapped by the mad archmage Zagig, and her church has become popular in the last two decades, especially

among adventurers. She is friendly with her mentor and Norebo, but opposes Zagyg, Ralishaz, and luz. A master of the

rapier, she never misses with her shortbow and claims the bull's-eye target as her holy symbol. "Depend upon skill for

success, but also on your good fortune. Never rule out the long shot, but don't count on it. Successful people make their

own luck, at a gaming table or in a duel, especially if they buck the odds with expertise. The ability to recognize good

luck and seize its possibilities divides the heroes from the fools." Rudd's clerics practice at games that rely heavily on

chance and physical prowess (less often mental ability), hone their fighting abilities, and perform other tasks that

improve with repetition. They work in gambling establishments and schools of fencing and archery, counsel the novice

to continue training, and caution the perpetually unlucky to find other interests. They adventure for the thrill of

experience, to prove their ability, to beat the odds, and just for the sake of exploring.
