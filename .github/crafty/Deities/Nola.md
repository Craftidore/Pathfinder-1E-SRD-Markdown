Description: Nola is the first being created by Uvot. She represents the life-giving power of sunlight and its ability to

reveal things hidden in the dark. A nurturing deity, she abhors deadly cold and those who destroy things before they

have a chance to come to fruition. She is pictured as a Touv woman of serene beauty, her head surrounded by a corona

of flame. Priests of Nola are concerned with the growth and development of living things, especially children.

Adventuring priests often see themselves in a parental role, watching over the adventuring companions and seeing to

their maturation. Ceremonial garb includes a headdress and collar of copper and gold.
