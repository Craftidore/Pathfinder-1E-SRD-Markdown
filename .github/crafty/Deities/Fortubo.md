Special Notes:

Description: Fortubo (for-TOO-boh) was once a Suel god but withdrew his support from nearly all his human followers

in favor of dwarves when he found that the Suel were responsible for the creation of the evil derro. He is friendly with

the gods of the dwarven pantheon but avoids all other gods except his brother Jascar. Fortubo is the sworn enemy of the

derro and their patron deity Diirinka. His holy symbol is a glowing-headed hammer, and his personal weapon is a great

hammer named Golbi that returns to his hand when thrown and is said to be a gift from the dwarf god Moradin. He is

shown as a small bearded Suel man who resembles a dwarf. "Focus on your tasks. Do not allow yourself to be distracted

by other careers or concerns outside of protecting the comÂ¬munity. Feel your kinship with the stone and do not cut it

more than what your community needs. Commit no theft, murder, or evil, for they will shackle the dwarven people

more strongly than any chains." Fortubo protects dwarven communities and welcomes clerics of either sex, especially

married couples. Fortubo's clerics plan defenses to the smallest detail and are more than willing to shoulder more than

their share of the responsibility if they feel anyone else involved is incapable of pulling their weight. They search for

ores and goblins, which they feel harm the earth with their pointless tunneling. Any hammer will serve as a holy

symbol. Married pairs of clerics are said to be especially blessed by Fortubo and their children are born with exceptional

insight and endurance.
