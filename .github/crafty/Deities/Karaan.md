**Special Notes:**

Known primarily as the Beast God, Karaan is a monstrous entity of savage lust and wanton destruction. Karaan is normally depicted as a hulking humanoid covered in fur, with terrible claws and teeth. He resembles no specific animal but has a predatory appearance.

Karaan represents the dark side of nature, and thus he is the enemy of Obad-Hai and Ehlonna. He is often revered in association with Erythnul, although his cults are much more obscure. A few believe him to be related in some way to Yeenoghu, though that demon prince is not an actual god. Karaan is the patron of lycanthropes and bestial creatures such as bugbears, gnolls, worgs, manticores, and some sphinxes. His symbols are gnawed, broken bones and bloody teeth. His favored weapon is the greatclub (though the bared claw and sharp tooth are just as favored). The domains he is associated with are Chaos, Destruction, and Bestial. He is chaotic evil.

Clerics of Karaan are as bestial as the god they serve. They despise civilization and love to destroy things—particularly objects fashioned through craftsmanship, for such skills are alien to them. They wear furs, hides, or armor in battle, or they wear nothing at all. Their hair is usually wild and flowing, and they are given to incoherent screams and grunts. They often undergo scarification as a part of their rituals and file their teeth into points if they are not naturally sharp.

Karaan’s temples are places of natural power: secluded glens, rocky outcroppings, and deep pits in the wilderness. They are always full of the bones of their prey, sacrificial victims, and fallen enemies.
