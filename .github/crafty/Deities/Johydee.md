Special Notes:

Description: Before the Oeridians began their migration into the Flanaess, their race was scattered throughout much of

Western Oerik. In the timelost centuries before the Suel and Baklunish empires initiated their terrible conflict, the

servants of evil deities held sway over the most prominent Oeridian nation. In time, the wise priestess Johydee (JOYdee)

tricked them into creating a magical mask, which she used to overthrow their hold on her people. While she

became a hero-goddess long ago, her sponsor is not known, nor is whom she worshipped in mortal life. Johydee can

appear as anything she wishes, but she favors the form of a young woman with honey-colored hair and gray eyes. She

appears flighty and mischievous, but this is a front that hides her true agenda. She makes few allies and never sides with

those who serve evil. Her sacred animal is the chameleon, and her holy symbol is a small mask of stylized onyx. "Never

let your enemies know your true intent, and casual allies should know little more. Know more about your foes than

they know about themselves, and tell their secrets to those who would use that information against them. Guard

yourself with layers of deception, for you cannot be harmed if you are not known to be an enemy. Know when to strike

and when to flee, and always act to help those who know your true self or those you have sworn to protect." Johydee’s

clerics usually work as spies for persons of power, whether nobles, generals, prestigious merchants, or spellcasters. They

enjoy situations in which they can pretend to be another person, and often have a different identity in each city they’ve

been to. They adventure to discover useful information about evil persons of renown, thwart the actions of tyrants, or

humble those with too much pride or ambition. Because they are skilled at deception, her clerics tend to treat all people

equally, regardless of apparent status.
