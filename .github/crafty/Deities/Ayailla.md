**Description:**

The goddess of light, Ayailla is called the Bright Eagle or the Brilliant Mistress. She is the steward of celestial radiance, and she watches over the good creatures of the sky. She is depicted either as a phoenix bathed in brilliant light or as a beautiful red-skinned woman with large, feathered wings.

Ayailla claims many nonhumans among her worshipers, including giant eagles, giant owls, pegasi, lammasus, cloud and storm giants, and good dragons. Surprisingly, she is also revered by some dwarves, including paladins, who quest to bring light into the darkness of the deep regions, both literally and metaphorically. Her symbol is a phoenix, and the domains she is associated with are Glory, Good, and Sun. She is neutral good and her favored weapon is the spear.

Clerics of Ayailla are bearers of her celestial light. Some take that mission literally, such as the dwarves mentioned above, or clerics who use celestial radiance to combat plagues of undead. Others interpret their mission more metaphorically, working to illuminate and educate people, teaching everything from basic literacy to abstract philosophy.

Ayaillaâ€™s temples are most commonly found in the cloud-castles of good giants or in subterranean dwarven strongholds, where they are beacons of light ain the darkness.
