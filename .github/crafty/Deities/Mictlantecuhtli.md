Description: Mictlantecuhtli is the god of death and the power of unlife. Normally shown as a tall lich-like being, he is

also depicted as a skeletal canine. His worshippers get his attention by sacrificing 50 of their own members during the

dark of the moons; these sacrifices then serve the god as undead. Another warlike god, he encourages his followers to

send their enemies to be his slaves in the afterlife. His permission is needed before a priest can use raise dead or

resurrection. Grim and cold, the priests of the death god never show mercy to their captured foes, sacrificing them at the

first opportunity. They oversee the interment of those who have died in battle and of natural causes. Ceremonial garb

includes a red metal or jade rod and a headdress of red feathers.
