is outnumbered. He is always shown as a serpent coiled around a skull. Priests of the serpent god are reclusive and donâ€™t

often deal with strangers, at least not openly. They work through agents, many of whom are charmed, to disrupt

civilization and harm the worshipper of other gods, and have been known to make human sacrifices. Ceremonial garb

includes a snakeskin headdress or cloak.
