**Description:** Valiant Azor’alq (Ah-zor-ALK), triumphant champion of the First Dynasty emperors, has been venerated as a hero by the Baklunish people for more than 3,000 years. He is first mentioned in the mythic tale of Hegira in which he defended the royal family from the minions of Darkness that assailed them in the flight from their defiled homeland across the desolate western mountains. Poets still sing of his courage and strength in battle, naming him the Banisher of Darkness. Philosophers and mystics esteem his purity and call him the Son of Light. The entrance to his great sanctum is said to be found at the highest peak among the Dramidj Ocean island-pinnacles that bear his name. He dwells within that sanction with his ancient paladins, the Thousand Immortals. Azor’alq appears as a tall, handsome warrior, dark of skin, clad in a coat of fine mail and a helm topped with peacock feathers. He wields a long curved sword known as Faruk. His symbol is an armed man standing atop a stone summit. "Strength grows in the light of courage. The bright sword of Azor’alq, once drawn, may be sheathed again only in victory. A true leader is the first to join in battle, and the last to seek rest. The flame of truth must be tended with good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, so that the purity of its light may dispel the tyranny of darkness." Azor’alq finds his strongest following among young warriors, but anyone in need of steady courage might call upon him. His adherence to good is unwavering, therefore he does not seek to restore the fallen or convert the evil, for he has no mercy to offer them. Among the Paynim, the clergy of Azor’alq is hereditary; they claim that the legacy of their cult goes back to the earliest days of the Baklunish empire. They often serve as war-leaders, and are always in the forefront of battle. In the settled lands clerics of Azor’alq are most often found in closed communities, where they are sometimes mistaken for fire worshippers. His few remaining paladins seek to emulate the legendary Thousand Immortals by destroying creatures of Darkness (typically fiends and undead). Some even make a quest to the Pinnacles of Azor’alq, when they feel they have grown sufficiently in knowledge and strength to overcome the challenges that their master has set for them there.
