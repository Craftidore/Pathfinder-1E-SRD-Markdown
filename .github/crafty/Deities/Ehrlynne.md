**Description:** 

Revered by pirates and the unpredictable beasts of the deep, Ehrlynne scorns land and laws for the freedom and fortune of the sea. She delights in chaos and pretense, and it's said she crews her own ship, the Ocean's Fury, with particularly brave or cunning pirates, taking them for raids across the planes. Brash, lusty, and greedy, she nevertheless follows a code of honor and loyalty to her crew and allies. Though she isn't interested in senseless murder or other unprofitable acts, she prefers conflict to peace-when two nations squabble, that's more opportunity to plunder both sides.

Not all of Ehrlynne's followers are pirates. A few are those who profit from strife (such as war profiteers, beast handlers, poachers, moonshiners, and smugglers), leaders of "pirate towns," those who cater to criminals, and intelligent sea monsters like cecaelias and sahuagin. While a few take to the seas in search of exploration and adventure, most of Ehrlynne's worshipers are those who covet the belongings of others and think it's fair to take them if they can. Particularly religious or cautious pirate captains throw a share of treasure overboard before battle or while navigating dangerous shoals, to invoke Ehrlynne's favor or turn aside her wrath.

The goddess has few temples, most of which are repurposed buildings or half-submerged shipwrecks. Shrines to Ehrlynne, however, are quite common in port towns, where they might be nooks between buildings decorated with a pirate flag, a carving of the goddess on an old ship's figurehead, or whittled idols of a woman holding a cup. Many vessels also have a small alcove or carving of the goddess placed near the bow facing the sea ahead.

Ehrlynne's clerics value coins and treasures from famous hoards or notorious captains, and consider it lucky to give a new priest such a coin or trinket. Priests try to wear such items at all times, often piercing them and tying them to their holy symbols. They believe it's very unlucky to ever lose such a gifted item, and will sail a thousand miles to recover a lost token.

Clerics ofEhrlynne may prepare *lesser geas* as a 4th-level spell and *curse of disgust* as a 5th-level spell, but can only use them to cause aversion to boats, ships, or open bodies of water.
