Special Notes:

Description: Keptolo (kep-toe-low) is the drow male ideal: elegant, quick-witted, attentive, and eagerly debauched. He

normally appears as a young nobleman dressed in well-tailored silks of red, purple, jet, and amber. He is armed with a

thin but sturdy poinard and a filigreed longsword. He affects a two-handed fighting style, using both weapons at once.

Otherwise he appears dressed for the hunt, velve-cloaked and armed with a magnificent crossbow. His relationship

with other drow deities is one of insincere amnity, save for Zinzerena, whom he openly despises. His symbol is a

stylized mushroom, which in drow culture is associated with both strong drink and fertility. "Feed the vanity of your

mistress, and all her treasures shall be yours. Be careful whom you offend, and keep an expendable companion nearby

to hold culpable for your crimes. Gossip can be as deadly as the venom on an assassin's blade. Use the poison of words

to destroy your rivals, that you may claim for yourself all they once presumed was theirs." Shrines to Keptolo are found

throughout the underworld, for many male drow worship him as their patron, mostly due to his association with

drinking. Tales of his sexual exploits are quite popular, and there are groups of performers who act them out for festivals

and private gatherings. His greatest temple is in the drow city of Erelhei-Cinlu, but only his most attractive or wealthy

worshippers are permitted to participate in services there. Clerics of Keptolo are found as advisors, critics, philosophers,

and politicians: essentially, any role that does not require actual work. They seek to emulate their deity in all ways, and

as such number among the most handsome and charming of the drow race. However, followers of Keptolo remain very

dangerous, for many of them are skilled dirksman, poisoners, or spies. Utterly capricious and completely untrustworthy

(even by drow standards), worshippers of the Eager Consort are deferential to priestesses of Lolth and attentive to the

matrons of the powerful noble houses. In other relationships, they are manipulative and abusive, particularly with

fellow clerics lower in the hierarchy.Name: Keptolo
