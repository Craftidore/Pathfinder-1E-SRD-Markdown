Description: luz (EYE-ooze) is thought to be the cambion (half-fiend) son of the demon lord Graz'zt and the powerful

wizard Igglwilv. Appearing on Oerth as a shriveled old man or as a huge, demonic-looking being, luz has many fiendish

allies and impersonates other gods to fool mortals and increase his territory. He remains a great threat to the balance

despite setbacks since the Greyhawk Wars. His symbol is a grinning skull, and he holds a particular hatred for Zagyg,

Vecna, St. Cuthbert, and Greyhawk. "The weak must be exploited, tortured, and stripped of hope. The strong must be

constantly wary of betrayal by their underlings. Pain is power, and inflicting pain demonstrates power best. Crush those

beneath you. luz must be obeyed, and those who defy him will know absolute pain." luz's clerics inflict cruelty and

torture upon all who oppose them. luz tolerates no less than fanaticism and complete obedience. His clerics constantly

try to outdo each other in their acts of cruelty and evil. They show their superiority over all other beings by hunting for

trophies; rare finds such as unicorns or paladins are truly prized. The clerics create spells and magic items of terrible

power and evil nature, and travel the world to commit acts of evil and search out luz's enemies, luz is served directly by

the Boneheart - two tiers (Greater and Lesser) of six advisers each (clerics and wizards), and by the Boneshadow, six spies

and evildoers who roam the world. Iuz builds grand temples to himself in his nation-state, but his churches elsewhere

are small and secret. He maintains important sites for mass rituals, sacrifices, and other ill deeds in forbidding

wilderness terrain far from the eyes of good.
