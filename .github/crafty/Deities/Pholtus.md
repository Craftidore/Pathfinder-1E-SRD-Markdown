Special Notes:

Description: Pholtus (FOHL-tus) is a stern Oeridian guardian of unbending Law, depicted as a tall, slender man in a

white robe, with fair skin and hair, and eyes that shine with the fires of devotion. He carries the Staff of the Silvery Sun,

an ivory object shod in silver and topped by an electrum sun-disk. His holy symbol is a full moon (Luna) partially

eclipsed by a smaller crescent moon (Celene). He believes that he is the authority on Law and the natural order, which

makes him unpopular with other gods. He particularly despises the Oeridian wind gods and is opposed by St. Cuthbert.

"The One True Way is a strict path, but guarantees rightness. Show no tolerance for those who do not give all for the

cause of Law. Fanaticism in the name of the Blinding Light is praiseworthy, and Law's champions shall be rewarded in

the era when chaos has been vanquished." This church does not have much respect for those of other religions,

especially chaotic ones. The anthem of the worshipers is "O Blinding Light"; the church has three ascending orders:

Glimmering (preferring white garments), Gleaming (preferring white and silver), and Shining (preferring white, silver,

and gold). Clerics of the Blinding Light are expected to bring the word to unbelievers, and brook no argument against

this practice. This quest means they must travel far from their churches, usually in groups should unbelievers and

heretics turn hostile. They smite chaos where they find it, and Evil once chaos is rooted out. These clerics get along well

with conservative paladins. When not preaching, they act as judges, lawyers, and arbiters.
