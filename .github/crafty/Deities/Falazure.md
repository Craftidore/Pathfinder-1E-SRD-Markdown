Special Notes:

Description: The terrifying Night Dragon, Falazure, is the lord of energy draining, undeath, decay, and exhaustion.

Some claim he has a decaying skeletal form, but others believe that he looks like a decrepit black dragon whose flesh is

pulled tight over his bones. Falazure teaches that even a dragon's long life span need not be the limit to a dragon's

existence. Beyond the world of the living is another realm, one of undeath eternal. It is generally accepted that Falazure

created (or had a hand in the creation of) the first undead dragons, such as dracoliches, vampiric dragons, and ghostly

dragons. Among the draconic gods, perhaps only Bahamut and Tiamat have more nondragon worshipers than Falazure.

Many necromancers of all races revere the Night Dragon, as well as intelligent undead such as liches and, especially,

dracoliches. Temples to Falazure are always deep beneath the earth, cloaked in darkness and far from the sun and fresh

air of the surface world. The followers of Falazure count all members of good-aligned faiths as their enemies. The may

occasionally ally with Nerull, but such instances are rare.
