Special Notes:

Description: Io the Ninefold Dragon is neutral, for encompasses all alignments within his aspects. He can (and does)

appear as any dragon type, from the small pseudodraon to the largest great wyrm. Io cares only for his "children," the

dragons, and their continues existence in the world. In some cases, this means taking the side of the dragon against

other races. In other situations, Io may actually help nondragons fight against a dragon who would otherwise jeopardize

the ongoing survivability of the species as a whole. He prefers to remain uninvolved in conflicts between dragons,

though if such a conflict threatens to escalate he may step in (either personally or by dispatching Aasterinian or some

other servitor). Io has even fewer cleric or shrines than most of the other draconic deities, since his outlook is so broad

and all-encompassing. Still, even the most devoted cleric of Bahamut, Tiamat, or any other dragon deity pays at least a

modicum of homage to the Ninefold Dragon. He also occasionally find clerics or adepts among the reptilian races, such

as kobolds and troglodytes. Io counts no other faiths as his enemies, knowing the value of neutrality in outlook. Even

those of greatly varying alignment can find common cause under the banner of the Ninefold Dragon.
