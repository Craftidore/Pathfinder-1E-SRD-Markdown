Special Notes:

Description: Erythnul (eh-RITH-nul) is the undisciplined counterpart to Hextor, possibly predating him and losing

worshipers to his ordered and intelligent rival. This Oeridian god is a terrible sight to behold, with ruddy skin, red

garments, a brutally strong build, and a great stone mace that is pierced to cause a fear-inducing shriek when he swings

it. His title comes from his appearance in battle, as his features change between human, gnoll, bugbear, ogre, and troll,

and his spilled blood becomes an allied creature of like type. His symbol is a red blood drop or a hideous mask. "Destroy

anyone who would take what is yours away from you. Covet that which you do not own. Blessed is he who can take

something from a rival. Maim those you cannot destroy, and cause fear in the hearts that you cannot maim. Bloodshed

for its own sake is reason enough, and if you can shed the blood of a hated enemy, so much the better. When Erythnul's

gift of blood rage comes upon you, be sure to use it well." Any site where great bloodshed has occurred is considered a

holy place by the church. Erythnul's clerics are cruel, sadistic, and hateful. They foment rebellion, murder, and riots in

civilized areas, lead troops of bandits, raiders, or nonhumans, and commit murder when they grow bored. They deface

beautiful things and disfigure attractive people for fun. They aren't above betraying their own allies to suit their own

motives or protect their own hides. They travel to bring ugliness and strife to pleasant places or to escape those that

would persecute them. Clerics of Erythnul get most of their training in large temples (where they'll witness live sacrifice

after live sacrifice) or in the army (where they'll witness the horrors of war). A higher-level cleric looks over a number of

novice clerics, trying to frighten them into rejecting the path they've chosen. Those who don't flinch after repeated tests

become Erythnul's new clerics. Anything that creates mass slaughter or mass hysteria pleases Erythnul, so his followers

might finish off the dying on a battlefield, make sure a shaky cease-fire falls apart, or simply pillage the countryside,

killing or maiming everyone they find. Erythul favors simple rhyming chants-and the gorier the subject matter, the

better. "First we slay and then we flay!' From skin to bone, you beg and moan!" Erythnul raises massive altars quickly at

battlefields, where their followers slaughter in the name of their god. If the tides of war take them elsewhere, they may

abandon their altars, leaving the area unhallowed, desecrated, and a prime lair for other evil creatures. For obvious

reasons, Erythnul's rites are generally sacrificial. Captured soldiers from a previous battle are often sacrificed at dawn

before combat starts in a "Bloody Howl" ceremony that inspires Ervthnul's followers to greater slaughters. Erythnul's

clerics favor rust red or bloodstained garments.
