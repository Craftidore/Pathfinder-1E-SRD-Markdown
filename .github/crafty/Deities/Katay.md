Description: Born of Breeka without a father, Katay represents the relentless cycle of birth, rot, and death in his

mother’s realm, as well as the time that tugs on all living things. He is the inventor of the Touv calendar, and records all

events upon the metallic wheel given to him by Xanag. Katay is shown as an elderly man with youthful eyes, wearing a

decaying animal pelt and carrying a great copper disk inscribed with Touv runes. Katay’s priests are the record-keepers

of the Touv people, recording births, deaths, great events, and weather phenomena for later study. They preside over

births and funerals, and uphold the laws of the people. Ceremonial garb includes old animal pelts and a copper disk on a

chain.
