Special Notes:

Description: Ralishaz (RAL-ih-shaz) is ever-changing (hideous to beautiful, female to male), but he usually appears as an

oddly dressed beggar. He carries nothing but his wooden staff; his holy symbol is three sticks of bone, derived from

divination and gambling tools. He rewards or punishes those that rely on chance or take great risks, seemingly at

random. He is the god of insanity; many debate whether his appearance and whims are truly random or just madness.

He shuns other gods, although he does not seem to be hateful of them. "Order does not exist, only randomness and

chance, and the odds are stacked against you. While you may have a good run against the odds, eventually the universe

will balance itself out against you. Randomness and insanity go hand in hand, and sometimes those who are the most

insane are the ones who are closest to the true nature of the universe. Kindness and prosperity are illusions, as

misfortune comes to all sooner or later." Clerics of Ralishaz are a curious combination of fatalism and recklessness,

stoicism and wild endeavor, depending upon how they feel their place is in the world at that moment. They live

charmed lives, although when misfortune hits them it hits hard. They preside over places of gambling, although most

patrons are unsure if their presence wards off bad luck or draws it. They travel when their divinations indicate they

should, or at the roll of a die. They are often mean-minded or cruel, not seeing the point of friendliness to someone who

will eventually be cursed by bad luck.
