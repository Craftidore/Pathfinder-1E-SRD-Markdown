Special Notes:

Description: Trade in the Baklunish lands is the province of Mouqol (moh-KOHL) the Merchant. Like Istus, he was

neutral in the war between Light and Darkness that precipitated the mythic Hegira; like Geshtai, he provided

necessities to both sides of the struggle. Other tales describe Mouqol's travels among genie-kind, and his skill at

bargaining with even these most difficult of clients. Mouqol's particular gifts are the ability to discern the true desire of

his customers, and the talent of finding and delivering the rarest of treasures to their predestined owners. "Reward is not

gained without risk. The perfect bargain satisfies both necessity and desire. The wise know the worth of a thing as well

as its cost. Greed makes the wealthiest into debtors. All life is a matter of exchange." The Bazaar, or marketplace, is holy

ground. Some markets in the larger cities are set up around actual temple-buildings, but most simply contain a tentcovered

altar or shrine to the merchants' god. There is no standard tithe, but a variable set of fees is levied on the traders

who utilize the marketplace. These monies are used to cover expenses, but any excess is dedicated to charitable works,

for the accumulation of large amounts of wealth is foreign to Mouqol's values. Much more important is the art of the

negotiation process, for hard bargaining is near to a sacrament for these Western merchants. Clerics of Mouqol are

common among the Baklunish, as well as among the jann and the merfolk of the Dramidj. Clerics use their powers to

deter theft, fraud and magical deception. They work as appraisers of common goods, with certain members specializing

in more exotic items. Most travel during at least part of their career, particularly as part of merchant caravans. Ritual

prayers are said each morning, prior to opening for business or beginning the day's travel.
