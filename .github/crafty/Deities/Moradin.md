Special Notes:

Description: Moradin (moar-uh-din) usually appears as a stern-faced male dwarf with a powerful build. His upper body

is particulary robust, with a barrel chest, wide shoulders, and arms corded with big muscles. He has flowing black hair

and a beard to match, and he always wears full plate armor. He carries a shield and a warhammer. Moradin forged the

first dwarves out of metal and gems and breathed life into them. Many of Moradin's clerics have parents and

grandparents who were also clerics of the Soul-Forger, so many clerics train for their calling from childhood with a

father or mother as teacher. Defense of dwarven civilization - and the traditions that make it strong - is paramount to

followers of Moradin. They protect new mines from goblinoid invaders, track down a lost line of dwarven warrior-kings,

and journey to the Elemental Plane of Fire to light a forge that tempers a new artifact. Moradin's prayers are replete with

references to metals and smithing. One of the most common prayers for intercession begins, "You burn the dross from

me, but the iron remains." At the center of every temple to Moradin is an anvil and a massive forge, where the weapons

and armor that defend the dwarven people are made. The anvil is also frequently used as the altar. The best

weaponsmiths in the world probably work in Moradin's temples. Genealogy and heritage are important aspects of

Moradins rites. A funeral for a Moradin worshiper is a grand, solemn spectacle, with chants that describe the lineage of

the deceased stretching back thousands of years.
