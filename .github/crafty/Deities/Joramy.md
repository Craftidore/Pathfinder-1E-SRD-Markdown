Special Notes:

Description: Joramy (JOR-um-ee) is a hot-temprered but generally good-natured goddess. Shown as a nondescript

woman with fiery hair and one fist raised, Joramy argues for the sake of arguing, and uses emotional arguments when

rational ones fail. She is on good terms with nonevil gods who enjoy their aggressive side, but disdains emotionally

distant beings such as Delleb, Rao, and her estranged lover Zodal. Her holy symbol is a volcano. "The dance of a flame

and the twisting patterns of molten rock are the most beautiful sights in the world, representing fire's argument with

earth. Let your passions burn as hot as these things, and never back down when you have the opportunity to convert

someone to your perspective. Ideal and opinions are what forms and shapes a person, and not defending with all your

effort what you hold in your heart to be the truth is a betrayal to yourself and your ideals. Any rival opinion is a

challenge - answer with the same fervor that you would a physical threat." Clerics of Joramy make good political leaders

and revolutionaries. They are willing to defend their ideals to the death and have a gift for inspiring others to do the

same. Many work as diplomats for small but aggressive nations, where their tendency to escalate talks into heated

arguments makes their parent nation appear stronger than it is. They go adventuring to find new people to argue with

and new causes to champion.
