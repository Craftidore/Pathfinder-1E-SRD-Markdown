# Rais
## Overview
Rais (rye-EES) is a draconic goddess of the intellect and silver dragonkind. She is worshipped only by the silver dragons of Edill.

**Description**

When she manifests on the Prime Material Plane, Rais takes the form of a silver dragon of surpassing grace and beauty.

**Worshippers**

The silver dragons of Edill revere their goddess with their hearts and minds, eschewing organized churches or permanent shrines. It is not in their nature to request clerical spells, so Rais does not grant them.
