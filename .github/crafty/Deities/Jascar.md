Special Notes:

Description: Jascar (JAS-kar) is the brother of Fortubo and dedicated foe of Beltar; his holy symbol is a snow-capped

mountain peak. With his dark beard and shining silver breastplate, Jascar doesn't resemble the Suel people that worship

him, but his visage strikes fear into orcs and goblins. He is sometimes shown as a great horse or Pegasus - two forms he

once took when fighting Beltar. He is often aided by Phaulkon in his efforts to advance the cause of good, and Jascar's

hammer is the bane of all undead. Other than Phaulkon and Fortubo, Jascar talks little with other gods and is often

perceived as driven and aloof. "Hold no quarter for evil nonhumans like orcs and goblinoids, and equally hate those

who would make the beautiful hills and mountains ugly. Protect the hills and mountains from plundering by evil forces

and you will be rewarded with the treasures Jascar places under the earth for good folk to find." The church teaches

common tactics used by evil nonhumans. Jascar's clerics often lead cross-country and underground crusades against evil

nonhumans. They survey for precious metals, and advise miners on how to dig their tunnels safely and cause a minimal

amount of damage to the surrounding environment. Their single-mindedness often alienates them from others, but

their dependable nature means that an entire temple can be called upon in times of crisis; the network of the multiracial

Jascarian faith is strong as stone. Ceremonial garb includes earth-toned clothing with a white cloth headdress or

white metal cap..
