Special Notes:

Description: Olidammara (oh-lih-dam-MAH-rah) loves upsetting those who are too attached to their boring and

controlled worlds. He is shown as a brown-haired man of rakish appearance, olive skin, and merry eyes, although his

magic laughing mask (and holy symbol) allows him to change his appearance. Zagyg once forced him into the shape of a

small carapaced animal and imprisoned him; the Laughing Rogue still retains the ability to form a protective carapace,

and he has used it to thwart many aggressors and pursuers. He is friendly enough with other gods, although the lawful

ones resent his capriciousness and tricks. "Treat music as the art it is. Strive to be as skilled at it as your patron. Life is

meant to be happy and entertaining, and the best jokes need a target to hang them on; when it is your turn, accept the

laugh and appreciate the trick. Wine is one of the joys of life, and the only thing better than making wine is drinking it.

Avoid misery, temperance, and solemnity, for they are the greatest poisons to the soul." Olidammara has a faithful

following but few easily found churches. Clerics of Olidammara study music, make wine, tell jokes, and occasionally

perform acts of mayhem. Those who live in cities tend to work as entertainers or vintners, while those who prefer rural

settings act are storytellers, messengers, and minstrels. Many of them live a life on the run from powerful people whom

they greatly offended early in their careers. Others just enjoy traveling in search of new music, exotic wines, and

celebrations. Becoming a cleric of Olidammara seems easy enough to an outsider - it looks like one celebration and

escapade after another. But would-be clerics are being keenly observed even in their least sober moments as more senior

followers of the Laughing God look for the right mixture of joy, whimsy, and mischief. Missions that steal from the rich

or embarrass the mighty are the headiest wine of all. Followers of OIidammara might engage in intrigues at the Duke's

masquerade ball, steal offerings from the temple of a rival deity, or rescue a world-spanning thief from a prison on the

plane of Pandemonium. Olidammara's prayers are more often sung than spoken, and they almost always rhyme. There

are very few established liturgies, because Olidammara's worshipers are expected to freestyle-rhyme praises to their

deity. Simple shrines to Olidammara are common in concert halls and public houses. However, the larger temples are

hidden (often in the city's sewer network), because they double as a hideout for thieves. Those who know where a

temple to Olidammara is can buy or sell all sorts of stolen or forbidden goods there. Olidammara's rites range from the

simple (the Ceremony of the Cork, practiced when a particularly good bottle of wine is opened) to the elaborate (New

Moon Follies, a three-act comedy performed by and for Olidammara worshipers). Most feature alcohol, song, and

laughter.
