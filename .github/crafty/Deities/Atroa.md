**Description:** Atroa (ah-TROH-ah) is one of the five Oeridian wind and agricultural deities fathered by Procan. Depicted as a fresh-faced blonde woman with an eagle perched on her shoulder, she once loved the gold Kurell but was spurned by him for her sister [[Sotillion]]. She oversees the blessings of spring, including the opening of hearts to new prospects and the body to new horizons. Her sling Windstorm can strike the most distant foe, and her spherical glass talisman Readying’s Dawn can melt ice within her line of sight. She is closest to her divine family and is indifferent to most other gods except Fharlanghn. Her holy symbol is a heart with an air-glyph within. "Spring is the time that the world awakens from her slumber by the invigorating breath of the east wind. Spring brings new life and love to the world, renews old friendships, and pulls on the heartstrings of lovers, poets, and travelers. It is a time for old things to be repaired, old feuds to be buried, and old biases to be discarded. Like the dawn, it presages great things to come; look to them with an open mind and heart so that they may be enjoyed to the fullest." Clerics of Atroa are optimistic, willing to try new things; and rarely settle in one place for more than a year. They are forgiving and proud to turn foes into friends. They love returning to past friends and lovers almost as much as they relish any opportunity to travel and see new places. They enjoy exploring strange places, especially if they haven’t traveled in a while.
