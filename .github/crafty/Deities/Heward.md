Special Notes:

Description: Heward is of indeterminate age - appearing both young and old at the same time. He is athletic and

strong, quick and lively. Although his pate is bald, Heward has a luxurious moustache and small beard of sandy-brown.

His forehead is wrinkled but his cheeks are rosy and fresh. Heward always wears shabby garb or finery which is old and

out of fashion (thus actually creating a style all his own and quite remarkable). Although distinctive, Heward has the

power to be quite unnoticeable when he so desires, simply by willing it, so no magic aura betrays this anonymity.

Because of his non-aggressive philosophy, Heward seldom carries any major weapons. Similarly, Heward is

uncomfortable with protective devices, although he does employ a special herbal mix which improves his armor class.

In addition to his magical powers, Heward is able to employ any standard musical instrument to enhance his bard skill.

Heward understands the arcane art of technology, and is particularly adept with mechanical items of this nature. His

domicile is reputed to have many devices of this occult nature: engines, clockworks, etc. Heward dislikes

incomprehensible things, however. The devices, as well as golem-machines, are reputed to serve in many capacities in

Hewardâ€™s bizarre stronghold. The domicile of Heward is non-descript on the exterior. It extends into many extradimensional

spaces, so its interior actually contains all manner of rooms and spaces - from cramped lofts to a grand

auditorium with a great organum, including open gardens and spacious parks. This domicile is a nexus which touches

parallel worlds, many planes, and the dimension of time. Heward will always have various pitch pipes and tuning forks

with him. The powers of these instruments are basically twofold: one will provide defensive magical effects, the other is

for movement to other planes.
