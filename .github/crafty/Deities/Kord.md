Special Notes: Divine spellcasters are not permitted to wear dragonhide of any kind unless they are descendants of

Kord (which requires campaign documentation to claim this ancestry; for example, the Blood of Kord feat or an entry on

an Adventure Record). Wearing dragonhide armor by non-descendants of Kord is a gross violation of the code of

conduct.

Description: Kord (KOHRD) is an incredibly powerful Suel god, second only to his grandfather, Lender. Son of

Phaulkon and Syrul, he is shown as a hugely muscular man with long red hair and beard, wearing dragon-hide gauntlets

(white), boots (blue), and fighting girdle (red); these items form his holy symbol, although a star composed of spears and

maces is popular. He fights with his intelligent dragon-slaying greatsword Kelmar, and when wounded he often enters a

blood rage so intense only Lendor can control him when he succumbs; because of this, a cleric of Kord will always defer

to a ranking cleric of Lendor. He is reputed to have dallied with beautiful humans, elves, or even giants, and tales are

told of the great heroes who are born of such liaisons. "The strong and fit should lead the weaker. Bravery is the greatest

quality in any ruler. Scorn cowardice." Kord loves physical challenges and contests, and it is this love that inspires many

barbarian tribes to use nonlethal sports as a method for resolving disputes. Kord's clerics are expected to be leaders. They

train people to become stronger, organize athletic tournaments, and participate in challenging physical activities.

Doubting their fitness is a grave insult, and they go to great lengths to prove their physical abilities (although they

realize the difference between difficult and suicidal challenges). Wearing of dragon-hide by a cleric is a blasphemy,

unless the wearer is a descendant of Kord. Clerics believe magic should be used to enhance allies rather than strike

directly at foes. Would-be clerics of Kord come into the faith one of two ways. Most succeed on some feat of strength

(often at a local carnival or sporting competition), drawing the admiration of a cleric of Kord. Less often, a youth attains

notoriety for his sickly nature, but a cleric of Kord notices how passionately the child craves strength. Either way,

becoming a cleric of Kord involves rigorous physical training, including calisthenics, running, and practice in any

number of specific sports. Kord's followers love any quest where they can prove their strength, especially if it involves

direct competition with someone else. Winning in a gladiator arena, climbing an unassailable mountain, and slaying a

great wyrm dragon are all pleasing to Kord. Kord favors rhythmic chanting and clapping, the louder the better. Many of

his chants feature syllables that exist strictly to maintain the rhythm, such as "Ah re, ah tee, Kord the Mighty..." A temple

to Kord is often a sprawling dwelling open to the air. Some feature gymnasiums, fields for athletic competition, and

gladiator arenas. They provide training for nearly every physical endeavor. Kord's rites are brief, lasting just a few

minutes. They're joyous, dancing ceremonies at the end of a battle or a long-term teat of strength, such as raising a barn

or moving stones to form a hedgerow. Ceremonial garb includes white, blue, and red clothing.
