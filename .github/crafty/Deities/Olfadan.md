**Description:** The Grey Scribe is most often portrayed as an elderly man carrying a beautiful quill in one hand and a bottle of ink in the other. Olfadan (ol-Faa-dan) is the human name, while the elves name him Olfadain (Ol-fa-dayn), yet he is very much the same god to both races. Olfadan is said to keep all the knowledge of the world in his magical tomes. Olfadan is the caretaker of libraries, and for that reason alone, almost all libraries in the civilized world has a shrine dedicated to the Grey Scribe. You'll find bards and traveling scribes among his most trusted followers and they are always collecting knowledge and stories where they find it.

Clerics of Olfadan always wear robes of grey and white.
