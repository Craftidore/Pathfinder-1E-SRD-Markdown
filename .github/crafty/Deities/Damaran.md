**Description:** Damaran is the god of vermin and other creeping things, as well as the flight-instinct necessary to survival. He unquestioningly obeys his father Meyanok and is easily browbeaten into obedience by his older sister Vara, although he often runs away when confronted by enemies. Damaran is shown as a strong Touv man with a skulking look about him, often accompanied by rats and insects. The priests of Damaran are survivors - they know how to find food in the strangest and most disgusting places, and thrive where no one could be expected to live. They serve their communities in times of famine, and often lead the reclusive tribes hidden in the deepest jungles. They call hordes of vermin on those who anger them. Ceremonial garb includes ribbons of black metal on the arms, neck, and legs.
