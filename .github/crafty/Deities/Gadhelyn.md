Description: Gadhelyn (Gad-THEL-en) the Archer is an old name in elven mythology. Once part of the traditional Fey

Mysteries, he is now largely forgotten by the elf-kindreds, save among the grugach. To these wild elves of the Flanaess

he remains a potent and heroic figure appearing as a sharp-featured elf with long, yellow hair and bright green eyes. He

is attired in rough garb of hide and fur, the color of which varies according to the season. His symbol is a leaf-shaped

arrowhead. Gadhelyn is the ideal of the noble outlaw, with a court of unruly but loyal subjects. He recognizes no value

in family lineage, but admires only individual skill and merit. He delights in discomfiting the high-born, but is known

to show generosity to those in genuine need - if the mood strikes him. One or two Knights of Luna are thought to be

sympathetic to the Lord of the Wildwood, but otherwise he finds little favor among the members of the Grand Court of

Celene. "Rejoice in the springtime, make merry in the summer, feast in the autumn, and dream in winterâ€™s shadow. At

the court of the Lord of the Wildwood, knights are knaves and the rude are royal. Let all who would enter the forest

bring a gift to the Lord of the Wildwood; but beware, if it is not pleasing, he shall take what he will in its stead. When

the first arrow strikes the heart, it is a noble wound; when a second must be shot, it is fitting that the hunter should

become the hunted." Gadhelyn has many druids in his service, though very few of them participate in the hierarchy of

the Old Faith. His worshippers are most commonly grugach, but also include a number of wood elves, and even a few

half-elves and humans revere him and participate in his festivals. His followers are the bane of wealthy travelers in the

woodlands, but they are truly dangerous only if attacked, or if their forests are despoiled.
