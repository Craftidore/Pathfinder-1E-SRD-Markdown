Special Notes:

Description: Hextor (HEKS-tor) is the arch-foe of Heironeous, his brother and fellow Oeridian war god. He seeks to

conquer or destroy any that oppose him. He is depicted as a handsome man with dark hair and light skin when shown as

a god who rules through strength, but takes the visage of a gray-skinned, horrible six-armed being when shown in his

more violent aspect. He uses a different weapon in each arm and wears iron scale armor with many skull decorations.

His icon is the Symbol of Hate and Discord, six red arrows facing downward in a fan. "The world is a dark and bloody

place where the strong rule the weak, and power is the only reward. It is often necessary to be cruel and merciless in the

pursuit of ones goals, and achieving those goals can have harsh consequences. Order must be forged out of chaos and

law out of anarchy. The forces of tyranny must be obeyed and dissenters must be oppressed or destroyed." Most of

Hextor's temples are built on the sites of great battles where many were slaughtered. Hextor's clerics constantly train

themselves in the arts of war, for they plan or lead attacks on rebels and do-gooders. Many serve petty or powerful

leaders, and others still have achieved significant political positions of their own, particularly in the former Great

Kingdom. Individuals and small groups strike out from established churches to sow dissent in enemy lands, bringing

down foreign nations from within so that the arms of Hextor may conquer. Hextor's religion is organized in military

style, so "superior officers" put wou Id-be clerics through rigorous, harsh training. Only those strong enough to put up

with months of abuse become clerics of Hextor. Not surprisingly, they're eager to turn the tables and establish

dominance over others. Hextor's followers are obsessed with having "lessers" under their heel. They establish

themselves as the state religion wherever they can, join the crusades of despotic conquerors, and force local lords to

kneel before them. Worshipers of Hextor generally express concepts as laws, such as "The slave shall not contradict the

master, for such is the Law of Hextor., They also exclaim, "He will be obeyed!" a lot. Hextor's followers build their

fortress-temples at mountain passes, river crossings, and other sites of strategic importance. They often have massive

forges where they build weapons and armor for those aiding the cause of tyranny. The hierarchical structure of Hextorworship

lends itself to a number of rites that honor relationships between two unequal partners, such as master-slave or

officer-soldier. Hextor's sect is not as secretive as other dark religions. Temples of Hextor operate openly in many cities,

and clerics wear black clothing adorned with skulls or gray faces.
