**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Annam is the fertile progenitor of worlds. Annam has a conflicted nature that proves to be his undoing. On the one hand, he is an all-knowing god of learning, philosophy, and deep meditations; Annam is omniscient, but he chooses not to know certain things, in his wisdom. But, against this vastly cerebal nature, one must set Annam's instinctual, even lustful nature. He is not a god for whom contemplations hold endless attraction. Annam is fertile and vigorous, and he makes a considerable number of mistakes when governed by his insticts. Thus his son, Stronmaus, makes him proud and contented, but his other sons have been distinctly less of a blessing to him. Annam has largely retreated from events on the Material Plane, grown weary of having to watch countless worlds and conflicts; he has few followers or clerics. Only events that will affect the course of history for an entire world (like the Rain of Colorless Fire) are sufficient to attract his attention. Annam does not grant visions or omens, save once in the lifetime of each cleric. Annam appears as a giant of truly staggering size - white-haired, wearing a robe of midnight blue.
