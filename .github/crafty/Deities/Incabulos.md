Special Notes:

Description: Incabulos (in-CAB-yoo-lohs) is a dread power feared by mortals, fiends, and (it is said) even some gods.

The bringer of disease and blights is a terrifying figure - deformed body, skeletal hands, nightmarish visage, and garbed

in a black robe lined with orange and green. He rides a nightmare and is accompanied by hags. He causes a nightmarish

slumber in any who meet his eyes, and his great staff causes seeping wounds and withers flesh with a touch. His symbol

is the magic icon for the eye of possession. Incabulos hates all other gods, although he is indifferent to Nerull, who

completes the work Incabulos starts. "The suffering of the world is meat and bread to Incabulos. Sickness, famine, and

other curses bring him power. Some feel that the Black Rider can be warded off or appeased by prayers; but this only

delays the inevitable. The world of dreams is his battleground, and he wages war against minds just as he rots bodies."

Clerics of Incabulos are secretive and paranoid. Justifiably fearing persecution by good and evil folk, they rarely reveal

themselves for what they are except in times of great despair when they can fan the emotions of the suffering. Greater

clerics use threats and this state of fear to encourage junior members to maintain secrecy. They enjoy torturing others,

inflicting disease, and spreading blight. They travel to find new locations or people to infect, escape those who would

destroy them, or find strange lands where exotic diseases can be found.
