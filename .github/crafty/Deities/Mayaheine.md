Special Notes:

Description: Mayaheine (MY-ah-heen) is a recently ascended paladin of Pelor, brought here from another world to

help fight the powers of darkness and evil. She is portrayed as a strikingly tall woman with blue eyes and auburn gold

hair, dressed for battle. Her shield, Hope’s Champion, turns back evil magic upon its source, and her bastard sword

Triumph stuns fiends and tyrants with a touch. Her holy symbol is a shield with a bastard sword, sunburst, two golden

sphere and two victory runes. While she is fine warrior, she is above all a protector. "Protect those who need it. For

good to survive it is necessary to defend the weak and innocent. Bravery, strength of mind, and perseverance in times of

hardship or danger are virtues, and adherence to the concepts of justice, fairness, and righteousness are essential.

Obedience to Pelor the Sun Father is as important as devotion to the Shield Maiden. Just as Mayaheine traveled a long

way to aid our world, it may be necessary for the faithful to travel far to uphold her word." Clerics of Mayaheine train

themselves and others in self-defense. They help build town walls and other protective constructions; many take roles

as community leaders, their devotion to justice and good making them excellent judges. They travel to prove their

bravery, right wrongs, and to destroy strongholds of evil. This faith sponsors many paladins and is friendly with

paladins of other faiths as well. They are always respectful of clerics of Pelor, for their religion wouldn’t’ exist on Oerth

if it weren’t for him.
