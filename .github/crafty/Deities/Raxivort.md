Special Notes:

Description: Raxivort (RAKS-ih-vort) is the god of all xvarts - a short, blue-skinned goblinoid race found in the Bandit

Kingdoms, old lands of the Horned Society, Bone March, Pomarj, Verbobonc, and the eastern Vesve Forest. Raxivort

was the greatest general of his race, taken in by the demon lord Graz’zt and granted abilities by his lord. After centuries

of serving as Graz’zt’s Master of Slaves, Raxivort looted the demon’s armory and claimed his own Abyssal realm. While

he can take the form of a great rat or bat, his natural form is that of a strong but ugly xvart wearing silken garments over

blue mail. He carries the falchion Azure Razor, favors throwing blades of various sizes and creates fans of acidic fire

from his left hand (thus, his symbol is a blue flaming hand). He combats most other nonhuman gods and avoids

demons entirely. "Xvarts are the inheritors of the world. They and their rat, wererat, and bat allies will destroy their

enemies, particularly the goblins and kobolds. With cunning, numbers, and small allies, the xvarts will overwhelm all

opposition. Like Raxivort himself, fire and knives are the tools of the xvarts against their hated foes. Those who can not

take the shape of a rat or bat are doubly blessed." Most clerics of Raxivort are xvarts, although some rat- and batcreatures

worship him as well. The less militaristic clerics search out old ruins to stone sores of magic and weapons that

can be brought back for their tribe. His clerics are more open-minded about and less fearful of humans than other

xvarts, and they serve as negotiators or diplomats when humans are encountered.
