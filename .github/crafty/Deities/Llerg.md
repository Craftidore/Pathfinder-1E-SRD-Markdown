Special Notes:

Description: The most uncivilized god in the Suel pantheon, Llerg (LERG) ignores most other gods, seeing them as too

civilized, but has a friendly rivalry with Kord and a hatred for Telchur. He is shown as a strong, shaggy man wearing furs

and a fighting girdle or as a great bear, snake, or alligator. These animals are sacred to him, and they are his three holy

symbols. He fights with a broadsword or in one of his animal forms and may be the ancestor of the original dire bears,

dire alligators, and giant snakes. He is popular among the jungle savages, who call him Hlerg. "Be strong so that others

respect you. Be fierce like the creatures of the animal world. Humans have lost contact with their inner animal nature -

watch and learn how the predator lives, and you will again be as you should be." Llerg supports barbarians defending

their lands against encroaching civilization. Llerg's clerics choose one of his sacred animals as their totem animal. They

act as intermediaries when tribes meet, and range far in search of prey when times are lean for their tribe. They bless

weapons, warriors, and sites of battle to ensure victory, and in more peaceful times they train young warriors in armed

and unarmed combat. Some clerics see visions and travel to find the meaning of what they have seen. Llerg's temples

are simple stone or wooden buildings with large open spaces. They are built in places frequented by wild animals, and

prey animals tend to avoid such places due to the predators in the area. The interior of the building is carved and

painted with animal motifs, with animal skins decorating the walls and floor. An open fireplace dominates the center of

the temple. The first appearance of large predators after the winter is a day for celebration; the priests spend all morning

in prayer, then wrestle and dance in firelight that night. The first snowfall of winter is likewise heralded as a time for

prayer and ritual, putting the animal spirits to rest until the world renews itself; in regions that get no snow, the first day

of Sunsebb is used instead. This winter ceremony consists of securing food stores, prayers over animal skins, and feats of

strength such as rock lifting and axe hurling. Ceremonial garb includes bear skins, alligator hides, and snake skins.

These skins are carefully preserved and often decorated with jewels for eyes. Necklaces, amulets, and belts of carved

animal bones complement their dress, and many tie animal teeth and claws to their faces or hands during such times, or

even pierce their bodies with these items. Adventuring clerics favor typical barbarian garb, with thich leather girdles

carve with bear images; most also wear either a bearskin cloak or a "Llerg-cloak," a tasseled robe woven to represent the

pelt of a bear. Llerg's clergy are known as beastwalkers.
