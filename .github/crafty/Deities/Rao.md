Special Notes:

Description: Rao (RAH-oh) is shown as an old man with dark skin, white hair, slender hands, and a serene smile. Any

time an offering of peace is made, Rao grows a day younger. Although he never intervenes directly on Oerth, Rao is the

creator of several artifacts of good, particularly the Crook of Rao. He is a dedicated foe of Iuz, an ally of Zilchus, and is

otherwise friendly with all other beings. He can cause any aggressive being to relax into an agreeable calmness with a

glance, having thwarted even Nerull with this power in the past. His holy symbol is a white heart of wood or metal, or a

heart-shaped mask with a calm expression. "Reason is the greatest gift. It leads to discourse, which leads to peace,

which leads to serenity. If all could be convinced to reason with each other, the world would enjoy the harmony of

benign order. Some refuse to use reason and instead resort to violence, at which time action - governed by reason and

wisdom - is required to counteract their deeds and restore peace." His clerics pursue knowledge, paths of logical

thought, theology, and introspective meditation. They prefer peaceful means over violence, but are not above using

force when their arguments are ignored or the bastions of reason are threatened. They search for new schools of

thinking, fabled locales of calmness and quietude, powerful magic to use in the cause of Law and Good. Temples of Rao

are generally stately, open air affairs filled with incense, quiet chanting, and earnest philosophical discussion. Many

have extensive libraries and learned sages on hand to answer even the most esoteric question.
