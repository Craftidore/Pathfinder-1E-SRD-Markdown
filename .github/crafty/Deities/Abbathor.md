**Special Notes:**

Abbathor (ab-ah-thor) embodies the principle of greed which is the major weakness of the dwarven race. 

Abbathor always appears as a very large dwarf in leather and furs, fat and piggy-eyes with a sallow skin.  He wears leather and furs made from those non-dwarves who have opposed him in the past.

He has an insatiable lust for treasure, especially gold. He is tolerated by the other dwarven deities because he has sided with them in epic battles of the past, but none trust him. Berronar loathes his deceitfulness, and Dumathoin shields treasures from him, to his fury. He broods in his gold-lined cave, ever watchful for more treasures to consume. Abbathor's omens to his followers are typically malevolent, such as the splitting apart of a gem, the tearing of a sack of gold, or the despoiling of treasure. "Gone to Abbathor" is a dwarven expression for lost treasures. Abbathor's clergy secretly opposes those of Dumathoin and, to a lesser extent, Berronar. They amass treasures and sacrifice them to Abbathor. Clerics of Abbathor are known as aetharnor (a dwarven word meaning "those consumed by greed"); they pray for spells at night. Solar eclipses, volcanic eruptions, or any other natural phenomenon that blocks the light of the sun during the day are causes for great religious celebrations among the aetharnor, who use the cover to hatch their larcenous schemes. Abbathor teaches that "wealth was created for those dwarves crafty enough to capture it by any means possible. Revel in the possession of all wealth that shines or sparkles, for its pleasing form was meant to bring you pleasure. Greed is good, as it motivates the possession and holding of all that is precious."

**Relationships**

The Morndinsamman, the dwarven pantheon of gods, consists of the leader Moradin, as well as Abbathor, Berronar Truesilver, Clanggedin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Muamman Duathal, and Vergadain. Of all the dwarven deities, he gets along best with Vergadain, with whom he sometimes travels.

Although he is the only evil power among the Morndinsamman, he is tolerated by the other dwarven gods because he has sided with them whenever a threat appeared from outside. Abbathor may be untrustworthy and the embodiment of all dwarven qualities the other gods would rather avoid, but in the end he's still a dwarf, and both they and Abbathor believe in sticking together. "Greed is good, but do not seize wealth from the children of the Morndinsamman," Abbathor teaches, "for strife in the name of avarice weakens the clan."

**Realm**

Abbathor's realm in the Gray Waste is known as the Glitterhell. It's a place of great natural beauty, if you like gold and gems. The true location of the Glitterhell is unknown, and Abbathor maintains several false locations of his realm to throw off the greedy men and dwarves who are always attempting to steal his gold.

**Clergy**

Abbathor's priests dress in red leather, and leather caps.

**Holy days and rituals**

Abbathor's holy days are on the solar eclipse, and he demands the sacrifice of both blood and gems annually.

**Temples**

A long-abandoned temple to Abbathor in the Yatils was looted by Arnon Orberend. {The Marklands, 75)

**Myths and legends**

Envy and avarice

Originally, Abbathor was god of the beauty of gems and minerals, but he fell into a rivalry with his brother Dumathoin over who would be the patron of the mountain dwarves. When Moradin named Dumathoin, Abbathor became twisted with disappointment, vowing that from that point on, whenever he desired something he would take it.

The beard shirt of Dunforth

The legendary dwarf hero Dunforth wove his beard into a shirt, forsaking all other forms of armor. The dwarven god of battle, Clangeddin Silverbeard, was so impressed by this gesture that he invested Dunforth's beard with power, making it strong as chain mail. Abbathor conspired with Vergadain to trick Dunforth into gambling his beard away. Shamed as only a beardless dwarf can be, Dunforth tried to redeem himself by single-handedly exterminating an orc village. Though he slew thirty of his foes, the overwhelming number of orcs eventually felled the armorless Dunforth, and the beard shirt remains as part of Abbathor's hoard.
