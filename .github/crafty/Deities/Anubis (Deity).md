**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Virtually every Osirian tomb contains images of the jackal-headed god Anubis, the god of mummification and protector of tombs. He presides over funerals and embalming, and guides souls to Pharasma to await their judgment in the afterlife, punishing tomb robbers and defending the dead on their journeys to the Boneyard. 

Anubis is the son of Osiris and Nephthys, and assisted Isis with Osiris’s mummification. Like his father, Anubis frequently comes into conf lict with Set, particularly regarding that god’s association with undeath. As a guardian of the dead and their tombs, Anubis frequently works with Isis, Neith, Nephthys, and Selket, who protect the canopic jars containing the organs of the deceased. Anubis usually appears as a man with jet-black skin and the head of a jackal, though he sometimes takes the entire form of a jackal. 

Clerics and paladins of Anubis are dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they find them. Anubis is the patron of embalmers, and priests and embalmers typically wear jackal masks that cover their entire heads in honor of their god. Anubis grants his followers the [[Death (Domain)|Death]] domain and Souls subdomain, but worshipers of Anubis who choose either of these adjust the granted domain spells slightly. Those who choose the [[Death (Domain)|Death]] domain replace *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* with *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]*, *[[Create Undead (Spell)|create undead]]* with *[[Antilife Shell (Spell)|antilife shell]]*, and *[[Create Greater Undead (Spell)|create greater undead]]* with *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*. Those who choose the Souls subdomain replace *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* with *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]*.
