Special Notes:

Description: Pelor (PAY-lor) is the Flan sun god, known throughout the entire Flanaess. Riding the great ki-rin Star

Thought, he summons flights of eagles and destroys evils with bolts of sunlight. Depicted as an old man in white, with

wild hair and a beard of shining gold, he was until recently a peaceful and gentle god concerned with the alleviation of

suffering. Now, he is a more martial deity who brings his wrath to bear on darkness and evil. Now he invigorates and

heals those who champion the cause of good, and the stylized sun-face holy symbol is painted on shields and banners

across the Flanaess. "The energy of life originates from the sun. This light brings strength to the weak and health to the

injured, while destroying darkness and evil. Do not be afraid to challenge the forces of corruption, but remember that

just as staring at the sun can cause blindness of the eyes, relentless attention to the destruction of negative forces can

blind the heart to the true essentials of life: kindness, mercy, and compassion." Pelor's clerics are usually quiet, kindly

people with a backbone of steel. They are primarily nurturers and protectors, but when the time comes to bear arms they

are not afraid to do so. They use their powers to heal, nourish, and otherwise aid the needy, while practicing the skills

needed to protect their charges should they be threatened. Clerics of Pelor are free to explore far lands in an effort to

drive off harmful beings and spread their god's gift to all who need it. Because Pelor's clerics spend a lot of time tending

to the sick, blessing crops, and providing for the basic spiritual needs of their communities, they attract a number of

earnest, forthright youths who want to make the world a better place. While not unduly harsh, training among the

followers of Pelor is rigorous enough to send many well-meaning youths back to their farms and cobbler-shops. More so

than adherents of any other faith, the followers of Pelor often find themselves striving against the undead. They also

undertake healing whenever they can-whether that healing is physical or spiritual. Quests that break tip a cabal of

necromancers, broker a peace accord between rival warlords, or destroy an ancient lich-queen once and for all are good

examples of missions for the glory of Pelor. Pelor's prayers often take the form of firstperson affirmations, such as "I am

merciful, just as the Sun of Mercy shines on me." Temples to Pelor are tall structures that often feature large windows,

often with decorative stained glass. They tend to be tall, airy, and blindingly white. They are usually placed so the sun

shines into most of their rooms throughout the day. They often feature open, sunny courtyards as well. They are kept

scupulously clean, and many of them have wings that house hospitals. They're a good source of healing magic and often

easy to find because Pelor-worship is so prevalent in civilized lands. As befits a sun god. Pelor's major festivals take place

on solstices and equinoxes, and many weddings and rites of passage take place on the cusp of a new season. The Blessing

of the Sun-Kissed Field is a common rite requested by farmers. Pelor's clerics favor yellow garb. They are usually kindly

people with backbones of steel.
