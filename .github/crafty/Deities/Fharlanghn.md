Special Notes:

Description: Fharlanghn (far-LAHNG-un) is shown as a seemÂ¬ingly old man with leathery, wrinkled skin and youngseeming

bright green eyes. Brother of the Oeridian god Celestian, he is on amiable terms with nonevil earth gods and

several nature gods, and is sometimes tied to Atroa. His symbol is a wooden disc carved with the curved line of the

horizon, and he carries a magical version of this symbol called the Oerth Disc. He is the patron of those who walk or ride

long distances (including travelers in tunnels, and as such is praised by those who must use mountain passes or travel

the Underdark). "People need to move about and see new things. Be open to travel, as the world may change overnight

and you may be in need of a new home or perspective. Look to the horizon for inspiration - the far end of the world has

new peoples, new cultures, new magic, and new roads to walk." The church is comprised of wandering clerics (who

favor green and minister to those on the roads) and settled clerics (who favor brown and are usually older clerics whose

wandering days are behind them). Clerics of Fharlanghn are encouraged to travel the world and see new things. They

bless caravans, explore exotic lands, scout for armies, and record lore on distant places and people. Because they learn

many languages and cultures, they act as translators and diplomats. Many aid in constructing of roadways and bridges,

and a pair of shoes made by one of his clerics is held to last longer than any other. "The road is the best teacher," say the

worshipers of Fharlanghn. A higher-level cleric takes a half-dozen or so recruits on a long journey, where they'll help

fellow travelers, see the wider world, and take part in any number of misadventures. The only way to flunk out of

Fharlanghn's training is to ask when the journey will be over-those faithful to Fharlanghn know that the journey never

ends. Any quest involving long journeys can involve Fharlanghn as well. His followers often guard caravans, explore

mysterious islands, and maintain a series of portals between worlds. Fharlanghn teaches through short anecdotes, many

of which feature a wise old man traveling with a foolish young man. There are more than a hundred stories that involve

the two of them crossing a river, for example. Fharlanghn doesn't have many large temples, but wayside shrines to him

are common. At major crossroads and port cities, shrines to Fharlanghn provide fast horses and sturdy sailing ships.

Because his followers are often on the move, Fharlanghn's rites are often short and to the point. Many Fharlanghn

worshipers rely on the ceremonies of allied deities for such things as marriages and funerals.
