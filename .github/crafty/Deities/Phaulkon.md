Special Notes:

Description: Phaulkon (FAHL-kahn) is an active deity, promoting the cause of good and chasing down evil. He

concerns himself with all things that happen under the open sky, and is a scholar of artifacts (and how to negate their

powers). Father of Kord and second only to him in fighting ability, he is friendly with Aerdrie Faenya (the elven goddess

of air and weather), Jascar, and the other gods with portfolios similar to his own. Depicted as a powerful, cleanshaven,

bare-chested wingless man, his holy symbol is a winged human silhouette. "Victory in battle depends upon archery. The

sky is the dome over creation, and creatures of the sky are blessed for freeing themselves from the soil. Take the fight to

the enemy; do not wait for the encroach of evil. The ancient devices of war are best left alone, as their use involves great

danger." Phaulkon's clerics study the sky and clouds for portents, and work to protect the nesting places of flying

animals. They teach archery and hunting to common people so they may feed and protect themselves, teach farmers the

difference between birds that eat seeds and those that kill seed-eaters, and train soldiers in the more difficult aspects of

ranged combat. When rumors of ancient evil magic surface, they seek out the source to make sure the item gets

destroyed or at least stays buried. His clerics tend to be wanderers, enjoying living under the open sky and fighting evil

where they discover it. Ceremonial garb includes blue clothing.
