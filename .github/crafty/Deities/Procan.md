Description: Procan (PROH-kan) is the father of the Oeridian wind gods (Atroa, Sotillion, Telchur, and Wenta) and the

sky-god Velnius. He usually ignores other gods save those who rival his control of the sea (Osprem and Xerbo).

Typically worshiped for his aquatic aspect, a few inland peoples revere him as a weather god. He is greedy, tempestuous,

and mercurial, rarely keeping the same mood for more than an hour. His trident Undertow is made of coral and gold

and finds sunken treasure; this weapon over a cresting wave is his holy symbol. "The seas and skies are ever-changing

and unpredictable. The waters that blanket the earth are deep and unknowable, and their waves can pull down any ship

not guided by Procan. He must be honored so that one can avoid his fury in the greatest storms and reap the bounties of

the deep blue waters. Life came from the sea and to the sea all life will return." Clerics of Procan avoid complexities in

life (the faith itself has few rituals) and usually live on or near the sea, attending to those who earn their livelihood on

the seas. They are considered good luck on sea voyages, and are often hired by captains, or choose to pilot their own

vessels. They may be leaders or enemies of pirates. Holy water is made from salt water; their create water cantrips may

create fresh or salty water.
