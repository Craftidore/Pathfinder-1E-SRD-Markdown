# Demiplane (Scales')
## Overview
Created by the wizard Scales on xxx of year xxx, this demiplane was created using a *[[Genesis Oil|genesis oil]]* provided by the witch Xann.

## Description
Scales' demiplane is spherical and surrounded by water in every direction. This water's depth is always one sixth the overall size of the demiplane itself. The temperature of the water at the surface is always within 5 degrees (F) of the air temperature (which is always 75 degrees (F). For every 10 feet of depth, the water temperature drops 1 degree.

## Additional Details
The original *[[Genesis Oil|genesis oil]]* created a 180 ft. sphere whose inner surface was covered by water 30 feet deep. The air temperature is always 75 degrees (F). The water gets colder as it gets deeper.

Use *[[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]]* (*[[Genesis Oil|genesis oil]]*) > *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]]* (1 bountiful, 2 gravity, 3 seasonal, 4 structure, 5 portal, 6 time x4), *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* x 9 (90k + 80k + 17.5k=187.5k)
