# Jawbreaker (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
The rugged surface of a *jawbreaker* shield is always scratched and gouged, as if gnawed by enormous jaws. Attacking the wielder with a bite attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the wielder, which is resolved before the bite attack. This attack of opportunity must be a shield bash attack with the *jawbreaker* shield; making this attack does not cause the wielder to forfeit the shield’s bonus to AC. If the wielder confirms a critical hit with this shield bash attack, the attacker’s jaws are injured, causing it to take a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls with its bite attack for 24 hours. The save DC of exceptional or supernatural abilities that use the target’s mouth, including breath weapons, is likewise reduced by 2 for the same amount of time. A *[[Regenerate (Spell)|regenerate]]* spell ends this penalty, and a creature with regeneration recovers from these effects after 1 minute.

The wielder adds the *jawbreaker* shield’s total shield bonus to AC (including its enhancement bonus) to his CMD against combat maneuver checks to grapple him with a bite attack, including attempts to swallow him whole.

This special ability can be placed only on shields, but it cannot be placed on bucklers or tower shields.

Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Inflict Critical Wounds (Spell)|inflict critical wounds]]*, ; Price +2 bonus.
