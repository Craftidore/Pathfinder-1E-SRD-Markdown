# Energy Resistance (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
A suit of armor or a shield with this property protects against one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of energy damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]* spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]**;* Price +18,000 gp.
