# Bashing (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A *bashing shield* deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.

Moderate transmutation*;* CL 8th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bullâ€™s strength]];* Price +1 bonus.
