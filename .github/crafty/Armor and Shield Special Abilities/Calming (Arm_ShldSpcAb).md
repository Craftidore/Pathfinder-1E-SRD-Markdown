# Calming (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
*Calming* armor is dyed or stained a soothing color, usually blue. As a swift action, the wearer can create a 5-foot aura around her that quiets the emotions of any agitated opponent threatening her. A creature that is raging or under an emotion effect must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or those effects are suppressed (but not dispelled) for as long as the aura persists. The aura can be used up to 10 rounds each day, though the rounds donâ€™t need to be consecutive. Ending the aura is a swift action.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Calm Emotions (Spell)|calm emotions]]* ; Price +1 bonus.
