# Sharbhat
## Overview
**Sharbhat Overview**

Founded over 500 years ago by Prince Havros Nehli as part of Sharba's expansionism, Sharbhat stood as a jewel for centuries. Threatened by slavers from the Tilvanot Peninsula, Baron Grallus anticipated the onslaught, however, and made a fateful alliance with the Free Captains of Breeka's Teeth. Swooping out of Xuxchan Bay to pounce on the unsuspecting slavers, the pirates’ superior fleet swiftly ended the threat to their northern neighbor, and extracted a mighty price from Sharbhat for their efforts. To this day, vast portions of Sharbhat’s wealth flow into the Free Captains’ coffers for past assistance and assurance of continued naval protection.

Financially weakened by the Free Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners to the north, Sharbhat faces an even larger threat from within. The native [[Hepmonaland]] people, inspired by the teachings of a mysterious, undead child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open rebellion to free themselves from colonial rule. While Sharba no longer has an official stake in Sharbhat's government, the colonial Sharbhat minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the natives know that they have the resources of the entire Central Reach at their backs, and that Baron Utilinus’s government is in a poor position to quell a rebellion.
