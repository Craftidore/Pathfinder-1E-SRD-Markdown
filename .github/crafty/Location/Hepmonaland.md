# Hepmonaland
## Overview
Hepmonaland is a continent to the southeast of the [[Flanaess]]. Hepmonaland is the Suel and Oeridian name for the land, named after Eri-hep-Mona, the first Suloise explorer to arrive there. The Olman call it Xamolatatl, "Home of the People," and the Touv call it Melavi, "The Bountiful Place." It is the smallest of [[Oerth]]'s continents.

Hepmonaland is bounded by the Densac Gulf and Vogan Sea to the west, the Solnor Ocean and Sea of Sharks to the east, the Tilva Strait to the northwest, and the Oljatt Sea to the northeast. A spur of islands splits off from the continents western shore, curving north to form Xuxchan Bay. A large island, the Isle of Singing Stones lies to the southwest.

An unhealthy tropical marsh, the Pelisso Swamps, sits along much of the continent's northeastern coast.

Hepmonaland is a tropical landmass, suffering frequent storms.

A number of intelligent lifeforms inhabit Hepmonaland, including three human races. The Touv to the south, and the degenerate Suel tribes in the north. Olman tribes also inhabit portions of Hepmonaland. Yuan-ti are also known to dwell on the continent. Hobgoblinpirates which ply the Oljatt Sea are thought to have a presence in Hepmonaland as well.

**Dragon's Claw**

Hepmonaland is a land on the verge, simultaneously pushing on the edge of the map of the Pearl Sea and lying near the Tilvanot Peninsula. The nigh impassable jungles of the area known as the Central Reach and the perilous navigation hazards of Xuxchan Bay isolate Hepmonaland from the Flanaess, and its closest neighbors are only nominally

nations themselves. Several nations (as well as groups of adventurers) have attempted to colonize Hepmonaland) with limited success. 

Yet the citizens of Hepmonaland were not the first to attempt to carve civilization out of the wild region—since the dawn of history, humanity has strived to form great kingdoms amid the dangers of the Central Reach. Crumbled ruins are all that remain of these

vanished empires, and even their names have been forgotten by history. Some scholars even whisper that lost ruins of the ancient Sarrukhan empire may be found in the unexplored jungles, but these crackpot theories are dismissed by more

reputable sages. But whatever their origins, these ruins may provide incredible wealth and power to those who rediscover them. This dangerous land and the wilderness beyond serve as the setting for the Dragon's Claw.

This guide seeks to aid players preparing to take part in the Dragon's Claw adventure, to arm them with spoiler-free details and rules elements useful in the forthcoming challenges, and to help create backgrounds that easily mesh with the campaign. Along with advice for players of most races and character classes—details on Sharbhat, the country in closest proximity to the campaign’s events, and of the Pogue's Folly, the ship conveying the PCs to adventure, should help ground players in the circumstances and events of this adventure.
