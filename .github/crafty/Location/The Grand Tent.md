# The Grand Tent
## Overview
Among the myriad places of political power in the city of Greyhawk must be counted the Grand Tent.

## Description
A permanent red-and-white striped pavilion of fire-resistant cloth situation on the southern edge of Low Market.

## Profile
Before the dawn of each day, a cabal of accountants, merchants, guards and priests of [[Zilchus]] gather here to discuss the day to come. As the sun breaks the horizon, they sell booth licenses (in the form of wooden plaques) to scores of merchants and await the coming of the crowd. Throughout the day, the group handles disputes between merchants and customers and assays the days business. At dusk, when the market closes, they total their receipts and return (under guard) to the headquarters of the Union of Merchants and Traders.

Renting a 6-ft.-by-6-ft. selling space for a full day costs 5 sp. Larger spaces are available for proportionally more money, and certain respected or extremely wealthy merchants have managed an arrangement with the accountants of the Grand Tent by which they rent the same booth each day. usually in East Market. Costs for popular space near the Hanging Tree are doubled. The colorful wooden plaque that serves as the receipt for space rentals must be displayed at all times and must be returned at the end of the day.

## Additional Details
**DMs Notes:** Those who manage Low Market have a notoriously low reputation. Most expect that these folk work hand-in-hand with the Thieves' Guild and worse, and that they even receive a cut from the daily criminal "take." While a good deal of corruption can be found here, most of it is the type of "money for special considerations" double dealing common to any marketplace. Though rumors abound, the business of the Grand Tent is in large part legitimate.
