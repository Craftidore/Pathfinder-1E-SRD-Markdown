# Khemti, Demiplane of
## Overview
Khemti, the land of evernight, was created millenium ago by a wizard who attempted to create a demiplane using a dark crystal from the Plane of Shadow as a seed. The demiplane was then shaped to resemble its creator's homeland: a hot dry desert.

## Additional Details
The Land of Always Night is a cross between the world of Stargate (the film), Midnight (the Fantasy Flight Games campaign setting) and an Arabian Nights setting. Notable features: it is always night there (duh!). All food production is done by using *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* crystals. It is extremely limited. DIvine magic is impeded in the Land of Always Night. All magics with the teleportation subschool are completely disabled. The sun is occluded in a perpetual eclipse. The worship of gods is forbidden save for the Dark Lord. Secret cults and cabals worship a limited Pharaonic pantheon. All light spells are halved.

The Dark Lord (shade wizard?) employs many different creatures (fey,ri and kir-lanans); he uses them to opress the people.
