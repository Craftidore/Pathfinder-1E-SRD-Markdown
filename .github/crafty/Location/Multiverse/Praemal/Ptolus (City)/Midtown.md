# Midtown
## Overview
The largest district in the city, Midtown is

bounded by the King’s River on the

north. But where the river dips south (at

Carver Lane), the border veers north to Golden

Elm Way to run along the Necropolis wall.

Farther east, Midtown continues right up to the

Cliffs of Lost Wishes and the Warrens, and to

the south the district ends at Iron Street. The

boundary between Midtown and the South

Market is rather vague—it amounts to a

diagonal line drawn between the north end of

Carriage Row and the ramp up to Oldtown.

The western border then runs north up along

Dalen’s Cliffs.

Midtown is actually twice as big as any other

district of Ptolus. Frequent motions have come

before the **City Council** to subdivide it into two

separate districts. Holding up the motion’s passage,

however, is the furious debate among merchants,

business owners, and city administrators

as to exactly where the new border should go. If

the parties ever manage to settle this issue, this

division likely will happen.

Perhaps most significantly, Midtown is

where the delvers and adventurers live, congregate,

make their plans, and return with

their treasures.

THE FLAVOR OF MIDTOWN

Midtown may be the most purely “Ptolus” section

of town. This is where adventurers come,

where a lot of nonhumans live—in essence, this is

the hub of the city. “Everything passes through

Midtown,” the saying goes.

The streets are about ten feet wide—fifteen

feet wide in a few places, and Center Street,

which traverses the entire district on a diagonal,

is a full twenty feet wide. Regardless of their

width, the streets are almost always crowded

with locals going about their business and others

just passing through to get to one of the Market

wards, the Temple District, the Guildsman

District, or Oldtown.

The smell of cooked meals mixes with the odor

of garbage and sewage at times, but often the

rainwater clears away the nastier refuse. A dog

tethered to a hook in the door of a house barks at

passersby. Children kick a ball around in front of

the adjacent house. Across the street, a vendor

with a wooden cart full of apples and pears sells

her wares for a few coppers. The streets are full

of people carrying things: their washing, freshly

bought bread, a child or two, their trash to dump

into the river, or a stack of newly printed broadsheets

for distribution. And that’s just for starters.

RUNNING MIDTOWN

Chances are, the player characters will spend a lot

of time in Midtown—perhaps even the majority

of their time in Ptolus. Adventurers congregate

here, get supplied, sell loot, share information,

and depart for the Undercity. Running Midtown

likely will become very familiar to you.

Best of all, there are very few restrictions on

what you can do with Midtown. Any kind of person,

from beggar to noble, from thief to priestess,

from powerful mage to savage barbarian, can be

found in here, if only just passing through.

A campaign set in Ptolus can use Midtown from

the time the player characters are 1st level until

they are 20th. If the players seem more interested

in exploring dungeons than in the intrigues of the

city, Midtown—specifically **Delver’s Square**—can

serve as a “mini” version of the city. That is to

say, Delver’s Square offers just about everything

an adventuring group needs: a weapons shop, an

armorer, an outfitter’s, a tavern, a place to sleep,

a place to sell loot, and even a small temple.

When the PCs are in Midtown, particularly in

Delver’s Square, don’t hesitate to toss any kind of

strange encounter at them. In many ways, the area

around the square is the strangest part of town.

Seeing someone riding a flying carpet or strolling

along with a troll cohort, a dire bear companion,

or *ioun stones* is not out of the ordinary. Or all of

the above. A good rule of thumb when running

Midtown is to make sure the player characters are

not the strangest folks in the district. If one of the

players has a minotaur PC, people should be surprised

to see the minotaur, but not completely

thrown for a loop. A minotaur fighter is certainly

no stranger than the local **ogre-mage cleric** with a

collection of *ioun stones*, for example.

PEOPLE OF MIDTOWN

Nonplayer characters in Midtown are more likely to be nonhuman than those encountered in other sections of town. They are also far more likely to be adventurers, or to have levels in a non-NPC class—although such characters are still the exception, even here.

People in Midtown seem even more jaded to the supernatural, the monstrous, and the strange than the standard residents of Ptolus.

**MAN ON THE STREET**

**Kord the Culler:** Kord is not your typical Stonelost dwarf. Originally from **Kaled Del**, Kord now spends all his time in Ptolus. His job is to gather supplies not available to the dwarves in their underground community, like green vegetables, paper products, and wood, and send them down to his fellow dwarves beneath the city. He is never too busy to chat, however, and likes to talk about the dwarven community. Kord is always surprised that most people don’t even know that Kaled Del exists. If someone shows real interest, he’ll even offer to lead people there (although other dwarves might not be as welcoming as he is).

**Aven Jellel:** Aven is a tailor, but she wants to be a delver. Should this five-foot-seven, muscular human woman with medium length brown hair encounter some obvious delvers on the street while running an errand or delivering garments for a customer, she likely will introduce herself and try to find out who they are and what they’re doing. She’s not necessarily interested in joining an adventuring party right now (although she would not turn down an offer), but she is looking toward the future and the possibility of getting some training or at least some pointers down the road.

**Gaellas Icestar:** Gaellas is a courier who does most of her work for **Doraedian Mythlord**, the master of **Iridithil’s Home**. Gaellas, a female halfling, has a strong affinity with **her “elven” heritage** and enjoys the company of elves even over her own race. She has very long black hair and a large scar on the side of her face and neck (she got it from being kicked in the face by a horse). Seen frequently all over town, she typically goes back and forth between **Emerald Hill** and Oldtown or the Nobles’ Quarter. She can be somewhat gruff, simply because she is always hurrying somewhere.
