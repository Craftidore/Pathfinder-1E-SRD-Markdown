# Greyspace
## Overview
The crystal sphere containing [[Oerth]] where the World of Greyhawk campaign setting takes place.

The sphere known as Greyspace is one of the largest crystal spheres yet discovered-a staggering 16,000 million miles (16 billion miles) in diameter. Many centuries ago, explorers and astronomers discovered the relationship between the size of a crystal sphere and the sizes of the orbits of the planets within its system. The sphere always has a diameter exactly twice that of the orbit of the major planet furthest from the system's primary.(In most systems, this primary is the system's dominant fire body, i.e. "the sun." As will be discussed later, in the case of Greyspace, the primary is the earth body known as [[Oerth]].) The outermost major planet in Greyspace is the [[Spectre]],which has an orbitalradius of 4,000 million miles (i.e., it is 4,000 million miles from the primary).This gives the [[Spectre]] an orbital diameter of 8,000 million miles, meaning that the shell itself has a diameter of twice that distance.

Nobody knows for sure just why this relationship holds. Many theories have been put forward: some logical and supported by arcane mathematical computations, and others whimsical, supported by emotion more than calculation; still others make no sense whatsoever to anyone but the theorist proposing them. As is so often the case, reality seems to have little truck with theory.No matter what the reason, this relationship has been proven in every crystal sphere yet discovered, and no spacefarer really expects to find a counterexample.

The [[Spectre]]'s orbit is perfectly circular, which means the distance, and thus the travel time, between it and [[Oerth]] never changes. At top spelljamming speed, it takes 40 days to travel from [[Oerth]] to the [[Spectre]].This means that the voyage from [[Oerth]] . to the boundary of the crystal sphere itself takes 80 days, and the journey from one side of the crystal sphere to the diametrically opposite side takes 160 days.

It is important to point out that the "double diameter" relationship refers only to "major" planets. In Greyspace, as in many other crystal spheres, there are other astronomical objects beyond the most distant "major" planet-comets, asteroids,and other such denizens of the dark. Some of these orbit (if, in fact, they do orbit) relatively close to the crystal sphere itself. A minority of these "planetoids" and "planetesimals"-to use two terms in technical parlance-are relatively large. This leads to arguments among sages over exactly what is a "major" planet and what is not.If the definition is broadened to include some of the larger comets, etc., then the "double diameter" relationship breaks down. Certain of the more cynical sages have thus come to define a "major" planet as any world that causes the "double diameter" relationship to remain true.

As stated earlier, Greyspace is a geocentric system. That is, the system's central point or primary, around which all major bodies orbit, is occupied by an earth world. This sets Greyspace apart from the vast majority of other crystal spheres, which have fire bodies-suns-as their primaries. In the Greyspace system, the dominant fire body is the world known as [[Liga]]. It is the third most distant planetary body from [[Oerth]], after Kule and [[Raenei]].

The distinction between major planets and minor planets, or moons, raises its ugly head again with respect to Kule and [[Raenei]]. In the Greyspace system,euery planetary body orbits around [[Oerth]], and so-by strict reading of the definition-are all moons. This position leads to the patently ridiculous result that several of [[Oerth]]'s moons are actu ally several times the size of the planet they orbit. To avoid this, most sages of [[Oerth]] classify only [[Raenei]] and Kule as moons, basing this on their proximity to the primary and on their size. (Some sages, of course, argue this is mere sophistry, whether basing their refutations on complex logical argument or on simple stubborness.)

To anyone approaching Greyspace's crystal sphere, the surface of the sphere appears utterly flat. This is a consequence of the sphere's great size. In any sense that is meaningful to normal mortal creatures, any region of the sphere can be considered to be flat. The curvature is simply too infinitesimal to make any meaningful difference.

The outside surface of the sphere is highly reflective. On close inspection, it has the same appearance as perfectly-polished steel. It is not steel, of course, or any other kind of metal. It cannot be scratched or dented, it has zero electrical conductivity, and it is a perfect superconductor of heat. (This means it is totally impossible to melt the surface of the sphere. Any heat applied to one point is instantaneously conducted throughout the massive volume of the sphere, so that all points on its surface maintain exactly the same temperature. If there were some way of pouring intense energy into the sphere, its entire surface would rise in temperature until it glowed cherry red.Considering its volume, however, there is probably not enough free energy in the entire universe to achieve this.)

From a distance, the surface takes on a shifting, iridescent quality reminiscent of mother-of-pearl. Its silver sheen appears to be shot through with streaks and whorls of subtle pinks and blues. Travelers through the Phlogiston have frequently reported their absolute amazement on first seeing Greyspace, hanging like a massive pearl in the turbulent colors of the Flow.

The inside surface of the sphere is very different.It is as smooth as the exterior, with no ripples or unevenness that can be detected by even the most precise measurements. It is black, however, and totally nonreflective.It seems to absorb all light that falls on it. It has no texture, and no discernible temperature, that is, it feels neither warm nor cold to the touch. In fact, it does not seem to register to the sense of touch other than as a boundary. Someone trying to touch it feels something stopping his hand from moving any further,but this sensation is registered by the muscles. The actual tactile nerves do not register the contact at all. This has lead some sages to speculate that it is, in fact, truly impossible to actually touch the inside of Greyspace's crystal sphere. There is some force-magical or physical-that prevents such contact. Certain experimenters, using cunning arrangements of mirrors and lights, claim to have shown that there is always a hair-thin gap between the sphere and any object that is or seems to be touching it.

The stars that can be seen from the surface of the planets and from wildspace are actually huge, glowing, multifaceted jewels embedded somehow in the material of the sphere. To be seen from the surface of [[Oerth]], eight billion miles distant, it would seem that these gems would either have to be incredibly massive, hundreds or thousands 

of miles across, or incredibly bright. Neither seems to be the case. The largest of the star-gems are 10 to 20 miles across, while the majority are smaller in dimension than one mile. Some are as (relatively) tiny as a few hundred feet across.

Neither are they overly bright. They are dazzling when approached, to be sure,and cast deep shadows across the deck of any spelljamming vessel that approaches within a few thousand miles. But they pose no threat to unprotected vision. Staring at a star-gem from a distance of 1,000 miles is less painful than looking into the disk of [[Oerth]]'s sun from the lands of the [[Flanaess]]. Predictably,there are many competing theories struggling to explain how the star-gems are still visible from a distance of billions of miles.

The energy source that drives the star-gems' light remains a mystery. Presumably, there must be some connection between the jewels and some highenergy plane-possibly the plane of Radiance, the plane of Elemental Fire, or possibly even the Positive Material plane itself. Perhaps at the heart of each star-gem, deep in its crystal lattice, is a gate to this other plane, whichever one it may be. Or, perhaps the source is something very different-an energetic chemicalor magical-chemical reaction in the heart of the gem. Salamanken, a noted sage from the [[Flanaess]], holds that the star-gems are actually composed of material quarried by the gods from the Positive Material plane itself, and that their glow is simply intrinsic to their nature. Nobody knows for sure.

What is known is that the star-gems of Greyspace do not pour heat into wildspace around them nor, apparently, into the crystal sphere itself.If precautions are taken against the light,an unshielded human can approach within 100 feet of a star-gem without feeling any increase in temperature. The 100-foot limit represents some kind of boundary, however. The temperature within this boundary is several thousand degrees Fahrenheit. The boundary has no physical presence; it cannot be felt or otherwise detected. An explorer can walk right through it without knowing it is there and be instantaneously cremated by the massive heat of the star-gem. Any character who breaks this boundary must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 50) {original text: saving throw vs. breath weapon,with a -3 penalty}, or be vaporized instantly. If the character saves successfully, he still suffers 4d10 hit points of damage for each round he stays within 100 feet of the gem. A brave or foolhardy character who actually touches a star-gem must make another successful Fortitude save (DC 55) {original text: save vs. breath weapons, this time at -5}, or be vaporized instantly. Even on a successful save, the character suffers 6d10 hit points of damage from the contact. No magical protection (a ring of fire resistance, for example) mitigates the damage within the 100 foot boundary. The heat is enough to ignite or melt any nonmagical material that passes within the boundary. Magical items receive a saving throw vs. breath weapon, at -5, each round they are within 100 feet of a star-gem. A failure means the item is totally destroyed.

Star-gems have no gravitational-field; neither does the shell itself.

The star-gems are arranged in complex patterns. When viewed from a distance, the pattern appears to be right on the boundary between order and chaos. Observers usually have the sensation that there is a pattern, but one just slightly too subtle to grasp and understand. Certain sages claim that the distribution of star-gems follows complex mathematical formulae. Each sage who holds this view believes these formulae take different forms, however, so the whole concept may well be meaningless.

Spontaneous gates and portals sometimes open in the crystal sphere, giving access to and from the Flow that surrounds Greyspace. Most of these portals are small-tens of feet across, and rarely larger than 100 feet in diameter.They are always perfectly circular. Rarely, a truly massive portal opens, up to several miles in diameter.These "major portals" are exceedingly rare, however, occurring on the order of once every five years or so. Spontaneous portals are much more uncommon in Greyspace than they are in Realmspace. In the latter sphere, there are thought to be 3,200 spontaneous portals in existence at any given moment. In Greyspace, in contrast, there are probably fewer than two dozen portals open simultaneously. (Considering the vast surface area of Greyspace's crystal sphere-8.04 x 1020 square miles (over 8 hundred million million million square miles)-this means that spontaneous gates are exceedingly difficult to find.

The frequency of spontaneous gates seems to follow an 11-year cycle. Every 11 years, for a period of two months, the number of spontaneous gates increases by a factor of ten. This still increases the number of simultaneously open gates to fewer than 250, however, so they remain very rare. In Greyspace,spontaneous gates remain open for up to half a day (2d6 hours). There are apocryphal stories that tell of spelljamming vessels smashed to flinders when spontaneous portals closed on them, but these tales have never been substantiated.

Spontaneous gates always open between stargems. Various sages posit dire consequences if a portal should open superimposed over a star-gempredictions ranging from a massive explosion to the destruction of the entire crystal sphere-but since this has never happened, the discussion remains meaningless.

Greyspace is thought to be a younger sphere than Realmspace. This is, sages believe, the reason why wildspace within the Greyspace sphere is cooler than that within Realmspace.It is nowhere near as cold as [[Krynnspace]], however. The temperature throughout Greyspace is relatively constant, except very close to [[Liga]]. It is an unchanging 40°F to 45°F-chilly, but far from unbearable. Travelers would be well advised to dress for the temperature, of course.Even though it is not cold enough to cause physical damage or pain, prolonged exposure can drain energy from even the doughtiest explorer.

Most of the major planets in the Greyspace system orbit in exactly the same plane. The only two exceptions are Ginsel and the [[Spectre]], both of which are inclined a couple of degrees to the ecliptic. This makes eclipses (in the cases of Kule and [[Raenei]]) and occultations or conjunctions (in the cases of the other planets) relatively common occurrences. Before the denizens of [[Oerth]] understood the true nature of their solar system, various schools of astrology sprang up, using arcane mathematics and even more outre theories to extract omens and predictions from the interactions of the heavenly bodies. Even after the true nature of the solar system became widely known,many of the more superstitious and gullible still clung to the old astrological ideas, consulting ludicrously complex charts for portents.

In most other crystal spheres, the length of a planet's year can be calculated exactly based on its distance from the sphere's primary. Such is not the case in Greyspace, unfortunately. For major planets, the length of year increases the further the planet is from [[Oerth]]; however, it does so in an unpredictable manner. Furthermore, there are certain minor astronomical bodies that disobey even this vague "law": some cometlike bodies that orbit in the dark spaces beyond the [[Spectre]] have years shorter than planets much closer to [[Oerth]]. Nobody has yet explained quite why this is. It does seem to imply that Greyspace is a highly unusual system, and that supposedly universal physical laws break down within [[Oerth]]'s crystal sphere. Wise starfarers keep this in mind and take precautions accordingly. If such a common relationship as the one between orbital radius and year length breaks down in Greyspace, what other universal laws might no longer hold?

**Physical characteristics**

The crystal sphere, Greyspace, like all planetary systems in the Spelljammer universe, is encased in a vast sphere of an indestructible substance. At 16 billion miles across, Greyspace's sphere is one of the largest known. From the outside it is as reflective as polished steel, and from a distance beautiful colors, like the iridescent hues in mother-of-pearl, can be discerned. From the inside it is night-black and completely nonreflective. It is, in fact, the night sky itself. It cannot be touched, exactly; it is perceivable only as a barrier beyond which nothing can go, except through portals opened magically into the chaos outside.

The "stars" that can be seen on clear nights are actually titanic gemstones somehow buried in the surface of the sphere. It has been surmised that they contain portals within them to the Positive Energy Plane or the Quasielemental Plane of Radiance, or that they were mined from the gods from the stuff of the Positive Energy Plane. The heat from them can only be felt from less than a hundred feet away (where it is deadly), but their light can be seen (obviously) for billions of miles. The constellations are described as occupying the midpoint between Law and Chaos; patterns can be discerned, but the greater order behind them, if any, seems elusive. Oerthly sages identify 12 Lairs of the Zodiac and have given names to many other constellations as well, such as the Druid, the Dancer of Swords, and the Swan.

**Wildspace**

The vacuum of space between the worlds and stars of Greyspace is cooler than that of Realmspace, but not as frigid as Krynnspace. It is almost always 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit, except close to the sun.

**Celestial bodies**

The major celestial bodies of Greyspace, from the center out, include:

**Oerth:** Terrestrial planet and home to the Greyhawk campaign setting.

**Celene:** Tidally-locked terrestrial body. Covered with the ruins of a humanoid civilization, but lacking any air whatsoever. A magical cataclysm is suspected to have caused the depopulation. Also known as Kule, one of Oerth's "moons."

**Raenei:** Terrestrial planet, covered with earthlike features, including animals and monsters, but no sentient life. Also known as Luna, one of Oerth's "moons."

**Liga, the Sun:** Star. Has many small lakes of elemental water to keep it from burning too hot. Larger than Oerth, but orbits it anyway.

**The Grinder:** Spherical asteroid belt.

**Edill:** Gas giant, populated primarily by dragons.

**Gnibile:** Dark-red gas giant, with blobs of lava and shards of ice in the interior. Contains a gate to the Negative Material Plane. Populated primarily by undead.

**Conatha:** Elliptical water world with two solid cores that orbit around each other. Populated by many piscine creatures, including merfolk and sahuagin.

**Ginsel:** Crescent-shaped world that resembles a sphere with a giant bite taken out of it. Has an atmosphere on the inside of the crescent. Basic civilized fantasy world.

**Borka:** Spherical asteroid cluster with a common atmosphere. Formerly a planet inhabited by orcs, goblins and other humanoids, it was devastated by the magic of the elves.

**Greela:** Another spherical asteroid cluster with a common atmosphere, although many of the asteroids bear huge forests. Home to elves.

**The Spectre:** A flat, circular disc of rock that appears to vanish and re-appear as it is seen edgewise, then rotates to show its full face. Also called The Wink. Has an atmosphere and water, but no life.

**Other features of Greyspace**

**The Sisters:** A constellation of nine star-like objects, resembling a single bright star from Oerth. They are surrounded by a region of reverse gravity and dead magic. Those who pass between them end up far removed in space or time.

**The Great Sargasso:** A region of dead magic a million miles in diameter.

**The Habitat:** A mile-long ellipsoid of some dark blue-gray metal (perhaps superficially resembling the far smaller artifact in the Pits of Azak-Zil).

**Dark Stars:** At least three objects similar to Spheres of Annihilation, but several miles in diameter.

**Other possible features of Greyspace**

Atropus, the World Born Dead, is a small moonlet that travels through space, erasing all life it encounters.

The Dragon's Tear comet, which appears in the sky every 27 years, opening the Vast Gate to the Far Realm with the enormous reserve of potential magical energy it builds up during its long interplanetary journey.

A fiery red comet heralds the approach of Ragnorra.

The Rock of Bral, a vast city-state located on a huge asteroid, is (optionally) located in The Grinder.

The floating castle of Sardior, which stays forever on the night side of the world away from the sun. On the nights it can be seen, it has been mistaken for a small red moon. Periodically it moves between planes.
