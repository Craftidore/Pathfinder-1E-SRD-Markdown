# Darkspire College of Thaun
## Description
The Dark spire College’s campus is built into the sides of three enormous hanging stalactites tapering down from the vaulted ceiling of a colossal underground cavern. Piercer, the largest stalactite, extends more than 300 feet down from the ceiling and has a base with a radius of 150 feet. It houses laboratories and libraries for each school of arcane magic, a concert hall, thirteen summoning chambers, two gymnasiums, the Desmodu Dormitory, and lecture halls. Each of the Fangs, the other two stalactites, is roughly two-thirds the size of the Piercer. They contain classrooms, studies, artists’ cupolae, and practice rooms. The northernmost Fang also features the Sunless Rose tavern and a warehouse. The warehouse stores goods in transit to and from the surface and other underground communities, and it sells surplus and goods gone unclaimed when a caravan doesn’t return. The warehouse has a 25% chance to have any given *Core Rulebook* item in stock and available at 150% of the price. The Piercer and the Fangs are connected by a network of rope bridges.

Faculty and students attend Darkspire to increase their arcane knowledge, and that is the stated goal of the organization.
