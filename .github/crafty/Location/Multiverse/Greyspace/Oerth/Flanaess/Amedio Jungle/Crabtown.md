# Crabtown
## Overview
Crabtown is built on the ruins of a town from an earlier era; a town successful and important enough to have warranted the construction of both a stone castle and bridge.

The town of Actia lay along a major trade route, with shipments of lumber, ore and food traversing its length. Unfortunately, this also made the town valuable. As is often the case, battles were fought over which petty tyrant could rule the area; the town fell in the third such battle, when hill giants powerful enough to break through Castle Actia’s walls and cripple the bridge, razed most of the town. Worse, the course of the war shifted the trade routes and, coupled with the loss of the bridge, Actia’s position as a trading centre was gone forever.

Trade is one thing, but people are creatures of habit, and the ruins of Actia still lay on a convenient and well‐travelled route, even if it was no longer as economically vital. Travellers still used Actia’s ruins as a way station and adventurers often stayed a night or two in the rubble of the town while exploring the castle. Eventually, the makeshift camps became a semi‐permanent settlement, which grew into an inn and a shop clustered around a small apple orchard that had escaped the devastation; from there, the small village of Arca grew from Actia’s ashes.

Arca, situated on the Crab River, quickly became known for the delicious and abundant fresh water crabs which inhabited the river above the collapsted bridge which with a bit of work was turned into a ford across the river. Below the ford, the crabs were quickly fished into obvilion and now they can only be found above it. The rivermen are careful in what they take from the river and the crabs remain abundant. Recognizing the economic momentum behind their crabs, Arca renamed itself Crabtown.

Nearly three decades ago, Crabtown’s fortunes changed again. One night, seven‐year‐old Marsa Daigle went missing from her family home. A search was organised and as the villagers hunted through the woods looking for the young girl, Marsa's father Loiker happened upon a bloated, violet humanoid clutching his child. Loiker prepared himself to face this terrible monster only to have the menacing creature set the child down and release her, hissing in guttural Common, "Needs honey."

The creature's strange response was enough to give Loiker a moment's pause; studying the creature, he slowly and carefully reached out and began examining his child, as the large purplish creature watched. A cursory examination revealed burn wounds, covering both of his daughter's lower arms. Looking at the creature for an explanation, it merely repeated, "Needs honey."

Over the next few weeks, the ettercap, M'yxtix, helped Loiker treat his daughter's burn wounds, and was a guest in the community. The villagers quickly became used to their strange guest and she adapted rapidly to "village life." Loiker Daigle and other townspeople asked M'yxtix countless questions about insects, drawing on the forest‐dweller's exceptional store of information about insects and arthropods. It was over repeated conversations that Loiker came to understand how exceptional honey is, and how easy it would be to gather with the ettercap's help.

Over the next few years, the village of Crabtown added an apiary and began raising bees and selling the honey, rapidly finding a wide untapped market for the sweet substance.

**NOTABLE LOCATIONS**

Most of the village comprises peasant homes. It should be noted that all dwellings with 100 feet of the river are elevated on stout pilings of river cypress (an extremely strong and rot resistant wood). These pilings are typically 6 ft above the ground and the construction is used to prevent flooding during the spring flood season. Also there are a few locations of note:

1. **Beekeeper’s Home & Studio:** Here, Casia tends Crabtown’s bees, and harvests their honey.

2. **Bee’s Knees Tavern**: The local inn and tavern.

3. **Bridge & Docks**: Here, children dive and swim in the river.

4. **Castle Actia**: An old ruined castle; M’yxtix’s home.

If the settlement’s size would not normally allow it to have magic items of a particular category, it always has at least one randomly chosen item of that category for sale. However, if a buyer rolls a natural one on any [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check made to examine or purchase a locally bought magic item, that item is always cursed.]

*family*: Amberale, Bottlecast, Gallinson, Multengrue, Portercast

## Locations
Below are descriptions of notable locations (along with any related NPCS) in Crabtown.

### Beekeeper's Home and Studio
**1: BEEKEEPER'S HOME and STUDIO**

*These two buildings are painted a light blue, as if to match the sky. They have open windows and their doors stand ajar. The scent of the place is almost unpleasantly sweet.*

The two buildings that sit alongside the beekeeping fields are kept by Casia Lornton (NG female human expert 2), the current beekeeper of Crabtown. Casia studied under Loiker Daigle (Area 6), before he retired, and M'yxtix the ettercap. She uses one of the buildings as her home, and the other for the processing of honey. In the early morning, Casia can always be found hard at work, gathering honeycomb, collecting and bottling honey and replacing any damaged panels or portions of the apiaries.

Characters with questions about beekeeping are directed to Casia, who answers questions patiently and pleasantly. She is also happy to show interested parties the apiaries (provided they don't seem untrustworthy and are genuinely interested).

Casia is a dark‐haired, bright‐eyed woman who looks to be in her early 30s. She always wears light‐coloured, long, snug clothing, and nearly always wears a beekeeper's hat and carries a smoker – a modified lantern that generates smoke to soothe bees. Casia moves and speaks slowly and with great deliberation, even when dealing with people. Occasionally, she talks to her bees as a parent talks to their children. 

Loiker (Area 6) can still be found here, helping out a few times a week. While he’s here, he often sneaks off a quantity of honey for himself to aid in perfecting the method of creating a Mellified Man (see “Mellified Man” for more information).

### The Bee's Knees Tavern
**2: THE BEE’S KNEES**

*The sign above the door features a cartoonish bee with a bright red and swollen stinger, clutching a tankard and smiling widely. Within, you hear music and laugher and smell wonderful scents.*

Marsa Daigle (NG female human expert 2), a plump and smiling woman, serves the drinks and food at the Bee’s Knees with a laugh and wink. The large ground floor of the tavern is heated and lit by a large hearth and surrounded by cosy booths of dark wood and soft, red leather.

Much of the food and drink at The Bee’s Knees includes honey, which also provides travellers with otherwise uncommon delicacies such as honey‐glazed hams, honey‐roasted peanuts, honey oat bread, and honey mead.

The Bee’s Knees has a simple fireside stage, suitable for a bard or minstrel to perform. Most evenings some local volunteers do their best on a lute or harp, and at least a few nights a week Marsa gives an admirable performance with her singing (generally, the bawdiest tavern‐song that comes to her mind at the time).


| **TARIFF** | **PRICE** |
|---|---|
| Meal | 5 sp |
| Wine, common (pitcher) | 2 sp |
| Mead (pint) | 5 cp |
| Stay (night) | 5 sp |

### The Bridge, Ford and Docks
**3: THE BRIDGE, FORD, & DOCKS**

The bridge that spanned the Crab River fell long ago, broken to gain a temporary respite in an ancient battle. The children of Crabtown now use the broken bridge as a diving platform, and sunken stones from the bridge are visible in the river and have been filled in with other stones to form a shallow ford. Those sailing on the river cannot pass over this stony underwater berm.

Curious characters looking into the construction of the bridge can make a DC 10 [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (stonemason) check or a DC 10 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check to determine that what’s left of the bridge (on either side) is stable and solidly constructed. Beating either DC by 5 or more reveals the bridge is almost 500 years old and that it was obviously collapsed deliberately.

Crossing the river without a boat must be done at the ford otherwise the character must swim (DC 10 Swim check) or use a boat. The villagers own a half‐dozen or so boats and will carry travellers across the river for a few coppers. Transporting animals or heavy goods is somewhat trickier and more time‐consuming and the ford must be used. Marsa, at the Bee’s Knees, owns a moderately large boat that can carry one horse or a small cart, although she’ll expect some compensation in return.

There is always a townsman sitting on the west side of the ford day and night. He is there to ensure no one is swept into the river as they cross and to collect 1 sp for each person, beast, and wagon or cart that crosses using the ford who is not a member of the town. This money is turned over to the mayor, Marsa Daigle (NG female human expert 2), who uses it to pay the ford watchman, make minor improvements around the town and put a small portion back in case of emergency.

### Castle Actia
**4: CASTLE ACTIA**

*The outer walls of this sprawling ancient castle have half-collapsed. Lichens and mosses are well established on the ruins and a strange, foreboding silence hangs over the place.*

The ruin of Castle Actia sits atop a small hill. There is a simple road up to the castle's (now fallen) gate, although it's become somewhat overgrown from disuse. A DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check, or a DC 15 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) check, notes a higher than typical number of spiders dwelling in the castle’s immediate surrounds.

The history of Castle Actia is now largely unknown to Crabtown’s inhabitants, although its fall is noted in histories of the area. Most villagers don’t visit the castle anymore, which they describe to travellers as a dull, boring place that decades of looting have stripped of anything interesting or valuable. This is partly true although the ruins – with stones slick from moisture and heavy walls that eliminate outside noise but produce eerie echoes – are ominous. Although bereft of valuables, however, the castle is far from abandoned.

M’yxtix (N\[E] female advanced old ettercap expert 2, a particularly strong, clever and resourceful ettercap, took up residence in the ruins some 23 years ago with the villagers’ approval and blessing. M’yxtix helped the villagers learn how to keep bees and harvest the honey and is a valued, if reclusive, member of the community.

A few adults – often including Casia and Loiker – visit M’yxtix every week or so, to speak with her about bees and the surrounding woods. Outsiders are not welcome at these meetings, unless Casia or Loiker vouches for them.

In the lower reaches of the abandoned castle is roughly carved tunnel that leads to a strange room.

One or more of the PCs may express an interest in acquring the rights to the ruins of Castle Actia. Should this be the case they must strike a deal with Findar Ralfson \[male human bard 3] a down on his luck street performer who is the last living heir of the Actia family. Years of hard living have taken their toll on him. He lives part of the time with his half-sister Torei, a widow of the arena, and her two small children. He spends part of each day attempting to make a few coins which he faithfully gives her half of. The other half goes towards keeping his addiction to devilweed fed. If Findar is approached while under the drug's influence he can be convinced with a DC 23 Diplomacy check to sign over his rights to the castle for a weekly payment of 125 gp for as long as he lives. The GM should note that this a questionable act, if not an actual evil one.

Should he be approached while not under the drug's influence the price is 2,000 gp a month with an additional payment of 5,000 gp every 3 months for 2 years.

Once the character(s) have title to the ruins, they must then strike a deal with the townsfolk regarding M’yxtix. This requires a DC 25 Diplomacy roll if she is to be allowed to continue to reside there or a DC 35 roll if she is to be relocated to somewhere close the apiaries.

The town records hall in Sasserine records that the castle and its environs cover an equal to a square (640 acres) with no access to the Crab river (though an enterprising character might be able to convince the citizens of Crabtown to allow them to cut a channel to the river. The annual taxes on the property AND castle come to 7,680 gp and these taxes are collected during the last week of Coldeven. 

No title is attached to the castle or its lands.

### General Store
**5: GENERAL STORE**

*A pleasant sweet and syrupy aroma wafts from this small shop.*

Toldreth Morl (NG male human expert \[apothecary] 1/wizard \[transmuter] 2), the owner of Crabtown's only shop, runs an organized and well‐stocked establishment. While there's only a limited selection of adventuring gear, there's everything anyone could need for village living. Toldreth does not order adventuring gear from [[Sasserine]], he has an arrangement with Dawtry Ringle and receives a percentage of any 'special' orders Ringle takes for such things.

The shop also has a selection of honeyed products available, including honey candies, honey on the comb and jars of honey. Toldreth is pleased by any opportunity to talk up the curative properties of the golden liquid, peddling it as something of a miracle cure for everything from minor skin irritations to lifethreatening injury, as well as its amazing preservative properties.

Toldreth is also something of a retired wizard; he makes much more of his very brief adventuring career than it really deserves. He has parlayed his minor talent for spellcraft into the manufacture of some alchemical items for sale in his shop, including alchemical honey (see “Alchemical Honey”).


| **ITEM** | **WEIGHT** | **PRICE** |
|---|---|---|
| Alchemical honey | 1/2 lb. | 100 gp |
| Honey candy | — | 1 cp |
| Honey (jar) | 1/2 lb. | 3 sp |
| Honey on the comb | — | 2 cp |

### Loiker's House
**6: LOIKER’S HOUSE**

*This tiny house is little more than a cottage.*

Loiker Daigle, father to Marsa and original beekeeper of Crabtown, lives in this simple cottage, close to his lifelong friend, M’yxtix. When his duties as beekeeper became too much for him, Loiker handed his duties over to Casia and steadied himself to face the long night of death. Long, late night conversations with M’yxtix have, however, recently given him pause to reconsider his options. In conversations with M’yxtix about death, the ettercap revealed that there is an alternative to passing uselessly into death, in which honey plays a vital role: she spoke of transformation into a mellified man. Loiker sees this as an opportunity to continue and extend his useful and productive “life” in the community. Knowing that many of his peers would be shocked at his plans, he has quietly begun working toward his goal and has begun stealing the requisite honey from Casia.

### The Crabshack
**7: THE CRABSHACK**

This large two-story building is made of the heavy well-seasoned heartwood of the river (Monctezuma) cypress. Here local rivermen sell the fruit of their traps; the freshwater river crabs which gives the town its name. Also the local lumberjacks float down the logs of river cypress and other rare trees where they are loaded onto one of the three river barges Dawtry Ringle operates between here and [[Sasserine]]. If the general store doesn't carry something, Toldreth Morl refers them here. Ringle can usually get most anything within a week.

The magical goods from the resettled ruins quality are sold from Ringle's warehouse and reflect his near monoply on first purchase rights from adventuring on and around the river as well as his knowledge of the strange room under the ruins of Castle Actia.

\[Resettled Ruins: Add +1d3 to the amount of magic items in any category the settlement’s size would allow it to normally offer. If the settlement’s size would not normally allow it to have magic items of a particular category, it always has at least one randomly chosen item of that category for sale. However, if a buyer rolls a natural one on any [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check made to examine or purchase a locally bought magic item, that item is always cursed.]

Ringle is a tough bargainer and has several magical tricks he uses to insure he gets the best bargain possible. He also is the only one in Crabtown with any real knowledge about the mysterious room beneath Castle Actia.

## Life in Crabtown
Life in Crabtown is much like life in any other small village, with the addition of several thousand honeybees.

The presence of the bees has a distinct effect on the residents’ clothing; villagers dress in light clothing that covers much of body, leaving minimal exposed skin, and tend to move about slowly, giving the bees time to get used to their movements. Even young children are cautious about running or roughhousing around the fields of flowers and the apiaries.

Further, along with the bees has come an abundance of honey. Honey is an excellent source of a number of things people need, as well as providing a more readily available treatment for illness and some types of injury. People in Crabtown tend to have better complexions, less scarring and be healthier than those from other similarly sized communities, although they are perhaps somewhat rounder in the midsection.

While harming the bees of Crabtown isn’t against any laws, it’s certainly frowned upon; the bees are allowed to fly anywhere in the village. Visitors using spells or abilities likely to harm a large number of bees find the residents of Crabtown become more cautious, reserved and hesitant due to their concern for the bees’ welfare.

**Honeybee Swarm**: Honeybees are essentially docile creatures; getting them to swarm is actually somewhat difficult; spraying the hives with water or grease, setting fire to several apiaries, kicking the apiaries over and so on creates a swarm.

## Events
**EVENTS**

While the PCs are in Crabtown, one or more of the below events may occur. Choose or determine randomly:

**D4 EVENT**

1 **Dance**: For dances in Crabtown, the ladies invite the gentlemen. Characters are welcome to attend, even without escorts. Attractive male characters are likely to be invited, and it would be rude to decline!

2 **Weddings**: Weddings in Crabtown are nearly always held out of doors, often with clouds of smoked (and thus docile) bees around as a living decoration or accompaniment. It’s considered exceptionally good fortune in the town if a bee should “feed” from the bridal bouquet.

3 **Bee Cleaning**: Every ten days or so, Casia pulls the apiaries apart for examination. Obviously, this irritates the bees to no end, so there’s often a large amount of smoke rising from her fields, and most villagers avoid the fields and try to stay indoors as much as possible; they suggest as much to visitors, if asked.

4 **Crabapple Harvest**: The local crabapple trees are well tended by Crabtown’s bees. Several times a year, the villagers head into the woods to gather crabapples. A weeks‐long flurry of pie eating and apple‐cider making follows.

5 **Baking Contest:** Baking contests are one of the highlights of life in Crabtown. Any outsiders are likely to be asked to serve as “neutral” judges, particularly those with an air of sophistication or fairness. The food is delicious, and virtually all includes honey in some capacity.

6 **Wild Beasts**: Every so often, an animal gets the scent of the apiaries and decide it’s worth coming close enough to investigate. Depending on the size and strength of the animal, their escapades in Crabtown range from amusing to terrifying. The villagers band together to hunt such animals, and might offer some (small) bounty on their capture to tempt outsiders to help.

## Whispers and Rumors
**WHISPERS & RUMOURS**

A PC can use [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] to gather information about Crabtown and its surroundings. This takes 1d4 hours and requires a DC 10 check. A character exceeding this check gains one additional rumour for each 5 points by which he exceeded DC 10. Use the table below to determine which rumour(s) the PC learns.

**D6 RUMORS**

1 “Casia has a real way with the bees! There are some folks that think she’s able to talk to them. I dunno where they’d get that crazy idea.”

2 “Did you know that there are only a few males in a bee colony? Females do all the work. I think there’s a lesson in that somewhere.”

3 “Maybe it’s just me, but I think there’s less honey coming out of the bees these days. Not a lot less, sure, but less; ever since Casia took over.”

4\* “Castle Actia? Teenagers sneak off there, from time to time, for a little privacy. Nothing much else there, nowadays.”

5\* "I reckon y'all heard that he rivermen are preparting strike until they get what they are now from Ringle for their crabs.'

6 "I heard that the spring storms are gonna be right bad this spring.'

**Special Actions** traps, web

**Web (Ex \[Standard, 8/day])** M’yxtix can use webs to support herself and up to one additional Medium creature. In addition, she can throw a webs at targets up to Large size up to 50 ft. (+8 ranged, range increment 10 ft.) in a similar fashion to a net. An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can escape with a DC 18 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check or burst the web with a DC 18 Strength check. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a –4 penalty. M’yxtix can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times her size. She usually positions these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must make a DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5‐foot‐square section of web has 4 hp and DR —/5. M’yxtix can easily move across her own web and can pinpoint any creature touching its web.

**Abilities** Str 15, Dex 18, Con 18, Int 12, Wis 21, Cha 14

**SQ** spider empathy (+9), traps

**Spider Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, but only works on spiders. M’yxtix gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing M’yxtix to train giant spiders and use them as guardians.

**Traps (Ex)** M’yxtix is skilled at crafting cunning traps with her webs, and doesn't require gold to build the traps, merely time. She does not use lethal traps, in her lair.

**Ettercap Noose:** *CR* 1; *Type* mechanical; [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] DC 20; [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] DC 20; *Trigger* location; *Reset* repair; *Effect* +15 CMB check (grapple).

**Feats** Ability Focus (web), [[Great Fortitude (Feat)|Great Fortitude]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]]

M’yxtix has dwelled in Crabtown for over two decades, in the ruins of Castle Actia.

**Background**: M’yxtix is a gifted member of her species, having killed her fellow broodmates (and her mother who tried to chase her from the nest). M’yxtix dwelled in the woods in comparative peace for years, before the fateful night when young Marsia Daigle ran into the night to play with fire. When M’yxtix came upon the injured child, she recognized that Marsia was immature, and that, if she were harmed, the other humans would hunt down her killer. Instead, M’yxtix made what seemed the obvious decision; to save the child. The decision that Loiker and the townspeople came to see as an inspired act of a kind soul was, in actuality, an act of self‐interest. Since then, M’yxtix has learned much about humans and has come to value her friendships with the villagers.

**Personality**: M’yxtix is similar to most ettercaps; an introvert, generally preferring solitude to the company of others. However, for an ettercap, M’yxtix is positively gregarious; other ettercaps would find her almost obnoxiously extroverted in tolerating interaction and conversation with others as often as every week.

M’yxtix may be a social creature, but she’s still savage and nearly as instinctual as she is intelligent. When frustrated or upset, M’yxtix struggles to control her primal, feral nature. Politeness and civility are crucial to M’yxtix; she requires a certain amount of routine when guests visit; first tea, small talk, whatever business there is to be done (over food), and then some brief parting pleasantries. She enjoys learning about human culture and habits, often asking highly specific and detailed questions about seemingly mundane details.

**Mannerisms**: M'yxtix is reaching the end of her life. Like an elderly human, she often moves slowly and reacts to things with caution instead of spontaneity. While talking, she makes quiet, clicking noises that sound not unlike a pair of knitting needles. M'yxtix is constantly attended by several pet spiders the size of dinner plates. She speaks to her pets (in Common, in front of guests) and compliments them on their behaviour, tolerating and reprimanding their actions (including climbing on guests) just as though they were more "common” pets.

**Distinguishing Features**: M’yxtix’s hue has dimmed considerably with age; her body is now lilac in colour. Her rounded, black eyes and mandibles effect a sinister appearance.

## Alchemical Honey
**ALCHEMICAL HONEY**

Conventional bee honey has many noteworthy properties, in addition to making even bland meals more palatable. It can been used to treat gastric disturbances, ulcers, sore throats, coughs, wounds and burns, being both an antiseptic and antibiotic. Using honey in this way is part of a normal [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check, although an ample supply of honey provides a +2 competence bonus on such checks. A DC 12 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) check or a DC 10 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check confirms these delightful properties, which are fairly common knowledge to woodsmen, herbalists and alchemists.

With alchemical treatment, though, honey can significantly magnify its healing properties. If this alchemical honey is ingested by a character afflicted by poison or disease, or spread on a poisoned wound or a diseased area, the alchemical honey bestows a +5 alchemical bonus to the next saving throw made within 1 hour to resist the poison’s or disease’s effects. A dose of alchemical honey costs 100 gp, and weighs half a pound.
