# Witchwarden Tower (Sasserine)
## Overview
**Type**: Point of Interest, Building, Guildhall
#Location/Point-of-Interest #Location/Building #Location/Guildhall

## Description
This large, imposing structure towers over its neighbors in the [[Noble District (Sasserine)|Noble District]] including Castle Teraknian. Seemingly built from a single piece of pale violet obsidian, the Witchwarden Tower was here before the founding of [[Sasserine]]. It rises 240 feet into the air and is 80 feet across at ground level. There are no doors or windows visible from the outside.

## Points of Interest
The obsidian walls are 5 feet thick. The entirety of the inner wall is circled (on all floors) by a staircase that spirals from the uppermost level to the lowest subterranean level. Stepping onto this staircase and beginning to walk either up or down causes the stair steps beneath move in the desired direction. 

The 'obsidian' that makes up the Witchwarden tower is actually a very rare form of [[Obdurium|obdurium]].

## Additional Details
Historically, the Witchwardens were 'Wardens of Witches' - spellcasters who, in more tumultuous times, banded together to protect their good name against those who would use magic destructively, so as to prevent stigma attaching to the profession as a whole and to preserve their own places in polite society. As they have become more of an accepted institution, particularly under the current stewardship of Witch [Lux Seoni](http://stap.wikidot.com/npc:lux-seoni), their role has slowly evolved towards 'Wardens who ARE Witches' - an organisation of mages that both monitors magical activity and act to protect Eleder as a whole. While they do not officially answer to the [Dawn Council](http://stap.wikidot.com/org:dawn-council), the two bodies tend to work toward similar ends more often than not. The Witchwardens volunteer a certain amount of time and magical power to the service of the [Council](http://stap.wikidot.com/org:dawn-council), and in return, they are permitted to govern their fellow mages as they see fit, outside the laws of the city. This arrangement is ripe for exploitation on the part of the Witchwardens, but while there is a certain amount of disquiet (particularly among non-member wizards and soap-box social reformers), as yet the Witchwardens have not abused their power so heinously as to motivate the [Dawn Council](http://stap.wikidot.com/org:dawn-council) to confront them over it.

The three sworn duties of the Witchwardens are as follows, in order of priority:
1) Protect [Eleder](http://stap.wikidot.com/loc:eleder) from the excesses of one's own magic.
2) Protect [Eleder](http://stap.wikidot.com/loc:eleder) from the excesses of others' magic.
3) Protect the position of mages in general as respected citizens of [Eleder](http://stap.wikidot.com/loc:eleder).

There are Four levels of Witchwarden membership:

Signatory

Expected to uphold the three above duties. Any mage entering Eleder is expected to register with the Witchwardens, and is given signatory membership. Dues are paid monthly. As a signatory an arcane caster is expected to follow the rules of the Witchwardens. Any breaking of these rules is handled by the Witchwardens themselves. Any member of the Witchwardens (signatory or otherwise) is expected to intervene in the event that another uses his magic inappropriately. In additon members of the Witchwardens are expected to assist the local authorities in any reasonably request.

Guild Mage

As a Guild Mage you are a full member of the Witchwardens, subject to the commands of the Wardens or the Witch. A Guild Mage is entiteled to quarters in Witchwarden Tower for a modest fee and may use the Tower's laboratories and libraries of arcane lore. In addition, once a Guild Mage has a proven track record is entitled to borrow magical items from the Tower's collection for short periods and specific purposes. Guild Mages are also entitled to seek tuition under the guidance of more powerful wizards. A Guild Mage must swear an oath of office that demands that the mage not owe allegiance or fealty to any other organization, so no Witchwarden of any rank may ever hold a position in the governing hierarchy of the city.

Warden

There are only ever five wardens at any given time. This is the ruling council of the Witchwardens and only the Witch's authority exceeds that of a Warden. In addition to commanding the Guild Mages as a whole, the Warden's also have the responsibility of acting as the counter weight to the Witch's authority. The Witch can be stripped of her rank and power by a majority vote of four out of five standing Wardens. In addition, no no serving or past Warden may be selected as a new Witch.

Witch

The head of the Witchwardens is the Witch, currently Lux Seoni, Lady Smokeheart. The Witch controls the policy of the guild in most areas. Her power is balanced by that of the Wardens. In the event that the current Witch dies, is displaced, or retires, the Warden's select a new Witch. Candidates are selected from among the most accomplished mages who have attained the highest circles of magic among the current membership.

Along with the title and political power, the office of the Witch and the Wardens come with the use of certain powerful magic items - the Witchknife, and the Warden's Hands respectively. Little is publicly known about these items, though it is widely believed that each of them allows the bearer to know the locations of all of the others at all times, among other, more deadly powers.

**Symbol:** A round disk bearing a circle of runes with eight daggers pointing toward the center. Each dagger represents one school of magic, each contributing to the greater cause. Members of the guild typically wear the symbol as a badge on their robes.
**Background, Goals, and Dreams:** Originally founded 600 years ago as a religious group dedicated to Wee Jas, the goddess of magic, death, and beauty, this guild has become much more secular over the years. Based in the Noble District, the Witchwarden Tower is the primary home of the guild. The 80-foot-tall tower houses numerous libraries, workshops, and meeting halls, all freely available to members, provided that they share their findings and knowledge with the guild. The Witchwardens prefer to keep an air of secrecy about them, requiring visitors to the tower to first make an appointment and restricting their access to the well-appointed meeting rooms on the first floor.
The first goal of the Witchwardens is the pursuit of arcane magic and members spend a great deal of their time researching new spells and recovering lost lore. The guild is also charged with the defense of the city against any magical threat. The current mistress of the guild, High Warden Lux Seoni (LN female human wizard 11) takes these responsibilities very seriously; constantly pushing guild members to strike out in new directions with passionate lectures and rallying them to the defense of the city in times of need.
