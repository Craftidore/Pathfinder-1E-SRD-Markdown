### Lidu family crest

Noble District has traditionally been thought of as the city’s ruling district, even though Castle Teraknian isn’t technically a part of this district. Yet [[Sasserine]]’s trust in its rulers has been shaken (see [[Sasserine]]’s History below), and nowhere is that loss of faith more evident than in this district. Today, the citizens of Noble District spend too much time bickering with those of [[Champion's District (Sasserine)|Champion’s District]] and trying to organize their district into a self-sustaining society. Idle talk of seceding from [[Sasserine]] is commonplace in Noble District bars. The other districts increasingly view the Noble District as a place of decadence and vanity, and eagerly await the district’s fall under its own excesses.

Noble District’s representative nobility is the Lidu family. With the end of the Teraknian family line over 100 years ago, the Lidus became the oldest noble family in the city. The family patriarch, Worrin Lidu, is a kind-hearted noble who may be too gentle and forgiving to succeed in [[Sasserine]] as a successful noble. His major concern today seems to be the reconciliation of the churches of Wee Jas and Kord.

**City Watch**

The Noble’s Watch are masters of subtlety. They do not patrol the streets of Noble District openly, as the local citizens have long since made clear their distaste for seeing guards in public places. As a result, the Noble’s Watch do their jobs undercover, posing as travelers, entertainers, merchants, or even petty nobles as the case demands. Newcomers to [[Sasserine]] seeking a place to ply criminal acts may be tempted by the seeming lack of guards in this district, but the Noble’s Watch wastes no time in dealing with crime as it appears. This, combined with the fact that anyone nearby could be the law, makes Noble District one of the safest in [[Sasserine]].

**Citizens**

If you’re from Noble District, you’re not necessarily the member of a minor noble house, although if you’re not, you probably have friends or associates who are. You may be from the middle class, in which case your family serves one of the noble families in some regard. Or your family could be involved in the arcanist scene, in which case you are no stranger to magic. Finally, you may be a student at the House of the Dragon, recently graduated (or worse, fl unked out) from higher education. Citizens of Noble District are clean, cultured, and eschew physical labor, preferring to hire muscle or use magic to take care of tough jobs. You likely worship Wee Jas. If you worship Kord, you keep your faith secret. If you’re a specialist wizard, you’ve probably chosen conjuration, enchantment, illusion, or necromancy as your field. Other specialist wizards are not unheard of, but those who opt to specialize as evokers or transmuters are o􀈘 en thought of as blowhards with something to proove.

## Notable NPCs
**CY 591**

**Nylaria Absalee** (human female): Nylaria, the manager of the [[Sasserine]] Opera House, is a huge woman who takes advantage of her ample frame to display outlandish dresses and hair styles. She fancies herself everyone’s friend, even though the feeling is not always mutual.

**Worrin Lidu** (human male): Lord of Lidu manor and representative of Noble District on the Dawn Council, many worry that Worrin has grown too so􀈘 in his advancing years to be an effective leader.

**Zebula Meravanchi** (human male): Zebula is a minor noble whose family’s interests run to the decadent and extreme ends of entertainment.

## Additional Details
**[[Sasserine]]’s History**

No district is more aware of [[Sasserine]]’s history than the citizens of Noble District. The city was founded over 700 years ago, in the year –124 CY by pilgrims from the north. This group was led by a visionary cleric of Wee Jas named [[Sasserine]] who died on the island now known as Ancestor Island in the heroic act of defending the pilgrims from a black dragon named Zelkarune. [[Sasserine]]’s lover, a man named Teraknian, founded the city in her honor. Over the next several centuries the city experienced phenomenal growth, during which a line of rulers descended from Teraknian ruled [[Sasserine]] in conjunction with advice from the churches of Wee Jas and Kord. In the year of 480 CY, Lord Mayor Orren Teraknian ruled the city—a rule that allowed for no shades of gray. For the first time in centuries, the church of Wee Jas was stripped of its power as fabricated charges of devil-worshiping saw to the arrest, imprisonment, and even execution of its faithful. Just as Orren’s rule became unbearable, a great fleet of ships arrived—representatives of the Hold of the Sea Princes to the north. Promising an end to Orren’s cruel rule, the invaders were aided in their assault on the city from within as the citizens rose up in rebellion. Orren Teraknian was overthrown and the Sea Princes claimed Sasserine as their own. Over the century to come, Sasserine’s resources were savaged. The Sea Princes kept Sasserine a secret from the rest of the world, hoping to hide the valuable port from invaders by destroying any references to it they could find. Spies infiltrated cartographer guilds and libraries throughout the world, altering maps and sea charts with magic. Ship captains who knew the route to the city were bought off or murdered. Sasserine suffered in these 100 years, but the underlying spirit of her citizens did not die. Their prayers were finally answered in 584 CY, when the Scarlet Brotherhood assassinated nearly all of the Sea Princes. The resulting turmoil threw Sasserine into chaos. Without the support of their homeland, the leaders of the city were overthrown in a fortnight. In the decade since their freedom, the people of Sasserine have rebuilt their city with astonishing success.
