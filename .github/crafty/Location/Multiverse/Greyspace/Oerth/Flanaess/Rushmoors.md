# Rushmoors
## History
The Rushmoors were the heart of the Occluded Empire of Vecna, until its abrupt fall circa -358 CY. Vecna's Rotted Tower once stood here.

## Ecology
In the western portion of the Rushmoors, farmers can be found farming the tall, thick grasses and draining the wetlands to create more farmland.

**Flora and fauna**

The moors are home to many creatures, otyughs, froghemoths and various types of large reptiles.

## Inhabitants
Lizardfolk and wandering bands of orcs roam the edges of the Rushmoors, while human farmers inhabit the western portion.

## Features and settlements
The Gran March city of Shiboleth is situated just east of the Rushmoors, along the [[Sheldomar River]], which skirts the southern boundary of the moors.
