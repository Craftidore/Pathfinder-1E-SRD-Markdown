# Sheldomar Valley
## Description
In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, the Sheldomar Valley refers to the large swath of fertile land in the southwestern [[Flanaess]], bordered by the Barrier Peaks to the north, Crystalmists and Hellfurnaces to the west, [[Azure Sea]] to the south and the Lortmils to the east.

The valley is named after the [[Sheldomar River]], which runs through a good portion of its length.

A number of nations make up the Sheldomar Valley, the largest being the Kingdom of Keoland. Other notable realms include Bissel, Geoff, the Gran March, the Hold of the Sea Princes, the Ulek States, the Valley of the Mage and the Yeomanry.
