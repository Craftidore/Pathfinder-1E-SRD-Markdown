# Midgard
## Overview
### C01: Overview and History
A Dark World of Deep Magic

Over time, our worlds change. That’s one of the hardest things to realize about a campaign setting, because when we start a new game, it all seems fairly clear. Heroes over here, villains over there, they fight, players laugh and shudder and make good decisions and terrible choices. Sometime later, the world... proves stranger we thought. Unanticipated volcanoes erupt, or cultists infiltrate peaceful villages, or demonic invasions succeed in tearing down an impregnable citadel.

What happens when player actions change what we thought we knew? Temples rise. Evil necromancers die their final death. Someone needs to draw new borders on the campaign map, and turn a few city markers into ruins (or vice versa).

In the first edition of [[Midgard]] (called the Campaign Setting) in 2012, we promised to stack high conflicts, create a living world, and determine if the spirit and essential themes of the world could include change, decay, and rebirth. Here we are, five years later (and ten years in game time), and all that has come true. The nations of [[Midgard]] have fought, some have fallen apart, and new nations are being born. Borders have shifted, and a new mayor has taken office in [[Zobeck]], as is tradition. Despite a great deal of change and heroic adventure, the heart of Midgard is unchanged—or truth to tell, has grown more interesting, richer in its strangeness, stronger in its [[Ley Lines and Shadow Roads|ley lines]] and its magic.

Our dreams may change, but they are still our dreams and our worlds, and so they still reflect the drive that stirred us to create this world in the first place. The shadow roads are still open, though now [[Ch. 11 - The Shadow Realm|the Shadow Realm]] is easier to explore. The deep magic is still calling, though its ley lines are now more clearly mapped.

I think change and growth and expansion of a world is one of its greatest joys. Go forth, and discover with your own eyes new lands and borders, which rulers yet live or have been deposed, and what plots have been foiled or grown in the passing of time. Midgard awaits you, deeper and wider and more fantastical than before.

*Onward!*
