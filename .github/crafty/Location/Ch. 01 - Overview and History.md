**THE WORLD MADE NEW** 

The age of heroes is dead, and the bridge to glory is broken—Bifrost fell long ago. The world is lost in an age of war, of dark wilderness and lost empires sunk beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth of hope keep lights aglow when dread things prowl and the priestly wardings shake, bent by hideous otherworldly rage. In this dark time, heroes must arise to claim the crowns of Midgard and restore the jewels to her scattered thrones. New heroes must lead a return to glory!

## Seven Secrets of Midgard
**SEVEN SECRETS OF MIDGARD**

At first glance the Midgard campaign setting might seem familiar, flavored with a strong dose of European and Middle Eastern mythos, a medieval level of technology, and races taken directly from the greatest fantasy traditions. Dig a little deeper, and you’ll find some surprising twists that take Midgard from standard fantasy to exceptional vision. These seven foundational mysteries provide a quick summary for the game master (GM) who wants to plan out a short campaign or a long arc.

**A Flat World**

The flat world of Midgard floats in a vast space of living stars. The heavens are accessible to great heroes who dare to visit them, by climbing a tower into the heavens or sailing to enormous heights on [[Outer Dragon, Void (Bestiary 4)|Void dragon]] wings. A great serpent surrounds the world, or so claim those few travelers who have been to the edge of the world. What lives underneath? No one knows for sure. Midgard is not a modern world dressed up in a few medieval bits of armor and weaponry. Midgard makes the mythic real, with a world to explore from edge to edge.

**Elemental Dragon Lords**

The dragons of Midgard correlate to the elements rather than to colors and metals (though all the traditional dragons are present). They obey an urge to power and rulership, and they exercise that rule through an entire empire that carries their name. All dragons seek to rule their provinces and to carve out power, the better to amass treasures. As their willing servants, dragonborn, [[Kobold (Bestiary PF1)|kobolds]], and drakes are rewarded with lands and wealth of their own. The dragons of Midgard have no interest in sitting in a lonely cave, counting coins. Their greed makes them ambitious, and that ambition makes them extremely dangerous. They do not wait for their fate to visit them, but instead they climb aloft and survey the land, knowing it is all theirs for the taking if their claws are strong enough to hold it.

**Gods That Dabble and Plot**

The Midgard pantheon has needs, and the urge to meddle. The gods dispense spells and miracles to their faithful, but they make clear demands of their worshippers and priesthoods. The gods also argue, sire children to rule kingdoms, and foment wars and feuds. Divine murder and enslavement are possible, and this is part of the reason why the gods of Midgard wear masks (see chapter 12). Their hatreds and rivalries spill out from the heavens and into the mortal streets and kingdoms.

Every deity has distinct goals and desires, and they specify what they expect of their followers.

**Hidden Races**

The Midgard campaign features the traditional humans, elves, and dwarves as well as new races, including the ravenfolk, minotaurs, kobolds, dragonborn, and trollkin. These races had a place in the world from the start, their ambitions leading to the founding of unique kingdoms. Concealed races still hide in the corners of the world to surprise players, such as the intelligent, ghoulish darakhul, the feral catfolk of the Southlands, and the mysterious winterfolk. Humans are the most numerous people and their kingdoms are grand, but Midgard offers many flavors of nations and a wide range of heroes and villains.

**Ley Lines and Shadow Roads**

The land is alive with ley line magic, and some know how to harness that power for spellcasting and magical travel. The elves used the magic of ley lines (see "Ley Lines" on page 38) to create and sustain the shadow roads (also called the fey roads), making it possible to connect a far-flung empire. When the elves retreated from the world, their roads remained, and humans and the shadow fey learned to tap into the ley lines that sustain this magic. Player characters and villains alike can use these wellsprings of power, which flow invisibly everywhere— though the most powerful ley line conjunctions are warded or guarded, used as the foundation of great fortresses or thriving cities. In Midgard, you can increase the level of magical power to unheard-of levels, without destroying the reality of the setting outside those ley line conjunctions.

**Shifting Borders and Falling Kingdoms**

Midgard is a world of cultures designed to change, collapse, and grow over time—and in this new edition of the setting, some of those changes have come to pass. Borders have shifted, crowns have been seized or restored, and cities have been plundered or rescued from ruin. Midgard is a setting intended to change after every adventure; the work of the heroes in Midgard challenges the existing order, gives rise to great new lords and ladies, or sees the failure of hope and the death of kings. The results of some of the last five years of play and development have been integrated into the world, both in Zobeck and farther afield.

There’s no point to playing a game where nothing changes but the statistics on a player’s sheet. As GM, you can and should take advantage of the inherently unbalanced politics or dangerous triggers built into the setting. Those ancient curses and festering revolts are there for your campaign. Find out whether your players have what it takes to change things—for better or worse!

**Time Flies, and Status Matters**

Two optional rules make Midgard special. The Status rule (see "Optional Rule: Status" on page 25) gives player characters a type of advancement linked not to level, but to difference in who they can visit and how they are treated—not that important in most dungeons, but possibly vital in the Court of the Imperatrix of Dornig, or when trying to counter a Dragon Empire ambassador’s plots.

Similarly, the Time Flies optional rule advances campaigns quickly, so that months and years can fly by, and events of a campaign roll out at a less hurried pace. Generations can rise and fall, and adventurers can see their careers as a long arc rather than a brief set of fireworks.

**Time Flies Campaigns**

The Time Flies rule states that during a campaign, the timeline always advances between game sessions by a period of not less than twice the real-world time that has passed. If it has been a week since you last played, then two weeks passed in the game world; if it has been a month, then two months have passed. Just add the time to the game’s calendar, noting that it includes rest and recovery time or downtime or heroes‑on‑vacation time If the group is in a dungeon or on a highly time‑sensitive mission, apply the additional time once they return to a suitable location.

For campaigns that seek to emulate the storytelling rhythm of a long-form saga, consider increasing this modifier to at least two months of game time between sessions. As a result, characters can age at a noticeable rate (six game sessions equal one year of game time), and generational effects become more pronounced. In addition, this prevents the chronological oddity of heroes going from novice to archmage in only a year or two.

## Stories of the Great Races
**STORIES OF THE GREAT RACES**

With those points in mind, let us draw back the curtain on the world and its people. It is a place of great danger and a few flickering lights, holding out against a tide of darkness that threatens to engulf all lands in a new age of horrors and barbarism. Midgard is a place in need of help, where a few stout hearts can turn the tide, or a few bad decisions can plunge a kingdom or an empire into bloody ruin.

Let’s start at the beginning with the creation of the world, as told by several of its great races, the dragons, giants, dwarves, elves, and humans.

All races agree the world is flat, with a single sun, one major moon, and six planets. Beyond these facts, the details of Midgard’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Almost all the gods and giants and other powers claim to have created the world. Some of them must be lying, and likely all of them are. The most common tale is that of the Northlanders who say that in the beginning, before Midgard was created, there was only the endless Void called Ginnungagap. At one extremity of this vast abyss was biting cold; at the other, raging fire. How did the Void become the world? That is a matter of theology, arcane ponderings, and bardic mysteries.

### Out of the Void Came Dragons
**Out of the Void Came Dragons**

The dragons claim that they are all directly descended from the stars, and that their wings once brought them (and their favored servants) through the endless darkness to stony realms of iron, gold, and ice. Though their song, the endless toil of blood mages, and the carvings of the earth dragons, in time the followers of Khespotan bound together enough mountains to create a small world, which was ruled by Veles, the Father of the Void, and his servants, the true dragons.

Over time, the other races have forgotten that the world is the work of Veles and Khespotan, of iron and blood merged with fire, air, and water, and that the world of Midgard was always meant as a realm for dragons to nest, to secure their hoards, and to rule the lesser races. But as any fool—scaly or not—can see, all gold and all jewels and all wealth rightfully belong to the dragons and their kin, for they pulled it from the Void and bound it into the world.

And yet the dragons also claim the world ends every so often, in fire and ruin, and is reborn stronger and scalier. When the time approaches, the dragon prows on longships will come alive and speak praise of Veles. The statues of Khespotan will stir and pronounce the final prophecies, and everywhere true dragons will let ring the call to rise and serve! Exactly how the world is reborn after such destruction is in dispute, but all the many dragonkin are sure the renewal turns to their favor. An end time is always near, and a rebirth likewise just over the next rise, for the world was made by, for, and under the claws of dragons, and all other races are pale imitations of the true folk.

**Void Speakers**

Even some of the lesser races can sense the Void and its ancient power. Those few souls are drawn to the Void, to death and power and an entirely false sense of controlling fate. These are the Void Speakers, who see the strands of Fate and sometimes warp them. Many are of the scaly races who know their role in creating and dissolving the world, though others also welcome the darkness from which all life came. The Void welcomes them all back into its embrace.

The Void Speakers are often warped or driven mad by their proximity to power, and yet they are unified in their dark beliefs. Void Speakers share a common language, said to be the language of the dragons at the dawn times (see "Void Speech" on page 231).

### Giants' Creation from Blood and Bone
**Giants’ Creation from Blood and Bone**

Giants tell a different tale of the earliest eras. Life sprang up in the center of the Void where rime met flame, melting and boiling. This was Aurgelmir, the first and greatest giant, from whose body both the earth and sky were crafted. Creatures sprang from Aurgelmir like branches on an oak, among them the first giants and the eldest of the gods, who fought on dragonback against the giants. The two groups warred, and when Aurgelmir sided with his giant kin, the gods slew him.

The giants have never forgotten this murder. Since that day they’ve nursed a grudge and hope one day to see the gods’ dominion ended and their forefather avenged. Loki always stands ready to remind them of the offense, and Boreas whispers of the glories of battle. Most of the dark gods find the giants’ grudges most convenient to this day.

The gods, meanwhile, fashioned the world from Aurgelmir’s corpse. His bones became the earth and his blood flowed out to fill the rivers and seas. From his teeth they fashioned mountains and his hollow skull became the sky. With giants cowed by the cleaving of Aurgelmir, the gods explored their new-forged world and soon they fell to strife among themselves.

The gods of nature and the gods of passion and glory formed factions and fought for dominion over their new realm of Midgard, and Creation trembled with the blows they struck. Eventually canny Wotan, always wise and victorious, brokered a truce. The gods exchanged hostages and peace descended once more.

Smaller races took their place in the world, and the gods watched. As far as the giants are concerned, they are still the true inheritors of the world and its treasures.

### Rise of the Dwarves
**Rise of the Dwarves**

During the conflict between gods called the Vanir War, the smith god Volund and the thunder god Thor created the dwarves. Warriors forged on an adamantine anvil, the dwarves were intended to counter the wild elves of Thorn in battle, who sided against Wotan’s forces with the giants, the fey, and the wilderness gods Freyr and Freja, among others. Fearless warriors and giant slayers, the dwarves achieved great deeds in the name of their patrons. Legions fell beneath their glittering axes and the dwarves became proud, believing themselves the greatest of all mortal races. Perhaps this was their undoing.

No mortal knows for certain what caused the Reaving, as dwarves call the fall of their mighty Northern civilization. Many believe they began to favor Volund over Thor, delighting in craftsmanship rather than warfare, and the Thunderer was filled with wrath and smashed their mountain kingdoms into the sea. Others claim that it was treachery from beneath the earth, an alliance of dead souls slain by dwarven axes and the defeated yet vengeful fey, who infiltrated their halls and brought them low from within. Early reaver dwarves claimed that elves were responsible, and they immediately went to war with their old enemies. Grove by grove, mile by bloody mile, they drove the elves and their allies out the North. Most fled to the West, across the sea.

Centuries later, after the fall of the elven empire (see below), dwarven followers of Volund continued the push farther southward, where they made a new home in the Ironcrag Mountains and the smith god became their preeminent deity. Those in the North stayed faithful to their dual heritage, however. They remain fierce warriors, slayers of elves, giants, and trolls, the proud and vengeful clans forever dreaming of a time when they can reclaim their fallen empire.

### The Land of the God-Kings
**The Land of the God-Kings**

The tales that the ancient Nurians wrote down and passed to their progeny make it clear that this oldest kingdom of Midgard is over 5,000 years old. It began along the banks of the River Nuria, where seven human families gathered at the end of a long journey. The stories vary on whether they were fleeing an ancient evil, fell victim to collapsed mystic portals, or were following some mystic portent. But all agree that, as the travelers rested on the riverbank, a wizard among them noticed a unique arcane energy within the water. After drinking, the wizard realized that he could touch the local ley lines, the mystical streams of magic flowing across Midgard. Taking charge of the seven families, the wizard declared that the river would be called Nuria, which meant “luminous” in the families’ native tongue. He ordered their new city to be built upon its sandy banks.

Down a long line of succession, the wizard-kings and sorcerer-queens of Nuria experimented with ley lines and the river’s magical water. They extended and prolonged their lives until they unlocked a kind of semi-divinity. Further, they developed the rituals needed to awaken from the slumber of death should their descendants need aid. Since then, the Nurians have regularly called upon their sleeping god-kings and god-queens for protection. Along with the major gods of the Nurian pantheon, these ancient rulers have watched over their kingdom since before the time of the titans, from the days of Ankeshel to the present day.

Now, Nuria Natal is one of the greatest—and certainly one of the oldest—kingdoms of the Southlands. It has waxed under wise leadership and waned during times of folly and collapse. But a new dynasty always arises to ensure that the legacy of the early god-kings never vanishes entirely. At present, Nuria Natal is in a period of growth, though it has not yet reclaimed some lands it once ruled, such as Ishadia, Kush, Makuria, and Siwal. The present king, Thutmoses XXIII, has his hands full fending off the dragons of the Mharoti Empire and strengthening trade and diplomatic ties with Capleon and Kyprion.

### Rise and Fall of Ankeshel
**Rise and Fall of Ankeshel**

In those ancient days, humans mastered magic and alchemy, engineering, navigation, and many other useful arts. They were citizens of Ankesh, an island in the Western Ocean blessed with rich deposits of copper, iron, and orichalcum. These humans built great cities, slew aboleths with vril rifles and lightning spears, traveled in flying carriages, and built orichalcum temples of shining gold. It was a golden age that lasted long centuries, perhaps a thousand years. Some believe the aboleths destroyed the island nation in the end. Others believe it was different horrors—krakespawn, the shining children of Caelmarath, the titanic servants of the sea god Nethus, or the arrival of the sea-devil sahuagin—that overran the walls of Ankesh and drove its people into the sea. Some blame the monstrous leviathan called the Isonade, which rose to destroy the western lands in a later age.

When Ankesh fell 3,000 years ago, all contact with the island was lost. The world sank into barbarism for centuries; the coasts were places of terror and avoided by the wise. The dwarves ruled in the North, humans and others struggled on the mainland, and goblins, gnolls, ghouls, ogres, centaurs, and other brutal races thrived. Nuria Natal remained as the only human kingdom of any size and power, its dynasties threatened but unbroken. 

Elsewhere, chieftains and petty kings held power for a generation, then fell back into chaos and struggle against the darkness. The light and knowledge of the world glimmered and went out.

### Arrival of the Elves
**Arrival of the Elves**

Roughly 2,200 years ago, the second great nation of elves arrived through mystic roads from the Summer Lands on the outskirts of the Arbonesse Forest. Unlike those who fought the dwarves and the Northern gods, these elves settled farther south, and their magic and archery was supported by powerful bonds of magic, oaths to their fey queens and kings, and a knack for securing the vassalage of other races. These Valeran elves slowly built their empire from the Western Ocean all the way to the Ruby Sea, ruling the humans, gnomes, halflings, and others who saw in the elves a restored hope for civilization. Their cities were tall, their magic powerful, and their mastery of living things, art, magic, and swift travel gave them a powerful advantage. They swept all other nations before them and built cities in the high places and the forests. They planted the seeds of the World Tree far and wide and pushed dark terrors away from the shadow roads, making them bright passages from one haven to another. The more distant regions were all connected to the elven centers of civilization by the fey roads, magical routes that compressed journeys of weeks or months into mere days or hours.

The elves ruled over at least five centers of culture and imperial power over the span of their 1,300-year reign, each corresponding to a different king or queen: first in the planeshifted and hidden River Court of the Arbonesse under the Emperor Xindrical the Explorer, then the eastern hub of Sephaya on the Ruby Sea under Queen Shillesh Greensun Sephaya, the Daughter of Yarila, and her children who built the Summer Gardens of Gennecka. The empire briefly lingered at the High Court of Liadmura in the Ironcrags where the Eagle Emperor ruled, in a time of conquests. The empire then centered for the longest time in the great capital of Thorn under the High Queen Lelliana Thorntree Endiamon, and her daughter the Shadow Princess Sarastra—mother of the shadow fey bloodlines, driven into exile in the Shadow Realm. Finally, when Thorn fell, the capital rested in the southern metropolis of Valera.

The elves considerably influenced the humans in the magocracies of Caelmarath, especially Allain, Bourgund, and Vael Turog, who learned the arcane arts in the elven style before they created their own. Some believe Parszan and the Margreve Forest also held large elven enclaves, but if so the details are lost—only a certain elegance to their towers, green thrumming ley lines, and overgrown groves attest to their time there.

Those few foolish nations that opposed the might of the elves were quickly brought to heel by a combination of elven might at arms (primarily their swift archers and light cavalry) and elven magic (which, it is said, could bewitch entire armies). The histories of this period are few, but clear in their deep regard (some might say terror) of the elven war machine, and the “sacrifices to Valeresh” that elven armies sometimes made of opposing officers and generals. The elves wiped out entire noble families, officer ranks, and royals who opposed them or rebelled against them.

### The Young Kingdoms
**The Young Kingdoms**

Sheltering under elven wings, various human magocracies and kingdoms arose starting around 1,800 years ago. Each pursued its own path outside the elven lands. Most are still remembered, but few survive to the present day.

As the human kingdoms grew to prominence on the outskirts of the elven lands, in mountains and plains where the elves elected not to rule, their strength, pride, and daring grew likewise. The secret societies of Caelmarath and Vael Turog began as human guilds within the Elven Empire, and they considered themselves apart and above elven rule. Although they resented elven authority, they profited from its arcane knowledge and experimented with magic the elves considered dangerous. The societies created their own lords, titles, tithes, and loyalties. The elves attempted to subvert them, but they proved difficult to dissuade through either reason or force.

The Mountain Kingdom of Morgau, Electoral Kingdom of Krakova, the Great Kingdom of Illyria, and the Sun Kingdom of Cassilon were founded early on, as were certain small city-states such as Achillon and Zobeck. Cassilon crowned its first human king in the south 1,739 years ago. Illyrian bloodlines go back to around 1,600 years ago, the Krakovan nobility built their first castle and throne about 900 years ago, and Morgau was settled 800 years ago, all on the edges of wilderness never explored or developed by the elves. These traditional kingdoms created cities, castles, and great monuments in their regions of the world. The elves considered these realms interesting but not threatening. Morgau and Krakova fought over their borders, but the other human kingdoms kept busy securing their territories. Cassilon befriended the desert giants and storm giants, and together humans and giants built great cyclopean fortresses in the Pytonne Mountains, fearing elven encroachments that never came.

The Moon Kingdom of Roshgazi, led by the minotaurs of the South, thrived and sent forth colonies throughout the middle sea to Kyprion and Corremel and Capleon, settlements still influenced the Moon Kingdom’s faith and people. Roshgazi’s Labyrinth was famous throughout the world, said to rival the works of the elves.

The last of the Young Kingdoms was the Magdar Kingdom, settled 732 years ago by a Rothenian tribe of human riders from the east. The riders saw the elven spires of Sephaya, and their king decided that this was a good place to trade. The Magdar quickly made war on both Illyria and Morgau—and the elves paid little attention. The Magdar built cities throughout the plain east of the Ironcrags, and their kings were more interested in piling up castles than wooing the elves. Though the noble families of the Magdar initially learned magic from the elves, they gave it their own cast.

In time, the Young Kingdoms profited greatly from trade and knowledge brought from the west, and they also brought great wealth to the Elven Empire through their sheer number and fecundity. As they grew stronger, some humans resented the elder race, and this led to “elf hunts” and laws proscribing where the elves might live and trade within human lands. The two races grew less tolerant of one another, while the dwarves stood by and laughed.

### Black Sorceress's Revolt
**Black Sorceress’s Revolt**

Roughly 800 years ago, the tieflings and humans of Caelmarath society revolted against elven rule in the First Great Revolt, often referred to as the Black Sorceress’s Revolt after Melathea Stross, the sorceress who led the uprising. The elves brutally suppressed the revolt but the wizards carried on in secret, summoning fiendish allies and corrupting the fey roads. They carved out their lands in opposition to the elves by using dark powers. The revolt burned out within 20 years, between arcane cataclysm and the Dread Walkers and madness, but not before humans seized control of Maillon and Bourgund and built arcane strongholds at Vael Turog and at Bemmea. A strange wise woman named Baba Yaga—long known in the east—offered her services to the rebellion, calling up fortress walls overnight, unbinding elven wards, and releasing demons by the score.

The elves sought to limit the damage, but the human willingness to call on dark powers combined with the tremendous human advantage in numbers was difficult to withstand across an empire spread thinly from the Western Ocean to the Ruby Sea. The elves soon became entangled in a hopeless struggle that threatened to corrupt their hidden lands. The elves feared human contamination of the elven homeland, and for good reason. Demons, devils, and horrors could easily walk the fey roads if elven vigilance slipped, or if an elf gave in to darkness.

The records of the period say the fey roads and the Elflands became magically corrupted. The elves who became the shadow fey threw in their lot with the dark powers that the mages of Caelmarath summoned and sent against each other. The shadow elves taught even more foul magic to certain human and tiefling families, such as House Stross, House Neckart, and House Galbrion, among others. Their hideous servitor-demons were the shining children of Caelmarath, as well as the elder Dread Walkers whose strength grew as the portals between worlds were disrupted and expanded. Though the shadow elves were corrupt, most elves remained on the side of light, and they found the growing fusion of magical and mortal realms abhorrent and vile.

### The Great Retreat
**The Great Retreat**

At last the elves decided not to join the mages of Caelmarath in their infernal descent into ever-greater madness. The elven roads shut down; the fey method of transport suddenly disappeared, and the legions marched out from Thorn and Valera for the last time, banners flying, to distant lands far from the reach of men. Those who believe the elves marched to war say they fought a great battle in the Realms Beyond to undo the evils of the wizards of Vael Turog, House Galbrion, and the other diabolists. Others believe that the elves merely prevented further summoning, and reestablished the borders of the Elflands on the far side of Midgard.

During the Great Retreat 482 years ago, the elves withdrew from the mortal world and went back to the Elflands. The elves have never explained their decision to leave the world, and those who question them get no answers. They abandoned their empire within a week, and houses and roads alike stood empty. The elven songs stilled, their towers gathered spider webs, and they stripped courts and halls bare of all readily portable goods. The dwarves and humans stepped in as masters of the empty realms, but the high civilization of Thorn, Valera, Liadmura, and Sephaya was gone. Only the River Court of Arbonesse remained as an elven stronghold, closed to all outside contact. The elfmarked were abandoned by their parents, forced to make their way in a newly hostile world. Servitor races such as the gnomes and halflings were suddenly free of the obligations and protections of their elven overlords. The gnomes fled the elven halls, while the halflings found new masters, or at least new friends, in the small human realms.

The races that paid obeisance to elves were suddenly free to run their own affairs, but the first years after the Retreat saw a riot of confusion and change. The reaver dwarves marched south through Krakova to seize the rich mines around Liadmura, creating the first of the Ironcrag cantons. A new human kingdom emerged during this time, when the god Perun founded a matriarchal kingdom near the ruins of Sephaya.

The victory of Caelmarath was complete, having won human independence and total freedom from elven interference. But Caelmarath could not control the powers it had unleashed, and its last gasp followed soon after. The warring mages could not agree on who led them or whose summonings were greatest, and they started to clash among themselves once the common enemy was gone. This conflict led to the period called the Great Mage Wars (see chapter 8). The rampage of the Dread Walkers, the Isonade’s sinking of the western Arbonesse, and the eldritch devastation of the war forever changed the landscape of the West.

### Rise of the Imperial Dragons
**Rise of the Imperial Dragons**

Over 300 years ago, the dragons of the Dragoncoil Mountains decided that raiding villages was a pleasant pastime, but the subsequent incidence of human, minotaur, and gnollish incursions into their territory was growing alarming. It was time, they decided, to found a kingdom of their own. After years of discussion and negotiation among their children, the kobolds, and the dragonkin, the dragons swore a compact that they would allow a human to rule and administer the land, as long as a tithe and tribute was paid to the dragons every 10 years. In return, the dragons swore to fight together to destroy any army arrayed against them, or to send the “children of draconic blood” in their place—meaning, legions of kobolds and dragonkin.

This was the founding of the Mharoti (Mah-ROW-tee) Sultanate, in which humans, kobolds, and dragonkin successfully seized all the lands of the eastern elves from Sephaya to Nuria Natal. They plundered far afield, demanding tribute from the Ruby Despot and the Daughters of Perun as well as the Southern realms of gold and salt. They took much of the land that was once the Kingdom of Illyria and the far eastern realms of Khandiria and Beldestan. They seized land near the Dragoncoil Mountains, and even reached beyond Nuria Natal to destroy two coastal cities of the minotaurs, Roshgazi and Cindass, ending the so-called Moon Kingdom period. The minotaurs of Cindass resettled in Capleon and Kyprion, but in Roshgazi the devastation was so great that the people sought more distant sanctuary. These Roshgazi minotaurs boarded a great fleet of ships and sailed west, and they were never seen again. The Lost Fleet of Roshgazi remains one of the mysteries of the early Mharoti Empire. The Nurian counterattack against the Mharoti coastal invaders drove the dragonfolk back in one of relatively few major defeats.

The dragons learned from those mistakes, yet still they lust for gold. To that end, each year the sultan or sultana leads the armies into the field in search of gold and silver to make up the next tribute to the dragons of the realm. These dragon-generals have grown to more than 20 in number, and each considers itself a master of earth and sky. The Mharoti Sultanate grows as they do, and its people are certain their destiny is to rule the earth as the elves once did. Their greed is great, and their ability to make war and conquer lands seems unstoppable.

### A Prince of Morgau
**A Prince of Morgau**

About 310 years ago, the vampire Prince Lucan arrived in Morgau and ingratiated himself with the king of Morgau, then seized the throne. He infected the children of his bloodline with undeath and adopted the faith of the Red Goddess. After his ascendance, he was nearly driven from the throne by the combined armies of Krakova, Doresh, and the Magdar Kingdom. However, his undead strength and persistence gave Prince Lucan an edge, the ability to return again and again and convert his enemies to his side. Furthermore, he made a second alliance, this one with intelligent and organized ghouls. The next attempt to drive him from his throne was a complete rout, with Morgau’s army killing (and devouring) the cream of Krakovan and Magdar nobility on the Field of Salesh.

Within 50 years, Lucan conquered Doresh, but the dwarves of the Ironcrags took Grisal before he could capture that as well. The vampire lords’ undead power and devotion to the Red Goddess make them extremely dangerous, but they fight among themselves more often than with their neighbors. As they have grown more numerous, it becomes harder for them to feed their ghoulish allies. The newly taken Krakova remains a precarious conquest, but a very rich one. They are surrounded by enemies: Baba Yaga, the amazons of Perunalia, and the kings of neighboring kingdoms maintain a working alliance against the undead. King Lucan and his undead hordes remain dangerous, but somewhat contained within the hills and forests of Morgau and Doresh and the new rolling plains and hills of the province of Krakovar.

### Return of the Elves
**Return of the Elves**

In recent years, the shadow fey, the elves of the Arbonesse, and the elves of various other courts (see "Dead Courts and Abandoned Holdings" on page 27) have grown restive. Fey interference in human and dwarven affairs is more prominent than it has been for centuries. While some of this includes the usual mischief of the shadow fey in the Crossroads, near Tintager, and along various sections of the White Mountain Marches, other elements are more difficult to quantify or explain. An elven knight wearing the full regalia of the Chosen of Valeresh joined a pilgrimage to the Seat of Mavros, whispering fervent prayers to the elven face of the god of war—and striking down the one pilgrim who attempted to interrupt him. Various wizards of Bemmea and Friula claim that elven arcanists have come to their libraries, seeking volumes of dusty lore. At least a few companies of adventurous, prickly explorers have sought out ley line nodes, items, and lore, and are working toward some goal, perhaps related to shadow fey dabbling, perhaps related to the Imperatrix’s malady, perhaps related to the apocalyptic blather of Loki and the priests of dragon gods.

The elves are entirely unwilling to discuss the matter, but they are restoring a few shrines of their gods, planting seeds for new towns, and calling up old servants. So far, it all amounts to a few scouts and curious savants and sages poking around. The more suspicious humans and the crustier dwarves claim that all this portends some new elven invasion, or an attempt to balance the moves of the shadow fey with counter-moves by the summer elves of Solindera. For now, it gives some people hope of a new age of peace, and worries others that elven ambitions in Midgard are not quite extinguished.

## An Abridged Chronology
**An Abridged Chronology**

Different nations remember history slightly differently, but some events are part of the sagas. This is one such telling, the Bard’s Chronology as told at Skaldholm, meant to provide a useful history of Midgard’s days from long ago to the current struggles against giants, dragons, and horrors from the dark.

**Creation**

Dragons live in the early Void and create mountains of iron and gold.

The gods create Midgard from the corpse of Aurgelmir.

### Recent Events
**RECENT EVENTS**

Certain events of the past century are still resonating with the people of Midgard, their kingdoms, and their destinies.

- 50 years ago, the minotaurs were pushed off the last of the Illyrian mainland at Gourniamos, and their queen swore an oath of vassalage to Triolo in exchange for naval assistance against the Mharoti Empire.
- 12 years ago, the old Mharoti sultan Makbule Khezmir the Wise died and his half-breed granddaughter, Sultana Casmara Azrabahir, ascended to the throne.
- 10 years ago, the darakhul and the vampires of Morgau marched into Krakova and conquered the kingdom entirely, declaring the birth of the Greater Duchy of Morgau.
- 9 years ago, dwarven reavers established the Wolfmark and seized the city of Johzt from the Blood Kingdom.
- 8 years ago, the sea god Nethus was restored to his divinity, though much changed. He now believes himself to be a good and true husband to Hecate and an equal partner in the rule of Kammae Straboli.
- 7 years ago, the Grand Duchy of Illyria fell to the assault of the Dragon Empire, and its nobles fled to the Drake’s Perch and to Triolo and Raguza. The dragons now rule over the new province of Rumela.
- 6 years ago, Nurian theurges allied with the fleets of Capleon, Kammae, and Triolo to win a great naval victory over the Mharoti galleys near Marea, seizing over 100 ships and sinking more than 50. The Mharoti lost more than 30,000 sailors and slaves, and the Mharoti admiral Tolga Serkhan al-Harkeshi was captured by Johennes of Salzbach, an elfmarked mercenary in the service of Capleon.
- 5 years ago, the Sultana Azrabahir escaped with her life, her vizier, and her closest companions when the Dread Sultan Ozmir Al-Stragul stormed the palace, pledging to honor Azuran and bring great victories in Veles’s name. She found refuge in the Seven Cities.
- 4 years ago, the shadow fey returned to Dornig, and when rebuffed there, they sent an ambassador—His Excellency Glaninin Thelamandrine—to their former fiefdom at Zobeck. While the shadow fey’s plots to assert their claim and rule Zobeck were defeated, they are a much greater presence in Zobeck now than they have been in several generations, since the days of debauched House Stross.
- 4 years ago, Dornig’s queen faded into a magical sleep, and her court is increasingly one of silence and despair. Kalvora Moonsong has presented herself as the chosen heir, though she has few friends in Dornig.
- 3 years ago, the thursir and other giants of Thursrike and the western mountains began to march into the human and dwarven lands of the north. The trollkin, surprisingly, came down from the hills to defend against Loki’s servants.

Triolo, Trombei, and Kammae compete to lead the unified states. The Emperor of Valera was annoyed his nation was not automatically given deference and plans a parallel effort.

### Regions of Midgard
**REGIONS OF MIDGARD**

The Midgard Worldbook details many culturally and geographically distinct regions. The river and roads of the Crossroads region stand at the center, surrounded by the Dark Kingdoms to the northeast, the Rothenian Plain to the east, the border of the Dragon Empire to the southeast, the imperial hodgepodge of the Grand Duchy of Dornig to the northwest, the Seven Cities peninsula and islands to the southwest, and the blasted ruins of the Wasted West. The frosty Northlands and Hyperborea lie across the Nieder Straits, and the sunbaked Southlands stretch far beyond the Middle Sea. With the notable exception of the Dragon Empire, each of these regions share many gods, language, and culture.

The North includes the dwarfholds of Tanserhall, Stannasgard, Wolfheim, and Thunder Mountain as well as human and inhuman lands such as Trollheim, Björnrike, Skaldholm, and Huldramose. Most of these lands are small in size and population. Some, like Thursrike, are trollkin and giant lands where humans and dwarves are enslaved or entirely absent.

The West includes the regions of the Western Wastes (also called the Goblin Wastes) and the Western Wilderness, the Haunted Lands of the Giants, the Magocracy of Allain, and the lands beyond the Western Ocean. It also includes numerous ruins, the crucial western port city of Barsella, and the sunken lands of Lost Arbonesse. Beyond lie scattered islands and cold ice. 

Two additional distant regions are not covered in this book. The first are the Kingdoms of Gold and Salt, a region also called the Southlands and including Omphaya, Lignas, Morreg, Terrotu, Narumbeki, Sebbek Sobor, and Kush, as well as the Corsair Coast.

The second is the Utter East, including distant Khandiria beyond the Dragon Empire, a land known only through trade for most citizens of Midgard, as well as Sikkim, Leng, Sailendra and the pirates of the Lotus Islands, the Qillian Plain, and Far Cathay (or the Heavenly Kingdom of Kitay). Each area is extensive enough to merit its own catalog of wonders.

### People of Midgard
**PEOPLE OF MIDGARD**

The realms of Midgard have always been home to a halfdozen major races and a handful of minor ones. All races certainly aspire to heroism and strive to do great deeds, but some are fewer in numbers. These varied people provide the bright blades that hold back the darkness.

#### Major Races
**Major Races**

The dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gearforged, humans, kobolds, minotaurs, ravenfolk, and shadow fey all have some claim to status as the great and powerful races of Midgard. Though some are few in number, the major races all have a long history, powerful patron gods, and widespread influence in their homelands. Most have or had nations of their own.

Minor Races

A number of minor races live in the civilized lands of Midgard, and many more in its wilderness and wastelands. These include the aasimar, bearfolk, centaurs, darakhul, gnolls, gnomes, dust goblins, tieflings, trollkin, and winterfolk. Most claim a small kingdom or tribal holdings, but none are large enough in numbers or in their command of land and power to shift the tides of history. Some, such as the winterfolk, are barely known. Others, like the gnomes and bearfolk, are simply rare, or at least rarely seen. Even those with some weight of numbers, such as the centaurs and dust goblins, are too scattered and divided to bend history to their will.

Aasimar

The great Phoenix Throne of Ishadia remains a shining beacon in poetry and song, but the reality for the aasimar is that the Mharoti Empire is devouring them slowly but surely, and they struggle to eke out a victory every time the dragons throw an army their way. Pilgrims and paladins bring coin and a wealth of prayers to the aasimar lands, but the doors to the heavens seem firmly shut, and so the power of the angelic folk dwindles. Still, give them a sword and a righteous cause, and they are still capable of putting terror into the hearts of the cruel, the greedy, and the faithless. See chapter 5 for their surviving kingdom of Ishadia and its remaining glories.

Bearfolk

Found in the chill lands of the Shadow Realm, on the Rothenian Plain, and the northerly climes of Björnrike and the lands of the giants, the bearfolk are strong and adaptable, displaying great strength as shapeshifters, druids, and shamans, and when commanding spirits to obey and keeping shadow contained. Their fangs, fur, and claws make smaller, weaker races nervous, though most bearfolk prove honest and loyal friends. Their societies consist of scattered tribes and roving bands rather than kingdoms and jarldoms, but all bearfolk acknowledge the Bear King of the Fey, at least in principle. See chapter 10 for their life in the Northlands, and chapter 11 for their strongholds in the Shadow Realm.

Centaurs

Centaurs are a scattered race and roam in clan groups from the Rothenian Plain (where their numbers are great) to the personal guard of the young emperor in Valera. Everywhere they are considered large and dangerous, and they have a reputation for banditry and bullying. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts well advanced, but they are a nomadic people without much interest in magic or writing, and other races disregard them as a result. They do so at their peril: Large centaur hordes occasionally smash entirely cities and small nations flat. See chapter 4 for their life on the Rothenian Plain.

Darakhul

Like gearforged, the darakhul were once members of other races. However, they live on not as mechanical embodiments, but as undead akin to ghouls, retaining the power of speech and having carved out an underground empire, which has now emerged as an ally of Morgau and a power in the Dark Kingdoms. They are powerful warriors, sleepless and cruel, capable of marching days without rest and fighting at full strength.

At the same time, they are hated and feared everywhere, and all good people turn against them, for they feed on the flesh of the living. Within their evil society, each darakhul strives only for itself, and obeys its superiors out of fear and hatred. Their dark gods give them strength, but their own bitter, undying hearts keep them far too petty and small to achieve more than war and conquest. See chapter 3 for more about the strange realm of the darakhul.

Dust Goblins

Alone among the shorter races, goblins refuse to be conquered or adopt even the pretense of diplomacy, and so they are treated as vermin and exterminated wherever dwarves and men encounter them. Driven into the wilderness by larger races, goblins are opportunistic scavengers. Many goblin tribes fall under the sway of worgs and nightgarms, which they worship as totem beasts. The relationship between goblins and worgs reverses expectations: the goblins are pets and servants of the lupine lords, not the other way around.

Some believe goblins are the warped remnants of the gnomes who did not escape to the Wormwood, or the twisted results of experimentation on halflings or humans during the Great Mage Wars. They are found in large numbers in the Goblin Wastes, though they are hardy travelers and can pop up thousands of miles away from their homeland, from the Northlands to the Dragon Empire. They have a knack for finding ancient artifacts and lost magic and spend much of their time digging through the dust for such items, then selling them to the mages of Allain. See chapter 8 for their tribes in the Wasted West.

Gnolls

Most common in Nuria Natal and points south, gnolls are also found in the Mharoti Empire, Khandiria, and even on the Rothenian Plain. They range the desert and plains as hunters and scavengers, and they are expert rangers, scouts, and trackers. Their culture is violent and largely unfriendly to outsiders, but they have a small kingdom in the distant South and act as guardians and avengers throughout Nuria Natal.

Gnomes

Found throughout Midgard in small numbers, gnomes have a single primary home, the dark forest of Niemheim and its surrounding territory. They have a terrible reputation as swindlers, kidnappers, diabolists, and charmers. As individuals, the small folk in their amusing hats and pointy boots seem silly. However, as a race they have struck diabolical bargains for power with Baba Yaga or archdevils, and this has led them to turn inward. Their only close allies are the shadow fey, though goblins and kobolds and gnolls are not particular in their choice of friends, either. See chapter 4 for their homeland in the Wormwood of Niemheim.

Tieflings

Once widespread in the human magocracies, tieflings grew to dominate Caelmarath’s and Vael Turog’s noble classes for a time. Those large and public families of tieflings are a thing of the past; they are an exiled people, found in families and pairs but rarely in any larger numbers. In most places they are reviled as the demonmarked or the hellborn, and driven out.

Significant numbers of the demonmarked reside only in Bemmea and Tintager, and even there they seem eager to prove themselves as worthy of trust. Many still blame them for the destruction of human lands of the West and the retreat of the elves. Shadow elves, gnolls, and gnomes enjoy their company, as do some dragonkin. Elves, humans, and halflings rarely abide them.

Trollkin

Combining the strength of giants with the arcane might of the darker fey, trollkin are strong in body and mind, warriors and raiders with a long history of taking what they want from the humans and dwarves of the Northlands and the wilder portions of the Dark Kingdoms. They brandish power over spirits and a deep understanding of the roads between worlds, and their warriors are known for ferocity, courage, and persistence. See chapter 10 for more about their kingdoms in the Northlands.

Winterfolk

Rarely seen and a stay-at-home race, winterfolk (also called halflings) are encountered as bargefolk on the great rivers and as the most discreet of servants to the River Court or in the Grand Duchy of Dornig. The race was widely believed to have been indentured to the elves before the Great Retreat, and they show great deference to elves and the elfmarked. Most halflings left Midgard for the Elflands or the River Court during the Great Retreat. Those that remained are slightly more adventurous than those who were loyal to the elven masters.

##### Humans
**Humans**

The humans of Midgard are both numerous and thriving, with kingdoms and duchies and small settlements scattered from shore to steppes and from icy vastness to searing sands. Human racial traits conform to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game standard traits for humans. For additional traits and abilities, see the Midgard Heroes Handbook for 5th Edition (MHH) or the Midgard Player’s Guide for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (MPG). 

Variations in culture and languages categorize humans into seven main groups and many smaller ones.

**Caelmarans:** The descendants of the nine magocracies—Allain, Andarre, Barsella, Caelmarath, Carnessa, Cassilon, Molovosch, Uxloon, and Vael Turog—are a pasty lot, with hair varying from rust-red to moss-green as common as black or brown. Some claim that the Caelmarans are all tainted by association with demons and devils, pointing to the high prevalence of tieflings among the shattered towns and deserts of the West. Caelmarans speak Common, though many also speak the Northern Tongue.

**Dornigfolk:** The numerous Dornigfolk of the Great Duchy have skin ranging from pink-white to a watery brown, and hair from brown to blond, though red hair is largely unknown. The Dornigfolk pride themselves on their work ethic and their elven empress, and they consider themselves the last bastion of the true Empire of Thorn. Those pretenders in Valera arouse only their pity and scorn. Dornigfolk speak Elvish and Common.

**Kushites:** The people of the great southern bastion of Nuria Natal are the best known of the Kushites, but this group also includes the desert folk, the Siwalese, the Mharoti humans, and many others. While all share mahogany skin and dark hair, their rulers and customs are quite different. Kushites take great pride in their status as the first and greatest of the human kingdoms. Most speak Nurian and many also speak Southern dialect or Draconic.

**Magdar:** Dark-haired and customarily green-eyed, the Magdar are beautiful and relatively tall among humans. They have rich, musical voices and an efficient way with horses and oxen. Though many Magdar ride the Rothenian Plain or wander far afield as mercenaries or adventurers, their kingdom is a strong one, and the Magdar are bold explorers and fighters. A few Magdar have a regrettable tendency to drunkenness. They speak Common, and a few speak Draconic or the Northern Tongue.

**Northlanders:** Pale and tall and strong, the Northlanders are a race of survivors and warriors. Their hair runs to pale blond or even white, sometimes with golden or red streaks. Their eyes are often a piercing blue or purple. They speak the Northern Tongue, and many also speak Dwarvish or Trollkin.

**Roshgazi:** Dark-skinned and eagle-nosed, the Roshgazi are associated with their friends the minotaurs. They roam the western deserts of the Southlands as well as dwell in small villages in Capleon, Kyprion, and Cindass. They speak Roshgazi, a language closely related to Minotaur. Speakers of either language can understand the other.

Septimes: Olive-skinned and dark-haired, the people of the Seven Cities, Rumela, and Kyprion call themselves the Manzaro, but most others call them the Septimes. They are a small and swift people, quick-speaking and sometimes too quick with a blade. They speak Common and a dialect they call Valeran.

**Human Corruption**

When the other races speak ill of the humans of Midgard, their complaints are clear: humans are corrupt, decadent, and untrustworthy. Humans are more prone to breed with demons and devils, become the prey of vampires, and turn into the tools and toys of elves. The entire existence of the elfmarked is attributed to human fecundity and general lack of discretion. Dwarves, gnomes, minotaurs, and other races are far more concerned with the purity of their bloodlines and the maintenance of their traditions and heritage. Human traditions are strong in some places – witness their schools of magic, or their knightly orders—and quite weak in others. In the eyes of other races, humans require persistent watching and paternal oversight, which explains why dwarves and elves can seem so constantly condescending.

The general sense that humans are more readily bribed, coerced, seduced, and corrupted encourages demons, devils, shadow fey, and other horrors to prey on humans in preference to other races. Perhaps this makes the impression a self-fulfilling prophecy, and other races are just as susceptible to corruption but simply less tempting targets. If human strength lies in the ability to adapt and its large populations, human weakness originates in the race’s lusts, greed, and lack of discernment.

**Other Peoples:** Dozens of smaller groups of humans consider themselves distinct from their neighbors, including the Kariv, Khazzaki, Mharoti, Khandirians, Nurians, Olandska, Toar, and Vadi. Most speak Common and have a private language of their own.

**Optional Rule: Status**

In Midgard, prestige or status is a matter of public importance, and the setting assumes that PCs come from different stations, social classes, and backgrounds. This social standing is reflected in the optional Status attribute. This attribute is generated at character creation like ability scores, but it can fluctuate considerably during play.

The Status attribute is rolled on 1d6+1 if other statistics are rolled, and it starts at a flat score of 4 if a point-buy system is used. Characters add their Charisma modifier to their starting status. Status increases further by special actions (see tables 7-1 and 10-1).

**GM Note:** Status determines which player character most NPCs will defer to. Note which PC has the highest Status at the start of any given game session, and have all NPCs address that character as the default party leader. The character with the highest Status is always the best-known and most-respected PC of the party in the eyes of others.

Some PC races or classes begin with a Status bonus or penalty at the start of play. See Table 1–2: Starting Status Adjustments. Classes and races not listed have no adjustment to starting status.

Table 1–1: Status gives typical Status values for various NPCs, as a yardstick to gauge player character Status.

##### Dragonborn
**Dragonborn**

The dragonborn are the youngest race of Midgard, growing quickly in the extent of their rule. They are common only in the Mharoti Empire, and indeed they are a consequence of its founding; the dragonborn were unknown before the unification of the dragons. They have spread beyond the Dragon Empire and now flourish throughout the south and east of Midgard. (“Dragonborn” describes this race; the term “dragonkin” refers collectively to all the scaled races. See chapter 5.)

Dragonborn are considered a race of great presence and ability, but driven by greed and arrogance. Such a young race should be more humble, or at least less demanding. And yet the dragonborn justify their arrogance with so many battles fought and won. Their penchant for warfare and their success at seizing plunder make many wonder whether they are especially favored by the World-Serpent Veles. The dragonborn are quick to claim his blessing, and the blessings of their draconic gods.

Dragonborn are powerful scaled humanoids, clawed and fearsome in size and strength. As might be expected, the resilience and arrogance of humans fused with the scaly magic and toughness of dragons is a powerful combination. Most dragonborn have gray, brown, tan, gold, silver, or black scales; rarely, some display red‑orange, green-yellow, or starlike blue-and-black scales.

The dragonborn divide themselves into the Four Elemental Kinds of supposedly purebred lineages, though there is a great deal of mixing among them and hybrids are not uncommon. The flame or fire dragonborn (who bear yellow, golden, or orange scales, with red crests) are the most common, followed by wind or storm dragonborn (blue, white, silver, or gray scales, with black crests). The stone or cave dragonborn are relatively uncommon (brown, gray, black, or rarely white scales, with purple or white crests). Rarest of all are the wave or tide dragonborn breeds, gold, blue, or green-scaled with bright green or yellow crests. More common than the purebreds and outside the traditional elemental divisions are the edjet or soldier dragonborn, who sport brassy or tan scales with black or rust-colored crests.

Dragonborn males and females are distinct. Both sport clawed hands and feet, their faces are dominated by short snouts, and their eyes are deep and golden or black. Beyond that, male dragonborn are larger, horned or crested, and considerably heavier. Their tails are short and often spiked. Female dragonborn are faster, smaller, and wiry, with longer lashing tails. They sometimes have a frill or collar of contrasting color.

Dragonborn wear armor normally, since their own scales are only slightly more protective than human or dwarven skin. All dragonborn are heavy and slow for their size, but they exude a commanding presence, a sense of destiny that scalykind and non-scaly races alike find compelling. Dragonborn speak Draconic, which serves as the language of the Dragon Empire, as well as Common.

**Dragon Magic**

Dragon magic tends toward the raw and uncomplicated: elemental magic and the magic of scale and claw. Occasionally, it also is transformative, as in certain rituals said to turn a kobold into a dragonborn, or a dragonborn into a drake. Dragon magic is discussed in more detail in the MHH for 5th Edition and Deep Magic for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.

##### Dwarves
**Dwarves**

The dwarves of Midgard live in three great realms: the Northern clan halls such as Tanserhall and Wolfheim, the free cantons of the Ironcrags, and the southern realms of Nuria Natal and Sebbek Sobor. The dwarves of the three realms are distinct in their culture, strengths, and style.

The Northlands dwarves are keepers of the old ways and the old gods, smiths and warriors, farmers and traders, stout and strong and able to down a barrel of ale at one sitting. They keep busy fighting the giants or the werewolves and worgs in the North, but sometimes the Northern dwarves take to the sea in their longships and raid the coasts, from Vidim through the Donnermark and Krakovar to northern Dornig territories, but bypassing the Magocracy of Allain. The Northern dwarves are especially accomplished at ring-making, smithwork, and (for some reason) berserk shapeshifting, including a society of especially fearsome bear-shirted berserks.

The cantonal dwarves are makers, miners, and smiths, digging deep into the Ironcrags for iron and gold and forging items of great wonder; primarily exceptional spears, crossbows, and arrows, but also great artistic works. Singular items are a lifetime’s masterwork: a clockwork steed or wagon, an airship, a returning hammer, or a suit of invulnerable armor. None of these are beyond the grasp of a cantonal smith.

The cantonal dwarves serve no kings, choosing instead to rule themselves. They frequently serve as mercenaries in the Seven Cities, among the nobles of the Grand Duchy, and against the Mharoti Empire, side by side with the Magdar knights. They have a deep hatred of the undead of the Blood Kingdom.

The Southlands dwarves are distant relatives at best, with different language, magic, and style. In the desert heat the Southern dwarves shave their heads and wrap their beards tightly in gold or copper wire; sometimes these beards are forked or braided as well. They serve a male mask of Rava named Ptah, and they build clockwork bodies they call shabti, or servants. Their skin is dark as ebony, and—when not shorn—their hair runs to pure black, gold, or (strangely) red. The Southern dwarves are alchemists and mystics, with a particular hatred of dragons and the Mharoti Empire. They have served the god-kings of Nuria Natal well and faithfully as bodyguards and heavy infantry for centuries, and as engineers who build their

temples, city walls, and step pyramids.

**Dwarves and Men**

The tale of men and dwarves is punctuated by feuds and battles, but they are allies more often than not. At first the dwarves mistook humans for a degenerate subrace of elf, and later grouped them among the many “lesser races” of Midgard. Gifts, familiarity, and common ground eventually forged an alliance between the two races, a concord that grew stronger as the old gods gave way to the new, but it was hardly an equal partnership. The dwarves raided into human lands at the least provocation, and their kingdoms claimed huge tracks of land occupied by other races, which the dwarves either drove out or enslaved. Those who proved too troublesome were exterminated.

In the Northlands, dwarven rule required those who submitted to supply tribute in the form of gold and slaves. The human tributes worked hard labor in mines or on lowland farms. These client races first gave their masters the nickname “reaver dwarf.” As time passed and more dwarves were lost each generation to southern emigration, war, and vendetta, humanity gained a more even footing. Dwarf culture was adopted by (or forced upon) humanity and the other races of the North and later the Ironcrags, but humans taught the dwarves the arts of restrained diplomacy, cooperation, and peaceful trade. Some say that the dwarves have mellowed over the years, but others claim that humans have simply learned to weather the dwarves’ pride and temper. Certainly the dwarves haven’t belied the “reaver dwarf ” name.

**Gunpowder and Airships**

The cantonal dwarves of Midgard are the only race with access to gunpowder and airships. This is purely an optional element of the setting, and gunpowder can be ignored entirely. If you choose to include gunpowder, gunslinger PCs in Midgard will require some connection to the cantons to gain access to proper guns, powder, and related materials.

Airships occupy a similar position. The dwarves built a few of them in the canton of Templeforge, but the crafts are delicate and expensive. Most are used for high-value cargos and urgent military matters, and only a few cantons have an airship of their own.

**Ring and Rune Magic**

These two schools of magic embed spells into rings of power and create carved runes that make magic visible and available to even nonspellcasters. The dwarves are particularly adept at these kinds of magic, since they are said to have invented ring magic, and to have learned rune magic at Wotan’s knee. See the MHH for 5th Edition or Deep Magic for PFRPG for details of these spells and their related feats and archetypes.

##### Elves and the Elfmarked
**Elves and the Elfmarked**

The elves are a people apart, as they are quick to remind others. They were not the first settlers of the forests and fields, but they taught humans and dwarves and others the arts arcane and the art of civilization. The empire they founded at Thorn and in the Arbonesse, which later spread as far east as Sephaya and south to Valera, was a wonder for the ages. Its magical roads, its slim towers, and its speedy and lethal armies maintained an age of peace that lasted until a few centuries ago.

Now the elves are a splintered race. Some few with elven blood—the so-called “elfmarked” humans—remain and can claim descent from the great elves of old. The greatest of these is the Imperatrix of Dornig, an aging queen without a clear heir. But the elfmarked are as much human as elf (see MHH or MPG). The true elves are rarely seen, and defined by three groups: the elusive windrunner elves of the Rothenian steppes, the shadow fey of the Realm of Shadow, and the reclusive river elves of the Arbonesse, who might be the strongest and wisest of the three groups.

The shadow elves keep a court and a king and queen, but their remaining glory is slight, a reflection full of illusion and trickery and deceit. They no longer draw their power from Midgard, but from Shadow. The river elves are of the last holdouts of the elves of Thorn, with the River King retaining only slight contact with Dornig. The Arbonesse Forest is their homeland and the river their highway, and their borders include all the land where the leaves’ shadow falls. The river elves sometimes exile one of their number to wander the world for a few decades, but otherwise, the other races rarely see the elves who built so many castles, roads, and cities throughout Midgard.

**On Elven Names**

A true elf of the Arbonesse lineage has three names. The first is a birth name given by parents, the second is a common name adopted by the elf upon maturity, and the last is a lineage name, akin to a family name among the humans but taken from a list of a few hundred great heroes of the Elflands known as the Wild Hunt, who harrowed the demons back to their hells. The most common lineage names include Aynwyn, Sheoloss, Kalthania, Derina, Dammung, Rexthathus, and Larentil. Elves with the same lineage name might not be related at all, which leads to confusion among humans. Elves reveal their birth names to their own kind and trusted friends, and their common name to all others.

The Imperatrix was born Regia Kalthania, and took the name Moonthorn when she first adventured among the primitives. When she married she added her husband’s name Reln according to human custom, and upon her ascension to a noble state she took the vann Dornig title. Not all elves in Midgard maintain this tradition. The windrunner elves (whom the exiles of Arbonesse say were lower classes of Sephaya who ignored the Last Horn) adopt the naming conventions of the plains, and forget their lineages.

By Dornig law, only individuals with a clear elven heritage can take an elven lineage name. There is a brisk trade among up-and-coming gentry for genealogists who can provide such a link.

**Elven Ritual Magic**

The elves have powerful forms of ritual magic, and traditions that hand those rituals down to their descendants, and sometimes to the elfmarked. More details are available in the MHH or MPG.

##### Gearforged
**Gearforged**

The gearforged are the children of Rava, the Gear Goddess of Fate and Industry. Her priests were the first to forge bodies of brass and copper with cunningly wrought gears and well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh; a special ritual transfers a living creature’s soul into the housing that makes it gearforged, and attunes it to the soul gems and memory gears that preserve a soul in a mechanical body. Once created, a gearforged can in theory live forever, though in practice most wind down or are destroyed by the ravages of time and the difficulty of surviving as a well-crafted machine.

All gearforged were once other creatures that now inhabit standardized bodies with cylinders, springs, and articulated joints of varying quality. Each is made of iron, brass, and steel and as distinctive in appearance as other people differ by their hair and eyes. The gearforged are thinking creatures and can serve as city guards and soldiers. Gearforged have free will that separates them from other mechanical devices, which are no more than simple servants responsive to orders and capable of little more than a limited amount of memorization.

Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because all gearforged are machines with a soul. Their arms and legs depend on actuators powered by everwound springs. Their minds depend on memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements are all held in a shell of iron, brass, and steel, and the bulk of the entire construct is remarkable. A large and heavily armored gearforged can weigh 400 pounds, since its armor is built in.

**Clockwork Magic**

Gearforged are the product of a specific ritual of soulforging (see MHH or MPG for details), using components such as memory gears and everwound springs. In addition, their creation is the apex of a school of magic called Clockwork Magic, which offers mastery of machines, time, and constructs. It is especially common in the Free City of Zobeck and in some of the Seven Cities, but rare elsewhere.

##### Kobolds
**Kobolds**

Of the diminutive races, the kobolds have adapted best to the changing world. Enslaved long ago by reaver dwarves, kobolds quickly carved a niche for themselves as miners, scouts, and tinkerers—small enough to be useful and small enough to be dismissed as a threat. At first they were tolerated, then largely ignored. As a result, the shadows of dwarven society are rife with kobold rogues and entrepreneurs (many of them secret worshippers of Loki), seemingly subservient but busily trading dwarven goods for resources extracted from the dwarves’ own mines and storehouses, right under the noses of their alleged “masters.”

Free kobolds defend their mines viciously, but otherwise maintain the ruse of a harmless and subservient little folk—at least until the opportunity to sheathe a knife in someone’s kidneys presents itself. Other small races have adopted the kobolds’ strategy, including the worship of Loki, embracing his cunning ways and the advantages of guile and cunning over brawn and bravado.

More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dexterous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of peril with a cowardly speed. They fight on their own terms, small and fierce, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races cannot sustain a settlement. They are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and exhibit a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble. They serve as merchants to both the Underdark and the surface world, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes and the dwarves, competing mining races that seek to overthrow the kobold dominance of dark, rich territories.

The kobold queen of queens—in all her radiant dragon‑blooded perfection—rules from Harkesh, the capital of the Dragon Empire. Kobold society is exceedingly social and built around the clan, matriarchal lines of descent, everchanging male kings, and the crucial importance of clutch-mates (those who hatched about the same time, since kobolds are reptilian and hatch from eggs). Relatively few kobolds become adventurers, but those who do generally have either offended a kobold king (and been exiled from the mines as punishment) or have lost their clutch-mates. Adventuring kobolds wish to leave their homes to grieve and find new friends. In many cases, a kobold will “adopt” an adventuring party as new clutch‑mates.

Kobolds are deeply enamored of their tools and spend a great deal of effort to improve them. Mining picks, a mason’s hammer or jeweler’s loupe, and even simple items like a spear or dagger are all named and cherished. At the same time, kobolds tend to gnaw on tool handles, forget to oil blades, or even pry out inlays or decorative gems to improve them. As a result, most kobold items are entirely distinctive and unlikely to be mistaken for anyone else’s possessions. Some believe this decorative urge may be a form of defense against theft.

One category of tool deserves special note: traps. Kobolds create wildly impractical traps and simple, deadly ones as a hobby, and few leave home without string, springs, or other triggers for their traps. Kobolds are the only race that recognizes “trapsmith” as a profession.

The kobolds are closely allied with and related to the dragonkin, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is ever satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire the dragons as the sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.

##### Minotaurs
**Minotaurs**

The bull-folk exhibit many of the same characteristics as the bulls they resemble. Both genders have horned heads covered with shaggy hair. Warriors braid their hair with teeth or other tokens of fallen enemies. The thick hair covering their large bodies varies widely in color, from bright white to medium red-browns to dark brown and black. Many minotaurs shave or dye their fur in patterns signifying their allegiances and beliefs. Other methods of decoration include brands, ritual scars, and gilding or carving their horns.

Adult males can reach a height of 6 1/2 to 7 feet, with females averaging 3 inches shorter. Both genders have a great deal of muscle mass even for their considerable size, and physical prowess plays a large part in their social structure. Minotaurs can live as long as humans but reach adulthood three years earlier. Childhood ends around the age of 10 and adulthood is celebrated at 15. However, most minotaurs don’t form their own families until at least the age of 25. They spend those 10 years proving themselves to their elders.

As omnivores, minotaurs consume enormous quantities of both meat and vegetation. Great banquets mark important social and religious occasions, and a successful feast is often a point of regional pride; competition between regional cuisines is fierce, sometimes violent, and eagerly anticipated. Minotaurs are particularly mindful of meals before great ceremonies or displays of skill, and the hosts of such events can earn nearly as much honor as the champions by providing memorable feasts. To fail as a host brings deep shame.

**Minotaur Horns**

The most valued accessories of any minotaur are his or her horns. Grown by both sexes, horns display an individual’s status and strength, and they provide a ready weapon in battle. Those who lose part or all of a horn suffer considerable stigma and must constantly demonstrate their worth; the term “brokehorn” is a fighting insult. Some temples will magically regrow a damaged horn for a minotaur who completes a quest or series of trials, though a few famous warriors have gone through life “broken” as a mark of pride and resilience. Those minotaurs who choose to keep a reminder of their failing are the most driven among them.

Many minotaurs chronicle their victories with carvings or etchings on their horns. Warriors display representations of defeated foes, and artisans mark theirs with accolades their work has won. For instance, the killer of a cyclops might have a square rune with an eye in the middle, and the maker of the killer’s weapon might have an axe rune with a crown above it. Others earn markings from the great mazes they have solved.

All minotaurs who honor their heritage take great care of their horns, polishing and shining them. Some even gild their horns with precious metals to draw attention to their achievements.

**Labyrinthine Magic**

Minotaurs are masters of the school of labyrinthine glamours, plus trap-spells and wardings. They keep this magic to themselves, never sharing it with non-minotaurs.

##### Ravenfolk
**Ravenfolk**

Also called huginn or heru, these western cousins of the tengu are scoundrels and not entirely welcome everywhere. Their homeland is in Beldestan to the east, or on a branch of Wotan’s tree in the North, or on a high cliff of Horus’s hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Nuria Natal, Zobeck, and the Dragon Empire, but none of these are large.

Travelers spot their black feathers and long beaks on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers in Midgard, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath they abide by it. They avoid the West and the Seven Cities and are most honored in Nuria Natal, where they serve temples of Horus as sworn guardians, assassins, and defenders.

While their numbers are relatively small, the ravenfolk are counted a great race because of their role as messengers for the gods. They hear the words of Wotan most clearly, but also claim to speak for Aten, Lada, Khors, Thor, Loki, Ninkash, and Sif. Occasionally, they bring dark tidings from Chernobog, blood-smeared missives from the Hunter, or demands from Mammon or Vardesain, but these are rare, and the poor ravenfolk chosen to deliver divine messages and prophecies from dark gods are shunned even among their own people.

**Raven Magic**

Though the ravenfolk claim to have invented or at least shared the runes of the All-Father, and though their understanding of prophecy and shadow are both excellent, their magic wins little renown in the wider world, for they guard it jealously. They are keen scouts and powerful oracles, and they demonstrate an uncanny ability to bend runes to new uses.

##### Shadow Fey
**Shadow Fey**

As best as anyone can determine, the shadow fey were once elves and goblins who swore undying and eternal fealty to Sarastra, the goddess of night and magic, and were embraced by her heralds and ambassadors of the Shadow Realm. This arrangement granted them great power over shadow and a twilight kingdom in the Shadow Realm, though at a cost of abandoning their homes and loved ones and turning to the night sky and the stars as their guiding lights. The shadow fey despise sunlight and bear great affection for things of darkness and shadow.

Shadow fey are courtly, swift, and powerful spellcasters, with special talents as enchanters, illusionists, and weavers of shadowstuff. They are prone to corruption and melancholy, though they hold feasts and revels in the old style, as the Midgard elves did when their kingdoms were still whole. The shadow fey have a great love of hunting, trickery, and duels, and they retain powerful hounds, horses, and hunting owls to assist them in finding and destroying the enemies of their eternal king and queen, and expanding the power of the Shadow Realm.

**Illumination and Shadow Magic**

The shadow fey are adept with these two schools of magic that turn starshine, shadow, and light into spells of power. See the MHH or Deep Magic for PFRPG for details of these spells and their related feats and archetypes.

**Greater Unity by Limiting Variety**

Midgard contains many races, and there’s a certain temptation to see them all as player character races. However, a campaign can gain focus and party unity benefits if the game leans toward one or two spotlight races. As GM, you have some measure of say in how that happens. For instance, if your vision of the campaign is Northlands-centric, you might invite players to stick to humans, dwarves, and either trollkin or ravenfolk (but not both). More than three races tends to turn an adventuring party into quite a motley bunch. At the same time, you’re more likely to generate player cooperation and buy-in if you discuss the region’s tone, its inhabitants, and what is interesting about the preferred races before character generation begins. Once players have independently made characters of six different races, it’s a bit too late to call for emphasis on regional types and tropes.

**House Rule:** Players gain an additional attribute point for each player that agrees upon a shared race within the party. No more than 2 of these addtional points may be put in a single attribute.

**House Rule:** Players gain an additional teamwork feat for every 4 levels gained. Characters that die and then are resurrected keep these bonus feats; newly created characters do not get them unless they spend downtime training with someone who has the desired feat.

#### Minor Races
**Minor Races**

A number of minor races live in the civilized lands of Midgard, and many more in its wilderness and wastelands. These include the aasimar, bearfolk, centaurs, darakhul, gnolls, gnomes, dust goblins, tieflings, trollkin, and winterfolk. Most claim a small kingdom or tribal holdings, but none are large enough in numbers or in their command of land and power to shift the tides of history. Some, such as the winterfolk, are barely known. Others, like the gnomes and bearfolk, are simply rare, or at least rarely seen. Even those with some weight of numbers, such as the centaurs and dust goblins, are too scattered and divided to bend history to their will.

##### Aasimar
**Aasimar**

The great Phoenix Throne of Ishadia remains a shining beacon in poetry and song, but the reality for the aasimar is that the Mharoti Empire is devouring them slowly but surely, and they struggle to eke out a victory every time the dragons throw an army their way. Pilgrims and paladins bring coin and a wealth of prayers to the aasimar lands, but the doors to the heavens seem firmly shut, and so the power of the angelic folk dwindles. Still, give them a sword and a righteous cause, and they are still capable of putting terror into the hearts of the cruel, the greedy, and the faithless. See chapter 5 for their surviving kingdom of Ishadia and its remaining glories.

##### Bearfolk
**Bearfolk**

Found in the chill lands of the Shadow Realm, on the Rothenian Plain, and the northerly climes of Björnrike and the lands of the giants, the bearfolk are strong and adaptable, displaying great strength as shapeshifters, druids, and shamans, and when commanding spirits to obey and keeping shadow contained. Their fangs, fur, and claws make smaller, weaker races nervous, though most bearfolk prove honest and loyal friends. Their societies consist of scattered tribes and roving bands rather than kingdoms and jarldoms, but all bearfolk acknowledge the Bear King of the Fey, at least in principle. See chapter 10 for their life in the Northlands, and chapter 11 for their strongholds in the Shadow Realm.

##### Centaurs
**Centaurs**

Centaurs are a scattered race and roam in clan groups from the Rothenian Plain (where their numbers are great) to the personal guard of the young emperor in Valera. Everywhere they are considered large and dangerous, and they have a reputation for banditry and bullying. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts well advanced, but they are a nomadic people without much interest in magic or writing, and other races disregard them as a result. They do so at their peril: Large centaur hordes occasionally smash entirely cities and small nations flat. See chapter 4 for their life on the Rothenian Plain.

##### Darakhul
**Darakhul**

Like gearforged, the darakhul were once members of other races. However, they live on not as mechanical embodiments, but as undead akin to ghouls, retaining the power of speech and having carved out an underground empire, which has now emerged as an ally of Morgau and a power in the Dark Kingdoms. They are powerful warriors, sleepless and cruel, capable of marching days without rest and fighting at full strength.

At the same time, they are hated and feared everywhere, and all good people turn against them, for they feed on the flesh of the living. Within their evil society, each darakhul strives only for itself, and obeys its superiors out of fear and hatred. Their dark gods give them strength, but their own bitter, undying hearts keep them far too petty and small to achieve more than war and conquest. See chapter 3 for more about the strange realm of the darakhul.

##### Dust Goblins
**Dust Goblins**

Alone among the shorter races, goblins refuse to be conquered or adopt even the pretense of diplomacy, and so they are treated as vermin and exterminated wherever dwarves and men encounter them. Driven into the wilderness by larger races, goblins are opportunistic scavengers. Many goblin tribes fall under the sway of worgs and nightgarms, which they worship as totem beasts. The relationship between goblins and worgs reverses expectations: the goblins are pets and servants of the lupine lords, not the other way around.

Some believe goblins are the warped remnants of the gnomes who did not escape to the Wormwood, or the twisted results of experimentation on halflings or humans during the Great Mage Wars. They are found in large numbers in the Goblin Wastes, though they are hardy travelers and can pop up thousands of miles away from their homeland, from the Northlands to the Dragon Empire. They have a knack for finding ancient artifacts and lost magic and spend much of their time digging through the dust for such items, then selling them to the mages of Allain. See chapter 8 for their tribes in the Wasted West.

##### Gnolls
**Gnolls**

Most common in Nuria Natal and points south, gnolls are also found in the Mharoti Empire, Khandiria, and even on the Rothenian Plain. They range the desert and plains as hunters and scavengers, and they are expert rangers, scouts, and trackers. Their culture is violent and largely unfriendly to outsiders, but they have a small kingdom in the distant South and act as guardians and avengers throughout Nuria Natal.

##### Gnomes
**Gnomes**

Found throughout Midgard in small numbers, gnomes have a single primary home, the dark forest of Niemheim and its surrounding territory. They have a terrible reputation as swindlers, kidnappers, diabolists, and charmers. As individuals, the small folk in their amusing hats and pointy boots seem silly. However, as a race they have struck diabolical bargains for power with Baba Yaga or archdevils, and this has led them to turn inward. Their only close allies are the shadow fey, though goblins and kobolds and gnolls are not particular in their choice of friends, either. See chapter 4 for their homeland in the Wormwood of Niemheim.

##### Tieflings
**Tieflings**

Once widespread in the human magocracies, tieflings grew to dominate Caelmarath’s and Vael Turog’s noble classes for a time. Those large and public families of tieflings are a thing of the past; they are an exiled people, found in families and pairs but rarely in any larger numbers. In most places they are reviled as the demonmarked or the hellborn, and driven out.

Significant numbers of the demonmarked reside only in Bemmea and Tintager, and even there they seem eager to prove themselves as worthy of trust. Many still blame them for the destruction of human lands of the West and the retreat of the elves. Shadow elves, gnolls, and gnomes enjoy their company, as do some dragonkin. Elves, humans, and halflings rarely abide them.

##### Trollkin
**Trollkin**

Combining the strength of giants with the arcane might of the darker fey, trollkin are strong in body and mind, warriors and raiders with a long history of taking what they want from the humans and dwarves of the Northlands and the wilder portions of the Dark Kingdoms. They brandish power over spirits and a deep understanding of the roads between worlds, and their warriors are known for ferocity, courage, and persistence. See chapter 10 for more about their kingdoms in the Northlands.

##### Winterfolk
**Winterfolk**

Rarely seen and a stay-at-home race, winterfolk (also called halflings) are encountered as bargefolk on the great rivers and as the most discreet of servants to the River Court or in the Grand Duchy of Dornig. The race was widely believed to have been indentured to the elves before the Great Retreat, and they show great deference to elves and the elfmarked. Most halflings left Midgard for the Elflands or the River Court during the Great Retreat. Those that remained are slightly more adventurous than those who were loyal to the elven masters.

## Time and the Seasonal Calendar
**TIME AND THE SEASONAL CALENDAR**

The measure of time in Midgard is straightforward. There are 12 months of 30 days each, for a total of 360 days in the calendar, and another six intercalendar festival days: New Year’s Dawn, Mustering, Rites of Spring, Summer Festival, Harvest Dances, and the Lantern Festival. With six festival days, the year is 366 days long.

The seven days of the week are the same in most cultures of Midgard: Moonday, Volsday, Wolfsday, Torsday, Marksday, Ceresday, and Khorsday. These common names appear from the Northlands to the Middle Sea and the Crossroads to the Wastes.

The elves and the dragonkin both use different names for the days of the week. The Mharoti of the Dragon Empire call the days Pazar, Nazartesi, Sali, Charsamba, Pehrsembe, Juma, and Umartesi. Among the elves, they are Larasday, Elothsday, Orielsday, Bowsday, Freyasday, Yarisday, and Leafsday or Bacchosday.

The months are measured from the arrival of the new year with the onset of spring in Springmelt or Mustering. The festivals associated with various months are noted below in parentheses. The names in brackets are those used for winter months in the southern regions, where snow is rare or unknown.

**Spring**

Springmelt (New Year’s Dawn, Mustering)

**Summer**

Goldflower (Crown Festival)

Low Summer

High Summer (Summer Festival)

**Autumn**

### Count of Years
**Count of Years**

The people and nations of Midgard measure time in many ways, though the most common standard is simply the formula “so-and-so many years ago,” counting backward from the present. But records meant to stand over time require a count or calendar, and Midgard has at least seven of them. Each begins a specific number of years ago. In many regions, even these counts are unknown, since the nations of Midgard are fragmented and largely too weak to impose a unified calendar. Many use a local dating system, such as the founding of the kingdom or counting from the coronation of the current duke, queen, or prince.

**After the Retreat (AR):** The Great Retreat of the Elves to the Arbonesse and the Summer Lands, ending their empires in Midgard. This date, 482 years ago, began a second descent into chaos and war, and led to the birth of the Goblin Wastes and the further decline of the West.

**Ankesh Count (AC):** No longer in use anywhere, but ancient records from before the elven arrivals date from 3,909 years ago, the date of the first coronation of a king and queen on the island of Ankesh.

**Count of the Prophet’s Years (CP):** The prophet of the Southern monotheistic deity Aten was martyred 52 years ago, and since that time his cult has grown substantially, especially among women, southern dwarves, and the poor. For religious reasons, these people disregard the Dragon Ages and use the Count of the Prophet’s Years instead. This does not endear them to the Mharoti officials and governors who encounter Nurian pilgrims, preachers, and merchants doing business with an unofficial calendar.

**Daughter’s Count (DC):** The god Perun granted dominion over Sephaya and the eastern provinces of the elves to his human daughter, Vasilka Soulay. The founding of this kingdom was 432 years ago.

**Elvish Thorn Years (TY):** Counted from the founding of the city of Thorn 2,190 years ago, and used in Dornig to this day. Formerly used by the Valerans and sometimes referred to as the Valeran reckoning.

**Founder’s Roll (FR):** Counted from the founding of Caelmarath, 492 years ago. This date is still used in the magocracy of Bemmea, the Kingdom of Bourgund, and sometimes in Verrayne.

**Horse Years (HY):** The kingdom of the Magdar was founded by Rothenian nomads who settled the finest grasslands of the Crossroads region and held them against all comers. They count their dates from the First Horse King, and call this the Horse Years. Nomads and centaurs of the plains know this count as well. The date begins 732 years ago.

**Mharoti Dragon Ages (MDA):** The dragons swore their compact 347 years ago, founding the Mharoti Sultanate. The empire is the only place that uses this reckoning, but its formidable size and strength means that neighboring kingdoms are familiar with the system.

**Old Calendar (OC):** The most common reckoning among humans and dwarves dates to the founding of the Sun Kingdom of Cassilon, 1749 years ago. This date is commonly given in brackets after other year reckonings, since it is the best known and most widely traveled.

**Shadow Reckoning (SR):** The shadow fey date their creation from the time before human revolt, roughly 582 years ago when they summoned and bargained with the Queen of Night and Magic and split the fey roads into those controlled by the summer elves and those held in shadow. Over time, the shadow roads have grown more numerous. Some believe infernal hands were at work here.

**Zobeck Free Years (FY):** The people of Zobeck revolted against their rule by House Stross 92 years ago, hanging all members of the family and winning a battle against considerable odds. The dating is not used outside the city, but it is typical of the reckoning of years in free cities and smaller kingdoms, which often ignore larger events in favor of their own milestones.

## Travel, Trade Fairs, and Festivals
**TRAVEL, TRADE FAIRS, AND FESTIVALS**

Life encompasses more than harvests, war, and taxes; the people of Midgard travel great distances to trade with far‑off lands, and they hold festivals and trade fairs to entice others to visit them. The sections below detail travel, trade, and festivals common in Midgard.

**Mule Trains, Barges, and Wagon Trains**

Mule trains, barges, wagon trains, and even a few dwarven airships move cargo from spring to late fall, but none of the roads are easy: the threats of bandits, goblins, snows and avalanches, deadly fey, and worse undead all require vigilance and preparation. Most merchants move their cargoes only under heavy guard.

**TABLE 1–3: DAILY PAY FOR GUARDS**


| **Type** | **Pay (gp/day)** |
|---|---|
| Archer | 2 |
| Cleric | 10 |
| Crossbow | 1 |
| Scout | 3 |
| Outrider, mounted | 6 |
| Wagon master | 20 |
| Wizard | 12 |

**Hiring:** Wagon masters are notoriously picky about who they hire, fearing cowardice, desertion, lack of martial skill, and—worst of all—betrayal of cargos and timetables to bandits or rival merchant groups. In most cases, a new hire begins as a scout, archer, or a lowly crossbow cranker.

**Novice, Veteran, and Heroic Pay:** In all cases, a novice of any type is untrained and receives half the usual pay. A veteran of the type listed is 2nd to 4th level and receives standard pay. A heroic guard is 5th level and receives 10 times the usual pay. The job pays out on safe arrival at the caravan or mule train’s destination.

**TABLE 1–4: PACK ANIMALS & TRANSPORT**


| **Item** | **Availability** | **Cost (gp)** |
|---|---|---|
| Barge, small | 20% | 2,000 |
| Barge, large | 10% | 5,000 |
| Cart, open 2-wheeled | 80% | 60 |
| Pack horse, sumpter | 80% | 100 |
| Horse train | 25% | 1,200 |
| Mule | 100% | 8 |
| Mule, dwarven | 10% | 25 |
| Mule train (50 mules) | 40% | 800 |
| Ox | 90% | 15 |
| Wagon, armored | 10% | 2,500 |
| Wagon, supply | 50% | 300 |
| Wagon, covered | 50% | 500 |
| Wagon, Kariv | 10% | 500 |

**SPRING TRAVEL TIMES**

Estimated travel times are listed on Table 1-5, using swift horseback and ship travel first and then travel by foot, mule train, or slow cart over poor roads and wilderness; more settled regions allow faster travel. Estimates can vary wildly from actual time required due to prevailing winds, inclement weather, terrain, and road conditions. None of these travel times include use of magical conveyances or deep magic such as shadow roads or catslide alleys.

All blue routes with a single number are largely or entirely waterborne. Sea or river travel is included to minimize time for some entries.

Assume all ship routes cost at least 5 gp/day for a single trusted passenger through safe waters, 8 gp/day (or more) for dangerous waters. Costs triple if also transporting a mount, and quadruple if the mount is a warhorse.

### Trade Fairs
**Trade Fairs**

Each summer and until harvest time, the various free cities and larger merchant towns gather at great market fairs, many of them specializing in particular goods: cloth and dyes, leathers, livestock, ironwork, scrolls and religious icons, or various special foodstuffs such as ale, wine, cheeses, or fish.

**TABLE 1–6: TRADE FAIRS**


| **Place** | **Month/Date** | **Specialty** |
|---|---|---|
| Bemmea | Midwinter | arcana, cantrips, familiars |
| Birch Fairgrounds | Last Leaf | elf work, herbs, nuts, memory philters |
| Bourgund | Redleaf | perfumes, silks, lace |
| Capleon | Goldflower | fish, tea, salt, spice |
| Cronepisht | High Summer | horses, oxen, sheep |
| Friula | Sowing | books, dyes, pearls, scrolls, vellum |
| Krakovar | Midsummer | amber, fish, horses, blood coins |
| Kubourg Cantonal | Goldflower | cheeses, tools, wool |
| Maillon | Harvest Tide | alchemy, ceramics |
| Melana | Mustering | armor, knives, weapons |
| Triolo | Thunders | glass, spices, sailcloth |
| Trombei | Last Leaf | beer, horses |
| Salzbach | Redleaf | dyed leathers, salt |
| Zigistad | Goldflower | metals, wine |
| Zobeck | Midsummer | clockwork, fine weavings, jewelry |

**Bemmea, Gathering of Thoth-Hermes:** The Bemmean midwinter fair of arcanists and bookbinders. Caters to mages, wizards, and other arcanists, with a smattering of priests of Thoth-Hermes.

**Birch Fairgrounds, Birch Queen’s Fair:** Deep in the Summer Lands side of the Arbonesse Forest, with an entrance somewhere along the Neurabon River, the Birch Queen’s Fair buys and sells everything from cantrips and cloaks of elvenkind to memories, skills, and luck. A dangerous fair for those who are not wary. The shadow fey are often in attendance.

**Bourgund, Rose Knight’s Emporium:** A mixture of the ephemeral and the magically infused, this is perhaps the most volatile and fleeting event of this kind, involving perfumery, fey magic, dueling, the honor of the houses of Dornig, and the swaggering strength of the alchemists of Maillon. Banditry is common just outside Bourgund’s borders before and after the event.

**Capleon, Baron’s Trade Fair:** Spices, salt, tea, and more trade hands at the Baron’s Fair. Notorious for espionage, intrigue, and assassinations.

Cronepisht, Horse Trade: Livestock of all kinds are sold at the fair in Cronepisht, primarily sheep, oxen, and cattle but also monsters such as winter wolves, double eagles, dogmoles, and even some familiars. The most exotic animal market outside Harkesh, Mhalmet, or Nuria.

**Friula, Scribe’s Fair:** In spring, the Friulans play good hosts (for once) and invite the world to buy their pearls, dyes, books, and scrolls. Visitors can bring books or scrolls to sell; it’s an easy way to make some money in Friula.

**Krakovar, Farmer’s Fair:** The fair deals in fish and horses, amber and birchbark, linen, honey, and much more from the Krakovan villages. A rival to the Zobeck Midsummer Fair, but catering to the Northlands and (recently) to the Morgau knights and troops.

**Kubourg Cantonal, Dwarfmoot:** Much more than a trade fair, the Kubourg Cantonal fair features dwarven ironwork, mercenary hiring and equipping, cheeses, woolens, and blades galore. It also provides court rulings on matters of cantonal law, the election of hall chieftains, an occasion for bride-prices and wergild to be paid, and raucous masses to Ninkash (which outsiders might consider drunken beer hall fights).

**Maillon, Alchemist’s Gatherum:** The strange folk of Maillon wait until after the harvest and then sell all the potions they have left before winter sets in. Some remarkable concoctions are available, as well as many frauds. A side trade in ceramic containers and copperwork has grown in recent years.

**Melana, Armoring Fair:** The smiths of Melana sell a great deal of iron and weapons to their cantonal cousins each year, and equally as much to the mercenaries of the Seven Cities. The whole city reeks of oil and iron for days.

**Triolo, Fleet Fair:** The Fleet Fair started as a way to equip Triolan ships and merchants of the Middle Sea with sailcloth and rope. Now the Triolans sell a great deal of spice and glass as well. Traditionally held on Sphinx Island at the harbor entrance.

**Trombei, Golden Ceres Fair:** If you don’t care about ale and horses, you have no reason to visit Trombei for this fair. If these topics hold your interest, nowhere else offers as much horseflesh and as many nights of drunken revelry.

**Salzbach, Salt Fair:** The salt of Salzbach sells to the highest bidders in the autumn of each year, and taken on the roads before winter sets in. A quiet, mercantile fair with little carousing and a lot of money changing hands.

**Zigistad, Wine Week:** Vintners sell barrels of wine, dwarves sell ingots of ore, and everyone goes home happy. A rather rowdy festival in a devout city, sometimes leading to brawls and arrests. Centaurs are explicitly not welcome. Elfmarked priests of Baccho sometimes see it as a good place to preach the tenets of that fading faith, and hold at least one Drunkard’s Mass during the week.

**Zobeck, Midsummer Fair:** Featuring the finest weaving, the most outrageous jewelry and clockworks, and sometimes a flying city visiting from Sikkim. The Zobeck Fair is a spectacle like no other, and recently, the shadow fey have brought moonsteel weapons and memory philters to sell at the fair. On rare occasions, the Griffon Knights auction a surplus griffon egg.

### Major Festivals
**Major Festivals**

As a relief from the toil and danger of daily life, the holidays of the calendar mark a series of festivals, rites, and occasional processions meant to signal the changing seasons, to mark great times of victory, and to give the pious an occasion for reflection and the discharge of their duties to the gods.

**New Year’s Dawn**

At the first sign of spring comes the New Year, when the light of Lada the Golden drives away evil spirits, or when mages’ fireworks do the same. The holiday begins in the early hours with a procession to the town center, and then waiting to see the sun rise over the horizon. As soon as it does, celebrants clang on pots and ring bells to drive out bad fortune and welcome good luck for the coming year.

Exchanges of gifts are common among family members, and many places have superstitions about what you can and cannot do on the first day of the year, such as keeping a full pantry, not leaving the house, or leaving a basket of food on the doorstep the night before.

**Mustering Days**

The campaigning season starts early in the spring (especially in the Seven Cities) and the mustering is the day when soldiers must report to their captains, captains to their lords, and lords to their kings. It is a day of oaths, calling up of peasant levies, and launching a season of raids, war, and commerce. The holiday stretches over three days: one to travel to the festival, then a day for swearing of oaths and contracts, then a day of blessings and prayer to Mavros before the march to war. The holiday is widely celebrated in the Magdar Kingdom, Bourgund, Verrayne, and Melana, and serves as an initiation for young warriors, who fight “Mustering Bouts” against each other to crown a “Chosen of Mavros.” 

The holiday’s variable date is declared by the local priest of Thor, Perun, or Mavros. Given weather and climate, the dates of the holiday depend on the condition of the roads and rivers. In the sunny south, Mustering can take place in the first week of Springmelt (or even the last week of Deep Winter). In the north, Mustering rarely takes place in Springmelt, and the holiday more often ocurs in the first or second week of Sowing.

**Rites of Spring**

The priests of Yarila and Porevit, druids, village elders, or wise women oversee the festival of sowing and fertility on the equinox. The priests bless the fields and the flocks and pray for their health and a successful harvest. The devout spread wine and sometimes lamb’s blood on the fields, and young courting couples hasten to the fields after dark to plant seeds of their own.

The Spring rites are a little more dangerous in the Mharoti Empire, in the form of the Egg Festival. Dragons retreat from their usual haunts to guard their nests, while their vassals and supporters keep a week-long vigil that ends with the Hatching Day, a day of joyous celebration when young kobolds, dragonborn, wyverns, drakes, and even true dragons are said to have their first birthday. Indeed, many do hatch around this time, though rarely precisely at the spring equinox.

The second day of the Rites of Spring is the Day of Misrule. On this day, a child is pronounced high priest or crowned king or queen. To celebrate the festival, a child wears a crown or full priestly regalia and makes pronouncements that adults seek to fulfill, though often the commands lead to a day of chaos and confusion. The festival is especially popular in the Seven Cities, the Magocracy of Allain, and the Grand Duchy of Dornig.

**Crown Festival**

Most nations celebrate the birth or coronation of a noble ruler. The Greater Duchy of Morgau honors the coronation of Prince Lucan some 300 years ago and his recent ascension as king in Goldflower, with the gift of 12 comely maidens to his court from the people of the realm. The Mharoti Empire observes the Pact Day of the first dragons and the Founder Mharot by the rendering of tribute to the dragons by their people, and renewing their oath of alliance to the sultan. In the Magdar Kingdom, the queen gives loaves and olives to all visitors to her palace during the Crown Festival.

**Summer Festival**

A festival of warmth, trade, oaths, and friendship, the Summer Festival occurs at a crossroads or fairground at the solstice. The Summer Festival is a popular time for marriages and betrothals, horse trading, and fair dealings with strangers and old friends alike. Priests of Volund are especially sought after to bless anvils and livestock, hold funds for wagers, and negotiate marriage contracts. The festival overwhelms trade for a day in hubs such as Triolo, Capleon, Salzbach, and Zobeck.

**Harvest Dances**

In the bright harvest moonlight, after the sheaves are gathered and the threshed grain is stored in the granaries, farmers celebrate with dances late at night. Dancing, gambling, and merriment prevails, and music, foot races, and even magical fireworks are sometimes part of the celebrations. The festival takes different forms in every nation, but all peasants and nobles count their blessings at the end of the growing season and give thanks to Ceres or Ninkash or Baccho. Shops, workshops, guildhalls, and smithies all close during the harvest dances, and only taverns, inns, and shrines are open.

**Lantern Festival**

A month after the winter solstice, when the night is dark and spring seems most distant, the people celebrate the returning sun with a parade of lanterns and candles. They send prayers to Lada, Khors, and Aten in elaborate ceremonies involving candles, lanterns, illumination magic, and sometimes lantern or candle drakes. A torchlit or candlelit singing parade might wind its way around an entire town as part of the Lantern Festival; other places send small floating lights into the sky as part of a solar mass. The festival ends early for children, and at dawn for the priests and the devout who maintain a vigil through the night.

### Minor Festivals
**Minor Festivals**

These minor festivals are celebrated only in parts of Midgard or are not celebrated every year.

**Axe Festival:** A rare festival held during the red moon of a lunar eclipse, the Axe Festival is a propitious time to sacrifice to Hecate or (for those of darker bent) to Marena, the Red Goddess. Blood rites, kidnappings, and ritual torture can mar the celebrations, but some wizards and witches swear by the festival’s power when crafting new magical items.

**Bear King’s Challenge:** Each year in Björnrike, or in the fey lands near it, the Bear King calls the strong and the wise to a set of challenges. Each year the challenges vary somewhat, with old contests and new, and each year the winner of the contests is crowned as the King of Bears—and some say, is transformed into one of the bearfolk! It is a festival much recounted in song and fey poetry, though the actual gathering is smaller than some.

**Ghost Night:** Also called Hag Night, this goblin festival is honored with masks, invocations of the elders, and candle offerings. The Ghost Night is the first new moon of the winter, when things are their darkest. Some celebrants smoke or offer requiem at this time, and seek answers from departed elders.

**Night of Open Roads:** The first winter moon is a time to communicate with ancestors and spirits of the dead. This festival is especially sacred to Charun, Lord of the Dead. It is also an unusually good time to travel to the Shadow Realm, to open portals, and to build secret shrines or to raise the dead, and thus it is beloved of necromancers. The festival’s celebration is especially common in Dornig and the Seven Cities.

**Slaughter Festival:** Also called the Brewer’s Festival, the Slaughter Festival focuses around meat and drink: the autumn butchering plus drinking the first ale of the season, overseen by the clergy of Ninkash. Animals are smoked or salted for the winter, and the best beer is chosen by the goddess (or her priests). Trombei holds the largest celebration of the Slaughter Festival. Priests of the Hunter celebrate as well, though generally only in the dark woods; stories claim their sacrifice is always a grown man or woman, hunted through the forests, their boiled bones left on the Hunter’s altar.

## Ley Lines and Shadow Roads
**LEY LINES AND SHADOW ROADS**

Midgard’s ley lines make it a place where magic is, if not common, at least part of the landscape and often a source of feuds, investigation, and mystery.

Two of the strongest of these tools are the ability to use ley lines to expand and empower spells (see MHH or MPG for details) and to use them to cover great distances. The second of these tools are the shadow roads, called the fey roads in Dornig and among the elves. They are roads to travel not through the mortal world, but along mystic channels of power through the Shadow Realm, covering hundreds or even thousands of miles in days.

Long ago, the elven arcanists drove their mystic passages through the dark wood and forbidding tunnels of Shadow. They drove back the shade hounds and other strange beasts, laid down walls and river passages, and forged mithral bridges across bottomless chasms. At the height of their empire they passed through Shadow at will, as readily as a human might cross a drawbridge. But there were things in the moat that is Shadow, waiting.

### Ley Lines
**Ley Lines**

Ley lines are the scales of Veles, the bones of the world, the blood that makes Midgard live and makes its magic strong. They are invisible rivers of power, and the connecting elements of shadow roads and ancient wards as well as the spells of liches and the living. Put another way, ley lines are the sources used to power fey roads, but not every ley line is necessarily a road. Most small ley lines lack the power to sustain a major or permanent road. The exceptions are the strongest and most titanic ley lines, and some few ley lines made to open as shadow roads by the cunning of the shadow fey or the elves.

As power sources, ley lines empower magic both arcane and divine in most places across the face of Midgard. They are invisible to normal sight, but to experienced spellcasters with the Nurian mage feat (see MHH or MPG) they are visible as glowing strings or bands of light. Despite their power, ley lines are not universal: some regions have no ley lines to speak of (such as the Western Wastes), and in others they can be difficult to find (ley lines are notoriously rare underground).

Ley lines are marked on the world map as lines of lighter color over the sea or land. Many have particular names and a specific appearance to the arcanists who work with them and the travelers who use them as magical roads.

#### Classifying Ley Lines
**Classifying Ley Lines**

Ley lines come in three varieties: weak, strong, and titanic. Weak ley lines are found almost everywhere; they whirl on the wind, burble along streambeds, and spring forth from standing stones and ancient trees. Crossroads sometimes draw weak ley lines, as do bridges.

Weak ley lines are not found inside consecrated holy or unholy buildings or on freshly plowed earth, however. This suppresses their function for a time, but ley lines generally return when the temple falls or when rain or plant growth restores some vital element to the soil.

Strong ley lines are found in places of magical reputation, which often coincide with locations settled by elves, dragons, and other magical races. These are found on hilltops, river confluences, stone circles, druid groves, elven ruins, deep canyons, rocky spires, and similar places.

Titanic ley lines are very rare and sometimes fleeting. They are found in distant places, in the hearts of great temples, and in other special locations such as the Tower of Boreas. Natural wonders such as the peaks of enormous mountains, towering cliffs, volcanoes, forest heartlands, or a glacier’s heart are often anchors. Greater demons, elder dragons, and other creatures of awesome power often make their lairs along titanic ley lines to further augment their magical might.

For further rules governing ley lines, see the MHH, MPG, or Deep Magic for PFRPG.

Each kind of ley line has a specific ratings and power levels. Weak ley lines can only empower or affect spells of level 0 to 3, strong ley lines can power up to 6th level spells, and titanic ley lines can empower spells of all levels. They enable the user to strengthen magic in various ways, many of them familiar to arcane casters, others entirely new. Though the effects are extremely useful, they function only when empowered by the hidden light of the ley lines themselves—some regions have no ley lines, not even weak ones.

#### Named Ley Lines and their Character
**Named Ley Lines and their Character**

Ley lines are roads, sources of power, and links between the mundane world and other planes, primarily the Shadow Realm. Here are more than a dozen of the best-known ley lines and roads, each one strong enough to have a given name and a particular character.

**Angel's Road:** With connections to the River Nuria over the Gidigiga Hills to the east, this titanic ley line serves the god-kings of Nuria Natal as well as the angelic rulers of Ishadia. It burns with fiery light and heat and resembles a desert of endless, whispering sands—with occasional caravanserais inhabited by genies, elemental spirits, angels, and demigods.

**Archer's Walk:** Well kept by the elves, the outer ley line of the Grand Duchy of Dornig always seems a forest of shadows, eerie bird calls, and rustling leaves. Shadow fey, monstrous giants, and other creatures are more common than they once were, but the fey portals leading in and out are secured in the various elven keeps and houses.

**Bear's Cavern:** Connecting the western Seven Cities with the ruins of Al-Rassor, the Bear’s Cavern resembles a series of enormous caves, underwater rivers, and canyon paths. It is said that an illusory or dream version of Al‑Rassor still stands within the Shadow Realm side.

**Black Road:** Surrounding Morgau and passing through the Margreve, the Black Road is a nighttime forest where owls and larger predators are always on the prowl. A very powerful but extremely dangerous shadow road, and yet quite tame for druids and the undead, who find it congenial and full of talkative forest animals, from bats to foxes and from bears to deer and fireflies.

**Demon Mountain Road:** Corrupted at its source at Demon Mountain, this is a ley line that Rothenian shamans tap but rarely dare to traverse. Filled with haunts, spirits, devils, demons, and undead centaur ghosts, the Demon Mountain Road is said to contain the souls of all those killed by the Master of Demon Mountain over the centuries. Extremely friendly to necromancers, diabolists, and blood mages, who often find their magic amplified or enhanced in some fashion by this ley line.

**Dragon's Coil:** The heart of Mharoti elemental magic, this ley line powers most of the larger magical workings of the Dragon Empire. Dragons feud over lands where its rivulets move, and its various portals are all controlled by the morza and timarli, just as the portals in Dornig are controlled. It is a very safe set of roads—for the dragonkin. Jambuka are forbidden from traveling the Dragon’s Coil, and some dragonkin mutter that they should not even foul it by seeking its strength for their hairy, foreign magic.

**Fortune's Road:** The favored ley line of the wandering Kariv east of Hugigrad is often empty, but sometimes entire clans of Kariv are found on it with one of their leaders, taking a shortcut or taking their chances. The shadow road is used by ravenfolk or even centaurs; journeys along it by outsiders or poor geomancers take months, years, or even decades. Occasionally, it is said, a young man stumbles off Fortune’s Road to meet his son or daughter—who is much older than he is!

**Grandmother's Walk:** Baba Yaga’s favored ley line serves her and her daughters and servants and is home to a variety of walking trees, enormous terrorizing birds, and other peculiar creatures. Anyone found using it as a shadow road had best be quick and stealthy. Grandmother is not especially fond of trespassers, though she seems to have some agreement to allow certain Perunalians and members of the Runkestad College access to the Walk in return for access to the Grey Way or other services.

**Grey Way:** A peculiar, foggy, and difficult ley line to walk as a shadow road, it connects Valogrod, the old Summer Gardens of the elves, Reth Saal, and Cogelu. Its power seems muted and visitors believe that the gnomes or shadow fey have hexed it in some way to make passage along it slow.

**Howler's Road:** From Corremel to Saph-Saph to Cindass, this ancient shadow road always resembles a series of stately homes, oases, barge canals, and gardens, making it a much cooler and more civilized journey than a camel-back trip or even a flying carpet. However, mages and geomancers drawing on the Howler’s Road are always overwhelmed by the urge to howl their spells rather than merely speaking them, giving the ley line its name.

**Huginn's Arrow:** Along the Nieder Straits, the Arrow connects the small northlands kingdoms and is extremely popular among the bards of Skaldholm and among the ravenfolk. Together, these two groups keep it largely safe, driving out shadow creatures, trolls, and snow goblins who occasionally seem to gather magical power at one of its rivulets or portals.

**Leviathan's Road:** Out in the distant ocean for much of its length, the Leviathan’s Road is knotted up by Bemmean runes and is also a cold, icy place for sections of its journey. Those geomancers who call on its power often complain that their bones ache from the cold of it.

**Loki's Bridge:** Circling around the isle and north to the giant and troll lands, Loki’s Bridge is a cold road used by trollkin, bearfolk, dwarven shamans—and giants and valkyries. Most who open one of its portals complain of the snow and cold. A few claim that items are stolen from their packs or pockets each time they travel the Bridge.

**Lotus Road:** From Mhalmet to Shibai and the East, the Lotus Road is a reasonably safe path for the powerful, and much less so for the poor and weak. It is said to devour some arcanists and travelers if its rituals are not performed correctly; others claim that a corrupt archmagi simply kills a few travelers each year to keep traffic down past the Jade Tower, a landmark that always appears halfway through a Lotus Road journey. Conjurers and geomancers drawing on its power always smell flowers and fresh breezes; the ley line is thought to hold a secret path to the Seven Heavens. Pontoretto: Through the heart of the Seven Cities, this ley line is said to have been favored by the Valeran elves, and to have provided a direct link to the Summer Lands of Silendora. That link is long broken, but the ley line is well kept and strong, a testament to the work of elven geomancers centuries ago.

**Raven's Road:** From Trollheim to Vidim to Domovogrod, this well-kept ley line serves many shapeshifting shamans, human wizards, and trollkin spirit talkers—but its true masters are the ravenfolk, who patrol it, watch over it, and keep it safe from shadow fey, winter monsters, and giants. It is said that the Raven’s Road is also connected to Valhalla, or at least that a branch of it waters Yggdrasil.

**Red Road:** A ley line largely exhausted from constant use in powerful magic, it trickles from Uqmal to Xirdalan and east to Khandiria. Khandirians and Mharoti and Ishadians have used it for battle magic in the Red Wastes, and little is left of what was once a ley line celebrated in epic verse and memorialized as the “Great River of the True Kings.” Now cracked obelisks mark its usual course, but some geomancers claim it is fading entirely.

**Scholar’s Path:** A strangely serene road filled with roiling clouds, peculiar trees, and a host of runes scratched on every stone and wall. Thought to be somehow influenced by the dragon-dreams of Mharot, and sometimes noted as a tributary or lesser ley line lined to the Dragoncoil. Relatively safe for dragonkin of all kinds, much less so for the furred races.

**Shadow Road:** Deeply connected to the Shadow Realm and controlled by the shadow fey, this ley line near Zobeck leads all the way through the cantons to Friula. Once beloved of both merchants and scholars, it is now primarily used to visit the court of the shadow fey, as its only certain destination is the Shadow Realm itself. Wizards and geomancers using its energy always feel a passing ennui, a sense of despair, and an urge to return to the graves of their loved ones; dark visions are common when drawing on this ley line, and those doing so often weep or sob if performing lengthy rituals or multiple spells in a single day.

**Shield Maiden's Fancy:** Said to be a passage that the valkyries favor, the Shield Maiden’s Fancy is a difficult ley line to gather power from, because of the way it often vanishes or surges under conditions of excess sun or storms. In addition, traveling it usually requires walking up a shadow path onto a glacier or mountaintop, and then returning to a shore; the variation in height makes it quite challenging, even though encounters with thursir giants, winter wolves, or trollkin raiders on the path are rare.

**Sky Road:** A pure and rarely traveled road from mountains and rivers and the lakes in the Qaen Plain, and along rarely seen mountains and hills. An avian race inhabits its upper reaches, and wind dragons sometimes lay their eggs along this ley line, to give their offspring strength and arcane might.

**The Processional:** Connecting the royal cities of Dornig, this well-kept road was once so safe that servants and humans could be sent through it. Now it is rather shadow-bent, with shadow-fey, marauders, and even undead found on its clean paths.

**Void Path:** Under a starry night and unfamiliar constellations, this dark road connects Tabur to Beldestan, and is said to also contain a Shadow Realm fortress built by Void Speaker cultists who would rather not spend their time in the mortal world at all. It is dangerous to use; some claim it whispers and cajoles all those who draw from it, using the Void Speech to draw others to the Ebon fortress somewhere in its coils.

**White Road:** Largely distant from civilized places, the White Road goes from the Magdar Kingdom through White Forest and the Mountain Marches into the Dragon Empire’s lands of Rumela and Marea. It is one of the best ways for human spies to enter the Dragon Empire quickly, taking them near Harkesh in a few days. In the opposite direction, dragonkin forces could (and did) move troops into Illyria to aid in its conquest, avoiding border defenses.

**Wyrm's Spiral:** At its center are the ruins of the Tomb of the First Khan, said to contain an army of undead riders and their steeds. Its power spirals out across the plains, shifting and surging in summer, and quiet and notably weaker in winter. Nomad geomancers claim tapping the Spiral for power feels like a “strong wind from the soul.”

#### Travel Times on the Shadow Roads
**Travel Times on the Shadow Roads**

The time required to move hundreds of miles along the shadow roads is fairly swift, but not instantaneous, and the better-kept and better-warded roads of Dornig (though in some mild disrepair) are far swifter than roads elsewhere. For instance, it takes 1d3 days to pass from any major city in Dornig to the Court of the River King, and 1d3 days to pass between any of the cities of Dornig (or from Dornig to Arbonesse Forest or to the various elven noble courts).

Outside Dornig, things are less certain. It takes 1d6 days if one is traveling from Dornig to someplace farther away (to another domain on the map—Dornig to Zobeck, for example), though the known and functioning gates are few and far between. The same is true of travel outside Dornig entirely, say from Nuria to Mardas Adamant on the Angel’s Road.

Travel time expands to 1d12 if one is traveling to or from the Great Wastes, since the disaster of the Mage Wars has warped these lands. Assume a minimum of 2d12 days to travel to the Southlands or lands east beyond the Dragon Empire.

**TABLE 1–7: SHADOW ROAD LORE**

Make an Intelligence (Arcana) ability check or a Knowledge (arcana) or (planes) skill check at a –5 penalty for non-elves and consult the table below.


| **DC** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1–5 | You don’t know how the shadow roads work. |
| 6–10 | Shadow or fey roads connect two points through magical travel. A spell or passphrase is often required to open one; elves, shadow fey, and the elfmarked seem to have an easier time on them than anyone else. |
| 11–15 | The start and end of a shadow road are set in advance, and the doors to them are never open long. |
| 16–20 | The destination of a shadow road can be changed, but only by a fey. Otherwise, new destinations require obscure incantations or arcane tinkering. |
| 21+ | Some shadow roads are guarded, and others lead in only one direction. |

In the Shadow Realm, the roads cross and recross. A skilled wizard or experienced shadow lord might move from place to place within the plane and between the planes, if he or she knows the correct passages.

To travel a fey road between locations, one must know the path. For most, this means a guide to make the journey between gates safe, but once a person has made the journey, he or she might follow the road later and lead others along the path. Certain fey magic (such as a shadow road spell, or a magical item such as a key of Veles) allows movement among the gates, or even permits shifting the entryways and exits of a road. In addition, some gates require specific spells to operate, or they are bound by magical conditions, such as only functioning on a full moon. As a general rule it takes one to three days to move between gates under normal conditions. But these are not normal times.

**Sights and Encounters on Shadow Roads**

Those who intend to travel along the shadow roads for adventure find it an overgrown chaos of hedge mazes, twisting passages, hollows and delves—the specific character of each road may vary, but all are somewhat notorious for lacking wide vistas or straight paths. Travelers may leave the path and wander at will, but once they attempt to go home, it takes them 1d3 days to find their way. Many have never returned, since those who step off the paths sacrifice any protection offered by the court or the Imperatrix, or even by warding stones or way markers placed by other hands. Shadow creatures, fiends, and celestials all use these roads for purposes of their own, and dislike competition.

In game terms, the shadow roads are filled with dangerous encounters. More powerful adventurers will attract more powerful creatures. Fey and undead are common, as well as hounds of the night, marauder giants, and various other shadow beasts. In addition, the shadow fey guard some roads with their black stone keeps, from which they send their minions forth to prey on the unwary—or at least, collect tolls in the form of memory philters (see the Rules Appendixes), scrolls, or silver. Travelers using these arcane highways do so at their own risk.

## Magic and Scholarship
**MAGIC AND SCHOLARSHIP**

At the forefront of passing along arcane knowledge, ancient languages, and an understanding of Midgard’s place in the heavens are the magical colleges, which turn apprentices into archmages, and whose dusty tomes and bright wands are both potent weapons of war and great tools of understanding the world.

**Famous Colleges of Magic**

Midgard has dozens of schools of magic, almost all of them among human settlements and most of them taking candidates for study on the basis of status, arcane ability, and ability to pay or to serve a length apprenticeship (10 to 12 years is typical). The best-known and best-regarded colleges of magic include the following institutions.

**Academy of Bemmea:** Bemmea sustains more than 20 colleges of study, but the first among equals is the Academy of Bemmea. This academy operates without a physical building, since it meets entirely in ad hoc spell creations such as magnificent mansions and other summoned domiciles. The greatest of these, the Peerless Collapsible Collegium, retains the academy’s lavishly appointed refectory, libraries (it has three), classrooms, and even student quarters and a faculty hall. The students are taken by invitation only, and the scholars and tutors are appointed by the existing members.

The whole is a rather elite club, but it rewards ability and it tends to avoid accepting members of chaotic or evil bent. The Academy is rightly considered snobbish but extremely capable, and its graduates have a bit of intimidation working in their favor, since the current Exarch of Bemmea is their honorary provost. The actual day-to‑day leadership is provided by Senior Lecturer Harman Lottbert, a wildly bearded bald man with a prodigious record of arcane research and a powerful inspiration to his students. The school specializes in glyphs, ley lines, wardings, enchantments, and conjurations.

**Arcane Collegium of Zobeck:** Small but highly influential, the Arcane Collegium rarely takes more than a few dozen students. Its fields of study are peculiar as well, with an emphasis on clockwork magic (sometimes called gear magic), dwarven forms of alchemy and divination, and the school of illumination, sometimes called star and shadow magic. It is led by Collegium Guildmaster Orlando, a wizard of deep insight and peculiar habits, prone to whimsy and to powerful intuition. Other masters of the collegium specialize in divination and illusion, but the outside world sees the Zobeck Collegium as both inventive and frankly bizarre, with little respect for the traditions and practices upheld elsewhere. At the same time, it’s hard to argue with results, and the Arcane Collegium turns out excellent students with shocking regularity, keeping up with the much more cutthroat schools of Bemmea and Runklestad.

**Bibliotori of Friula:** Though they are usually described as “librarians” or “scholars,” the Bibliotori are arcanists of one stripe or another, and many of them teach history of magic, summoning, divination, abjuration, and so forth. The leader of their library is Lynnean Verdia, Most Learned, Keeper of the Great Library—and her goal is the increase of knowledge through the acquisition of scrolls, codices, books, and folios of all kinds. Keeper Lynnean sponsors expeditions that the Bibliotori pay for and profit from, while those secretive Bibliotori retain their anonymity to do further research into natural and arcane wonders. The school is half exploratory and half secretive, and amasses hoards of information that it rarely shares.

**Blood College of Doresh:** This notorious college is led by the archlich Orgupash, one of the great allies of the vampire King Lucan of Morgau, and it exists to teach the control of wizardly and sorcerous power to the vampires, ghouls, and dhampir of Morgau and Doresh, with a sideline in promising humans who serve the Blood Goddess with full-throated fervor. The vile lessons specialize in necromancy, divination, and enchantments, along with transmutation and evocation.

**College at Runkelstad:** This riverine college on a small island produces some of the finest enchanters of Midgard, and it also does a fair business in abjuration, wardings, and bindings. Unlike many other arcane colleges, it does not offer special privileges to the children of its former students or to the wealthiest members of society. The apprentices and students must simply convince the teachers at the college that they show potential to both practice magic capably and to serve the Magdar Kingdom against the Mharoti and Morgau. The College at Runkelstad is more openly a function of the crown than most colleges, reflected in the fact that its arcanists gain their positions by royal decree. Their leader is Doctor of the Arcane Mariano Pretarza, a gray-haired woman with a great understanding of arcane tactics and the military application of magic.

**Dragoncoil College:** This elementalists’ school in Harkesh is a much quieter affair than the brawling of the various monks and priestly orders in the streets. Most of its students are dragonkin and kobolds, though it accepts a few of the furred folk if they are promising enough. Hidden in four plain towers around a pigeon-infested courtyard, the main site of the college is a rather rich and modern building, with newly applied frescos and bright blue roof tiles. It is said that the college sits directly on an anchor point for the Dragon’s Coil ley line (see page 40), though the dragons and dragonkin are silent on this point.

**Fallen College of Caelmarath:** Sometimes called the Invisible College, this infamous group was founded by a group of wizards and apprentices who survived the Mage Wars and agreed to meet 20 years later to restore the magic of their lost lands. They include necromancers, ooze wizards, astromancers, and diabolists. Widely considered an evil and malicious group, they use magical kidnapping, blackmail, and extortion to gather funds, and ally with the worst elements of magical practice in the Wastes and elsewhere. Their leader is the red-horned Truno Eldrepass (NE male tiefling wizard 11), a dandified fellow who also happens to be a close confidant (some say lover) of the Oracle of Kammae.

**Hecate’s Chambers:** The function of magic and the arcane in the Oracle’s state of Kammae Straboli is central to the function of government, and the Oracle depends on mages of several kinds to expand the power of Nethus and to work the will of Hecate. The school called Hecate’s Chambers is both a seminary and an arcane collegium, and the two sides are not deeply separated. All students are at least nominally worshippers of Hecate, and all priests are familiar with the fundamental arcane principals of illusion, enchantment, and crafting of magical items. The keeper of Hecate’s Chambers is the Black Chamberlain, Ustoros Trismagos (NE human male wizard 16).

**Maillon Guild of Master Chemysts:** This highly successful guild and the city are so tightly interwoven that they are often referred to in the same breath. Andress the Ageless, the eternally young leader of the Guild, ably leads the alchemists. They sell their wares in the Bottle Market in Maillon, and they also create remarkable numbers of potions and unguents and elixirs for trade via mule train or barge trade, shipping most of them to Bemmea and the Grand Duchy of Dornig. However, their distinctive pelican-stamped wax seals are found as far afield as Harkesh and Skaldholm, and the Tsar of Vidim is said to be a fan of their healing draughts and certain potions of strength and vitality.

As a teaching institution, there is no better place to learn the practice of alchemy in all its forms, and Maillon’s master chymists are remarkably open to any and all students—as long as they can pay the fees, which range from 250 gp for the lowliest bottle-washing wretch to 5,000 gp a season for noble lordlings seeking to master the elements.

**Great Linnorm House:** While bards maintain their traditions at Skaldholm, and the druids have circles throughout the northern forests, arcane traditions are a little thinner in the North and largely directed by the dwarves and a few human and trollkin wizards at the Great Linnorm House, built with rafters taken from the bones of an elder dragon near Thunder Mountain. This great hall echoes the Northlander style, with beams of linnorm bone and runestones used in the curriculum. The forms of magic taught at Linnorm House are typically kept secret by its devotees, but seem to involve skinchanging and transmutation, as well as alchemy, magical smithwork, summoning and conjuration, and the uses of rune magic and grudge magic. Some of the female adepts taught at Linnorm House learn angelic magic as well.

**Scolia Valeresh:** Half a militant order devoted to the elven war god and half a school for war wizards and battle scions, the Scolia in Valera is led by First Fencing Master and Ley Adept Tikkalan Illuvitesh, who also styles himself the Last Knight of Valresh—the whole school tends to florid titles and lengthy descriptions of simple spells. Despite his outrageous hats and lacy shirts, Master Illuvitesh is deadly serious about the fusion of magic and martial traditions. Arcane archery is part of the standard curriculum, as are classes on various battles and arcane devotions to Mavros and the scourging of enemies through magical fire and sword. The Scolia Valeresh claims to be the only place where secrets of elven battle magic is still taught in Midgard.

**Templeforge Alchemist’s Guild:** High in the mountains of the Ironcrag Cantons stands the Templeforge pilgrimage site, home to a handful of airships and the site where smiths and horsefolk alike journey in yearly summer pilgrimages to venerate the Hammer of Volund. Less well known is its school of alchemy and sorcery, for the dwarves of the Cantons are as fond of forge magic as any, and practice their share of evocation and elemental magic. The Alchemist’s Guild is responsible for the various fiery trumps and dragonheads employed by cantonal dwarves, as well as their holy flaming oil, their flame-spewing wands, and a special form of enchanted jewels, the seer stones, that grant keen sight from mountaintops to great distances.

**Thoth’s Temple:** The oldest school of magic in Midgard is Thoth’s Temple in an oasis two days travel west of Nuria, which still functions as a shrine and pilgrimage site. Thoth’s Temple outgrew its original religious charter, now featuring dozens of monumental halls, an army of ushabti servants, an enormous library of scrolls and tablets, and other wonders, including a mausoleum complex inhabited by several liches. Thoth’s priesthood retains great influence over the curriculum and the selection of candidates during admission, but leaves the instruction and pedagogy to a wizardly order separate from the priests. Their mastery of ley line magic is profound, and there is some speculation that the Order of Thoth is attempting to build a flying city on the model laid down by Sikkim. This is one of the most prestigious magical colleges of Midgard, and its wizards are both feared and respected.

### Unnamed
**28 Common and Archaic Languages**

Many languages are common in Midgard, with the following warranting further description. An educated or well-traveled adventurer might learn any of these languages.

 1. **Common:** The most common language in the Crossroads and the Seven Cities. All characters speak it.

 2. **Aklo:** The language of aboleths, derro, linnorms, gibbering mouthers, and other bizarre creatures of the underworld. Rarely heard on the surface.

 3. **Ankeshelian:** A dead human language, more than 3,000 years old, whose runes and glyphs are still used in magical writing today.

 4. **Caelmaran:** A very rare language, a human dialect of Infernal. Still spoken by the Master of Demon Mountain and a few wizards. Grants +1 to a Charisma (Persuasion) ability check or +2 to a Diplomacy skill check with devils, demons, and other fiends 1/day.

 5. **Darakhul:** The language of the Ghoul Imperium, also called Ghoulish, Charun’s Tongue, or Undercommon, is an offshoot of Common and can be partially understood by surface dwellers who have Intelligence of 15 or higher. It is widely spoken in Morgau and Doresh and by vampires, and thus serves as the common tongue of the undead. Those who speak it gain a +1 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) ability check or +2 to a Diplomacy skill check with undead 1/day.

 6. **Draconic or Mharoti:** The language of drakes, dragons, and dragonkin in the Mharoti Empire. Rarely spoken by non-scaly races, it grants +1 to a Charisma (Persuasion) ability check or +2 to a Diplomacy skill check with scaly creatures 1/day.

 7. **Druidic:** A degenerate form of Elvish mixed with Common. Rarely used outside religious ceremonies. Druidic can be spoken even when in animal form.

 8. **Dwarvish:** One of the first languages, widely spoken in the Northlands, Krakova, and the Ironcrag cantons. Older documents are written in a slightly different script called “Anvil Dwarvish” and can be difficult to decipher (typically an easy Intelligence check, depending on the topic and age of the document).

  9.** Elemental:** The language of elemental creatures of fire, water, air, and earth. Related to Draconic.

10. **Enochian:** The language of the Celestial Sphere, spoken in Ishadia and among the Seven Heavens. Sometimes called Ishadian.

11. **Elvish:** The language of the Elflands, the River Court, the Grand Duchy’s Court, and elsewhere. Remarkably unchanged over the past 2,000 years. Documents in the precursor language, Old Elvish (also called Thornish), can still be read with some effort by characters with an Intelligence of 15 or higher.

12. **Feather Speech (Pinion):** The silent language of the ravenfolk, spoken by the ruffling, position, and movement of feathers. Largely impossible for other races to speak unless aided by feathered fans, and even then, the effect is primarily comical.

13. **Gnomish:** A dialect of Elvish, with many words borrowed from Infernal. Those who speak it gain +1 to the DC of their illusions or enchantment spells 1/day.

14. **Huginn’s Speech:** The spoken language of the ravenfolk. Remarkably constant in the North among the huginn and in the South among the heru. Sometimes used as a thieves’ cant.

15. **Illyrian:** An archaic language, rarely used outside the court of Illyria and among nobles, and now outlawed in the Dragon Empire’s new province of Rumela. Those who speak it gain +2 to Diplomacy in the Seven Cities 1/day, since it is considered a sign of noble status and personal tragedy.

16. I**nfernal:** A planar language spoken by demons and devils.

17. **Kariv:** A dialect of Common, flavored with many borrowed words and bits of cant. Those who speak it gain +2 to Diplomacy with Kariv wanderers and centaurs 1/day.

17. **Khandirian:** A human dialect related to Enochian, spoken in the East.

18. **Khazzaki:** An argot of eastern tongues, spoken only among the nomads.

19.** Kobold:** A somewhat simplified (some might say debased) dialect of Draconic, though most dragons and drakes pretend not to understand it.

20. **Minotaur or Rue-Thothka:** The language of the minotaurs is complex and resonant, and especially favored in the South. Its tones are guttural and dangerous sounding.

21. **Morphoi:** The language of the Western Ocean and most aquatic races.

22. **Northern Tongue:** Also called the Rune Tongue or Giantish. A human language deeply related to Dwarvish and sharing many loan words.

23. **Nurian or the Southern Tongue:** A human corruption of Enochian, the divine language. A great deal of ritual magic is written in Nurian.

24. **Trolsung:** Related to the language of the giants, Trolsung has a quicker patter but retains the giantish love of riddles, kennings, and wordplay.

25. **Umbral:** The language of the shadow elves, a dialect of Elvish.

26. **Void Speech:** The language of the outer darkness, Void dragons, and alien gods, a tongue not meant for humanoid speech at all. It disquiets those who hear it, and adds +1 to the DC of fear-related spells and skill checks.

27. **Vos’ghaen:** An ancient human tongue, related to Ankeshelian. Speakers of Vos’ghaen are often wizards and masters of glyph magic.

28. **Whisperium:** A silent language common among gnomes and diabolists. If you know Whisperium, you may cast a spell silently once per day.

## The World
**The World**

The world of Midgard resembles a coin surrounded by a snake. The serpent is Veles, the Father of Serpents, who girds the edges of the earth. One face of the coin is the land most people know. The elves claim the obverse is the Bright Land, also called the Elflands, the Summer Lands, and the Fair Place. Here lies the homeland of the elves (and gnomes, and other fey), a land both more magical and wilder than the known world.

Between the two sides of this coin lies the Shadow Realm. It is a land of grays and darkness untouched by Khors’s lamp. It is a plane of long shadows and unending dusk. It is a land of nightmares, in which the unready and unprepared can be lost forever. And it is not empty.

This shaded desolation was pierced by the magic of the elves, which allowed them to arrive in Midgard among the savage races living in the wreckage of Ankeshel. They wove a web of passages between their world and this one. These were the fey roads, built using the power of ley lines and strengthened by that magic.

**The Sun, Moon, and Heavens**

Midgard is geocentric, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars swiftly circling the world. Beyond that, strange other worlds link to Midgard through dark roads, both sullied heavens and golden hells.

The sun is the chariot of Khors the sun god, or of Aten the sun god, or perhaps a lamp of one of the other cults of the sun. When it disappears, it presumably shines on the other side of the flat world. As the sun passes the edge of the world, some believe that the World Serpent snaps at it, someday to consume its light and plunging the world into the eternal darkness of Fimbulwinter.

Midgard has a single, primary moon and seven lesser moons called the Mage’s Stars, used as a common symbol in arcane workings and in the coat of arms of the Magocracy of Allain. The moon is called just that, though some wizards and sages call it Ond or Selles, names in older languages also meaning “the moon.”

Midgard stars are living creatures, lesser lights to the sun god’s greater light. A young star might require someone to defend it from the dark gods who would happily devour it. On rare occasions, these stars come down from the heavens to visit people on the face of the world.

Five known planets orbit the world of Midgard, though elves insist on the existence of a sixth planet, called Idelitan or Melgros, that human eyes are too weak to see.

**Asaph, the Green Planet:** A planet that shines white and green, Asaph is rumored to hold powerful influence over the seas and air, and alchemists associate it with elemental air, mithral, and spirits.

**Ermaon, the Jumping Planet:** Fastest and strangest of the planets, small and difficult to see. Some believe it is not a planet at all, but a comet trapped in a circle, or a lost court of the far-wandering shadow fey trapped in a chaotic spiral. Alchemists associate Ermaon with silver or mercury.

**Melgros, the Dark Wanderer:** Not visible to the human eye, this planet is a dark and mysterious home of malevolent forces, including nightshades, demons, and devils of all sorts. Stories dating to Ankeshelian times claim it is the source of both a soul-consuming fire and all black magic. Elves refer to it as “Idelitan” or “the Archer’s Planet” because those who see it happen to be the best archers. Alchemists associate the planet with adamant.

**Temperos the Giant:** A yellow planet, easy to see in the night sky and commonly linked with the giants of the Haunted Lands. Those giants held it to be the home of the gods and called it Gades, the All-Father, a name still used among savants, alchemists, and citizens of Bourgund. Alchemists associate it with copper, tin, and bronze.

**Tiomoutiri, the Golden Planet:** This bright and shining planet is most visible around sunrise and is widely connected with Khors the sun god and with Lada the Golden. Astronomers of Nuria Natal believe it governs the health and sexual aspects of life. Priests of Khors and Lada perform their high rituals when Tiomoutiri is in the sky. Alchemists associate the planet with gold and orichalcum.

**Zuhal, the Dragon:** The elves claim that this red distant planet has rings. Though it is a powerful symbol in the heavens, living dragons relate it with blood and life force. Alchemists associate it with platinum, earth, and minerals, and Zuhal is widely considered the planet that controls aspects of magic and the arcane.

**Planes and Hells**

Most adventures occur in the mortal realm of Midgard, but sometimes devils, angels, and the heralds of the gods show themselves and offer greater horizons. These planes and hells are known to the people of Midgard.

**Eleven Hells**

Scholars frequently speculate about the links, if any, between Midgard and the Hells. Niemheim and old Caelmarath, the most debauched and diabolical of the magocracies, hold the highest likelihood of answers. Both nations have a history of connections to the 11 Hells, known as the Hells of Fire, Ice, Darkness, Styx‑Lethe, Insects, Plague, Acid, Cannibals, Ignorance, Lies, and Blood. The exact list is disputed: sometimes Fire is described as Sulfur, Acid is called the Abyss, and the Hell of Cannibals occasionally the Hell of Decay or Putrefaction. Even the Hell of Blood is confused with the plane of Spears (see Geirrhöth below). These planes are the homes of devils and demonic forces, and the common people of Midgard correlate the various supernatural evils as “the Eleven.”

**Evermaw, Plane of Undeath**

Evermaw is confused with the Eleven Hells, since it is an afterlife of ghouls and vampires, cannibals and gluttons. A road like a lolling tongue sprawls through a waterless desert of blood dust, passing towers that sprout like crooked white teeth, until it’s swallowed by the gulletlike sinkhole that houses the city of Vulture’s Beyond, osseous capital of the Hunger God Vardesain, as well as the Eternal Palace of the dry undead lord Mot and the Crystal Necropolis of the guardian god Anu-Akma. Here ziggurats flow with the blood of daily sacrifices, liches study new necromancies of flesh and bone, and the cooks claim they can skin and butcher anything, from ghosts to gods.

**Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void**

Far beyond other planes, connected to Midgard by only the most tenuous twisting paths, is Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void, the Realm Beyond. Little can definitively be said of it, other than it harbors monsters and creatures of unspeakable evil, horrors such as nightshades, yithians, gugs, shoggoths, hideous Void dragons, spiders of Leng, hounds of Tindalos, the shining children of Caelmarath, and many more. Few wish to visit, but creatures from that distant and primordial realm seem eager to visit the mortal world. Dark gods from Addrikah to the White Goddess and from Chernobog to the Goat of the Woods seem at home in the Void, or at least draw power from it. The place does offer great power to those who swear their lives and souls to its causes, but those poor deluded beings who listen to such offers rarely live to see any promised rewards.

**Klingedesh, Plane of the Marketplace**

Imagine a tangled nest in the branches of the World Tree, formed of stacked shops, stalls, nooks, and crannies radiating out in all directions, connected by bridges of rope, wood, and bone. It’s a maze of commerce, friendly to all. Visitors can walk the entire way around and never see the same item twice. All things can be bought or sold here—for every faire, fete, and bazaar that ever was is a road to and from the Marketplace, and it connects to both the cities of Midgard and the festivals of the Fair Lands.

**Ravatet, Plane of Rusty Gears**

Every plane has its secrets, and the domain of Rava the Gear Goddess is no exception. A visitor can discover the dark side of the Mother of Industry and the Weaver while visiting her purgatories: the Desert of Rust, the Junkyard of Broken Cogs, and the Hall of Inevitable Fate. Boons and banes wait for those who dare explore the junk piles and haggle with the strange scavengers and exiles of the rusty gears. Other gods sometimes found here include Ptah, the Maker, as well as Volund and (strangely) the Hunter.

**Silendora, Summer Lands of the Elves**

Shining bright, the elves presumably retreated to the land of the Last Horn. Its elves hold great fairs and pay homage to kings and queens who speak with the River Lords of the Arbonesse. Their Birch Queen and Oak and Holly Kings are little more than names to mortals, but their silver halls and white horses can be glimpsed in dream or at the edge of the great forests of the world, where the fey roads are still traveled, and where the elven ambassadors sometimes come to call on the Imperatrix of the Grand Duchy of Dornig or the other elfmarked lords and ladies of the various fey courts.

**Valhalla, the Storm Court, and Geirrhöth**

Home to Thor, the valkyries, and mighty Wotan, the Storm Court is where the Northern gods meet. Their hall and their battleground is said to have a glorious view onto the conjoined realm of Geirrhöth (GIRE-hoeth), also called the plane of battle or place of spears. Some believe that the best way to visit the Storm Court is to fly into a raging thunderstorm; few return from that road.

Some say Geirrhöth is a punishment for those who revel in killing, though most reavers and warriors hold that it is a warrior’s heaven for the most valorous and bloodthirsty. All the triumph and tragedy of war rages here, a never-ending glory where the soldiers who die today rise again to rejoin their battle again tomorrow, watched over by archdevils, archangels, and all the gods of war, though Mavros is first and foremost. The rivers and rain run bloody, the dreadful sound of screams and war‑cries echoes everywhere, and the many swords and spears scattered underfoot are the only ground to be found. When night falls, the ghosts of the slain arise to drink, feast, and restore their flesh and bone for the following day.

**Yggdrasil and the World Trees**

The first World Tree, Yggdrasil, is the seat of wisdom and a connecting element between Midgard, Valhalla, and all other planes. Wotan and the Northern gods hold the secrets of how to travel its twisting paths and how to evade its guardians. Yggdrasil is ancient and perhaps sentient; certain of its trails are easier to follow than others. Those who travel Yggdrasil between the worlds carry messages for the gods or bring omens and warnings from Wotan and Loki.

The druids and elves agree that the Vanir elves—or Freyr and Freya themselves—planted the first seeds of Yggdrasil, which became the world and its many planes. Elven versions of this story say that Yggdrasil rests in the Summer Lands, and its roots and branches extend to Midgard, the Hells, and elsewhere. The druids and priests of Freyr and Freya claim Yggdrasil holds up Midgard and its offshoots form sacred groves and forests in the world.

The branches of Yggdrasil that enter Midgard manifest as World Trees that connect Midgard to various realms, from the Elflands to the Plane of Spears. Climbing a World Tree means entering the planar highways, which might lead to Valhalla, the Eleven Hells, or Ravatet. Only the elves, the ravenfolk, and valkyries even pretend to understand the paths, though the strange ratatosk native to the great tree act as guides, messengers, and guardians of its many planar roads.

The World Trees display roots as large as hills, and trunks pushing miles into the sky. Each tree’s bark is wildly variable, with sections of beech-smooth bark alternating with convoluted layers of flaking material. Their leaves are enormous, yet when they fall they seem to rarely reach the ground, instead slipping though the worlds to Valhalla or Elfheim or elsewhere.

The known World Trees are all sites of pilgrimage for followers of the Northern gods, but they are revered almost everywhere they grow. Each such tree is a node of divine power and is a nemeton, a sacred grove where no birds nest and no animals dig their burrows. The leaves of each World Tree constantly shiver and whisper, even when no wind stirs the forest around them.

Druids and Northlands pantheon priests find their magic operates as if they were 1 level higher when they are within the sacred grounds of a World Tree.

The known World Trees include an enormous fir in Domovogrod (see page 114); an unusual tree in Beldestan (see page 160); a marsh cypress in the Haunted Lands of the Giants (see page 260); a mere sapling in Huldramose (see page 306); and a thriving ravenfolk roost in Trollheim (see page 316). Not all World Trees prosper or resist corruption: Varshava’s tree did not survive the darakhul conquest of the city (see page 100); the gnomes of Niemheim have created a terrible sproutling abomination (see page 106); and a rotting World Tree endures in the ruins of Thorn (see page 293).
