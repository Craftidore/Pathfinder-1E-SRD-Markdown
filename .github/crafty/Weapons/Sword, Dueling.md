# Sword, Dueling
## Overview
*These swords are a bit over 3 feet long, very slightly curved, and sharp only along the outer edge.*

**Benefit:** A dueling sword may be used as a Martial Weapon (in which case it functions as a longsword), but if you have the feat [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] (dueling sword), you can use the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with a dueling sword sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. You can also wield a dueling sword in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Dueling swords by their very nature are some of the most versatile of blades, allowing their skilled wielders to use them either as piercing or slashing weapons.
