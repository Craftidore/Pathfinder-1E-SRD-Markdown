# Axe, Boarding
## Overview
Basically a hand axe with a backward-pointing spike, a boarding axe is used to chop through hatches or rigging, to drag burning debris off a ship, or as a weapon. A boarding axe is a one-handed martial weapon that uses the same statistics as a handaxe, except it deals slashing or piercing damage. In addition, the spike grants a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks on wooden surfaces.
