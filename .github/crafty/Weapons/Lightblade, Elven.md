# Lightblade, Elven
## Overview
This rapier-like exotic weapon is the size of a short sword but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightblade—often decorated with intricate filigree and tiny gemstones—as a sign of their station, even if they aren’t proficient in its use.

Characters proficient with the elven lightblade may treat it as a rapier or a short sword for the purpose of any of the following feats: [[Greater Weapon Focus (Feat)|Greater Weapon Focus]], [[Greater Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Greater Weapon Specialization]], [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], and [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]].
