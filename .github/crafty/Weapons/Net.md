# Net
## Overview
A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net’s maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is [[Entangled|entangled]]. An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the [[Entangled|entangled]] creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level or be unable to cast the spell.

An [[Entangled|entangled]] creature can escape with a DC 20 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a fullround action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.

A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.
