# Estoc
## Overview
A hand-and-a-half sword designed to pierce heavy armor and sharpened only on the tip, an estoc is 4 foot long, sometimes with a second crossguard. It is said to have been used first by the knights of Vael Turog and Balinor against the elves, but now is used by dwarven mercenaries and human knights who expect to fight other heavily armored warriors. Its anti-armor properties make it popular with monster hunters and dragon slayers as well. Sometimes called the “tuck.”
