Appearance:

Version 1:

A short blade on the end of a very long hide bound hilt. It has all the stacticstics of a dagger, except for the unproportional size of the hilt changes it into a one handed weapon and requires special training to use properly. 

Version 2:

As part of a move equivilant action, the wielder of an Elven Tarjul can exstend the hilt into a long, hollow shaft. Well placed supporting pieces of metal maintain its strength, and the wielder now has two options:

1. He may use it as a long spear

2. Use it as a quarter staff with one end as a blade with deals less damage but of the slashing sub type.

Edit: The wielder of the Tarjul may choose at the beginning of his turn which form of the weapon to use. Changing is a free action, reverting the Tarjul to its shorter form is a standard action, but it doesn't prevoke an attack of opertunity.

History: Made as a versatile weapon for the traditional sport of the Nadrandik Elven Aristocracy, the Tarjul is a versatile weapon that is great for a fighting style aimed to please crowds, but can also be a deadly tool in the hands of a warrior familiar with its weight and balance.

Special: The wielder of a Tarjul may treat his weapon as a dagger, spear, or quarterstaff for the purpose of using feats and class abilities. For example, a fighter could gain the benefits of both weapon focus (dagger) and Quick staff, no matter which version of the weapon they was using.

For my game, I'd stat it as a +1 Changeling Keen Wounding Spear
