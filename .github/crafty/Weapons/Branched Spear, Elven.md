# Branched Spear, Elven
## Overview
**Elven Branched Spear**: Behind this long pole weapon’s spearhead, several short branches project from the shaft at irregular intervals, each angled forward and tipped with a smaller leaf like blade. When you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can use the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven branched spear sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. Elves treat elven branched spears as martial weapons.

**GM Note**

The Langxian (Chinese) / Nang Seon (Korean) is quite literally the description of an Elven Branched Spear: Lots of small leaf-like blades branching off of a central spear shaft. It was apparently a useful defensive weapon; since it was basically a metal thornbush on a stick, it was very hard to advance on the wielder's superior reach and get past all the blades. It was also a good ensnaring tool, with all the small branches helping to immobilize attackers so the wielders allies could take them out for them.
