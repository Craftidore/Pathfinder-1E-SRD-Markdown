# Poleax, Tijino
## Overview
The Tijino poleax bears a long axe blade in front, with a long, looping backhook designed to unhorse riders. The Tijino poleax has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe.

When you use a Tijino poleax and strike a mounted rider, the rider must immediately make a DC 25 Ride check or fall from his mount. Even if he succeeds, he suffers a –5 penalty on all other Ride checks until the beginning of his next turn. You can use the Tijino poleax to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the Tijino poleax to avoid being tripped.
