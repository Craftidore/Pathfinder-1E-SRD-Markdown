# Net, Centaur
## Overview
**Net, Centaur:** Large nets with rope loops used as handles, these plains nets can be held between two centaurs. If the centaurs charge on either side of an opponent with the net between them (one readies an action triggered by the second one), one may make a touch attack against the opponent with a +4 bonus (+2 for flanking, +2 for equipment bonus).

If the attack succeeds, the victim is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If the attackers control the net by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature is knocked prone and can move only within the net. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level or be unable to cast the spell.

When either net wielder takes a movement action with a full net, the caught creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage each round it is dragged and drops held items. The centaurs may make this attack against three Medium-size or smaller opponents in a row, then the net is full.
