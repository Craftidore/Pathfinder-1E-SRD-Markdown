# Bone Bow
## Overview
This powerful and oversized bow is designed to fire exceptionally large arrows specially made for it. Made of the bones and sinews of huge animals such as woolly mammoths and dire rhinoceroses, these bows were designed by primitive cultures expressly for the hunting of huge creatures that require a lot of damage to take down. A bone bow functions as a composite longbow with regard to applying the user’s Strength bonus to damage done with arrows shot from it. The bow has a long, thick spike protruding from both ends; this spike is used to brace against a solid object (either the ground or an overhanging protrusion or ceiling) to aid in pulling the bow’s string. A character may use a bone bow as a martial weapon, but doing so imparts a –4 penalty on attack rolls, and firing an arrow from the bow requires a fullround action.

For purposes of feats such as [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] and [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]], a bone bow is treated as if it were a longbow; thus if you have [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (longbow), that feat applies to bone bows as well.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* There was much discussion with regard to the bonebow from Frostburn as an exotic weapon that was like a composite bow that automatically adjusted for Strength. Several good arguments were made both for it being able to do so and against. Ultimately, after conferring with other GMs and looking at the overall damage potential vs. costs for upgrading, I have decided that the bone bow **does** automatically adjust for Strength modifier adjustments.
