# Talon Blades
## Overview
These leather straps attach short, sharp blades to the natural talons (or claws) of creatures that possess such. Only creatures with natural talon attacks (or claw attacks at the GM's discretion) can use talon blades, and the weapon’s damage replaces (does not stack with) the natural talon attack of the wearer. Feats that apply to the creature’s talons (such as [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]]) also apply to talon blades if the wearer is proficient with martial weapons.

**GM Notes**

Talon blades are light martial weapons and are racial weapons for harpies, kestrels, kobolds, [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and serpent people.

Creatures with the [[Multiattack (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Multiattack]] feat use it with talon blades just as they would their natural attacks.

Talon blades in no way interfere with the manual dexterity of the creature wearing them.

Talon blades are usable with the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat.

Magical gloves function normally while the creature is wearing them just as they would with the creature's own natural talons or claws. Compare it to the gloves resizing to fit from the hands of a halfling to those of an ogre; except in the case of a creature with natural talons or claws they open at the fingertips.
