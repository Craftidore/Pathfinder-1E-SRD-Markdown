# Air Spells
## Overview
Spells that create air, manipulate air, or conjure creatures from air-dominant planes or with the air subtype should have the air descriptor. (Ultimate Magic, pg. 137)

An **<sup>M</sup>** or **<sup>F</sup>** appearing at the end of a spell’s name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch. An **<sup>X</sup>** denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the caster.

**Order of Presentation:** In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell’s name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice:** The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level:** A spell’s power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster’s class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters:** The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.

**<sup>F</sup>** This spell has a focus component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>M</sup>** This spell has a material component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>R</sup>** Spell requires a requisite religion or race. If religion, spellcaster must worship the listed deity to utilize the spell. If race, the spell might only target members of the listed race (the spell will say this if it does), but often are just the race's guarded secrets. Members of other races can learn to cast them with GM permission.

**<sup>T</sup>** In order to prepare any of these spells, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

**<sup>Y</sup>** This spell has a Mythic version.
