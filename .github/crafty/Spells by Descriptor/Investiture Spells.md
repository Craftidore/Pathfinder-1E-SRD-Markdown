# Investiture Spells
## Overview
The investiture descriptor indicates a category of spells that invest the essence of an outsider into a mortal. Unlike other spells, effects gained from different (though not the same) investiture spells stack. So, two different investiture spells that grant resistance to fire 5 to the same target would actually grant a total resistance of 10. However, investiture spells are intense and draining. Targets of these spells are fatigued for 1 minute once the duration expires (or the spell is dispelled or ended through some other means). If an investiture spell expires on a target fatigued from a previous investiture spell, the duration of the fatigue increases by 1 minute.
