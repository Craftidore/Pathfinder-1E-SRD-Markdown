# Stasis Spells
## Overview
An **<sup>M</sup>** or **<sup>F</sup>** appearing at the end of a spell’s name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch. An **<sup>X</sup>** denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the caster.

**Order of Presentation:** In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell’s name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice:** The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level:** A spell’s power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster’s class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters:** The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.

**<sup>F</sup>** This spell has a focus component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>M</sup>** This spell has a material component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>R</sup>** Spell requires a requisite religion or race. If religion, spellcaster must worship the listed deity to utilize the spell. If race, the spell might only target members of the listed race (the spell will say this if it does), but often are just the race's guarded secrets. Members of other races can learn to cast them with GM permission.

**<sup>T</sup>** In order to prepare any of these spells, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

**<sup>Y</sup>** This spell has a Mythic version.

One of the original Twelve, Bensalem was the first to leave that group of wizard-lords. While the exact reason for this is unknown, it undoubtedly had something to do with Malikazath and his attempts to bend the Twelve to his political ambitions.

Bensalem, like several others among the Twelve, chose to specialize in magic. In fact, it was his innate talent with abjurative magic that earned the attention of Malikazath. According to Bensalem’s writings, Malikazath sought out the young wizard with the idea of having Bensalem research magic that would let Malikazath live forever.

After many years of dedicated research, during which time his only companions were the other members of the Twelve, he discovered the secrets needed to “prevent” the body from being altered by outside forces. He immediately crafted several spells based on his new ideas, which he called “stasis” spells.

Written over four hundred years ago, Bensalem’s Stasis Formulae is the most well known treatise on a style of spells known as stasis spells.

All stasis spells are Abjuration school magic and are usually arcane in nature. Stasis is a new spell descriptor. Only one stasis effect may exist on any one creature at a time. Casting a stronger stasis on a character who is already affected by a stasis spell will dispel the lesser or equal level spell. Spells of higher level are not dispelled in this manner. All stasis spells can counter each other as they are being cast.

Stasis spells prevent any change in certain conditions that subject is in at the time it is cast until the stasis effect ends. Stasis spells do not affect the duration of other spells. An individual with a *[[Body Stasis (Spell)|body stasis]]* can still be blindfolded and prevented from seeing or be made blind via *[[Darkness (Spell)|darkness]]* as both of these effects are external to the target. However, should an external effect attempt to physically (or magically) blind the target by harming the target’s eyes, such an attempt will always fail while a *[[Body Stasis (Spell)|body stasis]]* is in effect.

Should anything (magical or non-magical) happen to the protected character that would normally cause her to acquire the condition, the condition does not happen to the character. Once the spell expires, however, any duration-based effects (including hit point loss) immediately come into effect.
