# Profession (Skill)
## Overview
**Profession (Wis; Trained Only**

You are skilled at a specific job. Like [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]], and [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks. While a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill represents ability in creating an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. The most common Profession skills are architect, baker, barrister, brewer, butcher, clerk, cook, courtesan, driver, engineer, farmer, fisherman, gambler, gardener, herbalist, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, midwife, miller, miner, porter, sailor, scribe, shepherd, stable master, soldier, tanner, trapper, and woodcutter.

**Check:** You can earn half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession’s daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems. You can also answer questions about your Profession. Basic questions are DC 10, while more complex questions are DC 15 or higher.

**Action:** Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.

**Try Again:** Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

**Untrained:** Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.

**Special:** A gnome gets a +2 bonus on a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or Profession skill of her choice.

**Profession: Sailor**

**Hazard: Seasickness**

Once at sea, some people adjust quickly to the seesawing deck beneath their feet. Once they get their sea legs, they feel just as good at sea as they do on dry land. However, some folks just can’t take the rolling waves and may end up handing off their lunch to the fish. Characters with 1 or more ranks in Profession (sailor) are never subject to seasickness. All others must succeed on a Fortitude save once per day or become seasick. The DC depends on the conditions, with calm weather having a DC 5 and stormy weather having a DC 20 or higher. Those that succeed on the save are fine until the conditions change again, at which point they must make another Fortitude save.

Those who fail the save become seasick and function as if [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for the remainder of the day. On the following day, the character is entitled to a new save. On a success, the character is [[Sickened|sickened]] instead of [[Nauseated|nauseated]]. On a failure, the [[Nauseated|nauseated]] condition persists. Each day thereafter, a character is entitled to another Fortitude save. Two successful saves in a row allows the character to recover from seasickness for the duration of the voyage.
