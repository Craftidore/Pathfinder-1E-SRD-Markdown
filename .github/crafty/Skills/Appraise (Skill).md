# Appraise (Skill)
## Overview
**Appraise (Int)**

You can evaluate the monetary value of an object. 

**Check:** A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item’s abilities. If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items might increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.

You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.

**Action:** Appraising an item takes 1 standard action. Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.

**Try Again:** Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.

**Special:** A spellcaster with a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

Whether performing a daring burglary or a hasty act of espionage, adventurers don’t always have time to carefully study the value of potential loot. Characters can use the Appraise skill to make a quick but rough estimation of an item’s value.

**Check:** You can appraise an item quickly, but the DC is higher. Failing the check means that you cannot estimate the item’s value.


| **Item (Examples)** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| *Common:* Trade goods (spices, food stuffs, raw materials, etc.), mundane items, livestock | 15 |
| *Rare:* Fine clothing, precious metals (unworked), gems, artwork | 20 |
| *Exotic:* Unusual gems (strange colorings, unusual to the region, unusually large or pure), spell components, jewelry, obscure religious items | 25 |
| *Unique:* Masterpiece artwork, royal jewels, crowns, or other adornments | 30+ |

**Action:** Appraising an item quickly takes 1 round.

**Try Again:** You can try to appraise an item normally (requires 1 minute), but you cannot try to appraise the item quickly again. You can try to appraise an item normally whether or not you successfully appraise the item quickly.

**Special:** The Appraise Magic Value feat enables you to use the Appraise skill to determine a magic item’s properties.
