# Spellcraft (Skill)
## Overview
**Spellcraft (Int; Trained Only)**

You are skilled at the art of casting spells, identifying magic items, crafting magic items, and identifying spells as they are being cast.

**Spellcraft DCs**


| **Task** | **Spellcraft DC** |
|---|---|
| Identify a spell as it is being cast | 15 + spell level |
| Learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll | 15 + spell level |
| Prepare a spell from a borrowed spellbook | 15 + spell level |
| Identify the properties of a magic item using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)\|detect magic]]* | 15 + item’s caster level |
| Decipher a scroll | 20 + spell level |
| Craft a magic item | Varies by item |

**Check:** Spellcraft is used whenever your knowledge and skill of the technical art of casting a spell or crafting a magic item comes into question. This skill is also used to identify the properties of magic items in your possession through the use of spells such as *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* and *[[Identify (Spell)|identify]]*. The DC of this check varies depending on the task at hand.

**Action:** Identifying a spell as it is being cast requires no action, but you must be able to clearly see the spell as it is being cast, and this incurs the same penalties as a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check due to distance, poor conditions, and other factors. Learning a spell from a spellbook takes 1 hour per level of the spell (0-level spells take 30 minutes). Preparing a spell from a borrowed spellbook does not add any time to your spell preparation. Making a Spellcraft check to craft a magic item is made as part of the creation process. Attempting to ascertain the properties of a magic item takes 3 rounds per item to be identified and you must be able to thoroughly examine the object.

**Retry:** You cannot retry checks made to identify a spell. If you fail to learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll, you must wait at least 1 week before you can try again. If you fail to prepare a spell from a borrowed spellbook, you cannot try again until the next day. When using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or *[[Identify (Spell)|identify]]* to learn the properties of magic items, you can only attempt to ascertain the properties of an individual item once per day. Additional attempts reveal the same results.

**Special:** If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify, learn, and prepare spells from your chosen school. Similarly, you take a –5 penalty on similar checks made concerning spells from your opposition schools.

An elf gets a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify the properties of magic items.

If you have the [[Magical Aptitude (Feat)|Magical Aptitude]] feat, you gain a bonus on Spellcraft checks (see Chapter 5 of the PFRG Core Rulebook 1).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Additional modifiers to identify a spell as it is being cast:

Auditory or visual effect of spell modified by [[Spell Thematics (Feat)|Spell Thematics]] feat +5

Higher level spell than you can currently cast +5/level

Unable to cast type of spell (arcane/divine) +5

For additional information on crafting magic items and possible modifiers to the Spellcraft roll refer to [[Magic Item Creation]].

Taken from the PF1 FAQ ([https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9n8m](https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9n8m))

## **Crafting and Bypassing Requirements: What crafting requirements can you bypass by adding +5 to the DC of your Spellcraft check?**
As presented on page 549 of the *Core Rulebook*, there are no limitations other than (1) you have to have the item creation feat, and (2) you cannot create potions, spell-trigger, or spell-completion magic items without meeting their spell prerequisites. So racial requirements, specific spell requirements, math requirements (such as "caster level must be at least three times the enhancement bonus"), and so on, are all subject to the +5 DC rule.

## **Crafting and Spell Requirements: When crafting an item, can an arcane caster use a divine scroll to fulfill an item's divine spell requirement?**
Yes. (Likewise, a divine caster could use an arcane scroll to fulfill an item's arcane spell requirement.) 
However, the character has to be able to activate the scroll somehow as part of the crafting process. This probably requires the arcane caster to succeed at a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check to activate the divine spell. If the caster fails to cast the divine spell from the scroll, he makes no progress on the item that day unless he has another source for that divine spell (such as another copy of the scroll).

## **Crafting and Take 10: Can I take 10 on the Spellcraft check to craft a magic item?**
        Yes.
