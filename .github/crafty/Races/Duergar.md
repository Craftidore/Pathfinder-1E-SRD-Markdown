# Duergar
## Overview
Duergar dwell in subterranean caverns far from the touch

of light. They detest all races living beneath the sun, but

that hatred pales beside their loathing of their surfacedwarf

cousins. Dwarves and duergar once were one race, but

the dwarves left the deeps for their mountain strongholds.

Duergar still consider themselves the only true dwarves,

and the rightful heirs of all beneath the world’s surface.

In appearance, duergar resemble gray-skinned dwarves,

bearded but bald, with cold, lightless eyes. They favor taking

captives in battle over wanton slaughter, save for surface

dwarves, who are slain without hesitation. Duergar view

life as ceaseless toil ended only by death. Though few can

be described as anything other than vile and cruel, duergar

still value honor and rarely break their word.

**Duergar Racial Traits**

**+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma**: Duergar are

hearty and observant, but also belligerent.

**Medium**: Duergar are Medium creatures and have no bonuses

or penalties due to their size.

**Dwarf**: Duergar are humanoids with the dwarf subtype.

**Slow and Steady**: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but their

speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance.

**Superior Darkvision**: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet.

**Duergar Immunities**: Duergar are immune to paralysis, phantasms, and poison.

They gain a +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities.

**Stability**: Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or

trip attempts while on solid ground.

**Spell-Like Abilities**: A duergar can use *enlarge person* and *invisibility* once each

per day, using its character level as its caster level and affecting itself only.

**Light Sensitivity**: Duergar are dazzled in areas of bright light.

**Languages**: Duergar begin play speaking Common, Dwarven, and

Undercommon. Duergar with high Intelligence scores can choose from the

following: Aklo, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, and Terran.

**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected

instead of existing duergar racial

traits. Consult your GM

before selecting any of

these new options.

**Blood Enmity**: Duergar have long warred against their

dwarven cousins and the hated drow. Duergar with this

racial trait receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against

humanoid creatures of the dwarf or elf subtypes. This

racial trait replaces the *invisibility* spell-like ability.

**Daysighted**: The cruel light of the sun harms some

duergar less than others. Such duergar lack the light

sensitivity racial trait, but have darkvision of only 60 feet.

**Deep Magic**: Duergar spellcasters labor long to overcome

the inborn spell resistance held by so many of their

underground foes. Duergar with this racial trait receive a

+2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome

spell resistance and a +2 racial bonus on dispel checks. This

racial trait replaces the *enlarge person* and *invisibility* spelllike

abilities.

**Dwarf Traits**: Duergar can select any dwarf racial trait

that replaces stability. They can select dwarf racial traits

that replace the hardy dwarf racial trait by giving up

duergar immunities instead.

**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all duergar who have

the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the

bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Cleric**: Add a +1/2 bonus on checks made to craft

magic items.

**Fighter**: Add +1 to the fighter’s CMD when resisting a

bull rush or trip attempt.

**Inquisitor**: Add +1/6 to the number of times per day the

inquisitor can use the judgment class feature.

**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetype is available to duergar.

Gray Disciple (Monk)

The gray disciple contemplates the inner voice of duergar

magic and the silent eternity of stone, mastering these

dual mysteries and combining them to deadly effect.

**Fade from Sight (Sp)**: At 4th level, as a swift action, the

gray disciple can become invisible (as the *invisibility* spell)

for 1 round by spending 1 *ki* point. To use this ability, the

gray disciple must already have *invisibility* as a spell-like

ability. This ability replaces slow fall and still mind.

**Gray Heart (Sp)**: At 6th level, as a swift action, the gray

disciple can enlarge himself (as the *enlarge person* spell)

for 1 minute by spending 1 *ki* point. To use this ability, the

gray disciple must already have *enlarge person* available as

a spell-like ability. This ability replaces high jump and

the bonus feat gained at 6th level.

**Born in Darkness (Sp)**: At 7th level, as a standard

action, the gray disciple can radiate *darkness* (as the spell,

except originating from the disciple’s person) for 1 round

per level by spending 1 *ki* point. This ability replaces

wholeness of body.

**Earth Glide (Su)**: At 12th level, as a swift action, the gray

disciple can spend a *ki* point to walk through solid stone

for 1 round. This functions as the earth glide universal

monster ability. The gray disciple may continue earth

gliding as long as he spends 1 *ki* point every round as

a swift action. If he ceases earth gliding within a solid

object, he is violently ejected and takes 5d6 points of

damage. The gray disciple is not harmed by damage

caused to material he is earth gliding through, but a

*stone to f lesh* spell cast upon it causes violent ejection as

described above. This ability replaces abundant step.

**Entomb (Su):** At 15th level, a gray disciple can phase a

foe into solid rock, killing it instantly. To use this ability,

he expends 1 ki point as part of a bull rush or reposition

combat maneuver against a creature adjacent to unworked

earth or stone. If the attempt succeeds, the gray disciple

pushes his foe inside the rock using his earth glide

ability. If the creature succeeds at a Ref lex save (DC 10

+ 1/2 the gray disciple’s monk level + the gray disciple’s

Wisdom modifier), it is ejected in the nearest open space

and takes 5d6 points of damage. If it fails, it dies instantly

as its body merges with the surrounding stone. Entomb

is usable once per day, but a failed bull rush or reposition

attempt does not count as a use of the ability. Entomb has no

effect on creatures that can earth glide, are incorporeal, or

can otherwise can survive merging with a solid object. This

ability replaces quivering palm.

**Earthen Thrall (Sp)**: At 17th level, a gray disciple can

attempt to control a creature with the earth subtype once

per day. This ability is treated as *dominate monster* (DC 10

+ 1/2 the gray disciple’s monk level + the gray disciple’s

Wisdom modifier), but is only effective against creatures

with the earth subtype, and the gray disciple can keep

only a single creature enthralled. If he attempts to control

a second creature with this ability, the first creature is

automatically released from domination whether or not

the second attempt succeeds. This ability replaces tongue

of the sun and moon and empty body.
