*This humanoid, unusually slender and taller than most humans, is androgynous and gives away no hint of its gender. Its eyes are a pale, almost ice-blue, its skin is very pale, and it has long, extraordinarily fine silky silver hair with no body hair. It is dressed very plainly in a brown and grey cloak and garments that blend in with its surroundings.* 

The rockseer is one of the rarest types of elves. Rockseers separated themselves from the rest of elvenkind millennia ago due to their own myths. Rockseer history tells that they were cowards at the great battle that forever separated Corellon and Lolth, fleeing below ground to hide. As such, rockseers believe themselves to be shunned by the elven gods, and rockseer clerics are unheard of. Rockseers are calm, enigmatic, and extraordinarily hard for outsiders to understand. 

An average rockseer stands 7-8 feet tall and weighs between 120 and 140 pounds, with little difference between genders. Rockseers have a natural life-span of over 1,400 years. 

Rockseer elves speak Elven and Undercommon, and most know Gnome, Terran, and sometimes Dwarven. 

The rockseer elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 12, Wis 9, Cha 8. 

COMBAT 

Rockseers exist in too few numbers to risk pointless deaths, so they abstain from fighting whenever possible. If forced to fight, a rockseer will unflinchingly defend to the death others of its own kind. A rockseer is usually armed with a longsword, dagger, spear, or a stone quarterstaff that is as hard as steel. Potential aggressors rarely even see rockseer elves due to their great underground special skills. 

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will - *meld into stone*. In addition, rockseers of 5th level or higher can use *stone shape* once per day, and rockseers of 9th level or higher can use *stone tell* once per day. These abilities are as the spells cast by a sorcerer of the rockseer's level. The DCs of these abilities are Charisma based. 

**Call Forth Stone (Su):** As a full-round action, a group of at least three rockseers may link hands to create a wall of stone, as the spell. Caster level equals 6 + 1 per rockseer involved in the link. 

Freedom of Movement (Su): For a total time per day of 1 round per character level a rockseer elf possesses, the elf can act normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement as if it were affected by the spell freedom of movement. This effect occurs automatically as soon as it applies, lasts until it runs out or is no longer needed, and can operate multiple times per day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). This ability stacks with the power granted to a rockseer elf cleric with access to the Travel domain. 

**Rockseer Elf Traits (Ex):** Rockseer elves possess the following racial traits. 

-2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma. 

Medium size. 

A rockseer elf's base land speed is 30 feet. 

Immunity to petrification. 

Immunity to sleep spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects. 

+1 racial bonus on saving throws against all earth spells and effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every five class levels the rockseer attains. 

-1 racial penalty on saves against spells with the air descriptor. 

(Not reflected in the saving throw modifiers given here.) 

Darkvision out to 240 feet. 

Weapon Proficiency: Rockseer elves are automatically proficient with the longsword and rapier. 

+2 racial bonus on Appraise and Craft (gemcutting) checks. 

+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it. 

Automatic Languages: Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Terran. 

Favored Class: Wizard. 

**Stone Walk (Sp):** A rockseer elf with 3 or more character levels can stone walk for a total distance of 300 feet once per day; this distance increases by 300 feet for each additional level gained. This allows the rockseer to move through stone at her normal land speed. Rockseers intuitively sense distances between passages and caverns separated by walls, so that they always know whether a stone walk can take them to a safe place or whether they might be trapped in solid stone at the end of the walk. Her burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does she create any ripple or other signs of her presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a stonewalking rockseer flings the elf back 30 feet, stunning her for 1 round unless she succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. 

A rockseer of 9th level can take one additional Medium creature with her on such a stone walk; this number increases at the rate of one passenger per level beyond 9th (thus at 10th level the rockseer could take two companions). Companions must all remain in physical contact with the rockseer while stonewalking. 

**ROCKSEER SOCIETY** 

Rockseers know of the drow and hate them, avoiding them as much as possible. They have no knowledge of any other elven race. They are extremely isolated by their choice, shunning the company of all other races save svirfneblin and pech. They have little curiosity about the ways of other folk due to their deep shame over their history. However, Rockseers rarely possess bows, as suitable bowstrings are difficult to come by underground, so they prize such items when they become available and would be willing to trade with anyone who had one. 

Since rockseers believe that all they have is themselves and the riches of the earth, they are powerfully cohesive socially. Chieftains are generally elected by a conclave of the most powerful warriors and wizards on the death of the previous leader. A wise rockseer leader does not give orders without consulting his or her advisors; rockseers do not tolerate tyrannical leadership, nor do they suffer fools. 

Rockseers disguise the network of caverns and passages that serve as their lair supremely well, and ward them with multiple cunningly placed spells to prevent other creatures from even suspecting the existence of such places. Spies melded into stone are placed to watch over entry points, except when a rockseer clan lives in caverns accessible only by stone walking, hundreds of feet into solid rock with only small fissures to provide air. 

Rockseer gem cutters and craftsmen are almost without equal; even gnomes and dwarves would hesitate to claim better craftsmanship. Underdark lore says that a rockseer can almost detect gemlodes by scent, no matter how deep underground they are. The greatest of rockseer artisans think nothing of spending ten years crafting and sculpting a single gem. Craftsmen with magical talent as well can sculpt gems into forms of almost painfully exquisite beauty, generating fractal patterns of brilliant color and radiance within the heart of the gem as it grows. It is said that if these gems are used to fashion a helm of brilliance, each gem can perform its spell-like power five times before becoming depleted, instead of just once. 

**Summon Earth Elemental \[General]** 

Rockseer elves have developed the ability to summon earth elementals to help with tasks and defense. 

**Prerequisite:** Rockseer elf, character level 6th. 

**Benefit:** Once per day, you may summon an earth elemental. If acting alone, you may only summon a Small earth elemental. For each additional rockseer elf employing this feat in conjunction with you, you may summon an earth elemental one size larger (see the table on Monster Manual page 83). For example, a group of four rockseer elves with this feat can summon a Huge earth elemental, and a group of six rockseer elves can summon an elder earth elemental. Working together in this fashion uses this ability for all involved elves for the day. 

This is a spell-like ability and is treated as if the characters involved are casting a *summon monster* spell of the appropriate level, with the exception that they can only summon earth elementals. Unlike the spell, you cannot use this ability to summon multiple elementals at a time. 

**Rockseer Magic \[General]** 

You have studied the long-standing arcane traditions of your people which allows you to better harness the powers of the earth. 

**Prerequisite:** Rockseer elf, ability to prepare and cast 3rd-level arcane spells. 

**Benefit:** You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell with the earth descriptor. Your racial bonus against spells with the earth descriptor also increases by +1. In addition, you add the following spells to your wizard spell list. 

1st - *Entangle* (affects stone rather than plants), *magic stone* 

2nd - *acid arrow, soften earth and stone* 

3rd - *Stone shape* 

4th - *Spike stones* 

5th - *Wall of stone* 

6th - *Acid fog, stoneskin* 

7th - *Earthquake* 

8th - *Iron body* 

9th - *Elemental swarm\** 

\*Cast as an earth spell only. 

**Rod of Acrid Steam and Vapor** 

This rod has the following two magical powers: 

*Steam*: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to spout forth a jet of superheated, acidic steam as a 50-foot cone. The steam forms a cloud that persists for three rounds, slowly cooling and dissipating. In the first round, the steam deals 3d6 points of acid damage and 3d6 points of fire damage; in the second round the steam deals 2d6 points of acid damage and 2d6 points of fire damage and in the third and final round the steam deals 1d6 points of acid damage and 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that succeed on a Reflex save take half damage. Also, living creatures caught in the cloud of acid on the first round must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded permanently as though by the blindness spell. 

*Vapor*: Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause billows of warm, steamy vapors to gout forth from the rod. These vapors spread out to an 80-foot radius cloud that lasts for six rounds. Creatures with the Cold subtype trapped within the cloud will suffer 1d6 points of damage per round. This effect otherwise functions as the fog cloud spell. 

Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Rod, acid fog, fog cloud; Price 27,255 gp. 

**STONE DRAGONET** 

Rockseer elves know the secret to crafting a magical construct called a stone dragonet. A stone dragonet resembles an incredibly intricate, slender stone statue of a dragon, though it moves as if perfectly articulated. A dragonet is one foot long, plus an additional 9-12 inches of tail, with extraordinary gems for eyes. 

A rockseer elf with the Improved Familiar feat and Rockseer Magic feat can take a stone dragonet as a familiar upon reaching 7th level. A wizard with a stone dragonet as a familiar gains a +2 bonus on Armor Class and cannot be caught flat-footed. 

A stone dragonet's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, weighing around 40 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs 400 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 17 Craft (sculpting) check or a DC 17 Craft (stonemasonry) check. 

CL 7th; Craft Construct (see MM page 303), Rockseer Magic, fear, ghoul touch, stone shape, caster must be at least 7th level; Price 2,500 gp; Cost 1,450 gp + 84 XP. 

**Stone dragonet:** Tiny construct; HD 2d10; hp 11; Init +3; Spd 20 ft. (4 squares), climb 20 ft.; AC 22, touch 15, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +1; Grp -7; Atk +1 melee (1d3, claw); Full Atk +1 melee (1d3, claw) and +4 melee (1d4, bite); Space/Reach 2 1/2 ft./0 ft.; SA brilliant glare; SQ construct traits, darkvision 60 ft, immunity to earth magic, low-light vision, spell resistance 16; AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +0; Str 10, Dex 17, Con ---, Int ---, Wis 11, Cha 1. 

**Brilliant Glare (Su):** Once per day, a stone dragonet can release a blast from its gem-eyes, targeting one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or become sickened for 2d4 rounds. If the target has less than 5 HD, it is also panicked for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. 

**Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex):** A stone dragonet is immune to the harmful effects of any spell with the earth descriptor.
