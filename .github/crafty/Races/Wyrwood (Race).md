# Wyrwood (Race)
## Overview
This relatively young race was created by a cabal of wizards who needed nimble and skilled construct servants to do their dirty work. This cabal was interested in creating magical machines, so they built their tools to be small, agile, and clever. Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and created minions with free will, and these first wyrwoods began to question why they were involved in their masters’ petty intrigues. When the wizards forced the wyrwoods to fight each other as proxies for the wizards themselves, the constructs instead killed their creators and stole the notes on how to create more of their kind, allowing them to perpetuate their race.

Wyrwoods are secretive and somewhat xenophobic, and can seem cold and calculating to others—a trait that could earn respect or enmity, depending on the audience. Purely rational and unemotional, wyrwoods see the survival of their race as their primary goal. Even the rare wyrwood who understands the point of empathy and altruism sees such concepts as mere tools to help ensure its own survival or that of its people. All wyrwoods know how to create more of their kind, and they keep the details of their construction process secret from other creatures to make sure their race is never again enslaved.

Most wyrwoods are wizards or rogues. The few who are inclined to worship tend to revere lawful deities with strict codes of behavior, which they follow to the letter rather than the spirit.

- **Size:** Small (0 RP)
- **Base Speed:** Normal (0 RP)
- **Languages:** Standard (0 RP)

**SENSES RACIAL TRAITS**

- **Low-Light Vision:** Wyrwood can see twice as far as humans in dim light (they have [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]]). (0 RP)

## Alternate Racial Traits
**Alternate Racial Traits**

- **Experimental Body:** Some wyrwoods have been built from rare materials in an effort to imbue them with special properties. Choose one of the following abilities. This replaces darkvision and low-light vision. **Source:** Heroes of Golarion
- **Blessed:** These wyrwoods contain divine relics. Wyrwoods with this trait can use divine favor once per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to their Hit Dice.
- **Enchanted:** Crafted from the remnants of broken staves, wands and other items, these wyrwoods have a natural attunement to the arcane. Wyrwoods with this trait treat their Intelligence score as 2 higher for the purpose of determining bonus spells or extracts per day.
- **Fey-Touched:** These wyrwoods have components that create a powerful link to the First World. Wyrwoods with this trait can use *[[Charm Animal (Spell)|charm animal]]* once per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to their Hit Dice
- **Scorched:** These wyrwoods are built from the ruins of cities and structures destroyed by conflict. Once per day, after a successful melee attack against an enemy, wyrwoods with this trait can deal an additional number of points of damage equal to their Wisdom modifier as a free action. 
- **Living Machine:** Through generations of refining the techniques of creation, many young wyrwoods have become closer to organic beings than constructs. These wyrwoods are constructs with the living machine subtype. They gain a Constitution score and can be targeted by spells and effects that target living creatures or constructs, as well as those that require a Fortitude save. They are no longer immune to ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, exhaustion, or fatigue. Wyrwoods with this trait require sleep, but they do not need to breathe or eat. They are not destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, instead becoming unconscious and stable. They are destroyed when reduced to a negative number of hit points equal to their Constitution score. They can be raised or resurrected when destroyed. This alters the wyrwood’s creature type. **Source:** Heroes of Golarion
- **Repair Magic:** Some wyrwoods have developed magic to keep them more self-sufficient. They can use *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]* as a spell-like ability once per day. This racial trait replaces darkvision. **Source:** Inner Sea Races

## Alternate Racial Traits (3pp)
**Alternate Racial Traits (3pp)**

- **Aura Seer:** By altering the components used to grant a wyrwood its sight during its creation process, a creator wyrwood can craft a progeny which sees magical, psychic, and spiritual energies, although at the expense of its other physical senses. Wyrwoods with this trait gain [[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]] as a constant spell-like ability, and also gain psychic tracking and see alignment as spell-like abilities which are each usable once per day. This trait replaces darkvision and low-light vision. **Source:** Book of Heroic Races: Advance Wyrwoods (Jon Brazer Enterprises)
- **Emotional:** Through a mistake of the creation process or an intentional design choice, a wyrwood with this alternate racial trait possesses emotions. A wyrwood that desires to make use of or benefit from a class feature that provides morale bonuses (such as the barbarian’s rage ability or the wilder’s euphoric surge ability) requires this alternate racial trait. A wyrwood with this alternate racial ability is not immune to mind-affecting effects. **Source:** Book of Heroic Races: Advance Wyrwoods (Jon Brazer Enterprises)
- **Stone Sentinel:** A rare few wyrwood communes use stone to craft new members of their race rather than wood. Such wyrwoods gain a +2 bonus to natural armor and DR 1/magic, but lose their racial bonus to Dexterity and have their base speeds reduced by 5 feet. (This also affects how some spells interact with the wyrwood; see the “Wood-Affecting Spells and Powers” sidebar later in this book for more details.) **Source:** Book of Heroic Races: Advance Wyrwoods (Jon Brazer Enterprises)
- **Swimmer:** The wyrwood has a swim speed of 20 feet and gains a +8 racial bonus to [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. Wyrwoods with this racial trait have a base speed of 20 feet. Source Book of Heroic Races: Advance Wyrwoods (Jon Brazer Enterprises)
- **War Titan:** Some wyrwood creators have increased the size of their progeny over time to make them more formidable and intimidating opponents. Such wyrwoods are Medium-sized creatures and gain 20 bonus hit points when created; however, their base speed is decreased to 20 feet due to the extra weight of their bodies. **Source:** Book of Heroic Races: Advance Wyrwoods (Jon Brazer Enterprises)
