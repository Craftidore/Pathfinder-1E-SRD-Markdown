The bhukas are an offshoot of the goblinoid people and

claim to be descended from the fi rst inhabitants of the

world. They are consummate survivors of the waste,

having a talent for finding water and many physical

adaptations that allow them to function in a harsh environment.

Their culture celebrates and preserves ancestral

ways of living.

Personality: Although theirs is not a technologically

advanced society, bhukas are a sophisticated people with

highly developed art and social organization. They are

not warlike, so they have learned to avoid conflict by

the simple method of not being seen. A bhuka never

approaches strangers but observes from hiding as long as

possible while gauging the newcomers’ intent. Even if she

does make contact, a bhuka reveals nothing of her kin or

settlement and is very cautious in her dealings. Within

their own society, bhukas form strong bonds in extended

families and cement the community as a whole through

rituals and storytelling.

Physical Description: Bhukas are slightly built, with

sand-colored skin and brick-red, tightly curled hair. They

have little facial or body hair. Their large ears, networked

with veins, fold fl at against the head to retain heat in the

cold desert night and keep out blowing sand. A frill of

skin about the neck contains numerous spines that can

lift the frill and raise it for cooling. The face of a bhuka

is fl at, with slitlike nostrils protected by fl aps of skin. A

bhuka’s eyes have long lashes to keep out sand and dust,

and the skin surrounding them is darker than the rest of

the face, giving a bhuka the appearance of wearing a mask.

Bhukas have wide, splayed feet that help them move easily

over sand, and they do not wear shoes. Body paint is used

to signify social position and ranges from a simple stripe

on a low-ranking youth’s neck frill to an elaborate pattern

of spots, stripes, and whorls covering the arms and upper

body of a matriarch. Clothing is fl owing and light, woven

from desert grasses using ancient techniques that make

the garb excellent protection from heat. A typical bhuka

stands between 4 and 5 feet tall and rarely weighs more

than 90 pounds.

Relations: From the beginning of their history,

bhukas have been a gentle people of whom others have

taken advantage. When the fi rst people emerged from

the Lower World, bhukas were the last to choose their

home and thus had to adapt to the harsh waste. The

cruder goblinoid races deride them as weak, while the

traditional enemies of goblins (such as badland dwarves

and painted elves) are more likely to engage a bhuka on

friendly terms. Warlike people of the waste have driven

bhukas away from fertile regions, forcing them into an

ever-smaller and less hospitable territory. Yet this form

of exile is a source of strength for the bhukas, who take

pride in their ability to fl ourish even under such conditions.

Bhukas are not cowards—push too hard, and they

reveal a toughness bred of burning sun and baked earth.

The bhuka people have a longstanding trade relationship

with the crucians (see page 144), exchanging food, art

objects, and dyes for tools and other worked items. Asheratis

are unnerving to bhukas. The asheratis’ presence

below the sand is disturbing to a bhuka’s perception of

reality and challenges his standing in the hierarchy of

the waste.

Alignment: A complex system of community relationships

holds a bhuka village together. Respect for superiors

and the need to contribute to the common good is drilled

into every member of the society, and those who do not

adhere become outcasts. Bhuka society is lawful, with

most individuals tending toward good.

Bhuka Lands: Bhukas form extended family groups,

called phratries*,* consisting of several clans related by

origin. Each phratry claims ancestry from one couple

who emerged from the Lower World at the beginning of

history and is responsible for maintaining a particular

tradition of the people. Young adults of a given phratry

cannot marry within any of its clans, which means they

must wed someone from another village; the new family may settle with either parent clan. Bhukas inhabit adobe

or sandstone dwellings built into and against cliffs or

dug into the upper levels of desert canyons. Each family

has its own home, with a terrace built under it to allow

drying of food, space for sitting and talking, and access

to other houses. The entrance to a house is well above

ground level as a defense against invaders—access is by

ladders or rope lifts. A central spring provides water to

the community.

Farms surround each village. The arid climate and

hard earth of the waste makes agriculture a challenge,

but bhukas use traditional dry-farming

techniques to grow their staple

foods of beans, sunf lowers, desert

grasses, and corn. The fields are not

plowed. Instead, tough native vegetation

holds the soil in place, with

the crops planted in rows of deep

holes. Sometimes, the village spring

irrigates a terrace built below the

house entrances for growing small,

tough melons that furnish both

food and containers. Bhukas

supplement their diet

with wild plants such as

cactus pads, fruits, and the

meat of small animals.

Religion: Religion is the glue

that holds a bhuka community together.

Each phratry is responsible for

protecting a relic of the Emergence,

the time when the fi rst people came

out from under the earth. For example,

members of the Wokuhoo (Moon

Owl) phratry are the caretakers of

the Talon, a relic of the bird that led

their ancestors into the Upper World. They lead ceremonies

commemorating that event and control

imagery that appears in sacred art relating to it.

Bhuka society is matriarchal, each village headed

by a Grandmother who presides over a council of male

and female elders. The Lower World from which the people

surfaced is known as the Second Womb, where the mother

deity, Kikanuti, nurtured them and taught them until

they were ready to emerge. (The more savage goblinoids,

they believe, are not yet mature and must stay beneath the

earth.) The Grandmother is the village’s link to Kikanuti

and presides over important ceremonies.

Each bhuka village has a ceremonial pit, dug into a courtyard

or sacred cave and covered with a lid of painted hides.

The walls are carved with traditional symbols that depict

the Emergence and subsequent migrations of the people,

as well as images of friendly spirits, important landmarks,

and food animals and plants. The most solemn rituals take

place in these pits, which recall the dark world beneath

the ground from which the bhukas emerged. Outsiders

are strictly forbidden from entering sacred pits, and only

adult members of the community participate in the rites.

The village pit is also where coming-of-age rituals are held.

Village festivals celebrating the harvest, weddings, and

changes of season take place in the common area rather

than the pit, and are occasions for

feasting, song, and dance.

The bhukas believe that Kikanuti

still guides them in the

Upper World by sending them

her spirit children to dwell

among the villages. These

spirits are embodied in ritual

masks, which clan elders don

for festival dances at specifi ed

times of the year. A mask’s spirit

possesses the dancer wearing

it and is honored by the villagers

with feasting and prayers.

Bhukas acknowledge the existence

of hostile deities of the waste

and take care not to offend them,

even holding an annual appeasement

ceremony at the winter

solstice. Unfortunately for the

bhukas, this practice does not usually

deter the warlike followers of

antagonistic deities.

Language: The bhukas do

not have a literate society. All

their lore is oral, supplemented by

a rich library of symbols that adorn

both artistic and everyday objects.

Their language is distantly related

to Goblin, but the two tongues diverged

so long ago that most other

goblinoids cannot understand Bhuka. The isolated

bhuka society offers little reason for its members

to learn Common, but many bhukas speak Draconic due

to their trading relationship with the crucians.

Names: Bhuka names are long and carry much meaning,

but they retain the harsh syllables of the Goblin tongue.

A typical bhuka has a given name, followed by the name

of the mother’s clan (preceded by *kha,* or “born of”), and

the clan into which he or she has married (preceded by

*gi*). Children receive a pet name until they come of age

and choose a name that describes their personality.

Male Given Names: Aghila’ak (Runs Like Lizard),

Cochik’ukan (Eyes of Sunhawk), Gistik’uwa (High-Kick

Dancer), Kotigana (Ears of Hare), Niskigan (Snake Fang),

Piklit’akit (Jumping Mouse Grace), Takigini (Speaks with

Force), Wikitagan (Flight of Swallow).

Female Given Names: Chinkichu (Basket of Corn),

Hintak’inai (Painted Frill), Kekkoti (Little Ear), Lakinigo

(Slow Smile), Namatagi’na (Sings with Paint), Stikuchi

(Dancing Mother), Takihoti (Speaks with Wisdom),

Yukaki’na (Leader of Songs).

Clan Names: Clans carry the name of a totem spirit or

relic of the Emergence. Examples: Chikuk (Sunhawk), Kekkinna

(Ear of Corn), Kichu (Basket), Niski (Rattlesnake),

Pitlitak (Jumping Mouse), Wiki’i (Swallow), Wokuhoo

(Moon Owl).

Adventurers: The tight-knit, agrarian community of

the bhukas does not often produce wanderers, but their

ancient migrations are still a part of the race’s memory.

Some individuals are born with the wind in their souls,

as the bhukas say, and are thought to be the incarnations

of spirit children. These bhukas become ambassadors,

traveling between the scattered villages with messages

and gifts, and lead the trade expeditions to the lands of the

crucians. Those in whom the wind blows more strongly

embark on solitary travels, perhaps to see where the other

children of Kikanuti have gone, or simply to follow their

hearts. Such individuals might join with other travelers

who earn their trust.

Outcast bhukas also rove the waste. These are usually

bitter, selfi sh beings who do not form groups. Sometimes a

wanderer yearns to belong, though, and might fi nd a sense

of community among other races.

Bhuka Racial Traits

• –2 Strength, +2 Dexterity. Bhukas have a delicate build,

but they are agile.

• Medium: As Medium creatures, bhukas have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

• Bhuka base land speed is 30 feet.

• Sure Feet (Ex): Bhukas have broad feat and splayed toes

that help them travel easily over sand and similar loose

surfaces. They treat shallow sand as normal terrain and

deep sand as shallow sand. See Sand Travel, page 18, for

descriptions of shallow and deep sand.

• Glare Resistance (Ex): Dark skin and long lashes around

the eyes protect bhukas from sun glare (see page 18), so

these creatures are never dazzled by bright sun.

• Water Sense (Ex): Bhukas have the innate ability to

detect a source of drinkable water within a distance of

100 feet. Doing this requires a Survival check; the DC

depends on the depth below ground of the water source,

according to the following table.

**Water Depth Survival DC**

0 feet (on the surface) 10

10 feet or less 12

11–20 feet 15

21–40 feet 20

41–70 feet 25

71–100 feet 30

• +2 racial bonus on Constitution checks or Fortitude

saves to resist harmful effects from heat and dehydration.

Bhukas are toughened to the rigors of waste life.

• +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks. Knowledge

(nature) is always a class skill for bhukas.

• Heat Endurance: Bhukas gain Heat Endurance (see page

50) as a bonus feat.

• Automatic Languages: Bhuka and Common. Bonus

Languages: Draconic and Goblin.

• Favored Class: Druid. A multiclass bhuka’s druid class

does not count when determining whether she takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing.

• Level adjustment +0.
