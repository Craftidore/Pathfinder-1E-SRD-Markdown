Garudas are noble but impetuous birdlike celestials, and most garuda-blooded aasimars grow graceful feathers during puberty. The majority of these aasimars have shimmering wings; the wings can be of virtually any shade, ranging from metallic colors to muted hues to pure white, or rarely, glossy black. Plumekith are sometimes born with taloned fingers or toes, and occasionally amber eyes like those of an eagle. 

Like their celestial ancestors, plumekith tend to take action at the spur of the moment when their abilities seem needed. Plumekith rush into the heat of battle to face off against evildoers, only stopping to ask questions afterward. Plumekith often have an extreme hatred for nagas and other snakelike creatures, a racial disdain no doubt stemming back to their garuda forebears. 

Plumekith are drawn to high, mountainous regions, and many travel to the Mindspin Mountains of Belkzen to make war against the savage orcs there. Others make their homes in the Five Kings Mountains, fight gnolls in the Brazen Peaks of Katapesh, or dwell in the many hills and mountains of Varisia. Plumekith often claim to be loners, but still crave at least occasional companionship, and when they aren’t traveling they often make their homes near towns or small cities.

**Snake Hater**: You’ve always loathed serpents and other slithering monsters, ever since you can remember, and have studied them extensively. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and Knowledge (dungeoneering) is always a class skill for you.
