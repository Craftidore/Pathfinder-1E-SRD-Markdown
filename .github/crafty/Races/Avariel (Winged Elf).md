# Avariel (Winged Elf)
## Overview
## **  Varient Avariels + Modified Winged Template**
VARIENT: <u>Avariels exist not as a subrace, but manifest seemingly at random among normal elves.</u>

*Much in the same way that dwarven thunder twins, a four-armed sahugain or a blue goblin is periodically born, there is a small chance an elf will develop avian traits during puberty, becoming an avariel at adulthood. Elves that become avariels aquire the winged template. One in a hundred elves, never including sea elves or drow, develop these traits by the time they reach maturity.*

***MODIFIED* WINGED TEMPLATE**
"Winged" template is an inheritated template that can be added to any corporeal creature (except elementals, oozes and plants) that doesn't already have a fly speed. A winged creature has all the base creature's characteristics except as noted here.
**Size and Type:** Animals become magical beasts.
**Speed:** A winged creature gains a fly speed equal to twice its base land speed with Good manuverability.
**Special Qualities:** A winged creature gains the special quality described below.
Improved low-light vision. If the base creature already has a form of low-light vision, that ability improves by two steps instead (to a maximum of Superior low-light vision).
**Abilities:** +4 Dex, +2 Wis
**Skills:** A winged creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Jump and Spot checks.
**Feats:** A winged creature gains the benefits of the Altitude Adaptation and Cold Endurance (Frostburn, pg. 45) feats.
**Challenge Rating:** Base creature's CR +1
**Level Adjustment:** +2


<u>Sight distances among those creatures with low-light vision:</u>

Low-light vision (x2 distance)

Improved low-light vision (x3)

Greater low-light vision (x4)

Superior low-light vision (x5)



The feats help with high altitude flight... I wanted the template to outfly similar LA templates that grant flight, but don't focus primarily on it.

Also, having avariels emerge in this manner has a few benefits:

gives you more choices for your avariel

removes it from the "menu" of the Alter Self spell

Avariels won't die out as long as surface dwelling elves remain

these Avariels will live longer due to having a different age chart


=============

another possibility

Just had a quick look at the ARG. 
Gliding wings and elven magic both cost 3RP. 
Full wings cost 4 - maybe elven magic and weapon familiarity? 

=============

Or slap the Winged template (Savage Species) onto a regular elf.

This also opens the door for that most despised aberration, the winged drow!
