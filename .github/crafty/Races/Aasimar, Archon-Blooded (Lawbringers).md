**Archon-Blooded (Lawbringers)** 

*Lawbringers are champions of justice and of doling out punishment to the wicked, and often believe chaos is the cause of all mortal suffering.* 

**Archon-Blooded** 

**Ancestry** Archon 

**Typical Alignment** LG 

**Ability Modifiers** +2 Con, +2 Wis 

**Alternate Skill Modifiers** Intimidate, Sense Motive 

**Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Lawbringers gain *continual flame* as a spell-like ability. 

Lawbringers reflect the patience of their archon ancestors in their daily lives; they understand the need for rules and routines, and use their inherent discipline to train in their chosen field as they seek to do good. They develop their talents faster than most of their peers and show exceptional skill at whatever they focus their attention on. 

Lawbringers feel most comfortable in regions where a clear hierarchy and system of justice exists, preferably alongside good people and honest rulers. Many archon-blooded aasimars can be found in Andoran, Lastwall, Mendev, and Molthune; lawbringers in Mendev are often paladins or crusaders who use their homes as a place to rest between excursions into the Worldwound. 

Evil kingdoms that use tyranny and repression to keep their people in line infuriate lawbringers. Aasimars can thus be found in Cheliax, Geb, and Nidal, conducting organized resistances that seek to find the most legitimate and least destructive ways to neutralize the nations’ tyrannical governments. 

Traits 

The following are race traits for lawbringers. 

**Good Influence**: You possess an innate ability to motivate and inspire others to do the right thing. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when attempting to persuade a nongood creature to make a decision that benefits the cause of good, and when persuading a nonlawful creature to make a decision in line with the laws of the region. These bonuses stack if you attempt to persuade a nongood, nonlawful creature to take a lawful good action. 

**Lantern Spirit**: Your celestial ancestor was a lantern archon for centuries before ascending to a higher rank. You feel a strange sense of nostalgia whenever you use your *continual flame* spell-like ability, and can use it as a move action instead of a standard action.
