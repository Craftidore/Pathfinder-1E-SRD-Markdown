Dwarf, badlands Humanoid +0 +2 Con, –2 Cha Fighter Common, Dwarven

Some dwarves have made their homes in the badlands

of the wastes, where they dig for an entirely different

type of treasure—water. Because badlands are usually

formed by water erosion, deposits of water sometimes

form deep below the surface in quantities that can sustain

a settlement for years. In some rare cases, badlands

dwarves tap into subterranean rivers, making their

communities attractive stops for merchant caravans and

nomad tribes alike.

Badlands dwarves are identical to the dwarves detailed

in the *Player’s Handbook,* except as noted below.

• Waterwise: Badlands dwarves gain a +2 racial bonus

on Survival checks to fi nd water, and a +2 racial bonus

on Search checks to locate architectural and natural

features that involve water. This ability works on pipes

and sluices, traps that use water or other liquids, and

natural or supernatural hazards involving water. A

badlands dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of an

unusual water-related construction or hazard can make

a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a

badlands dwarf can use Search to fi nd water-based traps

as a rogue can. This racial trait replaces the standard

dwarf’s stonecunning ability.

• A badlands dwarf can go without water for two days (48

hours), plus a number of hours equal to his Constitution

score, before beginning to experience the ill effects of

thirst (see Dehydration, page 15).

• Badlands dwarves do not gain the standard dwarf’s

+2 racial bonus on Appraise and Craft checks that are

related to stone or metal.

• Heat Endurance: Badlands dwarves gain Heat Endurance

(see page 50) as a bonus feat.
