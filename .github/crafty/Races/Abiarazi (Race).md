**Abiarazi**

Abiarazi are shape-changing oozes that can

take the form of other humanoids. They have

latent psychic abilities and voracious appetites.

Abiarazi find the concept of ownership an

oddity: a quirk shared by other races. However,

they understand all too well the concept of

consumption, and whether it’s an entire store of

foodstuffs or planetary resources, the abiarazi are

hungry for more.

Originally hailing from a planetoid known as

Vivistaldur, the abiarazi were forced into space

when their planet was shattered. Half of the

planet was broken into a multitude of vesselsized

asteroids that, along with the remaining

hemisphere of the planet, continue to orbit within

the star system. It is a harsh reminder to all sentient

races to not allow these creatures to become

overcome by their own insatiable appetites. While

their homeworld is incapable of sustaining life,

the abiarazi survive on half a dozen other worlds,

forming a small empire (as celestial empires go)

and attempting to rebuild the glory of their longlost

home. Some abiarazi make sacred pilgrimages

back to Vivistaldur to search for forgotten cultural

relics or lost knowledge; these voyages into their

own past are a time-honored tradition. Recovering

what was lost by their forbears is considered one of

the greatest honors in abiarazi culture. Those that

engage in such expeditions are viewed as a mixture

of heroes to their people and as beings anointed by

some undefined “higher power” that has charged

them with the task of restoring to the abiarazi that

which had been forgotten. Those that bring back

to memory bits of their ancient culture or retrieve

11

ancient artifacts are revered and provided for by

their communities.

**Physical Description**: In their true forms, they

are pulpy masses of vein-riddled violet slime,

though they often take the form of pale-skinned

humanoids with flat, nose less faces, dark eyes, and

scowling mouths.

**Society**: Abariazi appear to get along and

work well with others of their species. While

most abiarazi have no qualms about taking on

humanoid forms for extended periods of time,

there are some within abiarazi society that consider

themselves “purists”, keeping their amorphous,

gelatinous forms unless they need to take on

another shape for a specific purpose. There are a

few pitiful abiarazi that have gone mad, constantly

shifting between a plethora of forms, unable to

retain a shape for more than a few seconds at a

time. This makes them difficult to interact with at

the best of times, and dangerous at the worst.

Abiarazi find the commingling of their gelatinous

natural forms to be exceptionally intimate, and

taboo unless done with a mate in a private setting.

It is also considered impolite to pass through an

abiarazi in its ooze form, as it is regarded as an

invasion of that abiarazi’s personal space.

**Relations**: Abiarazi often have a difficult time

interacting with other races because they are

viewed as strange and exotic. Most sentient races

do not want to willingly meet an ooze, so they

usually assume a humanoid form to interact with

other species. When abiarazi want to put someone

at ease, they often appear as a member of

whatever race that they’re interacting with.

They have no unusual ties to any one race,

though they do have strained relations with

humans. For reasons that are lost to the pages of

time, humans and abiarazi do not typically get

along very well, and the shape-changing oozes are

not openly welcome in human communities.

**Alignment and Religion**: Abiarazi are largely

secular, not worshipping any set of gods. Those

abiarazi that indulge in religion often worship gods

of space and of the void, particularly the goddess

Alula. There are small communities of abiarazi

that worship other gods, but they are far more the

exception than the rule.

Races

Abiarazi

Raci al Traits

15 RP

+2 **Constitution, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma** (0 RP):

Abiarazi are tough and cunning, but put other creatures

off by their strange mannerisms.

**Type Ooze (5 RP):** Abiarazi are oozes with the shapechanger subtype. They eat and breathe, but do not

sleep unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from this activity, such as gaining spells. Abiarazi

are neither mindless, nor blind, and so they have no special immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects,

illusions, or other attack forms that rely upon sight. Abiarazi are immune to sleep effects.

**Size Medium (0 RP):** Abiarazi are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their

size.

**Base Speed Normal Speed (0 RP):** Abiarazi have a base speed of 30 feet.

**Compulsive (-1 RP):** Abiarazi find simple, repetitive behaviors fascinating, almost to the point of

obsession. This may manifest itself in varied ways; overeating, gambling, repeatedly washing after

minimal contact with other species, etc. Thus, abiarazi suffer a -2 penalty to Will saves to resist

compulsions.

**Oozeform (2 RP):** As a standard action, abiarazi can become flexible enough to move through areas at

least half their size with no penalty for squeezing. Abiarazi can move through a space at least onequarter

of their size using the standard penalties for squeezing. Abiarazi may use this ability a number

of rounds per day equal to their total character level.

**Plasmic Lash (2 RP):** Abiarazi have a long, sticky tentacle that you can use to attack with. In humanoid

form, this tentacle typically manifests itself as a tongue-like appendage. It is treated as a secondary melee

attack and is sticky along its entire surface. A creature hit by this attack cannot move more than 10 feet

away from the abiarazi and takes a -2 penalty to AC if the lash is attached (this penalty does not stack if

multiple lashes are attached). The lash can be removed by the target or an adjacent ally by making an

opposed Strength check against the abiarazi as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of damage to

the lash (AC 11, damage does not reduce the abiarazi's hit points). An abiarazi cannot move more than 10

feet away from a creature stuck to its lash, but it can release its lash from the target as a free action, and

the abiarazi may pull any creature attached to its lash 5 feet toward it as a swift action if it succeeds in an

opposed Strength check. An abiarazi can only have one creature attached to its lash at a time.

**Psychic Obscurity (2 RP):** Once per day, abiarazi can use *blur* as a spell-like ability (caster level equals to

the abiarazi's character level).

**Shapechanger (6 RP):** As a standard action, abiarazi can alter their forms, either into a generic

humanoid shape, or to take on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid as the *alter self*

spell, save that it does not adjust its ability scores. While in their natural forms, abiarazi are unable to

wear armor or clothing.

**Voracious Appetite (-1 RP):** Abiarazi are almost constantly hungry and require twice as much food as

a normal humanoid. If an abiarazi does not eat at least once every four hours, it gains the fatigued

condition.

**Languages (0 RP):** Abiarazi speak Aklo. An abiarazi with a high Intelligence score can choose from

the following: Aurelian, Common, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Manu, or Pasimachi.

13

**Adventurers**: The ruins of Vivistaldur are a nighirresistible

draw to abiarazi, and many abiarazi

choose to make the journey from the farthest

reaches of the cosmos. There are others that choose

a life of piracy or conquest, and such abiarazi are

often reviled as the scourge of the stars.

**Male Names**: Agu, Fahd, Majid, Nuh, Sa’ld,

Ulan, Vega, Zayd

**Female Names**: Baraka, Folami, Kanika,

Kehinde, Radhiya, Samiyah, Yamileth,

Zaynabu

*whip*, and *mental barrier*. The caster level for these

effects is equal to the abiarazi’s level, with a DC

equal to (12 + the abiarazi’s Intelligence bonus).

**Ultrapsionic (6 RP):** The abiarazi gains the

following psionic powers; 1/day−*biofeedback*,

Arch etypes

Morphic Warrior (Fighter)

Training from birth to control their ability to

take on humanoid form, abiarazi use their ability

to shapechange to their advantage in combat

situations. The morphic warrior capitalizes on his

ability, making himself a very difficult target to hit

by rapidly manipulating his form.

**Agile Defense (Ex):** At 2nd level, you gain a

+1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. This bonus

increases by +1 for every six levels beyond

2nd (to a maximum of +4 at 20th level).

This ability replaces bravery.

Races

**Shapechanger’s Dodge (Ex):** Starting at

3rd level, you can use your shapechanger

racial trait as an immediate action when

a target opponent declares a melee or

ranged attack against you. The opponent

suffers a 20% miss chance on that attack

and on successive attacks against you until

the start of your next turn. Every four levels

thereafter, the miss chance increases by

+10% to a maximum of 50% at 15th level.

You can use this ability a number of times

per day equal to 4 + your Charisma bonus.

This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.
