# Dwarf
## Overview
Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.

Dwarves are lovers of history and tradition, and their long lifespan leads to far less in the way of generational shifts in attitudes, styles, fashions, and trends than shorter-lived races exhibit. If a thing is not broken, they do not fix it or change it; and if it is broken, they fix it rather than replace it. Thrifty as a rule, dwarves are loath to discard anything unless it is truly ruined and unable to be fixed. At the same time, dwarves’ meticulous, near-obsessive attention to detail and durability in their craftsmanship makes that a rare occurrence, as the things they make are built to last. As a result, buildings, artwork, tools, housewares, garments, weapons, and virtually everything else made by dwarves still sees regular use at an age when such items would be relegated to museum pieces, dusty antique shelves, or junkyard fodder by other races. Taken together, these traits create the impression that dwarves are a race frozen in time.

Nothing could be further from the truth, however, as dwarves are both thoughtful and imaginative, willing to experiment, if always keen to ref ine and perfect a new technique or product before moving on to the next one. Dwarves have achieved feats of metallurgy, stonework, and engineering that have consistently outpaced the technological advances of other races, though some non-dwarven races have used magic to supplement and perfect their own creations to achieve the same ends through mystical rather than mundane means. They are also a race typified by stubborn courage and dedication to seeing tasks through to completion, whatever the risks. These traits have led dwarves to explore and settle in extreme environments that would cause other races to quail and retreat. From the darkest depths of the underworld to the highest mountain peaks, from rusting iron citadels along desolate rocky coasts to squat jungle ziggurats, dwarves have established their enclaves and redoubts, holding them against all comers or perishing to the last and leaving only their enduring monuments to stand as their legacy. 

While it is said that dwarves are not venturesome or inventive, it would be more accurate to say that they maintain a focus on and dedication to each task they undertake and every change they adopt, vetting such changes thoroughly before adopting them wholeheartedly. When faced with new circumstances and new needs, they react by applying tried and true tools and techniques systematically, using existing methods whenever possible rather than trying to invent novel solutions for every situation. If necessity requires, however, they throw themselves with equal vigor into developing the next perfect procedure for demolishing the obstacles that get in their way. Once their desired goal is obtained, they focus on consolidating each new piece of territory or conceptual advance. Dwarves thus rarely overextend themselves, but they also may miss opportunities to seize the initiative and maximize the advantages they create. 

**Physical Description:** Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse—no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.

**Society:** The great distances between dwarves’ mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves’ fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call “aggressive negotiations.”

**Relations:** Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and half lings to be too frail, flighty, or “pretty” to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans’ industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.

**Alignment and Religion:** Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoff ish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder—especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.

**Adventurers:** Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the conf ines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.

**Male Names:** Dolgrin, Grunyar, Harsk, Kazmuk, Morgrym, Rogar.

**Female Names:** Agna, Bodill, Ingra, Kotri, Rusilka, Yangrit.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**ALTERNATE RACIAL RULES**

While most think of dwarves as a relatively homogenous race, many clans have adapted over the years to better survive in harsh and varied environments. The following options represent some of that customization, and can be taken by any dwarf character.

**Alternate Racial Traits**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of the standard dwarf racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Ancient Enmity:** Dwarves have long been in conflict with elves, especially the hated drow. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the elf subtype. This racial trait replaces hatred.

**Craftsman:** Dwarves are known for their superior craftsmanship when it comes to metallurgy and stonework. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] checks related to metal or stone. This racial trait replaces greed.

**Deep Warrior:** Dwarves with this racial trait grew up facing the abominations that live deep beneath the surface. They receive a +2 dodge bonus to AC against monsters of the aberration type and a +2 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple such creatures (or to continue a grapple). This racial trait replaces defensive training.

**Giant Hunter:** Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoids with the giant subtype. Furthermore, they gain a +2 bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to f ind and follow tracks made by humanoids with the giant subtype. This racial trait replaces the hatred racial trait.

**Lorekeeper:** Dwarves keep extensive records about their history and the world around them. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) checks that pertain to dwarves or their enemies. They can make such skill checks untrained. This racial trait replaces greed.

**Magic Resistant:** Some of the older dwarven clans are particularly resistant to magic. Dwarves with this racial trait gain spell resistance equal to 5 + their character level. This resistance can be lowered for 1 round as a standard action. Dwarves with this racial trait take a –2 penalty on all concentration checks made in relation to arcane spells. This racial trait replaces hardy.

**Minesight:** Dwarves with this racial trait increase the range of their darkvision to 90 feet; however, they are automatically [[Dazzled|dazzled]] in bright light and take a –2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor. This racial trait replaces darkvision.

**Mountaineer:** Mountain dwarves are skilled at climbing and navigating narrow ledges. Dwarves with this racial trait are immune to altitude sickness and do not lose their Dexterity bonus to AC when making [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] or [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks to cross narrow or slippery surfaces. This racial trait replaces stability. 

**Relentless:** Dwarves are skilled at pushing their way through a battlef ield, tossing aside lesser foes with ease. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush or overrun an opponent. This bonus only applies while both the dwarf and his opponent are standing on the ground. This racial trait replaces stability.

**Rock Stepper:** Dwarves with this racial trait can skillfully negotiate rocky terrain. They can ignore difficult terrain created by rubble, broken ground, or steep stairs when they take a 5-foot step. This racial trait replaces stonecunning.

**Saltbeard:** Dwarves occasionally found iron cities along rugged seacoasts, and natives of such cities gain a +2 bonus on [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks while at sea. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. Their greed racial trait applies only to treasure found in or under the water, but applies to all such treasure regardless of whether or not it contains metal or gemstones. This racial trait replaces defensive training, hatred, and stonecunning.

**Sky Sentinel:** As creatures with a deep affinity for the ground, dwarves are wary of attacks from above. Enemies on higher ground gain no attack roll bonus against dwarves with this racial trait, and they gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls, a +2 dodge bonus to AC, and a +2 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks against flying creatures. This racial trait replaces defensive training, hatred, and stonecunning. 

**Stonesinger:** Some dwarves’ affinity for the earth grants them greater powers. Dwarves with this racial trait are treated as one level higher when casting spells with the earth descriptor or using granted powers of the [[Earth (Domain)|Earth]] domain, the bloodline powers of the earth elemental bloodline, and revelations of the oracle’s stone mystery. This ability does not give them early access to level-based powers; it only affects the powers they could use without this ability. This racial trait replaces stonecunning.

**Stubborn:** Dwarves are renowned for their stubbornness. Dwarves with this racial trait receive a +2 racial bonus on Will saves to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enchantment (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) schools. In addition, if they fail such a save, they receive another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming it has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the dwarf has a similar ability from another source (such as a rogue’s [[Slippery Mind|slippery mind]]), he can only use one of these abilities per round, but he can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails. This racial trait replaces hardy. 

**Surface Survivalist:** Some dwarves have dwelt so long aboveground they have lost their ability to see at night. However, their adaptation to extreme environments allows them to treat wind conditions (when determining whether or not they are checked or blown away) and either hot or cold climates (choose one) as one step less severe. This racial trait replaces darkvision.

**Xenophobic:** Isolationist dwarves despise non-dwarven humanoids. They speak only Dwarven and do not gain any bonus languages from possessing a high Intelligence score. In addition, they learn only one language per 2 ranks of [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] they possess. However, their untrusting nature gives them a +1 bonus against mind-affecting effects, except for fear affects. This racial trait replaces a dwarf ’s normal languages.

**Wyrmscourged:** Dwarves with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC and on saving throws against the exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of dragons. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) checks to identify dragons and can make such checks untrained. This racial trait replaces defensive training, hatred, and stonecunning.

## Racial Subtypes
**Racial Subtypes**

You can combine various alternate racial traits to create dwarven subraces or variant races, such as the following.

**Deep Delver:**  Dwarves living far below the earth have the minesight and deep warrior racial traits. Deep delver spellcasters may exchange stonecunning for the stonesinger trait.

**Elder Dwarf:** Traditionalist dwarves of ancient lineage have the ancient enmity, lorekeeper, and either the magic resistant or stubborn racial traits. 

**Exiled Dwarf:** Dwarves who have lost their homelands usually have the relentless and stubborn racial traits, and often have wyrmscourged as well.

**Mountain Dwarf:** Dwarves living atop high peaks have the mountaineer racial trait and often surface survivalist as well. Mountain dwarves are also trained to defend their homes, and may take the sky sentinel and xenophobic traits instead.

## Favored Class Options
**Favored Class Options**

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, dwarves have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon the character’s favored class. 

The following options are available to all dwarves who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

**Alchemist:** Add +1/4 to the alchemist’s natural armor bonus when using his mutagen.

**[[Barbarian]]****:** Add +1 to the barbarian’s total number of rage rounds per day.

**[[Bard]]****:** Reduce arcane spell failure chance for casting bard spells when wearing medium armor by +1%. Once the total reaches 10%, the bard also receives Medium Armor Proficiency, if he does not already possess it.

**Cavalier:** Add +1/2 to the cavalier’s bonus to damage against targets of his challenge.

**[[Cleric]]****:** Select one domain power granted at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the cleric’s Wisdom modifier. The cleric adds +1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power.

**[[Druid]]****:** Select one domain power granted at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the druid’s Wisdom modif ier. The druid adds +1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power.

**[[Fighter]]****:** Add +1 to the fighter’s CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip.

**Gunslinger:** Reduce the misfire chance for one type of firearm by 1/4. You cannot reduce the misfire chance of a firearm below 1.

**[[Inquisitor]]:**  Add +1/2 to the inquisitor’s level for the purpose of determining the effects of one type of judgment. 

**Magus:** Select one known magus arcana usable only once per day. The magus adds +1/6 to the number of times it can be used per day. Once that magus arcana is usable twice per day, the magus must select a different magus arcana. 

**[[Monk]]****:** Reduce the Hardness of any object made of clay, stone, or metal by 1 whenever the object is struck by the monk’s unarmed strike (minimum of 0).

**Oracle:** Reduce the penalty for not being prof icient with one weapon by 1. When the nonproficiency penalty for a weapon becomes 0 because of this ability, the oracle is treated as having the appropriate Martial or [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] feat with that weapon.

**[[Paladin]]****:** Add a +1 bonus on concentration checks when casting paladin spells.

**[[Ranger]]****:** Add a +1/2 bonus on wild empathy checks to inf luence animals and magical beasts that live underground.

**[[Rogue]]****:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] checks regarding stone traps and a +1/2 bonus to trap sense regarding stone traps.

**[[Sorcerer]]****:** Add +1/2 to acid and earth spell or spell-like ability damage.

**Summoner:** Add a +1/4 natural armor bonus to the AC of the summoner’s eidolon.

**Witch:** Add +1/4 natural armor bonus to the AC of the witch’s familiar.

**[[Wizard]]****:**  Select one item creation feat known by the wizard. Whenever he crafts an item using that feat, the amount of progress he makes in an 8-hour period increases by 200 gp (50 gp if crafting while adventuring). This does not reduce the cost of the item; it just increases the rate at which the item is crafted.

## Racial Archetypes
**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetypes are available to dwarves.

**Exarch (Inquisitor)**

The gruff traditionalism of most dwarves finds its apex in those who adhere to a strict orthodoxy rooted in ancient principles and practices and who are not amenable whatsoever to change or innovation. 

Spells: Exarchs cannot cast spells with the chaotic descriptor.

Inflexible Will (Ex): At 1st level, an exarch gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against [[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]] and insanity effects and effects with the chaotic descriptor. This ability replaces monster lore.

*Detect Chaos (Sp):* At will, an exarch can use *[[Detect Chaos (Spell)|detect chaos]]*. This ability replaces detect alignment.

*Fearsome Jurist (Su):* At 5th level, an exarch can imbue one of her weapons with the jurist or menacing weapon special ability as a swift action, and may switch between these properties as a swift action. When using either special ability, her weapon’s critical threat range doubles against chaotic creatures. This does not stack with *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]*, [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], or similar effects. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]*. 

*Aura of Repetition (Su):* At 8th level, once per day while using her judgment, an exarch can project an aura of repetition, as the Toil subdomain power (Advanced Player’s Guide 97). If the exarch takes Artif ice (Toil) as her domain, the save DC of her aura increases by 2 but its duration does not increase. This ability replaces her second judgment.

*Double Jeopardy (Su):* At 12th level, whenever an exarch uses her fearsome jurist ability, she may choose to affect two weapons, with one gaining the jurist weapon special ability and the other the menacing special ability as above. Both special abilities may be combined in a single weapon, whose critical threat range doubles. This does not stack with *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]*, [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], or similar effects. This ability replaces *greater bane*. 

*Aura of Reversion (Su):* At 16th level, while using her judgment, an exarch can project a 30-foot-radius emanation for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. Any creature other than the exarch that is using a transmutation effect within this aura at the beginning of its turn becomes [[Sickened|sickened]], or [[Sickened|sickened]] and [[Nauseated|nauseated]] if using a polymorph effect, including the change shape ability (Fortitude negates; DC 10 + 1/2 the exarch’s level + her Wisdom modifier). Continuous effects from permanent magical items do not cause this effect. Within the aura, dispel checks against transmutation effects gain a +4 bonus. This ability cannot be used simultaneously with aura of repetition. This ability replaces her third judgment.

**Foehammer (Fighter)**

While the axe is the most famous dwarven weapon, the hammer is at the heart of dwarves’ heritage as forgemasters and warriors alike. 

*Sledgehammer (Ex):* At 3rd level, a foehammer wielding a hammer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush, overrun, sunder, or trip. This ability replaces armor training 1.

*Weapon Training (Ex):* At 5th level, a foehammer must select hammers and does not gain weapon training with other groups, though his weapon training bonus improves by +1 every four levels after 5th.

*Hammer to the Ground (Ex):* At 7th level, when a foehammer succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver, he can make a trip combat maneuver at the end of the bull rush. If he does not move with the target, the force of his blow may still trip his foe, but he takes a –5 penalty on the combat maneuver check to trip. 

At 15th level, any creature a foehammer successfully bull rushes is automatically knocked prone at the end of the bull rush. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4. 

*Rhythmic Blows (Ex):* At 9th level, each time that a foehammer hits a target, he gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that target. This bonus stacks with each hit against that target, but lasts only until the end of the foehammer’s turn. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

*Piledriver (Ex):* At 11th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces armor training 3. 

*Ground Breaker (Ex):* At 13th level, as a full-round action, a foehammer may strike the ground with his hammer. If the attack deals more damage than the floor’s hardness, the space he occupies and all adjacent squares become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except for the foehammer, are knocked prone (DC 15 Ref lex negates). This ability replaces weapon training 3.

*Hammer Master (Ex):* At 17th level, any combat feats a foehammer has learned with any weapon from the hammer weapon training group (e.g., Improved Critical, Weapon Focus) apply to all weapons from that group. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

*Devastating Blow (Ex):* At 19th level, as a standard action, a foehammer may make a single melee attack with a weapon from the hammer weapon training group at a –5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Weapon special abilities that only activate on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed. This ability replaces armor mastery.

*Weapon Mastery (Ex):* A foehammer must choose a weapon from the hammer group. 

**Forgemaster (Cleric)**

Forgemasters are priestly dwarves who are ritual casters and expert enchanters, able to produce their rune-graven armaments with astonishing speed. 

*Artificer:* A forgemaster gains only one domain, which must be the Artifice domain (not including subdomains). If she worships a deity, it must grant the Artifice domain. 

*Steel Spells:* A forgemaster adds the following spells to her spell list : 1st—*crafter’s curse, crafter’s fortune, lead blades*; 2nd—*chill metal*,* heat metal, shatter;* 3rd—*keen edge, versatile weapon;* 8th—*iron body, repel metal or stone.*

*Divine Smith (Su):* Whenever a forgemaster casts a spell that targets a weapon, shield, or armor, the spell takes effect at +1 caster level. If the spell has one or more metamagic feats applied, she reduces the total level adjustment to the spell by 1 (minimum 0). 

*Runeforger (Su):* A forgemaster may inscribe mystical runes upon a suit of armor, shield, or weapon as full-round action, using this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. These runes last 1 round per cleric level, but inscribing the same rune twice on an item increases this duration to 1 minute per level, three times to 10 minutes per level, and four times to 1 hour per level. *Erase* affects runes as magical writing. A forgemaster learns forgemaster’s blessing at 1st level and may learn one additional rune at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. 

Only one type of rune marked with an asterisk (\*) may be placed on an item at any given time. This ability replaces channel energy. 

*Ancient Splendor:*  The inscribed weapon, armor, or shield grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks (+4 when interacting with dwarves).

*Bloodthirst\*:* The inscribed piercing or slashing weapon functions as if it had the wounding special ability, even if nonmagical. The forgemaster must be at least 4th level before learning this rune.

Deathstrike: The inscribed weapon stores a *death knell* spell that triggers immediately if a blow from the weapon reduces a target to negative hit points. This expends all deathstrike runes on the weapon. The forgemaster must be at least 4th level before learning this rune.

*Durability:* The inscribed item’s hardness increases by an amount equal to the forgemaster’s Wisdom modif ier, and its hit points increase by an amount equal to twice her level.

*Featherlight:*  The inscribed item’s weight is halved; a metal item’s weight is reduced to 1/4 normal. If inscribed on a suit of armor, its armor check penalty for Acrobatics, Climb, and Jump checks is halved.

*Forgemaster’s Blessing:* The inscribed nonmagical item functions as a masterwork item. 

*Ghostglyph\*:*  The inscribed weapon, shield, or armor gains the ghost touch special ability. The forgemaster must be at least 4th level before learning this rune.

*Glowglyph:* The inscribed item sheds light as a torch. As a standard action, the bearer can command the rune to erupt in a burst of light as a shield with the blinding special ability with a burst radius of 5 feet per glowglyph rune inscribed on the item. This expends all glowglyph runes on the item. 

*Invulnerability\*:* The inscribed armor grants its wearer DR/magic equal to 1/2 her cleric level. The forgemaster must be at least 8th level before learning this rune.

*Powerstrike\*:*  The inscribed weapon’s critical threat range doubles. This does not stack with *keen edge*, Improved Critical, or similar effects. The forgemaster must be at least 6th level before learning this rune.

*Return\*:*  The inscribed weapon gains the returning weapon special ability. The forgemaster must be at least 4th level before learning this rune.

*Spellguard:*  The inscribed item gains spell resistance equal to 11 + her cleric level. This applies only to effects targeting the item itself.

*Spellglyph\*:* The inscribed weapon gains the spell storing special ability. The forgemaster must be at least 4th level before learning this rune.

*Thief-Curse:*  The forgemaster designates one creature as the rightful owner of an item. Any other creature that intentionally grasps the item is cursed (as *bestow curse*) for the duration of the rune. The forgemaster must be at least 6th level before learning this rune.

*Tracer:* For as long as the rune lasts, the cleric may sense its location at will as a standard action, as if using* locate object*. 

Craft Magic Arms and Armor: The forgemaster gains this as a bonus feat at 3rd level. 

*Master Smith (Ex):* At 5th level, a forgemaster can craft mundane metal items quickly, using half their gp value to determine progress, and can craft magical metal items in half the normal amount of time.

**Stonelord (Paladin)**

A stonelord is a devoted sentinel of dwarven enclaves, drawing the power of the earth and ancient stone to protect her people.

*Stonestrike (Su):* Once per day per paladin level, a stonelord can draw upon the power of the living rock. As a swift action, she treats her melee attacks until the beginning of her next turn (whether armed or unarmed) as magical and adamantine, including ignoring hardness up to twice her paladin level, with a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as on combat maneuver checks. This bonus also applies to her CMD if she or her target is touching the ground or a stone structure. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This ability replaces smite evil.

*Heartstone (Ex):* At 2nd level, a stonelord’s flesh becomes progressively rockier. She gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC and DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 her paladin level. The natural armor bonus increases by +1 at 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These benefits are halved when not touching the ground or a stone structure. This ability replaces divine grace. 

*Stoneblood (Ex):* At 3rd level, a stonelord’s vitals begin to calcify and her blood transforms into liquid stone. She adds her paladin level on checks to stabilize at negative hit points and gains a 25% chance to ignore a critical hit or precision damage. This does not stack with fortification armor or similar effects. At 9th level, this chance increases to 50% and she becomes immune to petrification. At 15th level, this chance increases to 75% and she becomes immune to bleed and blood drain effects. This ability replaces divine health and her mercies gained at 3rd, 9th, and 15th level.

*Defensive Stance (Ex):* At 4th level, a stonelord gains the defensive stance ability, as a stalwart defender (Advanced Player’s Guide 277), and may select one defensive power at 8th level and every four levels thereafter. Levels of stalwart defender stack with her paladin levels when determining the total number of rounds that she can maintain her defensive stance per day. A stonelord does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items.

*Earth Channel (Su):* At 4th level, a stonelord gains Elemental Channel (earth) as a bonus feat, which she may activate by spending two uses of her lay on hands ability, using her paladin level as her effective cleric level. This ability replaces channel positive energy.

*Stone Servant (Su):* At 5th level, a stonelord may call a Small earth elemental to her side, as a paladin calls her mount. This earth elemental is Lawful Good in alignment and possesses the celestial template, and it increases in size as the stonelord gains levels, becoming Medium at 8th level, Large at 11th level, Huge at 14th level, Greater at 17th level, and Elder at 20th level. This ability replaces divine bond.

*Stonebane (Su):* At 11th level, when using stonestrike, a stonelord’s attack gains the baneweapon special ability against creatures with the earth subtype and constructs or objects made of earth or stone. This ability replaces aura of justice.

*Phase Strike (Su):* At 12th level, a stonelord’s stonestrike may pass through stone and metal as if they weren’t there. By spending 2 uses of her stonestrike ability, she may ignore any cover less than total cover provided by stone or metal, and she ignores any AC bonus from stone or metal armor or shields as if wielding a brilliant energyweapon. A phase strike cannot damage constructs, objects, or creatures with the earth subtype, but unlike a brilliant energyweapon, it can harm undead. This ability replaces her 12th-level mercy.

*Mobile Defense (Ex):* At 18th level, a stonelord can make one 5-foot step per round while maintaining her defensive stance. This ability replaces her 18th-level mercy.

*Stone Body (Ex):* At 20th level, a stonelord’s body transforms into living stone. She no longer needs to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and she becomes immune to paralysis, poison, and stunning. She is also no longer subject to critical hits or precision-based damage. This ability replaces holy champion.

The dwarves of Midgard live in three great realms: the Northern halls such as Tanserhall and Wolfheim, the cantons of the Ironcrags, and the Southern city of Nuria Natal. The dwarves of the three realms are distinct in their culture, strengths, and style. 

The Northlands dwarves are keepers of the old ways and the old gods, smiths and warriors, farmers and traders, stout and strong and able to down a barrel of ale at one sitting. They keep busy fighting the giants or the werewolves and worgs in the North, but sometimes the Northern dwarves take to the sea in their longships and raid the coasts, from Vidim through the Donnermark and Krakova to northern Dornig territories, but passing over the magocracy of Allain. 

The Northern dwarves are especially accomplished at ring-making, smithwork, and (for some reason) berserk shapeshifting. They have a society of especially fearsome bear-shirted berserks. 

The cantonal dwarves are makers, miners, and smiths, digging deep into the Ironcrags for iron and gold and forging items of great wonder, primarily exceptional spears, crossbows, and arrows, but also great artistic works. Singular items are a lifetime’s masterwork: a clockwork steed or wagon, an airship, a returning hammer, or a suit of invulnerable armor. None of these are beyond the grasp of a cantonal smith. 

The cantonal dwarves serve no kings, but rule themselves. They often serve as mercenaries in the Seven Cities, among the Princes of Dornig, and even against the Mharoti Empire, side by side with the Magdar knights. 

The Southlands dwarves are distant relatives at best, with different language, magic, and style. In the desert heat the Southern dwarves shave their heads and wrap their beards tightly in gold or copper wire; sometimes these beards are forked or braided as well. They serve a male mask of Rava they call Ptah, and they build clockwork bodies they call shabti, or servants. Their skin is dark as ebony, and— when not shorn—their hair runs to pure black, gold, or red. The Southern dwarves are alchemists and mystics, with a particular hatred of dragons and the Mharoti Empire. They have served the King of Nuria Natal well and faithfully as bodyguards and as his heavy infantry for centuries, and as engineers who build his temples, city walls, and step pyramids. 

**Dwarves and Men** 

The tale of men and dwarves might be punctuated by feuds and battles, but they are allies more often than not. At first the dwarves mistook humans for a degenerate subrace of elf, and later grouped them among the many “lesser races” of Midgard. Gifts, familiarity, and common ground eventually forged an alliance between the two races, a concord that grew stronger as the old gods gave way to the new, but it was hardly an equal partnership. The dwarves raided into human lands at the least provocation, and their kingdoms claimed huge tracks of land occupied by other races, which the dwarves either drove out or enslaved. Those who proved too troublesome were exterminated. 

In the Northlands, those who submitted to dwarven rule were required to supply tribute in the form of gold and slaves. The human tributes were put to work laboring in mines or lowland farms. 

These client races first gave their masters the nickname “reaver dwarf.” As time passed and more dwarves were lost each generation to southern emigration, war, and vendetta, humanity gained a more even footing. 

Much of dwarf culture was adopted (or forced upon) humanity and the other races of the North and (later) the Ironcrags, but mankind taught the dwarves the arts of restrained diplomacy, cooperation, and peaceful trade. Some say that the dwarves have mellowed over the years, but others claim that humans have simply learned to weather the dwarves’ pride and temper. Certainly the name “reaver dwarf ” hasn’t been abandoned by the dwarves themselves. 

**Gunpowder and Airships**

The cantonal dwarves of Midgard are the only race with access to gunpowder and airships. This is purely an optional element of the setting, and gunpowder could be ignored entirely. If you choose to include gunpowder, gunslinger PCs in Midgard will require some form of connection to the cantons to gain access to proper guns, powder, and related materials. 

Airships occupy a similar position. The dwarves built a few of them in the canton of Templeforge, but the crafts are delicate and expensive. Most are used for high-value cargos and urgent military matters, and only a few cantons have an airship of their own.
