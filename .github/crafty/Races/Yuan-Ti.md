# Yuan-Ti
## Overview
**Level Adjustment:** Varies.

The yuan-ti are a race of snake people descended from an unholy crossbreeding between humans and an ancient reptilian race.

They come in three distinctly different forms (purebloods, halfbloods, and abominations), and they have created two subraces of servitors as well (tainted ones and broodguards). Together, they form a horrific threat to the rest of Faerûn. This section discusses the purebloods and tainted ones, the yuan-ti most likely to be found as adventurers or spies in humanoid lands.

Purebloods have some serpentine characteristics, but can generally pass for human. They are the weakest of the true yuan-ti, serving as overseers and taskmasters over the yuan-ti servitors and slaves, as well as spies and assassins. Purebloods have subtle reptilian features, such as snake eyes, forked tongues, pointed teeth, patches of scaly skin, and the like. They are human-sized. Purebloods answer to the halfbloods and the abominations, even more powerful creatures whose serpentine features are too pronounced to allow them to infiltrate humanoid society without powerful magic.

Tainted ones are humanoids who have been corrupted by drinking a special yuan-ti elixir. The result is a person who looks almost exactly like his normal self, but whose mind has been twisted to the yuan-ti way. They serve as yuan-ti agents and spies in humanoid lands. Tainted ones sometimes develop distinctive mannerisms such as licking their lips constantly, drawing out their sibilants when speaking, or keeping large serpents as pets.

## Ecology
**Ecology**

The yuan-ti are oviparous. Females give birth to a clutch of 3-6 eggs every three months. These are normally left unfertilized and fed to the high priest and his inner circle, though eating yuan-ti eggs is considered sacrilege for anyone of lesser status. The yuan-ti, like the citizens of the Scarlet Brotherhood, are careful in breeding one another for maximum fitness and intelligence, and to ensure that the various castes exist in their proper ratios.

Yuan-ti have a gestation period of about 60 months, with about 30% of their young dying of birth defects in infancy. The yuan-ti do not practice infanticide, but the mutations prevalent in their race often cause their young to die on their own. Their young are raised communally, separated from their parents.

A yuan-ti hatchling sheds its skin 5-6 times before reaching maturity, which happens in 4 years for purebloods, 6 years for halfbloods, and 8 years for abominations. Rarely, adults may undergo another growth spurt, as a sign of divine favor. Purebloods can live about 2,000 years, halfbreeds 4,000 years, and abominations about 6,000 years.

## Environment
**Environment**

Yuan-ti dwell in [[Hepmonaland]] and the [[Amedio Jungle]]. Cities under their control include Alocotla, Xapatlapo, and Xuxulieto. They may dwell in other places further south as well.

Yuan-ti typically inhabit subterranean complexes, most often originally built by other races, as the lack of hands in so many of their kind makes building difficult. They may also adopt natural caves, or even build tunnels under the cities of other races. They fill their lairs with traps and with corridors too narrow for anyone but snakes to slither through.

## Regions
**Regions:*** Forgotten Realms:* Chult, Hlondeth, Tashalar, Western Heartlands.

                  *Greyhawk*: [[Amedio Jungle]], [[Hepmonaland]]

## History
**History**

*Forgotten Realms:* The true yuan-ti are the proud descendants of interbreeding between humans and the long-lost saurian creator race. They can be found all across Faerûn, although they mostly prefer to keep their existence secret and the locations of their lairs even more so. They have a long, mostly frustrated history of trying to take over various kingdoms in Faerûn, but they have firmly established themselves in several places—the city of Hlondeth in the Vilhon Reach, the land of Tashalar on the Shining Sea, and in the depths of the Black Jungles and Mhair Jungles.

These days, the yuan-ti have decided that if the direct approach does not work, there are still other ways to bring a country to its knees. To that end, they are infiltrating hundreds of agents—mostly tainted ones—into important posts throughout the various nations of Faerûn. These spies are to gather information about potential targets and look for opportunities for the yuan-ti to strike.

*Greyhawk:* In approximately -1100 CY, the high priests of the Olman city-states Alocotla and Xapatlapo made a pact with Tlaloc. In an elaborate ceremony, they sacrificed and devoured one thousand infants, and all who partook of that feast were transformed into yuan-ti. These changes bred true, and yuan-ti continue to rule those two cities to this day, as well as the city of Xuxulieto and elsewhere.

## Outlook
**Outlook**

All yuan-ti—even the servitors—are arrogant, convinced that their race is superior to all others. They believe it is only a matter of time before their machinations allow them to take over the nations of Faerûn from within. While they are not averse to open battle and actually excel at it, they realize that they are greatly outnumbered by their chosen foes, and prefer to use more subtle means to weaken their enemies from within.

From the moment they are hatched, young yuan-ti are led to believe that the world once belonged to their ancestors, the saurians. As such, it rightly belongs to them, and it is only a matter of time before they recover it. This justifies any kind of evil they may do to the peoples of Faerûn. After all, they are not proposing to take over someone else’s country. They simply want back what is rightfully theirs, and they are prepared to go to any lengths to get it.

The yuan-ti spend a great deal of time hiding in the wild, hunting for their food while they wait for their tainted ones to bring them the information they need to be able to plan an attack. For this reason, they often end up as rangers. However, they are devout worshipers of Sseth, the yuan-ti god, so there are a number of clerics within their ranks too.

Most yuan-ti become adventurers because they want to increase their own standing within their communities. Tainted ones, in particular, are often found far from any yuan-ti home, since it is their task to infiltrate humanoid society in preparation for the next attack.

## Yuan-ti Characters
**YUAN-TI CHARACTERS**

The favored class of pureblood yuan-ti is [[Ranger|ranger]]. The favored class of servitor yuan-ti is determined by his or her base race.

### Typical Physical Characteristics
**Typical Physical Characteristics**

The yuan-ti come in several distinct castes or breeds. The three most prevalent, described in the Third Edition Monster Manual, are as follows:

- Purebloods appear mostly human, with minor reptilian features, such as slitted eyes, a forked tongue, or patches of scales on their skin. They serve as diplomats and infiltrators, pretending to be human.
- Halfbloods are humanoid in shape but have a wide variety of noticeable serpentine features, such as a snakelike tail in place of legs, a complete covering of scales, a hood like a cobra, a snake's head, or snakes in place of arms. Halfbloods serve as warriors and temple assistants.
- Abominations are almost completely snakelike, with only a few human features, such as arms or a humanoid head. A quarter of the yuan-ti abominations are the Shan-Pachan, with human heads and serpent bodies, who act as high priests. Other abominations include the Ma-Yin, who are snakelike with human arms, and the Ma-Zhi, who are fully serpentlike.

In addition to the three main breeds, other breeds have been described as well:

- Tainted ones are human agents of the yuan-ti who have willingly undergone a ritual of transformation to make themselves yuan-ti, gaining a venomous bite and slight psionic ability. They retain their human appearance but often develop reptilian mannerisms, such as frequently licking their lips or drawing out sibilant sounds as they speak. They first appeared in Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faerûn.
- Broodguards, also known as histachii, are humans who have undergone the ritual of transformation but have been found unworthy, degenerating into hairless, near-mindless reptilian monsters. The yuan-ti employ these wretches as watchers over egg-broods and other demeaning tasks. They first appeared as the histachii in Dragon Magazine #151 ("The Ecology of the Yuan-ti" by David Wellham, 1989).
- The Forgotten, or Yin-Shu, are humans, half-orcs, or half-elves who have yuan-ti blood in their veins due to ancient, unsuccessful experiments. Purebloods can sense them instinctively from up to 100 feet away. Yuan-ti attempt to convince them to willingly embrace their inhuman heritage, transforming them into halfbloods or purebloods using the Black Broth or other foul potions.
- Holy guardians are a rare breed specifically bred as temple guards; they are also sent on missions to obtain needed goods for abomination priests. Holy guardians are naturally servile and follow their superiors without question. They uniformly have a serpentine tail in place of legs and a snakelike head. They first appeared in Serpent Kingdoms.
- Mageslayers, another rare type of yuan-ti, are bred for the special purpose of battling or hunting down human magic-users, and most of their abilities are magical rather than psionic. Mageslayers have a human-like head but a snake-like tail instead of legs. They first appeared in Serpent Kingdoms.
- Anathemas are by far the most powerful and loathsome of yuan-ti, worshiped as divine incarnations of Merrshaulk. They are truly bizarre in appearance, with a body like a 25-foot-long serpent; a pair of humanoid arms with clawed, three-fingered hands; and six serpentine heads rising from its shoulders. An anathema's power dwarfs even that of an abomination, but since they represent such unfettered chaos, they are usually found away from yuan-ti cities, establishing cults that worship Merrshaulk through them. They make a common practice of grafting yuan-ti body parts onto humans and other races for use as personal servants. Anathemas are extremely rare, however, and only a handful are likely to exist on any world. They first appeared in the Third Edition version of the Fiend Folio.
- Ignans are another rare subspecies of yuan-ti that dwell in hotter climes of the world, including in volcanoes and on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Ignans are similar to yuan-ti halfbloods, except they are slightly more powerful due to some of the fire spells they wield. Ignans were first described in Monster Manual IV.

### Alignment
### **Alignment**
Yuan-ti are usually both chaotic and evil, though their caste system is fairly rigid and they cooperate well in their schemes. They are no strangers to long-term planning, either, but this only means their superior intelligence allows them to embrace chaos as an ultimate goal and ferment chaos as a means to an end, without falling victim to the weaknesses of disorder. They feel no particular kinship with other chaotic or evil beings, and will be happy to see them destroyed along with everyone else.

### Yuan-ti Drugs
**Yuan-ti Drugs**

Humans can be transformed into yuan-ti using a preparation known as the Black Broth, which includes distilled ophidian venom and other ingredients consecrated to the yuan-ti deity. This can only be completed about every 1,000 years, when the stars and planets signify a conjunction between the Prime Material Plane and the 111th layer of the Abyss.

Yuan-ti also create a highly addictive drug called white resin, made from rare herbs and yuan-ti venom. They introduce it into humanoid populations, using the drug to manipulate them. They also use them to control their slaves, but they're reluctant to do this too much, as extended use of white resin can drive humanoids mad, giving them reptilian features that obligate the yuan-ti to care for them after they become too mentally ill to work, due to their reverence of reptilian beings.

Osssra is an oil that, when burned, confers benefits on yuan-ti but acts as a poison to other races. Its smoke is strangely multi-colored. Osssra is described in detail in Serpent Kingdoms, and various "antidotes" to osssra, known as ophiotoxins, were described in Dragon #355.

## Yuan-Ti Society
**Yuan-Ti Society**

The yuan-ti, despite their love of chaos, have a fairly rigid caste system with slaves at the bottom, with purebloods as ambassadors, builders, artisans, and spies, halfbloods as guardians, warriors, and enforcers, and abominations as the mystics, philosophers, generals, judges, and leaders of a yuan-ti nest.

Yuan-ti society slightly favors males, as only males may be high priests. However, they are too intelligent to not utilize their females' talents, and in non-priestly or reproductive roles females are permitted to do everything that males are. Female purebloods are particularly useful as seductresses in the human world.

The yuan-ti tend to build their communities in or beneath ancient ruins. The leaders of the community—the priests of the temple—like to reinforce the connection to their ancient heritage in this way. Other times, the yuan-ti occupy caverns, sewers, or catacombs beneath human cities. This positions them closer to the societies that they wish to conquer, and it improves communication with their tainted ones. It also exposes them to greater risk should their presence be discovered, but this is a risk many yuan-ti leaders are willing to shoulder.

Abominations, the most powerful and least humanoid of the race, rule over the yuan-ti. The ruler of the community is always an abomination, often one with a human head. Halfbloods are considered the next most important because they exhibit more snakelike qualities than the purebloods. Halfbloods are captains and elite guards. The tainted ones come below the purebloods, and the broodguards come last of all. Tainted ones sometimes serve in yuan-ti communities, but they are more often sent into nearby towns and cities as agents. Broodguards get their name from their function in the yuan-ti society. They guard the yuanti brood chambers, in which the yuan-ti females lay and then hatch their eggs. Broodguards also look after the young, making sure they don’t wander off unexpectedly.

Yuan-ti young are trained from a very early age in the use of their special abilities. The most important of these is the ability to change shape into a viper. When young yuan-ti are threatened, they invariably turn into Tiny vipers and slither away through cracks or holes in walls, escaping by going places where their attackers cannot follow. Elderly yuan-ti are respected for their wisdom, the result of long years of experience. Unlike many other evil societies, yuan-ti very rarely turn on an aging leader, instead allowing the elder to pass his final days in somnolence and quiet. When yuan-ti leave their homes, they usually arrange themselves into war, hunting, or spy parties, depending on their need. Purebloods and tainted ones often work alone or in small groups. They sometimes form yuan-ti cells in humanoid cities, meeting in secret to discuss their findings and argue about how to best advance their racial agenda.

## Religion
**Religion**

The temples of Sseth (a yuan-ti aspect of Set) are the center of yuan-ti life. Each yuan-ti community has one, and bloody services involving human sacrifice are held regularly.

In Dwellers of the Forbidden City, the yuan-ti are described as "devout demon worshippers," and their god is depicted as a cobra-headed man (page 6). In Dragon #151, the (Oriental) yuan-ti described there are made to worship a demon lord called Sch'theraqpasstt, who resembles a great, black-scaled winged snake. The article goes on to say that the yuan-ti have turned to other creatures of the Abyss for power since Sch'theraqpasstt's decline. In Treasures of Greyhawk, the Amedio Jungle yuan-ti seem to worship a deity they call Sarthis, vaguely resembling a human with undefined reptilian features. Monster Mythology introduced Merrshaulk, who is described as a vast serpent with a human head and stubby forearms, as the yuan-ti patron. Like Sch'theraqpasstt, Merrshaulk is a deity in decline, albeit for different reasons, and both entities are said to live in the Abyss. Sch'theraqpasstt is said to have gone mad while attempting to merge with his Abyssal layer, while Merrshaulk is slowly falling into eternal sleep.

In The Scarlet Brotherhood, the yuan-ti civilizations described in in that book were all made worshippers of the Olman deity Tlaloc, a reptilian-headed god of rain.

The yuan-ti of Scuttlecove detailed in Dungeon #95 are cultists of Demogorgon.

In addition, there is a sub-faction of the yuan-ti, the Vanguard of Sertrous (outlined in Elder Evils), who follow the teachings of the ancient obyrith Sertrous, sometimes known as the first heretic. The Vanguard wish to assist Sertrous in reconquering his layer of the Abyss.

The yuan-ti venerate reptiles in general and consider it taboo to slay them. However, they will not take foolish risks to preserve reptilian life.

## Language and Literacy
**Language and Literacy**

True yuan-ti speak Common, Yuan-Ti, and the human language of their home region. This affords them a broad range of peoples with whom they can converse. They often learn Abyssal and Draconic as well.

Tlaman is the language of the yuan-ti of Hepmonaland. It is largely derived from Olman with phrases from Touv and the languages of snakes, altered to be best pronounced with forked tongues. It uses essentially the same pictographs as Olman, and an Olman speaker can understand approximately two-thirds of Tlaman.

Servitor yuan-ti speak the languages they knew before becoming a servitor.

They usually pick up Yuan-Ti as well within a few months of joining the yuan-ti’s service.

All pureblood yuan-ti are literate, except for barbarians.

All tainted ones are literate, except for barbarians and commoners.

## Associated creatures
**Associated creatures**

There are several reptilian creatures closely associated with the yuan-ti that are not yuan-ti themselves:

- Ti-khana are reptiles, such as snakes, lizards, and dinosaurs, that have been altered by the yuan-ti. Ti-khana are far more intelligent than the creatures from which they are created, and possess both the psionic abilities and cruel disposition of their yuan-ti creators. They appear more snakelike than their mundane ancestors, appearing somewhat elongated, with venomous fangs. The ti-khana first appeared in the Third Edition version of the Fiend Folio, with a ti-khana deinonychus showcased as an example. Ti-khana elasmosaurs are also mentioned fleetingly in Serpent Kingdoms.
- Ophidians are an unrelated race of serpent-people who are nonetheless commonly associated with the yuan-ti. Ophidians are not very intelligent, and are easily impressed by shows of power by yuan-ti, evil nagas, and dragons, whom they frequently serve as willing slaves. Their most potent weapon is their venom, which can change humans into degenerate ophidians. Most ophidians worship their yuan-ti masters as gods.
- Ssvaklors are a type of serpentine dragon created by yuan-ti using special rituals on a dragon egg, typically that of a black dragon. Ssvaklors are less intelligent than even humans and, like true dragons (a group of which they are not a part), have a breath weapon: a cone of poisonous gas. They are typically green and black in colour. Greater ssvaklors also exist, though they are simply a more powerful version of the "standard" ssvaklor with the ability to spit globs of poison to their foes. Like yuan-ti, ssvaklors' serpentine nature makes them natural swimmers. They are normally met in the company of yuan-ti and are often used as guardians by them. Ssvaklors first appeared in the Monster Manual III.

## Abilities and Racial Features
**Abilities and Racial Features** 

Purebloods and tainted ones have different racial features, as described below. Abominations, half-bloods, and broodguards are not suitable as player character races and so are not described here.

### Pureblood yuan-ti
**Pureblood** yuan-ti have the following racial traits:

- +2 Dexterity, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +4 Charisma. Purebloods are fast as a striking cobra, sharp as a serpent’s tooth, and have the magnetism of a snake charmer.
- Pureblood yuan-ti land speed is 30 feet.
- Darkvision up to 60 feet.
- +1 natural armor.
- Proficient with all simple weapons, scimitar, and longbow. Proficient with light armor and shields.
- Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A yuan-ti pureblood has 6d8 racial Hit Dice. A pureblood character receives the maximum hit points for her first monstrous humanoid Hit Die and rolls her other monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally. She rolls all Hit Dice from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit points on her first class-level Hit Die. A pureblood’s racial Hit Dice also provide a +6 base attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +2, Ref +5, and Will +5. Purebloods with class levels add their class attack bonus and save bonuses to their racial attack bonus and saves.
- Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A pureblood’s monstrous humanoid Hit Dice grant her skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier) ×9. Class skills for these skill points are Concentration, Craft, Knowledge, Disguise, Hide, Listen, and Spot. A pureblood does not get the ×4 multiplier for skill points acquired from her first class level.
- Monstrous Humanoid Feats: Yuan-ti gain Alertness and Blind-Fight as bonus feats. In addition, a pureblood’s monstrous humanoid Hit Dice grant her 3 feats. A typical pureblood chooses Dodge, Expertise, and Improved Initiative. A pureblood with class levels gains feats based on her total Hit Dice, as shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.
- Spell resistance 16 + class level.
- Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—*animal trance*, *cause fear*, *deeper darkness*, *entangle*, *neutralize poison*, *suggestion*, and *baleful polymorph*. Treat these as if cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save DC 10 + Cha modifier + spell level).
- Psionics (Sp): The yuan-ti can produce the following effects at will:

*                 Detect Poison*: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.

*                 Alternate Form*: The yuan-ti can assume the form of a Tiny to Large viper. This is like a *polymorph* spell cast by an 8th-level sorcerer, 

*                     * but the yuan-ti does not regain hit points for changing forms, and she can only assume viper forms.

*                 Chameleon Power*: The yuan-ti can change her coloration to match that of her surroundings. This grants her a +8 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

*                 Produce Acid*: The yuan-ti can exude acid. This deals 1d6 points of damage to anything she touches. The acid is inert once it leaves the yuan-ti’s body.

*                 Aversion*: The yuan-ti can target one person within 30 feet and create a compulsion effect in him. The subject must succeed at a Will save (DC 17)

*                     * or gain an aversion to snakes for 10 minutes. A victim must stay at least 20 feet away from any snake or yuan-ti—living or dead—or move until 

*                     * he is at least 20 feet away. The victim can overcome the aversion with another Will save (DC 17), but even if he succeeds, he still suffers a 

   *                  * deep anxiety that causes a –4 reduction to Dexterity while he is within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti. This lasts until the effect wears off (up to 10 minutes).

*                     * Otherwise, this is similar to an *antipathy* spell cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

- Automatic Languages: Common, Yuan-Ti, home region. Bonus Languages: By region, plus Abyssal and Draconic.
- Favored Class: Ranger.
- Level Adjustment: +5. Due to her 6 racial Hit Dice plus her many powers and bonuses, a pureblood yuan-ti has an effective character level of 11 plus her class levels. Thus, a 9th-level pureblood sorcerer would have an ECL of 20. See Table 1 in the Introduction for more information.

### Tainted ones
**Tainted ones** have the following racial traits in addition to the traits of the base creature:

- +2 Constitution. Surviving the transformation makes the tainted one stronger.
- Poison Bite: A tainted one gains a venomous bite, although he does not gain a natural attack with which to deliver it. In order to use his poison, he must make a successful grapple check against a foe, and then make a successful melee attack. Fort save (DC 10 + the tainted one’s Con modifier) negates, initial and secondary damage 1d4 temporary Constitution. The poison can also be injected against an unresisting foe with a kiss.
- Poison Immunity: Immune to all forms of snake venom, including his own.
- Spell resistance 12 +1 per two levels.
- Psionics (Sp): The tainted one can produce the following effects labeled in italics. Treat these as if cast by a sorcerer of the tainted one’s level.

*                 Poison* 1/day: Fort save (DC 13 + the tainted one’s Con modifier). 

*                 Polymorph* 3/day: Into viper forms only.

- Feats: The tainted one gains Alertness as a bonus feat.
- Automatic Languages: As base race. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Yuan-Ti.
- Favored Class: By base creature.
- Level Adjustment: +2. Tainted ones are more powerful and gain levels more slowly than the common races of Faerûn. Their many powers and bonuses comprise this level adjustment. 

A player may play a tainted one yuan-ti with class levels as a character with total levels equal to his class levels +2. See Table 1 in the Introduction for more information.

## Yuan-Ti Magic and Lore
**Yuan-Ti Magic and Lore**

The yuan-ti have no new spells special to their race. Yuan-ti wizards and sorcerers choose spells from the Illusion and Transmutation schools of magic, as these sorts of magics aid them in their deceptions.

## Yuan-Ti Deities
**Yuan-Ti Deities** 

Yuan-ti worship Sseth, a serpentine deity conquered and consumed by Set, who now grants spells in Sseth’s name. To them, there are no other gods worth consideration. According to yuanti myth, Sseth helped create their race and has been directing them ever since. Given the devoutness of the yuan-ti, it’s clear that Sseth has a strong effect on every aspect of their lives.

## Relations with Other Races
**Relations with Other Races**

Yuan-ti don’t care for any of the other races. However, they have a special relationship with humans, since they are one of the races from which yuan-ti are descended. Yuan-ti wish to conquer, enslave, or assimilate (via their servitor draught) as many humans as possible. In return, humans loathe and fear the yuan-ti.

## Yuan-Ti Equipment
**Yuan-Ti Equipment**

The yuan-ti have no weapons or equipment special to their race. However, they insist on using only tools of masterwork quality. They favor scimitars and bows, and employ poisons of all sorts.

## Animals and Pets
**ANIMALS AND PETS**

Yuan-ti have a strong affinity for snakes of all types, especially venomous snakes. Many snakes kept by yuan-ti acquire the fiendish template and grow to frightening proportions, becoming creatures of supernatural evil and cunning. They protect yuan-ti lairs, serve as sacred animals for receiving sacrifices to Sseth, and provide companionship.

## Creative Origins
**Creative Origins**

The yuan-ti were created by David Cook in Dwellers of the Forbidden City.

## Publishing History
**Publishing History**

The yuan-ti were reprinted in the 1st edition Monster Manual II and appeared in 2nd edition in Volume One of the Monstrous Compendium series. The histachii, later called the broodguard, was introduced in Dragon #151 and reprinted in the Kara-Tur Monstrous Compendium Appendix, and as the broodguard in Monsters of Faerûn.
