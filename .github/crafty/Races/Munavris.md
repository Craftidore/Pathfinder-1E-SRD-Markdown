# Munavris
## Overview
Munavris are a shining example of how the forces

of good can thrive, even in the darkest regions

of the world. The descendants of humans

devastated by Earthfall, munavris dwell amid jade cities in

the deepest oceans of the Darklands. The great calamity

forced the munavris’ ancestors underground, where they

struggled against horrors such as the mind-bending

aboleths and the terror-inspiring urdefhans. It was during

the trying times of these first skirmishes that munavris

developed the ability to wordlessly communicate

among themselves. Soon they uncovered other mental

advancements, such as the power to instantly understand

the use of almost any device. Standing by the munavris

since their arrival in the Darklands, the empyreal lords

back them in their ongoing conflicts, defiantly reinforcing

their bulwark against those underground realms’ more

depraved denizens.

The munavris’ ancestors were once the seafarers of

a great surface empire, and munavris maintain their

connection to navigating the open ocean to this day. They

operate in the Darklands on violet-sailed ships, carved

entirely out of ivory, plying the waters of the Sightless Sea

as explorers and defenders of their island cities. Munavris’

pervasive wanderlust brings them into continued conflict

with other species, particularly urdefhans—whose

genocidal lust to destroy the Darklands’ entire human

population makes them the bitterest of rivals.

Ecology

Munavris are the offspring of the ancient humans who

plied the waters around the now-destroyed continent of

Azlant. Many of Azlant’s myriad naval and civilian ships

were caught on the open sea as the sky rained fire. Of

the thousands of ships on the water during Earthfall,

only a few hundred survived the bombardment from the

heavens, the tidal waves, and the violent thunderstorms

that followed. The aboleths, ever eager to push the limits

of what humanity could accomplish, even in the wake of

their orchestrated destruction, used powerful magic to

transfer the Azlanti ships through the magical waterspout

that connects the floor of the Arcadian Ocean to the

underground ocean known as the Sightless Sea.

Finding themselves in the strange, lightless world of

the Darklands, the refugees banded together in a vast

armada of ships of all shapes and sizes, knowing it was

their only hope of survival against the countless terrors

that confronted them. Over time, they found uninhabited

islands, which they settled in an effort to reestablish their

great civilization, leaving behind the ruins of their distinct

architecture, which stills stands to this day. The refugees’

plan was successful, and through tenacity and dedication,

they managed to avoid devolving into degenerate species

as the morlocks and mongrelfolk did, and eschewed the

dark bargains for safety held out by the dark folk, drow,

and duergar.

At first, the refugees flourished, believing themselves

the most fortunate of their devastated culture. The

aboleths, once again angered at the humans’ resilience,

took note of their ancient enemy’s survival and unleashed their full might against the remaining Azlanti cities.

As the aboleths’ ulat-kini legions overran their last

stronghold, the Azlanti of the Sightless Sea fled into the

murky corners of the Darklands.

Eventually, the humans found shelter on islands of

jade, some mysterious quality of which repelled the

tireless pursuit of the aboleths. Here they discarded

their Azlanti titles, surviving in tight-knit communities.

The munavris found themselves bereft of most of the

gods of their old pantheon, who had either died during

Earthfall or retreated beyond the reach of mortal

prayers. In response, many among them reached out

to Empyreal Lords for help. The celestial demigods

answered by protecting the munavris’ burgeoning

settlements, showing them means of building ships and

structures in the absence of trees.

Munavris have changed over the centuries, their hair

and skin having paled to a bone white. Their natural

humanoid grace, however, has only been improved

by their time sailing the waters of the Darklands, and

many walk with a subtle dancelike sway as a result.

Their continued exposure to the Darklands’ strange

radiations, the assaults of aboleths, and the psychically

resonant nature of their jade island homes, imparted

munavris with their own psychic aptitude—first, as

strong empathy, and later, telepathic communication

with their own kind. Munavris rarely have reason to

speak aloud, only doing so when treating with members

of other races. A munavri’s telepathic voice is the best

reflection of her personality, with subtle inflections

and a wide range of tones, while her physical voice is a

monotonous contralto sound.

Munavris share most of the same needs as their human

ancestors, from similar dietary requirements to means

of procreation. Sex is a casual

affair among munavris, their

history as refugees encouraging

reproduction to bolster their numbers

and removing any stigma from

open sexual relationships. They

form long-term relationships,

often selecting one or

more partners from

childhood. Many such

relationships are not exclusive, and a single munavri

may share multiple life partners, both female and

male. Children birthed in such groups have multiple

fathers and mothers, and blood relations are seen as

less important than bonds of affection. The munavris’

mental communion encourages these unique familial

units, as individuals often find it difficult to sequester

themselves from other members of the community,

effectively making all munavris of a given group as

close as the family members of other species. This

intimacy makes munavris prone to fits of passion when

their extended families are threatened. Jealousy is the

greatest threat to the ongoing prosperity of a family

unit, particularly when one munavri shares multiple

families and the members of these respective families

find themselves at odds over an issue.

Munavris’ time underground makes them susceptible

to bright lights, and most munavris prefer a soft, ambient

glow if they need any light at all. An overall increase in

nimbleness, longevity, and mental faculties compensates

for their relatively delicate frames. Munavris live longer

than their human predecessors, and their life cycles

are similar to those of half-elves. Death is viewed as a

release of one’s spirit, and funerals consist of rejoicing

the deceased’s accomplishments in life.

The most unique ability possessed by munavris is their

instinctual power to “read,” or intuitively understand,

any objects they hold or wear. Thought to be another

form of latent psychic power, this object-reading power

allows munavris to use magical arms and armor without

the need for standard magical identification. With this

ability, munavris can also quickly discern the use of

scrolls and wands possessed by their more magically

inclined enemies; they often pilfer such equipment

during combat in order to deprive their foes of its benefits

or even potentially turn it against their foes. A munavri’s

most sacred duty is to use his object-reading powers on

the corpse of a fallen brother or sister. In doing

this, the munavri often absorbs one or

more of the deceased’s most cherished

memories—an intangible gift of

untold value to the familial

unit and to the friends of

the departed munavri.

Society

Munavris developed a strong sense of communal

attachment after the fall of the last Azlanti city, when

they came to reply upon one another for survival. Living

on their islands of pure jade among the lightless waters

of the Sightless Sea, the munavris have formed diverse

communities with their own societal characteristics. Each

island possesses a unique coloration of jade, assisting in

the munavris’ societal distinction. The largest munavri

settlements lie on Beryl Isle—one of the few jade islands

to house multiple settlements. The vast number of

munavri sailors patrolling the Sightless Sea bear Beryl

Island’s trademark green jade armor.

The different population groups of munavri

settlements refer to themselves as kinships. Numerous

family units make up the fabric of these kinships. The

protector marshal, charged with ensuring the settlement’s

safety, holds the highest rank in a kinship, and her

role places her above even the most important familial

connections. Three spiritual leaders guide the munavris

of a settlement: the agathum, archum, and azatum. These

holy leaders represent the empyreal lords worshiped by

munavris. While the azatum often holds the majority of

influence in the community, the agathum and archum

are tasked with creating balanced views and providing

counsel for the protector marshal. Admirals lead munavri

families, with captains commanding individual sailing

vessels or squads.

The munavris’ crenelated settlements, known as

conurbations, range in size from small to large cities, and

provide shelter to thousands. Violence rarely occurs in

the conurbations; arguments are handled by escalating

concerns up the hierarchy for resolution. In cases where

discourse cannot settle a matter, nonlethal duels of honor

are enacted. Munavris treat the few outsiders allowed

to visit conurbations akin to royalty. They relish the

opportunity to talk with those outside of their kinships

and the telepathic communion shared by every member

of their species. Munavris have little social tact or sense

of personal boundaries when describing their lives to

outsiders, and they tend to overwhelm victims with their

most treasured personal thoughts.

Beyond the walls of their cities, munavris sail the

Darklands seas in violet-sailed ships of ivory. The bones

and teeth of large sea creatures compose the majority

of munavri sailing ships hulls’. From a young age, each

munavri is expected to craft a skiff, which is then used

to learn the art of sailing. Not all munavris employ their

naval skills beyond childhood, and some (particularly

craftsfolk or priests) remain within the confines of the

conurbation for most of their lives. Skilled artisans craft

the immense sailing vessels used to patrol the munavris’

territorial waters, working with the priests of empyreal

lords and resident psychics to imbue these ships with

powerful magic.

Campaign Role

Munavris fill a unique role in the Darklands as one of

the few good-aligned forces with any major presence

there. Since they’re located in the deepest regions of

Orv, it’s unlikely the PCs will come across them early

in their adventuring careers. Munavris aren’t widely

known beyond the depths of Orv, meaning the PCs’ first

encounter with them will likely be as shocking to them

as it is to the munavris. The encounter may very likely

end up turning into a combat; munavris are naturally

distrustful of outsiders after centuries of illusory attempts

at subversion by their aboleth rivals. But munavris can become strong and lifelong allies if a peaceful accord

can be arranged. Such an alliance is invaluable in the

Darklands, where supplies and allies are scarce.

Munavri settlements are bastions of freedom in the

Darklands. They are literal islands of safety amid the

threats of surrounding territories, but for guests seeking

extended rests, these settlements may not be ideal.

Their hosts’ understanding of personal space is limited,

and even simple transactions can turn into prolonged

conversations. Munavris explain odd personal problems

and share deeply private information to their guests

without understanding normal social cues to end such

conversations. Visitors to munavri settlements can expect

normal activities to take two to three times the normal

amount of time, simply because of the additional hurdles

of social encounters.

Treasure

Munavris’ most iconic treasures are items crafted from

the jade of their island homes. The islands regenerate in

places where pieces have been broken off, allowing their

settlers to harvest components for use as equipment.

Expert stoneshapers craft the various jade arms and

armor utilized by the munavri kinships. All but the

most inexperienced munavri sailors possess masterwork

quality equipment, while squad leaders, captains, and

higher-ranked munavris bear magical arms and armor.

Munavris’ craft extends well beyond the art of

stoneshaping, and calligraphy is a favored vocation.

Because they can instinctively understand the use of all

magical scrolls, the production of such magical devices is

abundant in munavri society. They also seek out wands,

particularly those with healing properties, and churches

of the empyreal lords located among the conurbations

often craft them in bulk, distributing them to munavri

forces to use in protecting the settlement.

Five Facts about Munavris

Players and Game Masters may wish to keep the

following facts in mind when encountering or playing

munavri characters.

• Munavris are the most numerous good-aligned

force in the Darklands region of Orv. They sail

the Sightless Sea in violet-sailed ships of ivory,

seeking out enemies and protecting their floating

jade island-cities. Aboleths and urdefhans rank as

munavris’ greatest enemies, and both malevolent

species engage in ceaseless attempts to torment or

wipe out the alabaster-skinned humanoids.

• Munavris possess psychic abilities, and all members

of the race can telepathically communicate

with others of their species. This easy method

of communication renders munavris somewhat

ignorant of how other species communicate.

Though munavris are socially graceful during

initial interactions with creatures whom they have

determined to be friendly, their ceaseless questions

can quickly come to grate on their guests.

• Simply by touching and examining an item,

a munavri can unlock the secrets of its true

potential. Both scrolls and wands are particularly

useful to munavris, who can use either item

regardless of their training. In fact, many

martial munavris possess scrolls and wands

that specifically complement their spellcasting

deficiencies. Munavris are prone to thievery in the

midst of combat, using their quick reading powers

to actively take an enemy’s equipment and use it

against him.

• The empyreal lords are the primary deities among

munavris, and have been so since the earliest days

of the munavris’ history. Most munavris venerate

azatas, while less free-spirited munavris foster

stronger connections to archon and agathion

lords, though such followers are a minority among

munavri priests.

• Beset on all sides by the depredations of the

aboleths, urdefhans, and other terrors of the

Darklands, munavris find solace on their island

homes. The origins and history of these strange

islands are mysterious even to the munavris, but

these colorful isles are actually weapons once

used in an ancient conflict between the baleful

aboleths and some forgotten force.

Munavri Characters

A munavri is defined by her class levels—she doesn’t

have racial Hit Dice. Despite having no racial Hit Dice, a

munavri is a powerful creature and her CR is 1 higher

than that of a human of the same level. A munavri has

the following racial traits.

**–2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution,**

**+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma**: Descended

from ancient humans who were forever changed by the

harsh lands in the depths of the earth, munavris have

exceptional abilities.

**Medium**: Munavris are Medium creatures and have

no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed**: Munavris have a base speed of

30 feet.

**Senses**: Munavris have darkvision 120 feet.

**Telepathy (Su)**: A munavri is able to mentally

communicate with other munavri within 60 feet.

**Advanced Object Reading**: A munavri can instantly

understand and learn how to use almost any device,

even if she’s never seen it before. She can cast *object*

*reading*OA at will, divining secrets of an object’s history

and its use. Once per day, she can select one weapon,

suit of armor, or spell-trigger item on which she has

cast *object reading*. For a number of minutes equal to

her level, she is considered proficient with that item,

or can make use of the spell-trigger device as if she

were a spellcaster of the appropriate class.

**Spell Resistance**: A munavri possesses spell

resistance equal to 8 + her total number of class levels.

**Light Blindness**: As deep underground dwellers,

munavris suffer from light blindness. Abrupt exposure

to any bright light blinds munavris for 1 round. On

subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they

remain in the affected area.

**Languages**: Munavris begin play speaking Munavri.

Munavris with high Intelligence scores can choose from

the following: Aklo, Aboleth, Aquan, Dark Folk, Draconic,

Terran, and Undercommon.
