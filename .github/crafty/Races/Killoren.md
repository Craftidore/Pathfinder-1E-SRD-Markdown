# Killoren
## Overview
*“Hunter, destroyer, and keeper of ancient knowledge; I am nature’s*

*answer to the rising power of man.”*

*—Allailai, killoren ancient.*

A newly risen race of powerful fey, the killoren blend nature’s

patience and power with the ambition and aggression of the

humanoid races.

The ancient places of the world stir with a power of their

own. From this power, the killoren have sprung in answer

to the growing might of the humanoid races. Whether

the work of some great nature deity or the spontaneous

creation of the wild power of nature itself, killoren are at

once young and eternal, newly brought to the world but

with unknowably ancient ties to the heart of nature. As fey,

killoren have a tie to nature unmatched by the humanoid

races, but unlike other fey, killoren are not content to wait

in the dark recesses of the dwindling forests.

Killoren are aggressive, ambitious manifestations of

nature’s presence and power, and they walk through the

cities of man as easily as they meditate in the glades of a

verdant forest. There are as yet few killoren in the world

compared to the population of humans and other humanoid

races, but their numbers are quickly growing. So far, these

adaptable fey have only come into isolated conflict with evil

powers bent on despoiling nature, but it is obvious that they are destined for more. The killoren have begun to make

known their presence in the world, and a few far-seeing and

learned sages wonder at the implications of their growing

power and numbers.

KILLOREN RACIAL TRAITS

Killoren resemble half-elves, and males and females alike

average about 5-1/2 feet in height. They mature quickly, being

full-grown by the age of 10, and live very long lives, hardly

changing at all in appearance for their first century. Killoren

have green or tan skin the texture of a soft, young leaf, and

their limbs are unusually long and slender when compared

with those of the humanoid races. An individual killoren’s

hair and eye color depends on which aspect of nature the

killoren is currently manifesting.

• Fey: Killoren are of the fey type and are therefore not

affected by spells such as *charm person* and *hold person*.

Unlike other fey, killoren gain Hit Dice only by acquiring

levels in a character class.

• A killoren’s base land speed is 30 feet.

• Low-Light Vision: Killoren can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

• Immunity to magic sleep effects and a +2 racial bonus on

saves against enchantment spells or effects.

• Racial Skills: Killoren have a +2 racial bonus on Handle

Animal and Survival checks.

• Cold Iron Anathema (Su): Killoren have a difficult time

wielding weapons made of cold iron. Killoren take a –2 penalty

on any attack roll they make with a cold iron weapon

or a weapon made only partially out of cold iron, such as

a cold iron spear or a bow firing cold iron arrows.

• Manifest Nature’s Might (Su): Killoren are forever

bound to the raw forces of nature itself, manifesting this

bond even in their physical form. A killoren can only

manifest one aspect of nature’s might at a time. Each

morning as the sun rises, a killoren spends 10 minutes

in quiet meditation, filling her spirit with the aspect of

nature that is most needed for her current tasks. Once

a killoren chooses an aspect, she manifests that aspect

until the next morning, when she chooses again which

aspect to manifest. Many killoren favor one aspect over

the others and rarely choose to manifest one of the other

two aspects.

*Aspect of the Ancient:* While manifesting the aspect

of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient

secrets of nature itself. With this bond to nature’s secret

lore, a killoren gains a racial bonus on Knowledge (nature)

checks equal to her Hit Dice and gains an additional +2

bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects.

This bonus stacks with the killoren’s normal racial

bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the ancient,

her hair turns white and her eyes turn to the color of a

blue summer sky.

*Aspect of the Destroyer:* Many races revere nature for its

power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren manifesting

the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a

maximum number of times per day equal to the character’s

Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the

aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that

deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making

this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to

her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per

Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations,

constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a

killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the

creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the

ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the

total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of

the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black;

many find the gaze of a killoren destroyer’s coal-black eyes

to be unnerving.

*Aspect of the Hunter:* The hunt affects nearly every

aspect of nature and claims a place of great prominence

and importance in the cycle of life. A killoren manifesting

the aspect of the hunt is bound to nature’s ancient tradition

of the hunt, and her senses sharpen to an amazing degree.

While manifesting the aspect of the hunt, a killoren gains

a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and

Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her

hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone

becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of

the other aspects.

• Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan. Bonus Languages:

Aquan, Auran, Elven, Gnome, Ignan, Terran.

• Favored Class: Druid.

KILLOREN SOCIETY

The killoren have no organized kingdoms and only a few

scattered communities. They live comfortably in nearly

any climate, and their dwellings and communities blend

beautifully with the natural world around them. Few members

of humanoid races are knowledgeable enough about

nature to recognize where the wilds end and a killoren

community begins.

Lands: As yet, killoren claim no lands as their own. Killoren

concepts of property and land ownership differ greatly

from those of the humanoid races: They see the world as

belonging to nature itself. As stewards and manifestations

of nature, they might at some point deny others the right to

settle or despoil part of the wild, but their numbers are few

enough that this has not yet come to pass. In the small conflicts

that have cropped up between killoren and particular

groups of evil humanoids, the killoren have not claimed

ownership of the land, instead claiming only that they guard

the land from evil.

Settlements: Their small communities blend with the

natural world, but many killoren are drawn away from

their home community to mingle with the populations of the humanoid races. A killoren community might be as

simple as a few families dwelling among the boughs and

shade of a peaceful forest or as remote as a small group

of killoren following game across the frozen steppes of

the far north.

Power Groups: Killoren communities are usually

governed by a group of elder druids and wizards, but any

individual killoren might rise to leadership depending on

his or her personal exploits. These leaders act more as

councilors and protectors than as an organized form of

government, the small size of killoren communities keeping

their roles relatively simple compared to the politics of

the humanoid races.

As the number of killoren grows, so too does their difference

in outlook. A small group of elder killoren, some

having walked among the humanoid races for a hundred

years or more, believe they have seen enough of humans

and the allied civilized races. Calling themselves simply The

Wild, these powerful killoren have chosen to defend their

refuges with magical and physical force. Many of these

killoren are druids and wizards, and their radical outlook

is quickly drawing the attention of both other killoren and

the armies of the human kingdoms.

Beliefs: Most killoren revere the silent might of nature

itself, although some, particularly clerics, pay homage to the

god Obad-Hai. Killoren do not simply admire nature—they

are part of it. A killoren cannot look at a distant mountain

range without feeling its power and beauty stir her, nor can

a killoren walk through a forest glade without being moved

by the peace and strength of nature. Nature is more than a

distant ideal to the killoren; it is life itself.

Relations: Although tension grows between the killoren

and the humanoid kingdoms, for the most part killoren

remain a curiosity in the eyes of the humans and their

allies. Killoren walk freely within the cities of almost every

civilized race. Of all the humanoid races, the elves are closest

in outlook to the killoren, but even the elves remain curious

about the killoren’s recent origin and their ultimate role in

nature’s plan.

KILLOREN CHARACTERS

Killoren characters range from powerful and zealous

defenders of nature to inquisitive and insightful students

of humanoid cultures. The killoren’s ability to manifest

different aspects of nature’s power lets them fill multiple

roles in a party of adventurers, depending on the expected

encounters and adventures. Killoren NPCs hint at the

growing unrest of powerful natural forces, adding a

sense of mystery and danger to the wild places of the

campaign world.

Adventuring Killoren: Killoren adventure to learn

about the world. Unlike other fey, killoren are driven by

the nameless powers of nature to learn about the humanoid

races and customs. Killoren match the aggression and

ambition of humanoids, but they also maintain the eternal

connection to nature that all fey embody. As killoren grow

in power and number, they form ever-changing opinions

of humans and their allies, helping the causes that they

deem to be one with nature’s design and opposing those

who would despoil or destroy nature’s beauty. Experienced

killoren might adventure with a more defi nite purpose—

working to thwart the schemes of a particular religious

cult, protecting nature from wild orcs and goblinoids, or

hunting powerful outsiders that are beyond the reach of

nature’s other servants.

Character Development: Killoren characters are best

served by focusing on one aspect and ensuring that the

abilities they favor work well with the choices they make

concerning skills, feats, and class levels. Because of their

obvious connection with nature, many adventuring killoren

advance as rangers and druids. Perhaps more intriguing,

however, are those killoren who take levels in other classes

such as wizard or paladin, yet retain their unswerving connection

to the power of nature.

Character Names: Killoren have only one name, and

they choose this name themselves upon declaring their

own maturity, usually near the beginning of their tenth

year of life. Killoren names always have three syllables, the

last of which denotes their family in the same way that a

human’s family name shows his or her relation. Example

killoren names include Durmindin, Ennimbel, Kettenbar,

and Shallahai.

ROLEPLAYING A KILLOREN

With the power of nature forever bonded to their souls, killoren

characters have both the enigmatic outlook of the fey

and the inquisitive drive of the humanoid races. This unique

outlook, combined with the unusual ability to manifest

different aspects of nature’s own power, makes killoren a

challenge to roleplay. When roleplaying a killoren, you must

make the reverence of nature a subtle yet ever-present aspect

of your personality without overdoing it, and you must be

ready to express markedly different aspects of your character’s

personality depending on which aspect of nature you choose

to manifest each day.

Personality: Killoren have an innate connection to

nature’s power; as such, the natural world and its best interests

are never far from their thoughts. Killoren also differ

from other races in that they have three different aspects

of their personality that correspond with their ability to

manifest different aspects of nature’s might. Killoren who

manifest the destroyer aspect are arrogant and aggressive,

those who manifest the aspect of the hunter are stealthy and

subtle, and those who manifest the aspect of the ancient

think carefully and look deep into the heart of a matter

before voicing their thoughts.

*Roleplaying Application:* Make the most of the different

aspects of nature that you manifest by accentuating

the changes in your character’s personality with each

change. Don’t overdo it—this ability is not a case of

three separate personalities. Rather, it’s an opportunity

to build multiple aspects of one character. The best way to do this is to make a short list of common sayings or

expression your character uses and then change the tone

and delivery depending on the aspect that your character

is manifesting.

Behaviors: Just as their personality changes slightly when

they manifest a different aspect, the behaviors of individual

killoren change slightly depending on the aspect that they

are manifesting.

*Roleplaying Application:* The best way to reinforce

the differences between the aspects of nature

that your character manifests is with body

language. Sit forward in your chair and speak

a little bit louder when manifesting the aspect

of the destroyer; sit back and think before

speaking when manifesting the aspect of the

ancient; and make quick, darting movements

when manifesting the aspect of the hunter.

Develop one or two obvious idiosyncrasies that

only surface when your character is manifesting

a specific aspect.

Language: Killoren make a great effort to

speak as those around them speak. Learning

the speaking styles as well as the language

of the humanoids they are with gives them

greater insight into the culture and attitudes

of their friends.

*Roleplaying Application:* Make it a point to pick

up on the sayings and speaking rhythms of those

you are with. This includes notable NPCs as well as

your fellow player characters. Don’t go so far as to mimic

anyone; that is not the killoren way. Rather, pay attention

to the way others speak as well as what they say and try to

slip a few sayings of theirs into your own dialogue.

KILLOREN ENCOUNTERS

Killoren are enigmatic fey, and as such they serve a campaign

better as occasional neutral parties rather than direct

antagonists. Hinting that the inquisitive and ambitious fey

are growing in number and power will serve to build tension

normally absent from encounters with fey creatures.

EL 4: Two killoren travelers. Although killoren usually

travel alone, a pair of killoren travelers might investigate a

large community or track a party of adventurers (perhaps

the player characters) to learn of their activities.

Killoren Traveler: Killoren ranger 1/rogue 1; CR 2;

Medium fey; HD 1d8+1 plus 1d6+1; hp 13; Init +2; Spd 30

ft.; AC 15, touch 12, fl at-footed 13; Base Atk +1; Grp +3; Atk

or Full Atk +4 melee (1d8+2/19–20, masterwork longsword)

or +4 ranged (1d8+2/×3, masterwork composite longbow);

SA sneak attack +1d6; SQ favored enemy humans +2, lowlight

vision, manifest nature’s might (aspect of the hunter),

trapfi nding, wild empathy +0 (–4 magical beasts); AL N; SV

Fort +3, Ref +6, Will +0; Str 14, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 12, Wis

10, Cha 8.

*Skills and Feats:* Handle Animal +5, Hide +7, Knowledge

(nature) +5, Listen +5, Move Silently +7, Spot +5, Search +6,

Survival +6 (+8 following tracks); Point Blank Shot, Track.

*Languages:* Common, Elven, Sylvan.

Favored Enemy (Ex): This killoren traveler has selected

humans as a favored enemy. She gains a +2 bonus on her

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against humans. She gets the same bonus

on weapon damage rolls against humans.

Manifest Nature’s Might (Su): This killoren traveler

is manifesting the aspect of the hunter, which increases

her skill modifiers as follows: Hide +9, Listen +7, Move

Silently +9, and Spot +7. It also increases her initiative

bonus to +4.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This killoren traveler deals an extra

1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against fl atfooted

or fl anked targets, or against a target that has been

denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. The killoren

traveler may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for

that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): This killoren traveler can find, disarm,

or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the

Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it).

If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or

more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering

or disarming it.

*Possessions:* Masterwork studded leather armor, masterwork

longsword, masterwork composite longbow (+2 Str bonus),

*elixir of hiding, elixir of sneaking, potion of aid, potion of cure light*

*wounds, potion of pass without trace,* 10 gp.

KILLOREN ADVENTURES

Adventures featuring the killoren are likely to center on

natural themes, particularly nature’s response to civilization.

Just as killoren give players a chance to reach for an alien

mind-set and a unique roleplaying experience, they offer

DMs a chance to show the characters that there are more than

two sides to many conflicts. Despite the multitude of good

forces in the world, few are entirely on the side of nature;

the killoren are the fey that nature can count on to fight for

it should the need arise.

• A killoren traveler has been asking pointed questions

about a town’s recent growth. As farmers stretch their

fields ever closer to an ancient forest, many in the town

are wondering if there will be some sort of conflict with

the denizens of the forest. In truth, the killoren is new

to the area and seeks only to protect the town from a

young green dragon that has been hunting the forest’s

edges recently. Seeing the dragon as a natural predator,

however, she does not wish to attract dragonslayers or

other powerful heroes to the area before the dragon

moves on.

• Something large and powerful has been seen in the

heart of an ancient woodland. Even the killoren, the

most forthcoming denizens of the forest, do not know

what it represents or what it is. Legends tell of a powerful

avatar of the forest’s might, but no one knows why it

might have been awakened or whether it might venture

out of the forest.
