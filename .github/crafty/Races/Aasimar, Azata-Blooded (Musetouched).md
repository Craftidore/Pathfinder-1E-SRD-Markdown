The capricious aasimars known as musetouched are the most likely of their kind to be found adventuring throughout lands both civilized and remote. Imbued with an undeniable spirit of wanderlust, musetouched feel the constant urge to explore new places, meet new people, and ferret out evil and corruption wherever they lurk. 

Of all the aasimars, musetouched tend to be among the most beautiful by most humans’ standards. They possess features with an unearthly charm, such as long, thick hair of a seemingly impossible hue and limpid, jewel-toned eyes. Musetouched are commonly possessed of innate musical talent and a love for melodies, and many train as bards while they wander. 

Their distaste for oppression and innate love of good draws many musetouched to Andoran and the River Kingdoms, and their beauty and free-roaming spirits endear them to the fortune-tellers and vagabonds of Varisia. Their drive to visit new lands leads azata-blooded aasimars to explore the farthest shores of Golarion; musetouched from the Inner Sea can be found in Vudra and Tian Xia, as well as the crystalline city of Dehrukani in southern Garund, where they are seen as holy beings truly worthy of worship. 

Traits

**Lillend’s Harp**: Your ancestor was a lillend, a being of exceptional grace and singular musical talent. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (string) checks. This bonus increases to +2 when you make a Perform check as part of a bardic performance.
