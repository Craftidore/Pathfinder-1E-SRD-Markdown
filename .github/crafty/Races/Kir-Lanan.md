Falsely labeled gargoyles by some, kir-lanans are actually creatures

who arrived on Faerûn during the Time of Troubles (1358

DR). They have made it their mission to destroy the gods of

Toril by first executing all who believe in them. In a world in

which religion plays a central part in the lives of so many people,

this is a no small task. It essentially calls for the murder of just

about every person on the face of the planet.

Kir-lanans are only vaguely similar to true gargoyles. They

have a humanoid form and large, batlike wings. They stand

about 6 feet tall and weigh around 220 pounds. Their finely

scaled hides are all dark in color, normally ranging from midnight

blue through deep purple to black. Some rare individuals

come in deep crimson, emerald, dun, or gray colors instead. They

all have mouths full of sharp, pointed teeth, and they have

small, blunt horns just above their temples. They eschew traditional

clothing, instead binding their torsos with cloth wrappings

interwoven with strips of metal, ivory, or stone.

Kir-lanan have no established life expectancy or age categories,

as the oldest members of the race are

only about 15 years of age. They are

fully grown within one year of birth, and

as yet show no signs of deterioration from

aging. How long their lifespans are likely

to be, none can say.

**History**

Even the most learned souls of Faerûn

have few clues as to the true nature of

kir-lanans. All they know for sure is

that the creatures are bent upon

killing off priests and other divine servants—

or “godslaves,” as the kirlanans

call them—as quickly as

possible. The kir-lanans are the source

of a great deal of rumor in Faerûn these

days. Anywhere there squats a stone gargoyle,

people whisper that it’s actually

one of these evil beasts watching silently

over a town, waiting for its brethren to

arrive so they can strike. These creatures are

reputed to have all sorts of powers, including

a complete immunity to magic (not true) and

the ability to drain the strength from their foes

(true at least in part).

There are several credible theories as to where the kirlanans

come from. The most popular is that the creatures hail

from another world or plane composed entirely of negative

energy, but in truth the kir-lanans sprang whole from the ineffable

energies unleashed by the death of three gods: Bane, Bhaal,

and Myrkul. This trio of ill-fated deities were slain during the

Time of Troubles, and their passing manifested itself in a

number of various destructive acts. Some of that energy didn’t

simply dissipate as the dead deities passed from Toril. Instead, it

coalesced in some deep, secret chamber into a seething ball of

furious chaos. The first of the kir-lanans erupted from this dangerous

sphere, fully formed and aware of its terrible origins. Several

hundred kir-lanans came into being in this way. However,

due to the manner of their creation, they were forsaken by the

gods, and they knew it. They were doomed to never be able to

gain the favor of the divine and pass into the afterlife. Instead,

their deaths would literally be the end of them.

Angered by this painful fact, the soulless kir-lanans decided

that if the gods were to condemn them outright, then they

would do the same to the gods. Unable to directly match the

power of the gods, the creatures decided to instead attack the

deities in the only way they could: through those who worshiped

the gods of Toril. In the years since their arrival in Faerûn, the

kir-lanans have made good on their plans to wreak terror in the

hearts of those who have promised their souls to the gods. They

originally started with raids on clerics and adepts and their

houses of worship, but in recent years they have extended their

horrific campaign to include all worshipers in those temples,

churches, or chapels. The threat the kir-lanans pose to the people

of Faerûn grows every day.

**Outlook**

Kir-lanans don’t care much for life—their own or that of

anyone else. They exist solely to cause misery for

the gods and those who call upon these feckless

and fickle deities.

Kir-lanans are born in secluded rookeries

and raised by all the adult kirlanans

who call the place home. They

come into the world only three

months after conception, and they

are fully grown within a matter of

only one year. During this painfully

short childhood, these new kirlanans

are indoctrinated in the

hatred that their elders hold for the

gods. By the time these new adults

are ready to stretch their wings,

they bear as much hatred toward

the deities who have damned them

as any other kir-lanan.

Some rare kir-lanans do not

spend their days slaughtering the

followers of the gods. Instead, they

observe the actions of the people of

Faerûn from a distance, hoping to

learn their strengths and weaknesses.

They then bring this newfound knowledge

back to their people so that the kirlanans

can figure out a better way to murder

people more efficiently.

KIR-LANAN CHARACTERS

Kir-lanans favor the fighter class, as this—along with their

innate abilities—gives them the chance to do the most damage

to the largest number of hapless believers at any given time.

Spells run out, but claws keep killing forever. They most often

multiclass as fighter/sorcerers or fighter/necromancers. They

can manipulate arcane energies just fine, and their nature lends

itself to handling negative energies.

**Kir-Lanan Society**

Life as a kir-lanan is relentlessly harsh. They exist only to kill,

to breed, and to learn how to become better at killing. Both male

and females are treated equally in kir-lanan society. This is a

meritocracy. The strongest rule, no matter who they are.

Most kir-lanans wander about the world in wings of two to

five creatures. These wings rarely have a stable roster, with kirlanans

joining and leaving as the mood suits them. The leaders

of these wings are chosen by combat, and those who are not the

MINOR RACES

***Kir-lanan***

leaders constantly jockey to be in the right position to challenge

the leader the moment she leaves herself vulnerable. Wings of

kir-lanans mount their operations out of breeding grounds

known as rookeries. At certain times of the year—based on a

schedule of which only the kir-lanans are aware—individual

members of a wing leave their fellows and travel back to their

rookeries to breed.

Other than the members of these wings, there are two others

positions in kir-lanan culture: the valrak and the kivar. Both of

these vocations stand outside the traditional structure of the

wing, allowing the valraks and kivars to avoid the normal rivalry

for leadership that causes so many of the wings to waste time and

energy on internal struggles. The attention of the kir-lanans

would be better spent on taking the battle to the believers, and

it’s the duty of the valraks and kivars to help direct this.

The word “valrak” means “eye” in the guttural kir-lanan

tongue. These creatures travel around Faerûn individually,

watching the native peoples and learning everything they can

about them and their rich and complex history. By doing this,

the valraks free up the others to cause as much destruction as

they can, while the valraks scout out new victims and locations.

“Kivar,” on the other hand, means “voice.” The kivars are a combination

of morale officers and strategic planners for the kirlanans.

Although they spend most of their time in the field,

exhorting the wings to attempt greater and more terrible acts

of destruction, when back at the rookery the kivars gather to

absorb and discuss the information gathered by the valraks.

They use this to guide the kir-lanan campaign against the gods.

Kivars also are the ones who negotiate temporary alliances with

other groups of people who are less devout in their worship of

the gods. Of course, once these allies have served their purposes,

they are to be murdered as well, but the kivars are willing to let

them serve their purpose for a time.

New kir-lanans are born in these rookeries and raised by the

kivars. Once they are one year or so in age, they are released into

the wild and sent to join up with a new wing or to reinforce an

old one. No one knows what happens to kir-lanans as they get

older. The eldest ones are only 15 years old, and many of those

who were part of the race’s creation have been killed off by

either their intended victims or in leadership challenges.

**Language and Literacy**

Kir-lanans speak their own harsh language (Kir-lanan) and

Common. When speaking with each other, they stick to Kirlanan,

but they use thickly accented Common to converse with

everyone else. Some valraks actually pick up several other languages

(it’s hard to learn a great deal about a people whose language

you don’t understand).

Kir-lanans don’t normally talk a great deal. They prefer

action to words.

All kir-lanans are literate, except for barbarians.

**Abilities and**

**Racial Features**

Kir-lanans have the following racial traits:

• +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, –2 Wisdom. Strong and fast, kirlanans

don’t bother much with keeping in touch with the

world around them. They usually prefer the direct approach to

most problems.

• Medium-size: As Medium-size creatures, kir-lanans have no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

• Kir-lanan land speed is 30 feet. Their fly speed is 90 feet, with

good maneuverability.

• Darkvision 60 feet.

• +3 natural armor.

• +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

• Proficient with all simple weapons and light armor.

• Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A kir-lanan has 4d8 racial Hit

Dice. A kir-lanan character receives the maximum hit points

for her first monstrous humanoid Hit Die and rolls her other

monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally. She rolls all Hit Dice

from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit

points on her first class-level Hit Die. A kir-lanan’s racial Hit

Dice also provide a +4 base attack bonus and saving throws of

Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Kir-lanans with class levels add

their class attack bonus and saves to their racial attack bonus

and saving throws.

• Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A kir-lanan’s monstrous

humanoid Hit Dice grant her skill points equal to (2 + Int

modifier, minimum 1) ×7. Class skills for these skill points are

Escape Artist, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Use

Magic Device. A kir-lanan does not get the ×4 multiplier for

skill points acquired from her first class level.

• Monstrous Humanoid Feats: A kir-lanan’s monstrous

humanoid Hit Dice grant her 2 feats. A typical kir-lanan

chooses Flyby Attack and Weapon Focus (claw). A kir-lanan

with class levels gains feats based on her total Hit Dice, as

shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

• Natural Attacks: A kir-lanan can attack with 2 claws, dealing

1d4 points of damage each. A kir-lanan can attack with a onehanded

weapon at her normal attack bonus and make a claw

attack as a secondary attack (–5 penalty on the attack roll, and

half Strength bonus on the damage roll).

• Negative Energy Touch (Su): Three times per day, a kir-lanan

can use a touch attack similar to the *chill touch* spell. If she hits

with a melee touch attack, she deals 2d6 points of damage and

1 point of temporary Strength damage. A Fortitude save (DC

12 + Cha modifier) negates the Strength damage. The kir-lanan

heals the same number of points of damage as she deals with

this attack, although she cannot exceed her normal maximum

hit points. The kir-lanan can use this power in conjunction with

a claw attack, but she must hit with a melee attack to do so. She

does not regain hit points for the claw damage she deals.

• *Ray of Enfeeblement* (Sp): Three times per day, a kir-lanan

can use *ray of enfeeblement* as if the spell had been cast by a

4th-level sorcerer.

• Rebuke Undead (Su): A kir-lanan can rebuke or command

undead three times per day as an evil cleric with as many levels

as the kir-lanan has Hit Dice.

• Harmed by Positive Energy: A kir-lanan suffers damage from

*cure wounds* spells, holy water, and blessed weapons just as if

she were undead. Conversely, she is healed by *inflict wounds*

spells and other applications of negative energy. Kir-lanans

are not undead, but their bodies are infused with negative

energy. They cannot be turned, but they are uncomfortable

around such displays and usually seek to avoid a turning

cleric anyhow.

• Soulless: Kir-lanans cannot become clerics, druids, or paladins,

and they cannot use positive energy of any kind. They cannot

ever use divine magic. They may become rangers, but they

never gain that class’s spellcasting abilities. A kir-lanan bard,

MINOR RACES

however, can learn *inflict wounds* spells instead of cure

wounds spells. Since kir-lanan don’t have souls, they can only

be brought back from the dead with a *wish* or *miracle* spell,

just like an outsider.

• Automatic Languages: Kir-Lanan, Common. Bonus Languages:

By region.

• Favored Class: Fighter.

• Level Adjustment: +4. Due to her 4 racial Hit Dice and her

supernatural and spell-like abilities, a kir-lanan has an effective

character level of 8 plus her class levels. Thus, a 7th-level

kir-lanan fighter would have an ECL of 15. See Table 1 in

the Introduction.

**Kir-Lanan**

**Magic and Lore**

Kir-lanans have no special racial

spells of their own. As spellcasters,

kir-lanans can only

manipulate arcane—never

divine—magic. They prefer

spells that destroy and corrupt

the soul, particularly necromantic

spells. As creatures of negative

energy, they have an

affinity for death magic.

**Kir-Lanan**

**Deities**

Kir-lanans have no deities, although

some kivars advocate striking a temporary

alliance with worshipers of

Shar. They appreciate this god’s

desire to wage war on the other gods,

so they feel that they could

work together for as long as

their interests coincide. Once the

other gods are gone, though, Shar is sure to be the

next target on the kir-lanans’ list.

Kir-lanans hate all the gods and the people who worship them.

They have some tolerance for those who simply pay lip service

to the gods, but in the end the kir-lanans want to murder these

people too. People who renounce the gods entirely might be able

to work with the kir-lanans without fear of betrayal, but by

doing so they put their souls in mortal peril.

**Relations with Other Races**

Kir-lanans want to kill everyone. They don’t particularly target

one race over another. However, the more pious a person is, the

more likely it is that he may feel the kir-lanans’ wrath. Piety is

measured by a character’s observations of religious rites and zeal

in his deity’s service, not his alignment. The valraks take this

into account when they report their observations and suggest

possible victims for kir-lanan wing raids. In cases in which the

valraks report a particularly important target, the kivars can

sometimes coordinate a multi-wing attack, bringing dozens of

kir-lanans to bear on the problem at once.
