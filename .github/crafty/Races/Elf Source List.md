# Elf Source List
## Overview
Here's as complete list of subraces as I can come up with, based on what the folks here have posted and my own sources, by campaign setting:

Forgotten Realms:

**Aquatic elf** (two cultures: Great Sea and Sea of Fallen Stars)
**Avariel** (aka winged elves, see 'Races of Faerun')
**Drow** (aka dark elves, same as in MM)
**Lythari** (elven werewolves)
**Marels** (evil aquatic elves found in the Moonsea; from 'The Moonsea', AD&D2E)
**Moon elf** (aka silver elf, the 'high elves' of Toril)
**Poscadar elf** (Native American-style elves from Anchorome, the continent north of Maztica; from 'The City of Gold')
**Star elf** (aka mithral elf, mysterious elves from a demiplane in the Ethereal, from 'Unapproachable East')
**Sun elf** (aka gold elf, the 'gray elves' of Toril)
**Wild elf** (aka green elf)
**Wood elf** (aka copper elf, descended from a mix of moon, sun, and wild elves)
**Zakharan elf** (from the Al-Qadim campaign setting; fully integrated into 'enlightened' Zakharan society)



World of Greyhawk:

**Avariel** (winged elf)
**Drow** (see MM)
**Gray elf** (see MM)
**Grugach** (wild elves from MM)
**High elf** (see MM)
**Snow elf** (tall, reclusive elves from the arctic; from Dragon Magazine 155)
**Valley elf** (human-sized gray elf offshoot)
**Wood elf** (see MM)



Dragonlance:

**Armachnesti** (Silvanesti offshoot found on Taladas, the northern continent)
**Cha'asii** (primitive jungle-dwelling elves from Taladas)
**Dargonesti** (aka Quoowahb among themselves; aquatic elves who can turn into dolphins)
**Dimernesti** (aquatic elves who can turn into sea otters)
**Drow** (the demoness Jialuthi from Krynn once posed as Lolth to convince many drow from different worlds to come to Krynn; she was killed and the drow were driven back to their own worlds. From 'Wild Elves')
**Elf of the Host** (I only know the name. Apparently from some novel? 'Riverwind the Plainsman'? tell me if I'm wrong)
**Hulderfolk** (reclusive 'wild elves' from Taladas)
**Kagonesti** (the 'wild elves' of the southern continent, Ansalon)
**Lucanesti** (I know virtually nothing about these elves except that they were introduced in 'Dark Queen of Krynn', a computer game?)
**Mahkwahb** (evil aquatic elves who turn into sharks)
**Qualinesti** (the 'high elves' of Ansalon)
**Silvanesti** (the 'gray elves' of Ansalon)
**Tamirnesti** (aka Hosk'i Imou Merkitsa; savage elves from Taladas)



Mystara:

**Aquarendi** (aquatic elves, probably from 'The Sea Peoples')
**Blacklore elf** (magic-users whose culture I believe died out in ancient Blackmoor; placed in the Hollow World by the Immortals to preserve their culture)
**Blackmoor elf** (from Dave Arneson's Blackmoor setting; extinct, forerunners of the Blacklore elves)
**Ee'ar** (same as the avariel of other worlds)
**Eldar** (mentioned in a novel?)
**Eusdrian elf** (from the Viking kingdom of Eusdria on the Savage Coast)
**Forest elf** (the most common subrace; essentially the equivalent of high elves)
**Gentle folk** (primitive elves found in the Hollow World)
**Grunland elf** (probably extinct; from the old elven homeland, destroyed in Blackmoor's fall)
**Icevale elf** (primitive elves found in the Hollow World)
**Savage Coast elf** (native to the western lands of the Savage Coast, fully integrated into human society)
**Proto-elf** (ancestor of the modern elves. Connection to yuan-ti?)
**Robrenn elf** (from the Celtic kingdom of Robrenn on the Savage Coast)
**Schattenalfen** (evil shadow elf offshoot, found closer to the Hollow World than the outer surface)
**Shadow elf** (pale-skinned subterranean elves with a strong aversion to sunlight; recently conquered the forest elf kingdom of Alfheim; not really evil but very xenophobic)
**Southern elf** (of Glantri; migrated to the Known World from Davania)
**Sylvan Realm elf** (not sure if the Sylvan Realm still exists...)
**Water elf** (pale-skinned, seafaring elves with a mercantile streak; primary inhabitants of the Minthorad Guilds)



Birthright:

**Sidhelien** (immortal Tolkienesque elves)



Dark Sun:

**Athasian elf** (7-foot-tall desert nomads)



Spelljammer:

**Avarien** (no connection to avariel; native only to the Astromundi Cluster)
**Faeriespace elf** (elves from Faeriespace, a strange star system that resembles a huge tree, where all its inhabitants live in harmony; from 'Crystal Spheres')
**Kule drow** (with kuo-toa and illithids, one of only three sentient species on Oerth's inner moon)
**Mratzal drow** (evil drow from Faeriespace, but not as aggressive as other drow because no gods are worshiped in Faeriespace, hence no Lolth (which begs the question of how they got there); from 'Crystal Spheres')
**Perianth elf** (elves from the Pyre system, in 'Shadow of the Spider Moon')
**Spider Moon drow** (from 'Shadow of the Spider Moon')
**Wildspace elf** (any elf who's taken to life in space; usually members or affiliates of the Imperial Elven Navy)



Planescape:

**Alabaster elf** (apparently extinct; what product are they mentioned in?)
**Elf einheriar** (from Asgard, on Ysgard's first layer)
**Planar elf** (any elf who was born on the Outer Planes)
**Svartalfar** (good drow native to Ysgard's lowest layer)



Ravenloft:

**Darkon elf** (the 'native' elves of Ravenloft; same as high elves elsewhere)
**Shadow elf** (in early 2E described as Lolth-worshipping drow; now apparently Fey type creatures called 'Sidhe' in late 2E and 3E. No connection to Mystara's shadow elves)

**Alf** (small, winged elves)
**Brag** (wild-eyed craftsfolk)
**Fir** (tinkers and engineers)
**Muryan** (aka Dancing Men; violent and aggressive warriors)
**Portune** (sobre and silent healers)
**Powrie** (aka Redcaps; evil and sinister assassins)
**Shee** (elves of Maeve's Seelie Court)
**Sith** (dark elves fascinated with death)
**Teg** (feral and wild)


**Sithicus elf** (descended from the qualinesti of Krynn drawn into Ravenloft when Lord Soth Laren was imprisoned)



Elves from Earth's Dark Ages (from Dragon 257):

**Alf** (wizardly light elves from Scandinavia, no connection to the cat-eating alien)
**Dockalf** (illusionist dark elves from Scandinavia; similar to drow)
**Fey** (reclusive elves from the British Isles)
(note that these elves are probably best treated as Fey rather than Humanoids)
I think that Eastern European elves may be mentioned in the 3E issue that dealt with a Slavic campaign. I'll check later today.



Elves from no particular setting:

**Ghost elf** (mysterious elves from the Ethereal Plane, from Dragon 313)
**Le'shay** (powerful elf-like fey; see 'Epic Level Handbook')
**Rockseer elf** (tall subterranean elves, from 'The Night Below')
**Sidhe** (Irish elves, from 'The Celts', historical reference sourcebook)
**Sidhe** (Seelie (celestial) and Unseelie (fiendish) fey from the Realm of Faerie, mentioned in 3E 'Manual of the Planes')
The Dragon #1 had a short article about Tolkien's **Noldor** (deep elves (ie, deep in regards to wisdom), second of the three races of high elves), **Sindar** (grey elves, descendents of the Teleri (sea elves), third race of the high elves; for those of you who are curious, the first are the Vanyar (fair elves)), and **silvan elves** (aka wood elves; descendents of both Nandor and Avari, the equivalents of wood and wild elves respectively) as PCs for 0E D&D.
I think it was Dragon 286 that presented ideas from Terry Brooks' 'Shannara' series for D&D. I'm sure they must have mentioned the **Westland elf**, his 'basic' elf race.



Elven crossbreeds:

**Draegloth** (drow/glabrezu half-fiends)
**Elfling** (half-elf/half-halfling; one appeared as the protagonist in a Dark Sun novel)
**Fey'ri** (demonic elven planetouched)
**Fainil** (another kind of demonic elven planetouched, appears as bat-winged drow; from Dragon 244)
**Half-elf** (normal type from the PH)

**Half-aquatic elf** (see 'Races of Faerun')
**Half-drow** (also 'Races of Faerun')
**Half-snow elf** (unusual half-elves from various sources)


**Half-surface elf/half-aquatic elf** (from Dragon Magazine somewhere)
**Half-surface elf/half-drow** (stands to reason they would exist)
**Half-elf/half-dwarves** (mentioned in 'The Complete Book of Elves' or 'Complete Book of Dwarves', I'm not sure which, plus 'Dwarves Deep')
**Half-elf/half-kender** (mentioned in some Dragonlance book, I don't know which)
**N'djadtwa** (elf-ogre crossbreeds from Dragon Magazine; encountered by Prince Haldemar of Haaken on his Voyage of the Princess Ark)
**Xakhun** (half-drow/half-wood elf, from Dragon 144)



Hopefully I didn't leave anything out.

Edit: Added elven crossbreeds.

Edit: Added the Planescape elves and a couple others, plus bullets to (hopefully) make it easier to pick out individual items.

Edit: Add the elves of the host to Dragonlance (correct me if they don't belong); the southern elves, proto-elves, and eldar of Mystara; and the n'djadtwa and a few other crossbreeds.

Edit: Added the ghost elves from Dragon 313 and the elves of Faeriespace from 'Crystal Spheres'. Also spiffied up the list format.
