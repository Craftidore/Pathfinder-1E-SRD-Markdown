# Dhampir
## Overview
The half-living children of vampires birthed by [[Human (Baklunish)|human]] females, dhampirs are progenies of both horror and tragedy. The circumstances of a dhampir’s conception are often called into question but scarcely understood, as few mortal mothers survive the childbirth. Those who do often abandon their monstrous children and refuse to speak of the matter. While some speculate that dhampirs result when mortal women couple with vampires, others claim that they form when a pregnant woman suffers a vampire bite. Some particularly zealous scholars even contest dhampirs’ status as a unique race, instead viewing them as humans suffering from an unholy affliction. Indeed, this hypothesis is strengthened by dhampirs’ seeming inability to reproduce, their offspring inevitably humans (usually sorcerers with the undead bloodline). Regardless, they live and die just like any other mortal creatures, despite possessing a supernatural longevity akin to that of elves.

Hardship and suffering fill a dhampir’s formative years. Most grow up as orphans, and despite their exquisite features and innate charm, they face a lifetime of prejudice, mistrust, fear, and persecution. Humans who witness the seemingly sinister nature of a dhampir child’s supernatural powers or sensitivity to daylight display an array of reactions ranging from awe to terror to outright hatred. Eventually, a dhampir must learn to cope with these difficulties in order to find his place in the world. While most dhampirs succumb to the innate evil of their undead heritage and devolve into the monstrous fiends depicted by society, a few reject their unholy conceptions, instead vowing to avenge their mothers by hunting the very creatures that sired them.

Dhampirs keep few, if any, close companions. Ultimately, the majority of evil dhampirs regard their allies as little more than tools or fodder. Those whom they deem useful are judged by their merits as individuals, not by their race. However, even with those they feel attached to, most dhampirs are sullen and reserved. Some fear the persecution heaped upon them may be transferred to their companions, whereas others worry their own bloodlust will one day overwhelm them and they’ll inadvertently turn upon their friends. In any case, an alliance with a dhampir almost always leads to an ill-fated conclusion.

**Physical Description:** Tall and slender and with well-defined musculature, dhampirs look like statuesque humans of unearthly beauty. Their hair, eye, and skin colors resemble unnerving versions of their mothers’; many possess a ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the color of a bruise.

While many dhampirs can pass as humans in ideal conditions, their features are inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All dhampirs have elongated incisors. While not true fangs, these teeth are sharp enough to draw blood, and many suffer a reprehensible desire to indulge in sanguinary delights, despite the fact that the act provides most no physical benefit.

**Society:** Dhampirs have no culture of their own, nor do they have any known lands or even communities. Often born in secret and abandoned at orphanages or left to die on the outskirts of town, they tend to live solitary lives as exiles and outcasts. Individuals acquire the cultural beliefs and teachings of the regions in which they grew up, and adopt additional philosophies over the course of their complex lives. This ability to adapt to a verity of circumstances provides dhampirs with a social camouflage that hides them from both predators and prey.

In rare instances, dhampirs might gather to form small groups or cabals dedicated to resolving their joint issues. Even so, the philosophies of such groups reflect the interests of the individuals involved, not any common dhampir culture.

**Relations:** As dhampirs are scions of evil, few races view them favorably. They share an affinity for those half-breeds whose sinister ancestry also sets them apart from [[Human (Baklunish)|human]] society, particularly tief lings and half-orcs. Humans view them with a combination of fear and pity, though such feelings often devolve into hatred and violence. Other humanoid races, such as dwarves, elves, and half lings, simply shun them. Similarly, dhampirs bear a deep-seeded loathing for living creatures, their hatred planted by jealousy and fed by frustration.

**Alignment and Religion:** Most dhampirs succumb to the evil within their blood. They are unnatural creatures, and the foul inf luence of their undead heritage makes an evil outlook difficult to overcome. Those who struggle against their wicked natures rarely progress beyond a neutral outlook.

Dhampirs who become vampire hunters tend to worship Sarenrae or Pharasma, depending on their moral stance. Those who have spiraled into evil and embraced their undead heritage typically worship the demon lord Zura the Vampire Queen or Urgathoa, goddess of the undead.

**Adventurers:** The life of an adventurer comes naturally to most dhampirs, since constant persecution condemns many to spend their days wandering. Evil dhampirs keep moving to maintain their secrecy and evade lynch mobs, while those who follow the path of vengeance venture forth in search of their despised fathers. Regardless of their reasons, most dhampirs simply feel more at home on the road than in a settlement. Having little formal training, a great many of these journeyers become fighters and rogues.

Almost universally, those inclined toward magic pursue the field of necromancy, though dhampir alchemists have been known to obsess over transforming their own bodies. Those who feel the call of the hunt often become inquisitors.

**Names:** Lacking a culture and unified traditions, dhampirs share humans’ predilection for a diversity of names, and most keep their [[Human (Baklunish)|human]] birth names. Many dhampirs take their mother’s surname, while others take the surname of the towns or regions in which they were born, or use a surname derived from a significant event.

## Dhampir Racial Traits
**Dhampir Racial Traits**

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution:** Dhampirs are fast and seductive, but their racial bond to the undead impedes their mortal vigor.

**Dhampir:** Dhampirs are humanoids with the dhampir subtype.

**Medium:** Dhampirs are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed:** Dhampirs have a base speed of 30 feet.

**Senses:** Low-light vision and darkvision 60 feet.

**Manipulative:** +2 racial bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]].

**Undead Resistance:** Dhampirs gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease and mind-affecting effects.

**Light Sensitivity:** Dhampirs are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell.

**Negative Energy Affinity:** Though a living creature, a dhampir reacts to positive and negative energy as if it were undead—positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.

**Spell-Like Ability:** A dhampir can use *[[Detect Undead (Spell)|detect undead]]* three times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability equals the dhampir’s class level.

**Resist Level Drain (Ex):** A dhampir takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels then he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a dhampir takes are removed without the need for an additional saving throw.

**Languages:** Dhampirs begin play speaking Common. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose any language it wants (except secret languages, such as Druidic).

## Alternate Racial Rules
**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing dhampir racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Dayborn:** A few fortunate dhampirs were born during the day under the blessings of priests, and their blood has weaker ties to their undead bloodline than others of their kind. Such dhampirs are unhindered by daylight and lose the light sensitivity racial trait. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

**Fangs:** On occasion, a dhampir may inherit his father’s lengthy canines. Whenever the dhampir makes a grapple combat maneuver check to damage an opponent, he can choose to bite his opponent, dealing 1d3 points of damage as if using a natural bite attack. As a standard action, the dhampir can bite a creature that is bound, [[Helpless|helpless]], [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], or similarly unable to defend itself. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

**Vampiric Empathy:** Though dhampirs often relate poorly to humanoids, some share an aff inity with baser creatures. These dhampirs gain the ability to communicate with bats, rats, and wolves as if under the effects of a *[[Speak with Animals (Spell)|speak with animals]]* spell (caster level equal to 1/2 the dhampir’s Hit Dice). In addition, they gain a +2 racial bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks when dealing with these animals. Whenever these dhampirs initiate an exchange, animals begin with a starting attitude of indifferent. This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces manipulative.

## Favored Class Options
**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all dhampirs who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Alchemist:** Add +10 minutes to the duration of the alchemist’s mutagens.

**[[Cleric]]:** Add +1 to the caster level of any channeling feat used to affect undead.

**[[Fighter]]:** Add a +2 bonus on rolls to stabilize when dying.

**Inquisitor:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks to demoralize humanoids.

**[[Rogue]]:** Add a +1/2 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks made in dim light or darkness.

**[[Sorcerer]]:** Add +1/2 point of negative energy damage to spells that deal negative energy damage.

**[[Wizard]]:** Add +1/4 to the wizard’s caster level when casting spells of the necromancy school.

## Racial Archetypes
**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetypes are available to dhampirs.

**Cruoromancer ([[Wizard]])**

To those who know how to manipulate it, the blood of a dhampir can be a powerful component to magic. A cruoromancer infuses his necromantic magic with the power of his unique mixture of living blood and undead ichor. As his power increases in this strange arcane art, a cruoromancer finds potent ways to infuse his unique blood with necromancy spells. A cruoromancer has the following class features.

**Blood Infusion (Su):** When a cruoromancer casts a spell of the necromancy school, he can opt to infuse that spell with his undead-tainted blood as a swift action. As he increases in level, the power and effects of such infusions become more potent. Each time a cruoromancer uses blood infusion, he drains a portion of his own blood either by cutting himself with a blade or by opening a scab from a previous wound. When he does this, he takes an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + the level of the spell being infused. A cruoromancer can only affect a spell with a single type of blood infusion. At 1st level, he can infuse his necromancy spells in either of the following ways.

*Focused Infusion:* When the cruoromancer uses this infusion, he adds +1 to the DC of the infused necromancy spell.

*Sickening Infusion:* When the cruoromancer uses this infusion, any creature damaged by the infused necromancy spell becomes [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round.

This ability replaces arcane bond.

**Blood Command (Su):** At 5th level, a cruoromancer can control up to 5 Hit Dice worth of undead creatures per caster level instead of the normal 4 Hit Dice of undead when casting the *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* spell. He also gains the following blood infusion ability.

*Commanding Infusion:* When using this infusion with *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]*, the cruoromancer can create a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to three times his caster level instead of twice his caster level.

This ability replaces the 5th-level wizard bonus feat.

**Blood Desecration (Su):** At 10th level, a cruoromancer gains the following blood infusion.

*Desecrating Infusion:* When the cruoromancer uses this infusion, he can choose to center a *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* effect on himself or a single target of the spell modified by this infusion (he chooses upon casting). This effect is like the *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* spell, but lasts for 1 minute per caster level of the cruoromancer, and does not interact with altars, shrines, or permanent fixtures that boost the *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* effect. This ability replaces the 10th-level wizard bonus feat.

**Blood Ability (Su):** At 15th level, a cruoromancer can choose to scry through a single undead creature he created with a spell modified by a commanding infusion. The undead creature is treated as if imbued with an *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]* spell (caster level equal to the cruoromancer’s wizard level). This ability replaces the 15th-level wizard bonus feat.

**Perfect Infusion (Su):** At 20th level, a cruoromancer can use his blood infusions without taking damage. This ability replaces the 20th-level wizard bonus spell.

**Kinslayer (Inquisitor)**

Appalled and guilt-ridden by the horrific circumstances of her birth, a kinslayer dedicates herself to eradicating the very creatures whose blood f lows within her veins. She spends her life hunting and slaying those vampiric monsters for whom humans have become prey. A kinslayer has the following class features.

**Judgment (Su):** At 1st level, a kinslayer gains the following judgment.

*Slayer’s Brand (Su):* When using this judgment, the kinslayer gains the ability to brand undead creatures with positive energy. To do so, she must make a successful melee touch attack against the undead creature. This attack deals an amount of positive energy damage equal to 1d6 + the kinslayer’s Charisma score, and burns her personal symbol into the undead creature’s flesh, bone, or even its incorporeal form. From that point onward, the kinslayer can sense the existence of the branded creature as if it were the target of a *[[Locate Creature (Spell)|locate creature]]* spell (caster level equal to 1/2 the kinslayer’s inquisitor level). A slayer’s brand lasts until the undead creature is destroyed or until the kinslayer uses this ability on another creature. This ability replaces the destruction judgment.

**Greater Brand (Su):** A 1st level, a kinslayer learns to modify her slayer’s brand judgment as she gains levels. Whenever she gains the ability to learn a teamwork feat, she can instead opt to learn one of the following modifications to her slayer’s brand judgment.

*Branding Ray:* The slayer’s brand judgment can be used as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. A kinslayer can take this modification more than once. Whenever she does, she increases the range of her brand by 20 feet.

*Debilitating Brand:* A creature currently affected by the slayer’s brand judgment takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls against the kinslayer who placed the brand.

*Devastating Brand:* When the kinslayer attacks a creature that she has branded with her slayer’s brand, she threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. If the kinslayer is good, she also gains a +2 sacred bonus on all rolls to confirm critical hits on a branded creature.

*Dual Brand:* The kinslayer can have up to two creatures branded at a time.

*Holy Brand:* The kinslayer can use her brand on creatures with the evil subtype as well as undead.

*Searing Brand:* The kinslayer’s slayer’s brand deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every five inquisitor levels she has. If the creature hit with the slayer’s brand is particularly vulnerable to bright light, the damage dice of her slayer’s brand increases to d8s. A kinslayer must be at least 6th level to take this modification.

*Silver Brand:* The kinslayer can use her brand on lycanthropes and creatures with vulnerability to silver as well as undead.

Each time the kinslayer opts to take a greater brand, it replaces her ability to gain a teamwork feat at that level. 

**Undead Sense (Sp):** At 2nd level, a kinslayer gains the ability to use *[[Detect Undead (Spell)|detect undead]]* as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to the kinslayer’s inquisitor level) at will. If she detects the presence of undead, she can use her monster lore ability to attempt to determine the type of undead detected as well as to reveal any strengths or weaknesses the undead might have. If any of the detected undead are vampires, she gains a bonus on the check equal to her inquisitor level to immediately identify them as such.

This ability replaces *detect alignment*.
