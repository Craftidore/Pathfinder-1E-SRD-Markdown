Asherati Humanoid +0 None Rogue Asherati, Common

An asherati might be mistaken for a thin human under some circumstances—at least until the asherati’s rust-red skin begins to glow with a light all its own, or until he dives headlong into the nearest sand dune, disappearing without a trace.

Asheratis are a geographically established people who live below the sands and dusts of suitable wastelands, rising to the surface to hunt for food, socialize and trade with other races, and make war upon their enemies. As merfolk are to the sea, asheratis are to the sands.

Personality: Asheratis are a quiet people, given to refl ection and long retreats from the presence of their fellows. However, every asherati acknowledges the value of community and fellowship, and each retreat is followed by a return to a sand-shrouded village where friendships are renewed and the needs of the community are met.

Physical Description: An asherati appears as a humanoid with smooth skin the color of rust. An asherati can make its skin glow as if with an inner fire, giving off a piercing illumination that suffuses through sand. An asherati has no body hair and eyes the color of ivory. The lithe asherati is a graceful swimmer of the dunes, and thus eschews excessive clothing or equipment, wearing only minimal, skin-hugging garments for modesty’s sake. Some asheratis wear tight leather armor, streamlined so as not to hinder their progress through the sands. A typical asherati stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds.

Relations: Asheratis delight when nomads, caravans, or travelers of almost any race appear in the sands above their homes—by day, asherati merchants trade their wares, while at night, asherati rogues silently

ascend and try their hands at pilfering. Trade continues

despite this behavior, because no one can come close

to replicating the delicate asherati sand sculptures (see

page 101), which can fetch large prices in cities far from

the desert.

Asheratis tolerate other established races of the wastes,

grudgingly admitting that each has found a niche. The

asheratis live below the sand and the other races above.

Still, sometimes confl ict erupts or potential feuds smolder

just below the surface.

It is not unknown for caravans moving through the

desert to hire an asherati or two to act as guides and

scouts. Especially adventurous asheratis have left the

wastes entirely, seeking their fortunes in completely

alien lands.

Alignment: Asheratis share a common concern for

one another’s welfare and are, therefore, good. Observing

no specifi c rules when it comes to behavior, and having a

proclivity toward thievery, asheratis are usually chaotic.

Asherati Lands: The trackless, changing waste seems

an inhospitable location to claim, with the burning sun

by day and frigid cold at night. That’s why asheratis claim

the lands below, living beneath the sand as if it were water.

Under the cover of sand are their homes, communities,

and even a few great cities of striking architecture. The

interior of every buried building is hollow; the air is clear,

and asheratis live in a way not unlike that of common

humans. Cleverly constructed “sandlocks” in the fl oors of

their homes allow asheratis to move into and out of buried

buildings without disrupting the equilibrium between

sand and open space.

In asherati cities, families hold the power. Powerful,

wealthy, and well-respected families are responsible for

the outlook of the local populace, and are referred to as

the First Families. The First Families share power in a

council, and truly great families are sometimes important

in more than one village. Since family is such an

important aspect of asherati social life, bad behavior on

the part of a single family is often tolerated for far longer

than in most other civilizations.

Far-f lung asherati towns are usually made up of just

two or three families, all working together to build

their community. Usually such colonies are built to

expand trade. Others are secretly established in sandy

areas that abut more temperate regions to serve as a

base for larceny.

Religion: Many asheratis give homage to Solanil (see

page 46), whom they view as responsible for building the

fi rst sand city to shelter the asheratis when they arrived

in the wasteland. Particularly zealous asherati worshipers

see themselves as the “seeds” that the deity has planted,

just as she encourages the planting of seeds so there will

be more food in the waste.

Language: Asheratis speak their own language and

Common.

Names: Asheratis have given names and family names.

*Male Names:* Amhapar, Het, Iputhut, Iu-same, Khankhe,

Menefer, M’ut, Nament, Tauah.

*Female Names:* Abesukh, Aned, Ankheru, Djede, Kher-ra,

Nemenmo, Reht, Shis.

*Family Names:* Ambera, Atinani, Faihayl, Habah, Huridah,

Imtimah, Manah, Nadeeha, Najeema, Nazihar, Nimah,

Rawthay, Reedayl.

Adventurers: Every asherati has some measure of

adventurous spirit, no matter how deeply hidden. It would

be hard to name an asherati who did not try his hand at

a minor bit of thievery for the fun and excitement such

behavior promises. It is not unheard of to fi nd full-time

asherati adventurers, though such folk usually leave the

sands of their birth far behind, fi nding noble quests in

the far corners of the world.

Asherati Racial Traits

• Medium: As Medium creatures, asheratis have no special

bonuses or penalties due to size.

• Asherati base land speed is 30 feet.

• +1 Natural Armor: An asherati’s skin is thick, so it can

stand up to the scrape of sand.

• Natural Dryness (Ex): Asheratis drink water, but they are

very dry creatures. To survive, they need to drink only

one-quarter the amount of water per day that humanoids

of their size normally require.

• Sandswim (Su): As a merfolk is to the sea, an asherati is

to sand, ash, dust, and even softsand (but not slipsand,

packed dirt, or rock). An asherati can sandswim through

such materials at his land speed while wearing light

armor or carrying a light load. His speed drops to 5 feet

if an asherati wears heavier armor or carries a medium

load. An asherati cannot make any headway through

the sand while carrying a heavy load.

An asherati breathes normally while under the sands.

This supernatural ability doesn’t allow an asherati to

breath in mediums other than sand, dust, or ash, nor

does it allow an asherati to hold its breath longer than

normal in water or dangerous gases.

• Body Lamp (Su): An asherati can make his skin glow at

will, providing bright light out to 60 feet and shadowy

illumination out to 120 feet. In a medium of loose

soil, such as sand, dust, or ash, a peculiar quality of

the light allows an asherati to make out solid objects

up to 60 feet away. Under the sand, this light is sufficient

for navigation and general identification of

objects, but not for reading, recognizing individuals,

or other similar feats of fi ner perception. This ability

does not allow an asherati to see invisible creatures or

creatures with concealment more easily than normal.

Other creatures in the sand with an asherati do not gain this special sight, but they can see the sand take

on a warm, orange glow.

Once per day, as a free action, an asherati can bring

his skin up to full brilliance so rapidly that it can dazzle

all creatures within 30 feet for 1 minute. Creatures can

avoid this effect with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10

+ 1/2 the asherati’s character level + his Cha modifi er).

• Heat Endurance: Asheratis gain Heat Endurance (see

page 50) as a bonus feat.

• Weapon Familiarity: Asheratis treat the eagle’s claw

(see page 96) as a martial weapon rather than an exotic

weapon.

• +2 racial bonus on Move Silently and Hide checks (an

asherati cannot Hide while his skin glows). If in a sandy

area, an asherati receives an additional +2 racial bonus

on Hide checks.

• Water Vulnerability: Asheratis hate being too wet,

and their dry bodies absorb water rapidly when they

are submerged. If completely wet, an asherati takes a

–1 penalty on all attack rolls, ability checks, and skill

checks. If an asherati is immersed in water, he cannot

hold his breath and must immediately begin making

Constitution checks to avoid drowning (see page 304

of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).

• Automatic Languages: Asherati, Common. Bonus Languages:

Bhuka, Goblin, Giant.

• Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass asherati’s rogue class

does not count when determining whether he takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing.

• Level adjustment +0.
