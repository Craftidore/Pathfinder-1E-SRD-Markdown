Elf, Painted Humanoid +0 +2 Dex, –2 Int Druid Common, Elven

More closely related to wild elves than high elves, painted

elves commonly dwell in petrifi ed forests—which in ages

past, they claim, were their ancestral homes. The painted

elves take their name from the nature of the wastes in

which they dwell, but also from their habit of camoufl aging

themselves with pigments derived from the mineral

deposits found in such places. Though they rarely see

visitors—since painted deserts and petrifi ed forests offer

little in the way of treasure—painted elves are extremely

distrustful of outsiders, and can turn on guests at the

slightest provocation.

Painted elves are in most regards identical to wild elves,

as outlined in the *Monster Manual* (which in turn are

based on the high elf detailed in the *Player’s Handbook*).

The exceptions to the standard *Player’s Handbook* elf are

summarized below:

• +2 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence: Painted elves are every

bit as graceful and agile as high elves, but they are a

bit more limited in their understanding of the world

around them, having experience with little more than

their own petrifi ed domains.

• Favored Class: Druid. A multiclass painted elf’s druid

class does not count when determining whether he takes

an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
