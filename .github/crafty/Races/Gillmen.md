# Gillmen
## Overview
Gillmen are the remnants of a race of surface-dwelling

humanoids whose homeland was drowned in a great

cataclysm at the hands of the aboleth. The aboleths rescued

a few survivors, warping them into an amphibious race to

serve as emissaries to the surface world. Modern gillmen

remain reclusive and suspicious, scarred by both the loss of

their ancient heritage and the sure knowledge that aboleths

do nothing without expecting to profit from it. Physically

gillmen have expressive brows, pale skin, dark hair, and

bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each side of

their necks, near the shoulder, but they are otherwise close

enough in appearance to humans that they can pass as such

(for a time) without fear of detection.

Gillman Racial Traits

**+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, –2 Wisdom**: Gillmen are vigorous and beautiful, but their

domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed.

**Medium**: Gillmen are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Aquatic**: Gillmen are humanoids with the aquatic subtype.

**Normal Speed**: Gillmen have a base speed of 30 feet on land. As aquatic

creatures, they also have a swim speed of 30 feet, can move in water without

making Swim checks, and always treat Swim as a class skill.

**Amphibious**: Gillmen have the aquatic subtype, but can breathe both

water and air.

**Enchantment Resistance**: Gillmen gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus

against non-aboleth enchantment spells and effects, but take a –2

penalty on such saving throws against aboleth sources.

**Water Dependent**: A gillman’s body requires constant

submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend more

than 1 day without fully submerging themselves in water risk

internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death

within 4d6 hours.

**Languages**: Gillmen begin play speaking Common and Aboleth.

Gillmen with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following:

Aklo, Aquan, Draconic, and Elven.

**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of

existing gillman racial traits. Consult your GM before

selecting any of these new options.

**Riverfolk**: Some gillmen groups

live in colonies along vast

riverways, and have adapted

to living on land for much

longer periods. Gillmen

with this trait have a

thin coating of natural

oil that keeps their skin

from cracking even without

water. However, this natural oil also makes such gillmen

particularly susceptible to f lames, and they gain vulnerability

to fire. This racial trait replaces water dependent.

**Slimehunter**: Gillmen with this trait are from lineages

that have fought against aboleths since the aberrations

rescued their human ancestors. They receive a +2 racial

bonus on saving throws against aboleth spells, spelllike

abilities, and supernatural abilities. This racial trait

replaces enchantment resistance.

**Throwback**: Some gillmen are throwbacks to their landdwelling

human ancestors. Gillmen with this racial trait

do not have the amphibious trait, have the human subtype

instead of the aquatic subtype, have no swim speed or

bonuses to the Swim skill, cannot breathe water, and do

not have the water dependent racial trait.

**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all gillmen who

have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise

stated, the bonus applies each time you select the

favored class reward.

**Fighter**: Add +1 to the fighter’s CMD when resisting two

combat maneuvers of the character’s choice.

**Rogue**: The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.

**Sorcerer**: Add one spell known from the sorcerer spell

list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest

spell level the sorcerer can cast.

**Wizard**: Add one spell from the wizard spell list to the

wizard’s spellbook. This spell must be at least one level

below the highest spell level he can cast.

**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetype is available to gillmen.

Eldritch Raider (Rogue)

An eldritch raider is a rogue who seeks to unravel the

mysteries of the destruction of the gillmen’s homeland.

They explore old ruins that date back to the days of the old

human empire and track down relics and lore from its glory

days. An eldritch raider has the following class features.

**Class Skills**: An eldritch raider adds Knowledge (arcana),

Knowledge (history), and Spellcraft to her list of class skills

and removes Disguise, Perform, and Sleight of Hand from

her list of class skills.

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

**Detect Magic (Sp)**: At 2nd level, an eldritch raider gains

the ability to use *detect magic* at will. The eldritch raider

treats her rogue level as her caster level for this ability.

This ability counts as the minor magic rogue talent for

purposes of qualifying for other rogue talents. This ability

replaces the rogue talent rogues gained at 2nd level.

**Eldritch Intuition (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an eldritch raider

gains an intuitive sense that allows her to more easily

activate sorcerer and wizard spell completion and spell

trigger items. She gains a +1 bonus on Use Magic Device

checks for this purpose. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th

level, +3 at 9th level, +4 at 12th level, +5 at 15th level, and +6 at

18th level. This ability replaces the trap sense class feature.

**New Talents**: An eldritch raider has access to the following

new advanced talents when selecting rogue advanced talents.

*Major Eldritch Magic (Sp)*: The eldritch raider gains the

ability to cast a 3rd-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard

spell list two times per day as a spell-like ability. The

caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The

save DC for this spell is 13 + her Intelligence modifier. The

eldritch raider must have an Intelligence of at least 13 to

select this talent. The eldritch raider must have the major

magic, minor eldritch magic, and minor magic rogue

talents before choosing this talent.

*Minor Eldritch Magic (Sp)*: The eldritch raider gains the

ability to cast a 2nd-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard

spell list two times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster

level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC

for this spell is 12 + her Intelligence modifier. The eldritch

raider must have an Intelligence of at least 12 to select this

talent. The eldritch raider must have the major magic and

minor magic rogue talents before choosing this talent.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement

the eldritch raider archetype: major magic, minor magic,

quick disable, trap spotter (*Core Rulebook*); fast picks

(*Advanced Player’s Guide*); black market connections,

esoteric scholar, ninja trick (slow metabolism, wall

climber) (*Ultimate Combat*).

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents

complement the eldritch raider archetype: dispelling

attack, improved evasion, slippery mind (*Core Rulebook*);

major eldritch magic, minor eldritch magic (*Advanced Race*

*Guide*); thoughtful reexamination (*Advanced Player’s Guide*);

familiar, hard to fool (*Ultimate Combat*).
