# Catfolk
## Overview
Catfolk are a race of natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such trailblazing is not limited merely to the search for new horizons in distant lands. Many catfolk see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. While most catfolk are nimble, capable, and often active creatures, there is also a strong tendency among some catfolk to engage in quiet contemplation and study. Such individuals are interested in finding new solutions to age-old problems and questioning even the most steadfast philosophical certainties of the day. They are curious by nature, and catfolk culture never discourages inquisitiveness, but rather fosters and encourages it. Many are seen as quirky extroverts by members of other races, but within catfolk tribes there is no shame attached to minor peculiarities, eccentricities, or foolhardiness. All but the most inwardly focused catfolk enjoy being the center of attention, but not at the expense of their tribe, whether it’s the one the catfolk are born into or the tribe they choose through the bonds of friendship with other creatures. Catfolk tend to be both generous and loyal to their family and friends.

**Physical Description**: In general, catfolk are lithe and slender, standing midway between dwarves and humans in stature. While clearly humanoid, they possess many feline features, including a coat of soft fine fur, slit pupils, and a sleek, slender tail. Their ears are pointed, but unlike those of elves, are more rounded and catlike. They manipulate objects as easily as any other humanoid, but their fingers terminate in small, sharp, retractable claws. These claws are typically not powerful enough to be used as weapons, but some members of the species—either by quirk of birth or from years of honing—can use them with deadly effect. Feline whiskers are not uncommon, but not universal, and hair and eye color vary greatly.

**Society**: While self-expression is an important aspect of catfolk culture, it is mitigated by a strong sense of community and group effort. In the wild, catfolk are a hunter-gatherer tribal people. The pursuit of personal power never comes before the health and well-being of the tribe. More than one race has underestimated this seemingly gentle people only to discover much too late that their cohesion also provides them great strength.

Catfolk prefer to be led by their most competent members, usually a council of sub-chieftains chosen by their peers, either though consensus or election. The sub-chiefs then choose a chieftain to lead in times of danger and to mediate disputes among the sub-chiefs. The chieftain is the most capable member of the tribe, and is often magically talented. Catfolk who settle in more urban and civilized areas still cling to a similar tribal structure, but often see friends outside the tribe, even those from other races, as part of their extended tribe. Within adventuring groups, catfolk who do not consider themselves the obvious choice as chieftain often defer to the person who most resembles their cultural ideal of a chieftain.

**Relations**: Adaptable and curious, catfolk get along with almost any race that extends reciprocal goodwill. They acclimate easily to half lings, humans, and especially elves. Catfolk and elves share a passionate nature, as well as a love of music, dance, and storytelling; elven communities often gently mentor catfolk tribes, though such elves are careful not to act in a patronizing manner toward their feline friends. Gnomes make natural companions for catfolk, as catfolk enjoy gnomes’ strange and obsessive qualities. Catfolk are tolerant of kobolds as long as the reptilian beings respect the catfolk’s boundaries. The feral nature of orcs stirs as much puzzlement as it does revulsion among catfolk, as they don’t understand orcs’ savagery and propensity for self-destruction. Half-orcs, on the other hand, intrigue catfolk, especially those half-orcs who strive to excel beyond the deleterious and hateful nature of their savage kin. Catfolk often view goblins and [[Ratfolk (Race)|ratfolk]] as vermin, as they disdain the swarming and pernicious tendencies of those races.

**Alignment and Religion**: With community and unselfish cooperation at the center of their culture, as well as a good-natured curiosity and willingness to adapt to the customs of many other races, most catfolk tend toward good alignments. The clear majority of catfolk are also chaotic, as wisdom is not their strongest virtue; nevertheless, there are exceptions with cause. The gods [[Desna]], [[Cayden Cailean]], and [[Shelyn]] all speak to the souls of catfolk, and many tribes depict the latter two as catfolk themselves. The quest for self-improvement has led many an individual to explore different philosophies, including the worship of Irori.

**Adventurers**: Natural born trackers, the hunter-gatherer aspect of their tribes pushes many catfolk toward occupations as rangers and druids by default, but such roles don’t always speak to their love of performance art, be it song, dance, or storytelling. Catfolk legends also speak of a rich tradition of great sorcerer heroes. Those catfolk who internalize their wanderlust often become wizards and monks, with many of those monks taking the path of the nimble guardian. While catfolk cavaliers and inquisitors are rare (steadfast dedication to a cause is often alien to the catfolk mindset) individuals who choose these paths are never looked down upon. Catfolk understand that exploration and self-knowledge can lead down many roads, and are accepting of nearly all professions and ways of life.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**ALTERNATE RACIAL RULES**

Catfolk are a wildly varied and independent race. As a result, there are many variations in their abilities, outlooks, and styles. The following rules are just some of the different traits that manifest in catfolk, frequently without regard for heritage or training.

**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of typical catfolk racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Cat’s Claws**: Some catfolk have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their race, and can use them to make attacks. Catfolk with this racial trait have a pair of claws they can use as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.

**Clever Cat**: Catfolk’s generally friendly disposition doesn’t preclude craftiness. Some of them see social obstacles as games to be played and won. These catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.

**Climber**: Catfolk hunters excel at hunting prey from trees and other high vantage points. Catfolk with this racial trait possess a climb speed of 20 feet (along with the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks a climb speed affords). This racial trait replaces sprinter.

**Curiosity**: Catfolk are naturally inquisitive about the world around them, though some are more curious than others. Such catfolk gain a +4 bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information, and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) are always class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead. This racial trait replaces natural hunter.

**Nimble Faller**: Some catfolk have an amazing sense of balance and keen knowledge of their own center of gravity. Catfolk with this trait land on their feet even when they take lethal damage from a fall. Furthermore, catfolk with this trait gain a +1 bonus to their CMD against trip maneuvers. This racial trait replaces sprinter.

**Scent**: Some catfolk favor a keen sense of smell over sensitive sight. Catfolk with this racial trait gain the scent ability. This racial trait replaces the low-light vision racial trait.

## Favored Class Options
**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all catfolk who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**[[Bard]]**: Add +1/2 to the bard’s bardic knowledge bonus.

**Cavalier**: Add +1/4 to the cavalier’s banner bonus.

**[[Druid]]**: Add +1 hit points to the druid’s animal companion. If the druid ever replaces her animal companion, the new animal companion gains these bonus hit points.

**Oracle**: Add one spell known from the oracle spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the oracle can cast.

**[[Ranger]]**: Choose a weapon from the following list: claws, kukri, longbow, longsword, short spear, or shortbow. Add +1/2 on critical hit confirmation rolls made while using that weapon (maximum bonus of +4). This bonus does not stack with [[Critical Focus (Feat)|Critical Focus]].

**[[Rogue]]**: Add a +1/2 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks to feint and Sleight of Hands checks to pickpocket.

**Sorcerer**: Select one bloodline power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times equal to 3 + the sorcerer’s Charisma modifier. The sorcerer adds + 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that bloodline power.

## Racial Archetypes
**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetypes are available to catfolk.

**Cat Burglar (Rogue)**

Gifted with finesse and stealth, catfolk make excellent burglars. Cat burglars are masters of breaking and entering, using their feline grace to make it seem as though no crime was ever committed in the first place. Few locks can withstand skilled cat burglars, and such nimble rogues are capable of bypassing traps without activating them and enabling associates to do the same. A cat burglar has the following class features.

**Phantom Presence (Ex)**: At 4th level, a cat burglar masters stealthy movement and leaves no trace of her passing in dungeons and cities. While in dungeon and urban environments, she leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, though she can choose to leave behind a trail if she so desires. Furthermore, she can always choose to take 10 when making a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Trap Saboteur (Su)**: At 8th level, a cat burglar becomes a master of avoiding and manipulating traps and locks. She can attempt to open a lock as a standard action and takes 1/2 the normal amount of time to disable traps (minimum 1 round) . When she has bypassed a trap without disarming it, she can also choose to suppress its trigger for up to 1 minute. If she does, she can also choose to end this suppression prematurely as a free action. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Rogue Talents**: The following rogue talents complement the cat burglar archetype: fast stealth, quick disable (*Core Rulebook*); convincing fakes, dodge trap (*Advanced Race Guide*); fast picks (*Advanced Player’s Guide*); terrain mastery (*Ultimate Combat*).

**Advanced Talents**: The following advanced rogue talents complement the cat burglar archetype: another day, fast tumble (*Advanced Player’s Guide*); hide in plain sight (*Ultimate Combat*).

**Nimble Guardian (Monk)**

Some catfolk monks dedicate their graceful prowess to the defense of others, especially those dedicated to a similar ethos or who prove themselves as stalwart allies of the monk’s cause. A nimble guardian has the following class features.

**Defensive Aid (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus, a nimble guardian can interpose herself between one adjacent ally and an attack or damage dealt in an area of effect. If an adjacent  ally is the target of the attack or is required to make a Ref lex saving throw against a damaging effect, as an immediate action the nimble guardian can grant that ally a +4 circumstance bonus to AC or on the saving throw against the effect. The nimble guardian must use this ability before the attack roll or saving throw is made. The nimble guardian can only use this ability if he is wearing light or no armor. This ability replaces evasion.

**Nimble Reflexes (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a nimble guardian gains a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability replaces still mind.

**Defensive Mastery (Ex)**: At 5th level, a nimble guardian gains 3 additional uses of her defensive aid ability per day. Furthermore, if an ally that gained the benefit of a use of defensive aid succeeds her Reflex saving throw, and the effect still deals damage on a successful saving throw, the nimble guardian can spend 1 *ki* point to negate that damage. Doing so is not an action. This ability replaces purity of body.

**Guardian Feline (Su)**: At 7th level, a nimble guardian can transform himself into a feline creature by spending 2 *ki* points. The effect lasts for 1 hour or until the nimble guardian changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The chosen form must be some form of feline (cheetah, lion, etc.). This ability is otherwise identical to *[[Beast Shape II (Spell)|beast shape II]]*. At 9th level, this ability functions as *[[Beast Shape III (Spell)|beast shape III]].* This ability replaces wholeness of body.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 9th level, a nimble guardian gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.
