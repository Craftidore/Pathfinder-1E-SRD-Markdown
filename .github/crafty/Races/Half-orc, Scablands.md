Half-orc, scablands Humanoid +0 +2 Str, –2 Int, –2 Cha Barbarian Common, Orc

Because of their reputation among the more civilized

folk of the waste, half-orcs are often barred from trading,

which forces them to make do with whatever tools and

weapons they can construct for themselves. This draws

many half-orcs to the scablands, where the razor rocks

make for excellent axe blades and armor spikes. These

half-orcs have come to be known as scab-orcs.

Scab-orcs are identical to the half-orcs detailed in the

*Player’s Handbook,* except as noted below.

• Scab-orcs have low-light vision rather than darkvision.

• A scab-orc can go without water for two days (48 hours),

plus a number of hours equal to his Constitution score,

before beginning to experience the ill effects of thirst

(see Dehydration, page 15).

• Heat Endurance: Scab-orcs gain Heat Endurance (see

page 50) as a bonus feat.
