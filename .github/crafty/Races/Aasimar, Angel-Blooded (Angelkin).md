Angel-blooded aasimars—called angelkin by many— follow the righteous paths their celestial ancestors walked, and are as varied as angels in how they go about their virtuous duties, split evenly among those who embrace law, neutrality, or chaos. 

Of all the aasimars, angelkin are the type who perhaps most often clash with tieflings. Angelkin have difficulty embracing the idea of harmony when it comes to their corrupt cousins, and most see tieflings as embodiments of evil that can never be trusted. It takes extraordinary circumstances for most angelkin to cooperate with tieflings, and even then, alliances are rarely more than fleeting. 

Angelkin are commonly found in Varisia—due in large part to the free-roaming spirit of the native Varisians and their acceptance of signs of the divine—as well as large city centers such as Absalom and Oppara. Because many angelkin feel called to the life of a crusader or paladin, they can often be found in Andoran, fighting against oppression and slavery, as well as near the Worldwound, where they campaign against demons. 

Traits 

The following are race traits for angelkin. 

**Celestial Tracker**: You share the same talent for tracking evildoers that your angelic ancestor possessed. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks made to follow tracks. In addition, you treat trails as being up to 24 hours fresher than they actually are when using the Survival skill to follow tracks. 

**Planetar’s Visions**: Ever since you were a child, you’ve experienced vivid dreams of cutting down hordes of shrieking, twisted demons. Whenever you succeed at a critical hit with a melee weapon against an evil outsider, you ignore an amount of the outsider’s damage reduction (if any) equal to the critical multiplier of your weapon (this cannot reduce a creature’s damage reduction to below 0).
