# Wemic
## Overview
**Regions:** Anauroch, Shaar, Vilhon Reach, Western Heartlands.

**Racial Feats:** None, but wemics can acquire the Spirited Charge

and Trample feats (ignoring the prerequisites) and apply the

benefits to their own melee attacks.

**Racial Hit Dice:** 5d8.

**Level Adjustment:** +3

Wemics are centaurlike creatures with the upper torso of a

humanoid atop a lion’s broad shoulders. They are a proud and

noble people who may be the most skillful hunters in all Faerûn.

From head to rump, wemics are 10 to 12 feet long, and they

stand 6 to 7 feet tall from their front paws to the tops of their

heads. They weigh around 600 pounds. Dusky golden fur covers

them from head to tail. Their tails feature a brush of black hair,

and the males have a long black mane. Wemics’ faces are a mixture

of humanoid and leonine, and their golden eyes have the slitted

pupils of a cat. Their ears are set high on their heads. All six

of their limbs end in claws, but the ones on their hands and their

front paws are retractable.

Wemics remain children for only five years, and live about 40

years on average. Most wemics die in dangerous hunts on the

savanna long before age can take them.

Wemics have the same life expectancy and age categories as

half-orcs.

**History**

The wemics are a tribal people with no writing skills or interest

in recording history. Nature gave the wemics their hunting

grounds, so they fight tooth and claw against the civilizations

encroaching upon them from all sides. The wemics aren’t evil

and don’t want to hurt anyone in particular, but they do want

strangers to stay well clear of their hunting grounds and the

wemics’ plentiful prey.

Small tribes of wemics live in the arid plains of southern

Anauroch and the Shining Plains west of Turmish. However,

most wemics belong to large, nomadic tribes that roam vast

regions of the Shaar. Several times over the last few centuries,

Shaaran wemics have formed great hordes to drive off

encroaching human settlement, especially along the southern

frontiers of Unther and Mulhorand.

**Outlook**

Wemics live in harmony with

nature, uncivilized and proud of

it. They eschew the ways of

civilization, since they can’t

see why anyone would ever

want to live under a shingled

roof when she could have the sky

itself as her roof. Wemics are a

proud people, usually slow to anger,

but they have no patience for civilized

folk who take their lack of

familiarity with human society

for ignorance.

Wemics learn to hunt and

fight from a very young age.

Female wemics do most of the hunting.

The males sometimes lead the hunt, but more often they roam the

plains, protecting the pride from outside threats.

Adventuring wemics sometimes leave their remote homes to

see more of the world. They are fascinated by the colorful human

merchants who travel through their territory. With civilization

creeping closer to their hunting lands every year, some of the

more adventurous wemics realize that it’s in the interest of the

pride for them to learn everything they can about their neighbors

before it is too late.

WEMIC CHARACTERS

Close as they are to nature, there are many druids among the

wemics. They have no other spellcasters in their tribes, although

wemics that have spent some time in the “civilized” world have

sometimes picked up levels as various kinds of spellcasters. In

any case, the wemic’s favored class is, of course, barbarian.

**Wemic Society**

Life as a wemic is simple. Most of the day is spent playing

around, basking in the sun, or hunting for food.

In a single pride of wemics, there are usually 1 to 4 males, 2

to 12 females, and 1 to 6 cubs. The cubs are allowed to play freely

until they reach 5 years of age, at which point they are brought

out on their first hunt to make their first kill. Once they have

proven themselves, they are considered adults.

In these prides, the males spend the nights patrolling the area,

protecting the pride from any threats. They mostly sleep during

the day while the females hunt for food. The leader of the pride

is the strongest male. When he is eventually challenged and

removed from power, he usually wanders off to live alone or join

with other males who have left their prides for various reasons.

Sometimes prides join together to form a tribe that can defend

itself against a threat larger than a single pride could handle.

Older wemics eventually slow down too much and are picked

off from the pride by predators, much in the same way that a

wemic might cull a herd of antelope. This is considered the natural

order of things. Some older wemics, realizing that

they are slowing down the pride, instead wander

into the nearest humanoid community,

retiring from the pride but taking

up a whole new life elsewhere.

**Language**

**and Literacy**

Wemics normally speak Sylvan.

Wemics who interact with outsiders

pick up Common to hire

themselves as guides or scouts

in their homelands, or (more

often) to warn away settlers or

hunting parties trespassing on

wemic territory.

All wemics are illiterate,

except for those with a

player character class other

than barbarian.

**Abilities and**

**Racial Features**

Wemics have the following racial traits:

• +8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.

Strong, fast, and hardy, wemics do not care much for impressing

others outside their pride.

• Large: As Large creatures, wemics suffer a –1 size penalty on

attack rolls and AC. They also suffer a –4 size penalty on Hide

checks. However, they can use larger weapons than humans

can, and their lifting and carrying limits are twice those of

Medium-size characters.

• Wemic facing is 10 feet They have a reach of 5 feet.

• Wemic land speed is 40 feet .

• +4 natural armor.

• Darkvision 60 feet.

• Proficient with all simple weapons and shields.

• +8 racial bonus on Jump checks.

• Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A wemic has 5d8 racial Hit

Dice. A wemic character receives the maximum hit points for

his first monstrous humanoid Hit Die and rolls his other monstrous

humanoid Hit Dice normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from

class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit points

on his first class-level Hit Die. A wemic’s racial Hit Dice also

provide a +5 base attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +1, Ref

+4, and Will +4. Wemics with class levels add their class attack

bonus and save bonuses to their racial attack bonus and saves.

• Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A wemic’s monstrous humanoid Hit

Dice grant him skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum

1) ×8. Class skills for these skill points are Hide, Jump, Listen,

Move Silently, Spot, and Survival. A wemic does not get the ×4

multiplier for skill points acquired from his first class level.

• Monstrous Humanoid Feats: A wemic’s monstrous

humanoid Hit Dice grant him 2 feats. A typical wemic

chooses Alertness and Great Fortitude. A wemic with class

levels gains feats based on his total Hit Dice, as shown on

Table 2 in the Introduction.

• Natural Attacks: Wemics can make 2 claw attacks, dealing

1d6 points of damage each. A wemic can attack with a onehanded

weapon at his normal attack bonus, and make a claw

attack as a secondary attack (–5 penalty on the attack roll,

and half Strength bonus on the damage roll).

• Automatic Languages: Sylvan, Common. Bonus Languages:

By region.

• Favored Class: Barbarian.

• Level Adjustment: +3. Due to his 5 racial Hit Dice, his natural

attacks, and his racial skill bonus, a wemic has an effective

character level of 8 plus his class levels. Thus, a 5th-level

wemic barbarian would have an ECL of 13. See Table 1 in the

Introduction for more information.

**Wemic Deities**

Wemics worship Nobanion, the demigod of noble animals and

woodland creatures. Nobanion is a nature deity and may grant

spells to wemic druids and rangers. Some wemics are lured by the

feral bloodlust of Malar, and worship the Beastlord instead.

**Relations with Other Races**

Isolated as they are, wemics don’t have much of an opinion about

the other races. They prefer to deal with people who recognize

the sanctity of nature, but they are willing to guide just about

anyone through or around their homelands for the right deal.

**Wemic Equipment**

Wemics prefer to use clubs, spears, and large wooden shields.

They only use weapons they can make themselves.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Wemics hold a deep reverence for all animals, especially the

game animals they hunt most often. They are careful not to take

too many kills from the same herd, and never kill more than

they can eat. Wemics are enraged by humanoid hunters who slay

an animal for a small portion of its body, such as a rhino’s horn,

and then abandon the carcass.
