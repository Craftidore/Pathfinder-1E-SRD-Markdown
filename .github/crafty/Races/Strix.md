# Strix
## Overview
Human neighbors tell horrific tales of slaughter woven

with frightened suspicion when speaking of strix. Strix,

however, tell a tale of encroachment and a struggle for

land and resources. For ages, humans invaded strix lands

fighting bloody battles against the fierce, black-skinned

creatures they thought to be winged devils. Over time,

strix have developed a hatred for humankind and now

fiercely protect their dwindling numbers.

Strix Racial Traits

**+2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma**: Strix are swift and elusive, but

tend to be stubborn and swift to anger.

**Strix**: Strix are humanoids with the strix subtype.

**Medium**: Strix are Medium creatures and have no bonuses

or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed**: Strix have a base speed of 30 feet on land.

They also have a fly speed of 60 feet (average).

**Low-Light Vision**: Strix can see twice as far as humans in

conditions of dim light.

**Darkvision**: Strix can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Hatred**: Strix receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against

humanoid creatures with the human subtype because of

their special training against these hated foes.

**Nocturnal**: Strix gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception

and Stealth checks in dim light or darkness.

**Suspicious**: Strix receive a +2 racial bonus on saving

throws against illusion spells and effects.

**Languages**: Strix begin play speaking Strix. Those

with high Intelligence scores can choose from

the following: Auran, Common, Draconic, Giant,

Gnome, Goblin, Infernal.

**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of

existing strix racial traits. Consult your GM before

selecting any of these new options.

**Dayguard**: Familiar with watching over its tribe during

the day, the strix gains a +2 racial

bonus on Perception checks and

treats Perception as a class skill.

This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

**Frightening**: The strix looks particularly menacing

and use this to its advantage, gaining a +2 racial bonus on

Intimidate checks. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

**Nimble**: The strix receives a +1 racial bonus on Reflex

saves. This replaces the suspicious racial trait.

**Tough**: The strix receives a +1 racial bonus on Fortitude

saves. This racial trait replaces suspicious.

**Wing-Clipped**: The flight of wing-clipped strix is weaker

than normal, whether from deformity or injury. Their fly

speed is 20 feet (poor) instead of the normal fly speed, and

they must make a DC 30 Fly check to fly upward. Ostracized

by their tribes and forced to deal with other races, these

strix compensate for their weakness by gaining a +2 racial

bonus on Bluff, Climb, and Diplomacy checks.

**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all strix who have

the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the

bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Barbarian**: Add +1 to the barbarian’s total number of

rage rounds per day.

**Fighter**: Add +1/4 to the attack roll bonus from the strix’s

hatred racial trait.

**Monk**: Add +1/4 point to the monk’s *ki* pool.

**Ranger**: Add +1/2 round to the duration of the bonus

granted to the companions of the ranger using his hunter’s

bond ability.

**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetype is available to strix.

Airborne Ambusher (Fighter)

Driven by suspicion and hatred, strix doggedly guard their

territories, making deadly use of their flight. Using swift

strikes from above, strix plummet onto their foes with

lethal force.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An airborne ambusher

is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields.

**Class Skills**: An airborne ambusher adds Fly to his list of

class skills and removes Climb from his list of class skills.

**Combat Flyer (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an airborne ambusher

may use his fighter bonus feats to select Flyby Attack and

Hover. This replaces bravery.

**Aerobatics (Ex)**: At 5th level, an airborne ambusher

may make a Fly check instead of an Acrobatics check to

move through a threatened area or an enemy’s space. This

replaces weapon training 1.

**Flying Dodger (Ex)**: At 9th level, when an airborne

ambusher flies at least half its fly speed on its turn, it gains

a +1 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. This bonus increases

to +2 at 11th level and +4 at 17th level. This ability replaces

weapon training 2.

**Plummeting Charge (Ex)**: At 13th level, if an airborne

ambusher flies at least half its f ly speed as part of a

charge, it gains a +2 racial bonus on the attack roll (in

addition to the normal charge bonus) and a +4 bonus on

its critical confirmation roll. These bonuses improve to

+4 and +6 at 17th level. This replaces weapon training 3

and 4.

Hidden in their aeries high in the treacherous

tors of Cheliax’s Devil’s Perch region, strix

have long presented an enigmatic danger for

humans. Tales of vicious, territorial strix savagely killing

travelers who wander into their domain are common

fare told around campfires and tavern hearths. However,

the truth regarding strix, and the reasons behind their

insular and challenging nature, is more complex. Even

the name strix is a misnomer, for strix refer to themselves

as the itarii.

Strix have lived in the Devil’s Perch region since at least

the end of the Age of Darkness, but the history of their

people is shrouded in mystery by the upheaval of that

bleak time. Scholars and explorers alike have attempted

to understand these winged strangers since Aspex the

Even-Tongued first encountered them during the Even-

Tongued Conquest. Even now, centuries removed from

that unique moment of cooperation between human and

strix, little is known about this secretive people.

GENESIS

Somewhere beyond a veil of superstition and myth lies

the story of strix’s origin far across the Inner Sea: a tale

of subjugation and revolution, exile and hardship. This

truth is unknown to the strix of the Inner Sea region,

lost to thousands of years of darkness, ignorance, and

strife among their kind. Wherever they came from,

whatever truth is hidden in the stories passed down

among their people, the strix of Devil’s Perch may never

know. The fragmentary nature of strix history stems

from their tradition of oral storytelling and paucity

of accurate written record-keeping, especially in their

people’s ancient past. The further back strix history goes,

the more vague and incomplete the record becomes, as

metaphors and poetic fables fill the stories. Worse yet

for scholars is the fact that each clan of strix tells slight

variations of its origin story, with differing timelines.

Some variations imply that strix left their ancestral

home before the Age of Darkness, while others hold

that the coming of the Age of Darkness brought about

their exile. Still others suggests a gradual migration

over thousands of years, beginning just prior to the Age

of Darkness and ending before its close.

The most common telling of strix’s origin is spun as one

of jealousy and exile. Called Korrsat Akra in their tongue,

or “The Scattered Nest,” the story outlines a history of

strix as a powerful and prideful race of hunters living in

an ideal land called Sharat Ce-Ar, the Sky Garden. There

they flourished and cohabited with many other races as

equals, sharing all that they had in abundance. One such

race, known to strix only as the shokir, or “betrayers,” used

the strix’s trust and generosity against them. The shokir

are described as jealous creatures who envied strix’s

strength and beauty, and who possessed strange and

terrible powers that allowed them to conjure a violent,

magical storm that destroyed the sun and tore the strix

from Sharat Ce-Ar. The storm purportedly deposited the

strix in an inhospitable and remote wasteland, and the

shokir cursed the strix to walk this wasteland until the

sun ceased to rise in the sky.

Strix claim that while in these wilds, they lost their

beauty and grace, becoming twisted by the dark spaces

they inhabited until they came to act as little more than

beasts. The legend states that when darkness receded

from the skies and the sun shone again, they had

wandered so far that they came to lofty and forbidding

peaks. Atop these mountains, the strix settled and

found themselves returning to normalcy, their minds

no longer clouded with savagery. Strix believe that their

curse was lifted with the return of the sun, though the

effect the harsh wilderness had on their forms would

forever remain.

While strix have since developed written language, it

is highly uncommon among their people. Furthermore,

taboos against writing down their race’s history—which

they keep secret from outsiders—prevent it from being

recorded by the few who are capable of writing it down.

Curiously, paintings found in sea caves near Corentyn in

Cheliax appear to illustrate a version of the story told in

the Korrsat Akra and match the styles of ancient paintings

in high mountain caves in the southern reaches of the

Mindspin Mountains between Nidal and Molthune.

While there are no known strix settlements in this range,

scholars suggest that small bands of ancient strix may

have temporarily spread through these regions long ago.

They might also have migrated there from Devil’s Perch

and been met with hostility and violence that wiped out

any existing traces of their culture. Further evidence

contradicting the Korrsat Akra comes from images on

scrolls of a strange leather found in the library of Iadara in

Kyonin, depicting black-and-gray figures with immense

wings and mysterious masks taking part in society. These

ancient documents, dating back to the time of Earthfall,

have led to speculation of a relationship with winged

humanoids closely resembling strix among the people of

Azlant and the elves of Adarshavir. Some claim that the

figures represented in these scrolls are not strix at all,

but are instead depictions of the syrinx, fabled masters

of the strix who are said to live in towering aviary-cities

across the sea and to be responsible for making strix

what they are today.

Outside historical perspective on strix is limited to

the ancient cultures that may have dealt with the winged

folk. Records from the Jistka Imperium retrieved from

the ruins of Rachikan indicate that the Jistkans were

aware of the presence of a winged humanoid race in

Devil’s Perch, but after several attempts to make contact

failed, the efforts were abandoned. It was these records

that informed Aspex the Even-Tongued in his attempts

to contact and negotiate with the strix during the Even-

Tongued Conquest of 4081 ar when Cheliax battled

Taldor for independence. Historical records fail to

indicate the terms of Aspex’s arrangement with the strix

were, only relating that Aspex was able to convince them

to join the war against Taldor. Aspex then honored

their request to be left alone following the conclusion

of their limited aid. Honoring this request was made

easy by the fact that the rough terrain and the difficulty

of traversing the rugged land in great numbers meant

there was no push for humans to settle in Devil’s Perch.

In the centuries since Aspex’s contact with the strix,

few Chelaxians have had close dealings with the residents

of Devil’s Perch. Relations soured considerably with the

western expansion of Cheliax in unflinching defiance of

Aspex’s original agreement of noninterference with the

strix. Settlements close to Devil’s Perch, such as Pezzack,

have been attacked time and again when tensions between

the strix and locals reach a boiling point. These hostilities

further both the stereotype among humans that strix are

violent and unpredictable creatures and the stereotype

among strix that all outsiders are untrustworthy and

dangerous, allowing continued resentment to flourish.

(For a more detailed look at interactions between strix

and humans, see the Pathfinder Tales novel Nightglass by

Liane Merciel.)

ECOLOGY

While strix outwardly appear comparable to winged

elves in physiology, this similarity belies the fact that

strix’s inner working are far removed from the biology

of most humanoids. Strix share more in common

with birds—specifically owls—than they do with most

humanoid races. A strix’s eyes are not spherical, but

rather more like the elongated ocular tubes found in

most breeds of owls. This shape is a part of why strix

have such keen eyesight, but also leaves them unable

to move their eyes, resulting in a stare that is fixed in

their sockets. This requires strix to move their heads in

order to change their field of view, making them prone

to sudden and erratic head motions that are unsettling

to people unaccustomed to strix’s presence.

Strix’s eyes seem to be a solid red or deep yellow on

casual observation; however, this appearance is created by

a nictitating membrane over strix’s eyes—a third eyelid

that moves horizontally across the eyeball to close. This

milky white membrane protects the eyes from drying

out while in flight, and cleans their surfaces of dust and

debris. It also assists in strix’s ability to see in low-light

conditions, something essential for their nocturnal life

cycle. This eyelid is visible briefly when a strix blinks.

To casual observers, a strix’s eyes closely resemble those

of an elf, with enlarged irises that fill nearly the whole

socket and no visible sclera.

A strix’s diet consists primarily of whatever meat can be

hunted from the surrounding environment, supplemented

with collected berries and nuts when in season. Some strix

even eat the flesh of humanoids, but this rarity occurs

primarily in desperate times or among more sinister clans

as part of vile rites.

Childbearing is an important part of strix culture.

Dangerous living conditions and low birthrates keep

strix populations low, so every birth is met with a

celebration. Strix parents are ferociously protective of

their newborns, and entire clans rally around successful

births and help ensure that the young are given every

opportunity to survive and succeed. Mothers take over

the role as caregivers, though more often than not whole

clans come together to take part in raising the young.

Though they don’t recognize any official rites of

marriage, strix often choose one mate for life, and find

great difficulty in pairing again if separated by death. A

clan’s spiritual leader, or rokoa, is forbidden from taking

a mate because of centuries-old customs whose origins

are long forgotten. However, the rokoa is polyamorous

and participates in unions with multiple strix males.

While such events rarely produce offspring because

of the advanced age of most rokoa, those that do only

ever produce female strix who are raised by their entire

clan—this is seen as part of the clan’s duty to its rokoa.

These strix often mature to become powerful rokoa in

their own right.

SOCIETY

While strix’s Korrsat Akra has questionable historical

value, its importance to the development of strix society

is indisputable. The tale is used as justification for the

insular and xenophobic nature of strix society and the

close-knit, clannish nature of their social structure. Strix

have a firm belief that the only people they can trust are

themselves; a history of miscommunication, fear, and

outright betrayal has helped cement this notion. Hateful

toward humans for their centuries-long advance into

Devil’s Perch, strix have come to call the Chelish—and by

extension all humans—kotaara, a particularly distasteful

epithet. Strix view all humans through the lens of their

own society, believing that humanity is as close-knit

as strix culture, and that one human’s misdeeds are

representative of normal human behavior.

Roughly a dozen clans of strix live in the Devil’s Perch

region, each with its own culture and social taboos, yet

strix were not always so divided. As doubt and suspicion

became deeply ingrained in their culture, so too did the

smallest of slights between different clans come to be

perceived as part of a more grievous and impending

betrayal. These misunderstandings have resulted in

generations of cold relations between clans, and are

often the impetus of divergent clans splitting off to

achieve independence and escape perceived threats.

Deeply seated cynicism has created a complex system

of social cues and behaviors that clans utilize when

Hell's Rebels AP 5 The Kintargo Contract

(Paizo)

interacting with one another in order to ensure they are

received as being honest and sincere. The strix language

has many different forms of the word “honest” but only

a single word for “deceit.”

In spite of this complicated social web, strix are quick

to rally together when facing a threat from outside their

culture. Strix have a phrase that roughly translates to “the

blood of outsiders falls faster than the blood of kin”; it

reflects an important social contract among strix that all

conflicts between strix must be set aside when their kind

is confronted by an external threat or other injustice.

To those on the receiving end of a strix warband or

hunting party, this monolithic response supports the

misconception that strix are more of a united people

than they are in truth.

The hierarchy of strix culture is centered on each

clan’s rokoa, the matriarchal spiritual leader

and story-keeper of an entire clan. Rokoa

are chosen from among strix who are able

to form a bond with powerful patron spirits

and commune with them through animals,

typically via shamanism and witchcraft. A

rokoa is trained from a young age by the

clan’s current rokoa with the intention

of replacing her at her death. She learns her

clan’s oral history to the exclusion of all other

points of view, understanding that only her

clan’s perspective is “true.” Each clan often

has two or three rokoa in training at any

one time, and the eldest rokoa trainee

is almost always the one chosen to

replace the predecessor. It is a rokoa’s

job to appoint healers, midwives,

and other positions of importance

to a clan from among the most

trusted in the group. These

appointments always replace any

extant members of the clan in

these positions, and frequently

occur when a rokoa dies and her

appointed trainee assumes her

role. Unlike in other societies,

strix do not typically perceive

being removed from one of

these prestigious positions during the

changing of rokoa as a slight. Rather, it is

viewed as an honor, a reward for diligently

performing one’s duty to the clan.

The rokoa serves as the ultimate arbiter

of justice within strix society. Though

most interpersonal conflicts are

settled without the intercession

of the clan’s spiritual leader, some

offenses merit such scrutiny. Two

crimes in particular warrant the

harshest of punishments from a rokoa. In the extremely

rare instance of a strix murdering another of his kind, he

is labeled a paashrat or “less than dead.” Such criminals

are cursed by their rokoa, their wings are amputated,

and they’re hobbled and left for dead in the lowlands of

Devil’s Perch. In some clans, dealing with outsiders or

divulging secrets of strix society, such as the details of

the Korrsat Akra, are also unforgivable acts. Betrayal of

this nature results in the offending strix being labeled a

navaatra, or “forsaken.” Navaatra are branded or scarred on

their faces, and exiled from Devil’s Perch. They are never

spoken of by their names in any clans after their exile,

as if they had never existed. Some clans have taken to

the practice of clipping the wings of navaatra, making it

more difficult for them to fly and further distinguishing

their appearances. Navaatra who return to strix territory

are killed on sight.

Most strix don’t expend

much effort on worshiping

particular gods, and instead

view religion through the

same lens of distrust and

suspicion through which

they view society. They

see themselves as a cursed

race, and believe that the

storm that carried them

from their homeland to

deposit them where they

now live also carried them

from the world of the

gods. Now they rely on the

strength and power of their

ancestors, retelling their

stories in order to make the

clans strong and wise. They

believe that only through

understanding their own

circumstances and respecting

their ancestors’ lives will they find

freedom from this ancient curse.

A clan’s rokoa is the closest thing a

strix clan has to a religious leader, and

members accept that the rokoa may

channel or otherwise have access to

the stories and memories of strix who

came before.

Perhaps as a result of their lack

of religion, strix view death with

a sense of finality at odds with

their intellectual knowledge of the

afterlife and the cycle of souls. The

death of a strix is viewed with

great sadness and remembrance.

the burial of the dead in rich

soil so that their remains can

give back to the land, which will in

turn give back to strix. The bones

of dead strix are retrieved after

nature has cleaned them and handed

down to the surviving family members. These

bones are fashioned into weapons, talismans, and

fetishes. Few natural materials are both as strong

and as light as a strix’s bones. Mourning periods for

strix can last weeks and are observed by all members

of the deceased’s clan, and often neighboring clans as

well—death, like an outside threat, is an event that can

unite the normally fractious strix clans. Inversely, strix

treat the bodies of kotaara with contempt, leaving them

to rot where they fall.

While strix acknowledge that the spirits of some of

their kind linger in the world after death as undead, they

see undead as dedicated members of their respective

clans who refused to succumb to death, rather than

aberrations of the natural cycle. While no contemporary

examples are known to exist, legends persist among

the strix that tell of an ancient clan called the Katesh,

“Those Who Remember,” whose members transformed

themselves into vampires. Strix believe the Katesh

attempted to claim dominance among the clans, but

the combined power of several rokoa resisted their

aggression and drove the Katesh from Devil’s Perch. Not

all strix clans acknowledge this tale, however, and no

historical evidence exists to support the myth.

Strix’s language is a creole of Infernal and Azlanti.

People capable of speaking either Infernal or Azlanti are

thus able to engage in basic communication with strix,

though the nuances of this complex language are largely

lost on foreign speakers. The historical roots of this

creole tongue are a mystery. There is no record of the

language’s evolution over the millennia, but the

strix claim it changes rapidly, as they frequently

add new terminology and honorifics concocted

among multiple clans, suggesting that the

contemporary strix language spoken in the

Devil’s Perch area and the tongue they spoke

before their exodus to Avistan are unlikely

to be mutually intelligible.

LAIRS

Most strix settlements are constructed

vertically, built both inside and outside

the stone spires common in the Devil’s Perch area.

While each clan has its own aesthetic for carving rock

and working wood and stone, most of these aeries share

a common architectural theme that relies on flight for

navigation from structure to structure. Some clans

construct external nest-hives from sinew, leather, vines,

and other salvaged materials, while clans with access

to softer stone, metal tools, or specialized magic carve

out dwellings inside natural caves. Strix typically sleep

indoors during daytime hours in individual roosts.

They carve these roosts into preexisting stone or make

them out of shaped wood, then pad them with leather,

hide, and animal fur. A strix roost is a depression

analogous in shape to that of a hollow in a tree. Strix

sleep in a fetal position with their wings folded around

themselves and their faces hidden. When endangered

or threatened with constant attack, strix disperse

their roosts to prevent the slaughter of multiple

sleeping strix. While strix are nocturnal, every clan

keeps dayguards to watch over sleepers.

Social spaces for strix are typically found atop high

rock towers or mountaintops in remote areas difficult to

reach on foot. These inaccessible places are adorned with

statuary, woodcarvings, scrimshaw, and other art dating

back to the clan’s founding. In caves near the top of these

rocky spires, rokoa tell the stories of their clans and

artisans adorn the smoothed walls with cave paintings,

adding to or adjusting faded, ancient images left by

their ancestors. The open spaces atop the rocky pillars

are often used for concerts in which strix musicians

play haunting notes on their ashikans, wind instruments

carved from horn or shaped wood. Drums and other

Hell's Rebels AP 5 The Kintargo Contract

(Paizo)

jingling percussion instruments accompany these

performances, and the songs can be heard for miles.

Because of such sites’ inaccessibility, such distant notes

are most non-strix’s only exposure to strix’s appreciation

for art and history.

STRIX ON GOLARION

The most famous strix settlement in the Inner Sea region

is Ciricskree, located in Devil’s Perch in western Cheliax.

While it is common knowledge that strix inhabit many

regions within Devil’s Perch, the exact number of strix

and clans has never been recorded; it is estimated that

only a thousand or so of their kind exist on Avistan’s

shores. Stories of hidden strix settlements along Cheliax’s

western coast beyond Devil’s Perch are favored yarns of

sailors and soldiers alike, though such strix settlements

remain elusive.

For generations, rumors have claimed that some

strix live beyond the borders of Cheliax within the

remote Napsune Mountains in Rahadoum. A sighting

tends to crop up once every generation, leading to a

frenzied rush by monster hunters and scholars alike to

track down these elusive creatures. No search for strix

in Rahadoum has ever turned up substantial evidence

to support their existence, and many believe these

sightings are of different creatures altogether. If strix do

live in the warm and rocky mountains, they have done

an exceptional job of hiding their presence, and are

either unknown to the strix of Cheliax or purposefully

forgotten outcasts.

If strix’s ancient stories are true, large numbers of

strix can be found across the Arcadian Ocean on the

continent of Arcadia. Some of these strix may still be

thralls of the enigmatic syrinx.
