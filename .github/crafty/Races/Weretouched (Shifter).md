# Weretouched (Shifter)
## Overview
Shifters, sometimes called “the weretouched,” are

descended from humans and natural lycanthropes,

now nearly extinct on Khorvaire. Shifters cannot fully

change shape but can take on animalistic features—a state

they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique race

that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its own

traditions and identity.

**Personality:** The personality and behavior of

shifters are infl uenced by their animal natures. Many

are boorish and crude, while others are quiet, shifty,

and solitary. Just as most lycanthropes are carnivores,

shifters have a predatory personality and think of most

activities in terms of hunting and prey. They view survival

as a challenge, striving to be self-reliant, adaptable,

and resourceful.

**Physical Description:** Shifters are basically humanoid

in shape, but their bodies are exceptionally lithe.

They often move in a crouched posture, springing and

leaping while their companions walk normally alongside.

Their faces have a bestial cast, with wide, fl at noses,

large eyes and heavy eyebrows, pointed ears, and long

sideburns (in both sexes). Their forearms and lower legs

grow long hair, and the hair of their heads is thick and

worn long.

**Relations:** Many races feel uncomfortable around

shifters, the same way they feel around any large predator.

Of course, some grow to appreciate individual

shifters despite their natural aversion, and halfl ings in

general get along well with them. For their part, shifters

are accustomed to distrust and don’t expect better treatment

from members of the other races, although some

shifters try to earn respect and companionship through

acts and deeds.

**Alignment:** Shifters are usually neutral, viewing

the struggle to survive as more important than moral or

ethical concerns about how survival is maintained.

**Shifter Lands:** Shifters have no land of their own.

Being descended from human stock, they live in human

lands. Unlike changelings, however, shifters often live in

rural areas away from the crowded spaces of the cities. They

are most commonly encountered in the Eldeen Reaches

and other remote areas that can be found in all the nations.

Many shifters earn their way as trappers, hunters, fi shers,

trackers, guides, and military scouts.

**Dragonmarks:** The fact that none of the dragonmarked

houses includes shifters cements their place outside

the mainstream of society.

**Religion:** Most shifters incline toward the druidbased

religion of the Eldeen Reaches, believing in the divine

power of the earth itself, the elements, and the creatures of

the earth. Those shifters who revere the pantheon of the

Sovereign Host are drawn toward the deities Balinor and

Boldrei, while other shifters follow the Traveler. Shifters

rarely worship the Silver Flame.

**Language:** Shifters speak Common and rarely

learn other languages.

**Names:** Shifters use the same names as humans, often

ones that sound rustic to city-dwellers.

**Adventurers:** Moving from the rugged, self-reliant

life of a shifter trapper or hunter to an adventuring life is

not a big step. Many shifters fi nd themselves embarking on

adventuring careers after something happens to disrupt

their everyday routines—a monstrous incursion into their

village or forest, for example, or a guide job gone sour.

SHIFTER RACIAL TRAITS

• Shapechanger Subtype: Shifters are humanoids with

the shapechanger subtype.

• +2 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma: Shifters

are lithe and agile, but their fundamental bestial

nature detracts from both their reasoning ability and

their social interaction.

• Medium: As Medium creatures, shifters have no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

• Shifter base land speed is 30 feet.

• Shifting (Su): A shifter can tap into her lycanthropic

heritage to gain short bursts of physical power. Once

per day, a shifter can enter a state that is superfi cially

similar to a barbarian’s rage. Each shifter has one of

six shifter traits—characteristics that manifest themselves

when a character is shifting. Each shifter trait

provides a +2 bonus to one of the character’s physical

ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution)

and grants some other advantage as well. Shifter traits

are described in the following section.

Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of

rounds equal to 3 + the shifter’s Con modifi er. (If a

shifter trait or other effect increases the character’s Con

modifi er, use the newly improved modifi er.) A shifter

can take feats to improve this ability. These shifter feats

are described in Chapter 3: Heroic Characteristics.

Every shifter feat a character takes in creases

the duration of shifting by 1 round. For

every two shifter feats a character

takes, the number of times per

day she can tap into the ability

increases by one. So, a character

with two shifter feats can shift two times per day

(instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability

lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3)

+ the shifter’s Con modifi er.

Shifting, though related to and developed from

lycanthropy, is neither an aff liction nor a curse.

It is not passed on by bite or claw attacks, and a

shifter can’t be cured—shifting is a natural ability

for the race.

• Low-Light Vision: Shifters can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

• +2 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks: A shifter’s animalistic heritage enhances many of her physical skills.

• Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages:

Elven, Gnome, Halfling, and Sylvan.

• Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass shifter’s ranger class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

**Shifter Traits**

Each shifter has one of the following special traits, which is selected when a character is created and cannot be changed thereafter.

**Beasthide (Su):** While shifting, a beasthide shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and natural armor that provides a +2 bonus to AC.

**Longtooth (Su):** While shifting, a longtooth shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows fangs that can be used as a natural weapon, dealing 1d6 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with a successful bite attack. She cannot attack more than once per round with her bite, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can use her bite as a secondary attack (taking a –5 penalty on her attack roll) while wielding a weapon.

**Cliffwalk (Su):** While shifting, a cliffwalk shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and has a climb speed of 20 feet.

**Razorclaw (Su):** While shifting, a razorclaw shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with each successful attack. She can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). She can not attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in her primary hand, but all her attacks in that round take a –2 penalty.

**Longstride (Su):** While shifting, a longstride shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a bonus of +10 feet to her base land speed.

**Wildhunt (Su):** While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights.

A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait.

When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source isn’t revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source’s location.

While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to fi nd or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

When not shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus on Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.
