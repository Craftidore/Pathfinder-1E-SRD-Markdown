**Peri-Blooded (Emberkin)** 

*Masters of fire magic, emberkin feel the dual pull of their peri forebear as well as that of a fallen angel further down their ancestry, and wrestle with their urges to do both good and evil.*

**Alternate Spell-Like Ability** Emberkin gain *pyrotechnics* as a spell-like ability. 

Emberkin reveal their divine heritage through their skill with fire-based magic and their desire to repent for others’ sins. Many emberkin suffer from frequent nightmares and strange impulses to commit spontaneous acts of evil. They typically have igneous features such as wispy auburn hair and bright yellow eyes, and a rare few are born with albino skin. 

Emberkin often feel an insatiable need to continually perform acts of good. Some are content to perform small acts of kindness at home, though they may feel driven to travel regularly in order to find pockets of true evil that they can eradicate. Emberkin can often be found in tumultuous regions such as Cheliax, Galt, and the Shackles, where they combat injustice in its myriad forms. 

Like all aasimars, emberkin are not necessarily compelled to embrace good and justice. Perhaps more so than most of their celestial kith, emberkin have a propensity to revolt against their benevolent predisposition and instead follow a darker path. Perhaps these emberkin are evil by nature, or perhaps it is a remnant of their fallen angel ancestry. Either way, such wicked individuals are often dangerous, and are both pitied and hunted down by their aasimar brethren. 

Traits 

The following are race traits for emberkin. 

**Burnished Skin**: Sometime during your adolescence, you suffered severe burns in a devastating fire. Along with your scars, you developed the uncanny ability to tell what is and isn’t real, gaining a +2 trait bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve illusions. 

**Pyromancer**: You’re especially adept at casting flame-based spells. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls for any spell you cast with the fire descriptor. Spells that do not deal damage do not benefit from this trait.
