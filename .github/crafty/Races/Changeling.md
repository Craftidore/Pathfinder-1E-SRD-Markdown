# Changeling
## Overview
Changelings are the offspring of hags and their lovers taken through magic or madness. Dropped off on doorsteps of prospective foster parents, changelings are raised by strangers. Typically tall, slender, dark haired, and attractive, changelings otherwise resemble their fathers’ race. They are always female, and their mismatched colored eyes and abnormally pale skin hint at their true heritage. At puberty, changelings receive “the call,” a hypnotic spiritual voice that beckons them to travel and discover their true origins. Changelings who ignore this call choose their own destiny; those who heed it discover their “mother” and may come into great power by transforming into hags themselves.

Changeling Racial Traits

**+2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution:** Changelings are frail, but are clever and comely.

**Medium:** Changelings are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Humanoid:** Changelings are humanoids with the changeling subtype.

**Normal Speed:** Changelings have a base speed of 30 feet.

**Hag Racial Trait:** The changeling inherits one of the following racial traits, depending on her mother’s hag type:

*Hulking Changeling (Annis Hag):* The changeling gains a +1 racial bonus on melee damage.

*Green Widow (Green Hag):* The changeling gains a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks against creatures that are sexually attracted to her.

*Sea Lungs (Sea Hag)*: The changeling may hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times her Constitution before she risks drowning.

**Claws:** Changelings’ fingernails are hard and sharp, granting them two claw attacks (1d4 points of damage each).

**Natural Armor:** Changelings have a +1 natural armor bonus.

**Darkvision:** Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Languages:** Changelings begin play speaking Common and the primary language of their host society. Changelings with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Orc.

**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing changeling racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Mist Child**: When the changeling has concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of attacks against her increases by 5%. This racial trait replaces hulking changeling.

**Object of Desire**: The changeling adds +1 to her caster

level when casting *charm person* and *charm monster*. This

replaces green widow.

**Ocean’s Daughter**: The changeling gains a +1 trait bonus on Swim checks. She automatically succeeds at Swim checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from swimming. This racial trait replaces sea lungs.

**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all changelings who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Oracle**: Add +1/2 to the oracle’s level for the purpose of determining the effects of the oracle’s curse ability. 

**Rogue**: The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.

**Witch**: Add one spell from the witch spell list to the witch’s familiar. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level she can cast. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, the new familiar knows these bonus spells.

**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetype is available to changelings.

**Dreamweaver (Witch)**

A changeling dreamweaver draws upon her hag heritage to ply the dream realms in order to touch mortal minds and souls, for good or ill. A dreamweaver witch has the following class features.

**Class Skills:** The dreamweaver adds Sense Motive to her list of class skills and removes Healing from her list of class skills.

**Patron:** A dreamweaver’s patron is normally portents or stars (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 83*).

**Spells:** A dreamweaver replaces some of her patron’s spells with the following: 2nd—*sow thoughts* (see below),

4th—*dust of twilight (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide)*,

6th—*deep slumber*, 8th—*modify memory*, 10th—*dream*, 12th—*cloak of dreams (Advanced Player’s Guide)*, 14th—*ethereal jaunt*, 16th—*moment of prescience*, 18th—*astral projection*.

**Dream Spinner (Su):** At 2nd level, when a dreamweaver casts a mind-affecting spell on a target that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast, she adds +1 to the mind-affecting spell’s DC. If the target succeeds at the saving throw against the spell, it does not wake up, nor does it have any recollection of having resisted a spell. If appropriate, the dreamweaver may incorporate elements of a mind-affecting spell (i.e., sow thought, suggestion, and so on) into the target’s subconscious so it believes the spell’s effects originated in its dreams (the details of how these elements fit into the dream is up to the GM). This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 2nd level.

**Dream Thief (Su):** At 6th level, a dreamweaver can alter the sleeping mind of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. She can reshape one of the target’s memories as if using modify memory. Alternatively, she may insert herself into the dreaming memories of the target, prompting the target’s mind to show her some specific information; the dreamer’s subconscious may resist, or try to deceive her with out-ofcontext memories, similar to the way a corpse can resist when questioned with speak with dead. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch’s hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 6th level.

**Dream Possession (Su):** At 10th level, a dreamweaver can take control of any creature that is sleeping because of her slumber hex or a spell she cast. This effect functions as *magic jar*, using the witch’s familiar acting as the soul receptacle. A Will save negates either effect (DC equal to that of the witch’s hex). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. This ability replaces the witch’s hex gained at 10th level.

**Hexes:** The following hexes complement the dreamweaver archetype: charm, slumber (*Advanced Player’s Guide*); beast of ill-omen (*Ultimate Magic*).

**Major Hexes:** The following major hexes complement the dreamweaver archetype: nightmare, vision (*Advanced Player’s Guide*).

**Grand Hexes:** The following major hexes complement the dreamweaver archetype: eternal slumber (*Advanced Player’s Guide*); dire prophecy (*Ultimate Magic*).
