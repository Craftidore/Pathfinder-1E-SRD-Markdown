# Gathlain
## Overview
According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples awakened in the First World, the primal realm of the fey. Gathlains grow from the seeds of an enormous magical tree—seeds that often drift for hundreds of miles before developing into adolescent gathlains, with the tree’s mistletoe grown into their flesh to form their strange wings. Despite being born with a basic understanding of their world, gathlains are inquisitive to a fault. They are known to be invaluable guides and knowledgeable explorers, if one can put up with their numerous questions and strange japes. 

**Physical Description:** Wings of wood and vines grow out of the bodies of these lithesome fey. Gathlains prefer to wear a mix of clothing, with a base of natural materials like grass skirts or simply woven tunics combined with bits of finery gathered from a variety of sources. 

**Society:** Gathlain society is built around art, discovery, experimentation, and storytelling. These fey constantly seek new ways to look at the world. Gathlain leaders are often popular explorers followed primarily as idols worth emulating and as sources of intriguing gossip. Although gathlains tend to engage in raucous romances born of melodramatic or fanciful encounters, they do not procreate conventionally from such pairings, even when the two happen to be of different physical sexes. Gathlains show little interest in gender, finding it quaint when other races use it as a basis for assigning roles or choosing partners. 

**Relations:** Gathlains associate with a variety of other fey as freely as among their own kind. These mixed communities of fey are called courts and feature elaborate titles for those members deemed most interesting or most worthy of admiration. When a gathlain chooses to join a different community, it is generally a temporary membership, whether it lasts only a season or persists for decades. Adventuring gathlains frequently seek out and attempt to mingle with like-minded gnomes; however, gnomes often find gathlains too flighty, foolish, and undisciplined for their tastes. 

**Alignment and Religion:** Mischievous and capricious, gathlains have discordant temperaments. Most are chaotic, and they tend to be morally neutral. The typical gathlain finds mortal religions strange; like many fey, they trade respect and token offerings to godlike fey in exchange for protection, but they see little difference between that and offerings to lesser kings and queens. 

**Adventurers:** Gathlains strive to entertain themselves and sate their immense curiosity about the world around them, and those who decide to become adventurers often migrate to the Material Plane to explore. Those who remain in the First World seek the strangest parts of their home plane and try to learn about its most unusual inhabitants. They favor spellcasting classes and skilled classes such as bard or rogue. 

**Names:** Gathlains lack gender-specific names, but instead attempt to create unique names for each individual. Some examples are Agollia, Armath, Arnonwy, Brazial, Dwynnen, Eirgara, Finnath, Gummow, Inirha, Marcanth, Nirialu, Sollowy, Tiltiu, and Urhiod.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**ALTERNATE RACIAL TRAITS** 

The following racial traits can be selected in place of the typical gathlain racial traits. 

**Flighty:** Some gathlains are too easily distracted to miss anything going on around them. They gain [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] as a class skill and gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against patterns and effects that cause the [[Fascinated|fascinated]] condition. 

This replaces natural armor. 

**Honey Whisperer:** Some gathlains keep bees of all sizes, collecting their honey and sometimes even riding the largest of them. They can use [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] and wild empathy to influence vermin as if they were animals with an Intelligence score of 1. 

This replaces natural armor.

**Intense Curiosity:** Some gathlains habitually fixate on someone or something nearby and examine its every detail. When taking 20 on the check, they gain a +4 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to find and follow tracks and to predict the weather. 

This replaces spell-like abilities. 

**Otherworldly Gossip:** Many gathlains excitedly share every last bit of gossip they can find. These gathlains gain a +2 racial bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information and on checks with one [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill of the gathlain’s choice. Once the choice of [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill is made, it can’t be changed. 

This replaces spell-like abilities. 

**Titled:** Certain gathlains play at the games of courtly intrigue that dominate much of First World culture, assuming titles that other fey may or may not recognize. These gathlains treat Bluff, Diplomacy, and Knowledge (nobility) as class skills. 

This replaces the *feather step* spell-like ability. 

**Tree-Born:** Some gathlains take after their tree ancestors, standing more firmly but moving more slowly. They have no Constitution penalty but have a base speed of 20 feet and a fly speed of 30 feet (clumsy maneuverability). 

This replaces the penalty to Constitution and alters speed. 

**Tree Dialect:** A rare few gathlains are born with the knowledge of an ancient way of speech that allows them to communicate with trees. Once per day, they can cast *speak with plants* (trees only) as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the gathlain’s character level. 

This replaces spell-like abilities.

## Favored Class Options
**GATHLAIN FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS** 

The following options are available to all gathlains characters who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward. 

**Barbarian:** Add 1/4 to the barbarian’s damage reduction. If the barbarian would not otherwise have damage reduction, this damage reduction can be bypassed by cold iron. 

**Bard:** Add one spell from the druid spell list to the bard’s spell list and known spells. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the bard can cast. 

**Bloodrager:** Add 1 additional round of bloodrage per day. 

**Cavalier:** Add a +1/2 bonus to the cavalier’s Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (nobility) checks relating to fey courts and fey courtiers. 

**Druid:** Add a +1/2 bonus to wild empathy checks. 

**Hunter:** The hunter’s animal companion gains DR 1/cold iron. Each time the hunter gains another level, this DR increases by 1/3 (maximum DR 5/cold iron). If the hunter replaces this animal companion, the new companion gains this damage reduction. 

**Ranger:** Add 1/4 to the damage dealt by the ranger’s animal companion’s natural attacks. 

**Rogue:** Add a +1/2 bonus to Bluff checks to pass secret messages or create a distraction to hide and on Sleight of Hands checks to pickpocket. 

**Shaman:** Add one spell from the druid spell list to the shaman’s spell list. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the shaman can cast. 

**Skald:** Add a +1/2 bonus to Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity and to Perform checks while performing a raging song. 

**Summoner:** Add 1/4 evolution point to the eidolon’s evolution pool. These bonus evolution points must be spent on evolutions that grant spell-like abilities or protect the eidolon from spells. 

**Witch:** Add one spell from the druid spell list to the witch’s familiar. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the witch can cast. If the familiar is ever replaced, the new familiar knows these bonus spells.

## Racial Archetypes
**GATHLAIN ARCHETYPES** 

These archetypes are typically only taken by gathlains, but members of other races, with the GM’s permission, can take them as well. 

**Fey Courtier (Bard Archetype)** 

Fey who associate with courts often become bards skilled at navigating the inhuman societies of the trackless wilds. **Bardic Performance:** The fey courtier has access to the following bardic performances. *Scorn of the Wilds (Sp):* At 8th level, the fey courtier can use bardic performance to permanently mark a creature with nature’s displeasure by spending 2 rounds performing while the target remains within 30 feet. The performance includes a litany of the target’s misdeeds against fey and nature. Unless the target succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the bard’s level + his Charisma modifier), it is cursed as per *nature’s exile*APG or *bestow curse.* At 14th level, the fey courtier’s options expand to include *baleful polymorph* and *green caress*HA. As part of the performance, the fey courtier must define a condition under which the curse will be lifted, which must relate to making amends for the crime against fey or nature and cannot be suicidal to carry out. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to the fey courtier’s scorn of the wild for 24 hours. This is a curse effect. This replaces dirge of doom and frightening tune. *Stone Dance (Sp):* At 15th level, the bard’s performance can move even the features of the natural world. This performance functions as *animate plants* (DC = 10 + half the bard’s level + his Charisma modifier) except it can also animate unworked stone and water from natural bodies of water (with statistics equivalent to an appropriate plant). 

This replaces inspire heroics. 

**Fey Contacts:** At 2nd level, thanks to his fey contacts and knowledge of the byzantine trade customs of the fey courts, a fey courtier can treat any wilderness area with fey residents as a settlement with a certain base value and purchase limit based on his bard level for the purpose of buying and selling magic items. See page 205 of the *Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide* for rules on settlement base values and purchase limits. The fey courtier can also use these contacts to gather information about the residents, geography, and nearby areas with Diplomacy. 

This replaces versatile performance.


| **Bard Level** | **Base Value** | **Purchase Limit** |
|---|---|---|
| 2nd | 50 gp | 500 gp |
| 6th | 500 gp | 2,500 gp |
| 10th | 2,000 gp | 10,000 gp |
| 14th | 8,000 gp | 50,000 gp |
| 18th | 32,000 gp | 200,000 gp |

**Summon Fey Allies:** At 3rd level, the fey courtier gains Augment Summoning as a bonus feat and can call upon natural allies who owe him favors. He adds *summon nature’s ally I* to his list of 1st-level bard spells known. Whenever he gains access to another spell level, he adds the next-higher *summon nature’s ally* spell to his list of bard spells known. The fey courtier adds the following creatures to the summon nature’s ally list: 1st—grimple (gremlin), mite, sprite; 2nd—atomie, fuath (gremlin), nixie; 3rd—leprechaun, nuglub (gremlin), pooka; 4th—kelpie, korred, twigjack; 5th—lampad, lurker in light, swan maiden; 6th—cold rider, oceanid, sangoi. 

This replaces inspire competence. 

**Season Sage (Druid Archetype)**

 Season sages wander as the seasons change, turning the leaves and transforming nature as they pass and taking pleasure in the transition between seasons. 

**Season’s Touch (Su):** At 4th level, a season sage can infuse living things with the essence of a season with a touch, causing them to manifest the changes associated with that season—for example, a touch of winter can make some animals grow a thick winter coat, while a touch of summer can make them shed. A touch of autumn would make a deciduous tree’s leaves change colors, a touch of winter would make its leaves fall, and a touch of spring would make it put forth new leaves. In addition, a season sage can use the following abilities (in any combination) a total number of times per day equal to 1 + his Wisdom modifier. 

This replaces wild shape. 

*Vernal Growth:* A touched living creature gains the effects of *enlarge person* (even if it is not a humanoid) for 1 minute per druid level. A touched non-creature plant likewise doubles in all dimensions for the same duration. 

*Summer Might:* A touched creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute per druid level. 

*Autumn Rot:* A touched creature or object made of plant matter takes 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 druid levels. 

*Winter Frost:* A touched creature or object takes 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 druid levels. 

**Season’s Veil (Su):** At 6th level, a season sage can radiate an aura of seasonal power as a standard action once per day. This affects a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the season sage and lasts in that area for 10 minutes, regardless of where the season sage moves afterward. At 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the season sage can use this ability an additional time per day. At 10th level, the radius increases to 40 feet. 

*Vernal Bloom:* The area surges with life. Plants form vibrant, heavy undergrowth (see page 426 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*) while in the aura. If the area can support plants, a circle of minor plants lingers afterward. At 8th level, the season sage can affect the area with *plant growth* as a swift action at will, which can linger after the aura passes. 

*Summer Heat:* The area of effect is treated as if it were under the effects of extreme heat. At 8th level, as a swift action the season sage can have the area deal 1d6 points of fire damage each round to other creatures in the area. 

*Autumn Squall:* The area is filled with fog, rain, and blown leaves. All creatures in the area gain concealment (abilities to specifically see through fog or rain don’t apply). At 8th level, the season sage can affect the area with *diminish plants* as a swift action at will, which also lingers after the aura passes. 

*Winter Chill:* The area of effect is treated as if it were under the effects of extreme cold. At 8th level, as a swift action the season sage can have the area deal 1d6 points of cold damage each round to other creatures in the area. 

**Season Mastery (Sp):** At 12th level, a season sage can cast *control weather* as a spell-like ability once per day; his choice of effects is not limited by the season. 

**Fey Prankster (Rogue Archetype)** 

Fey pranksters specialize in tricking others to teach a lesson or for their own entertainment. 

**Treacherous Plants (Sp):** The fey prankster can cause plants to distract nearby creatures. To use this ability, the fey prankster attempts a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide as a swift action or to feint against an adjacent opponent as a move action, so long as the target is adjacent to plants. He gains a bonus on this check equal to half his rogue level (minimum +1). 

This replaces trapfinding. 

**Improved Dirty Trick:** At 2nd level, the fey prankster gains Improved Dirty TrickAPG as a bonus feat. He need not meet the prerequisites. 

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 2nd level. 

**Steal Appearance (Sp):** At 4th level, the fey prankster can exchange the appearance of two adjacent items of the same size. He can also exchange the appearance of two creatures if at least one is willing and both are adjacent. Affecting an unwilling creature or an item it wears or carries requires a successful dirty trickAPG combat maneuver against that creature. If he succeeds, the objects or creatures are each disguised as the other as if with *veil* cast at his rogue level. The Will save DC to resist or disbelieve the illusion is equal to 10 + half the rogue’s level + his Intelligence modifier. At 8th level, the fey prankster can also exchange the locations of the two targets by succeeding at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. If he succeeds, observers can’t tell which is the original based on movement without succeeding at a Perception check against his Sleight of Hand result. 

This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge. 

**Greater Dirty Trick:** At 6th level, the fey prankster gains Greater Dirty TrickAPG as a bonus feat. He does not need to meet the prerequisites. 

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 6th level. 

**Plant Traps (Su):** At 8th level, the fey trickster can modify a plant (but not plant creatures) into a trap as a full-round action up to three times per day. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for the trap are each equal to 15 + his rogue level. A Tiny or larger plant can be used to perform a trip or dirty trickAPG combat maneuver using the fey trickster’s CMB and the plant’s size. A Large or larger plant can be used to create a *snare* as per the spell. The save DC is equal to 12 + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier. The fey trickster can trigger any plant trap he created as a standard action as long as he is within 60 feet of it. 

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level. 

**Unseen Trickster:** At 12th level, the fey trickster can attempt Stealth checks in areas with plants even if he does not have cover or concealment. 

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.
