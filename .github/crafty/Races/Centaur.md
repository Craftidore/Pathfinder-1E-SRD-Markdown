# Centaur
## Overview
**Regions:** Chondalwood, Dalelands, Great

Dale, High Forest, Tethyr.

**Racial Feats:** None, but centaurs can

acquire the Spirited Charge and

Trample feats (ignoring the prerequisites)

and apply the benefits

to their own melee attacks.

**Racial Hit Dice:** 4d8

**Level Adjustment:** +3

Centaurs are magnificent

creatures. From the waist up,

they appear like well-muscled

humanoids. Their pointed

ears suggest they were once

related to elves. From the

waist down, however, they

have the bodies of horses. The

centaur’s humanoid skin is

usually bronzed from many

hours in the sun. Their equine

coats vary greatly in color and

pattern, just as much as any traditional

horse. Many different species of

creatures appear to be conglomerations

of two or more other species, but few of

these are as handsome, noble, and articulate as the

centaurs.

Centaurs are usually honorable and affable people. They

prefer to stick to their own kind, but they are not afraid to

socialize with those from other races.

The main aim of most centaurs is to live in harmony with

their forest homes. They are uneducated, but few are wiser than

they in the ways of the woods. They care far more for the wilds

in which they live than for what someone might have once written

in some moldering old book.

Centaurs mature early and live short but happy lives. Like

horses, they can walk from birth, albeit on shaky hooves at first.

They are considered children for only two years, after which

they are adolescents for another three. Once they reach five

years of age, centaurs are considered full adults. On average,

centaurs live around 40 years, although some have been known

to reach the ripe old age of 60.

From their chests to the back of their rumps, full-grown centaurs

measure six to eight feet long. From their front hooves to

their crowns, they are seven to eight feet tall. Centaurs weigh

anywhere from 950 to 1,200 pounds.

Centaurs have the same life expectancy and age categories as

half-orcs.

**History**

Human legend has it that the centaurs are the

result of some mad cross between a wild elf

and a wild mustang, but both the wild elves

and the centaurs take umbrage at this

suggestion. (The mustangs have no particular

opinions on the matter.) As far

as the centaurs are concerned, they

have always been on Toril, caretakers

of the forest in which they make

their homes.

The centaurs’ territory has been

slowly dwindling over the years, and

presumably their numbers as well.

According to centaur myth, the

forests of Faerûn once ran thick with

great tribes of centaurs. It is only

since the encroachment of the “civilized”

races that the centaurs have

been forced to retreat into smaller and

smaller ranges.

**Outlook**

Centaurs see themselves as the noble

guardians of the forest. They are the

royalty of the woods. Because of this,

they feel protective of their homes

and responsible for the defense of the

creatures with which they share

their space.

Male centaurs spend almost all

their waking hours either hunting or out

patrolling their lands, keeping their sharp

eyes peeled for any outsiders who might be encroaching on

their territory and doing the forest harm. If the centaurs believe

that their “guests” are acting out of simple ignorance or carelessness,

they confront the strangers and deliver them a warning

to change their ways. But if the centaurs see these people

acting maliciously against their people or the forest, the noble

creatures attack without warning and without mercy.

Most centaurs who take up adventuring are young mares or

stallions looking for a bit of adventure in their lives before they

settle down. Perhaps they’re hoping to find a mate from a tribe

other than their own. Sometimes, centaurs who lose their

spouses or families take up wandering about the world to distract

them from their grief.

CENTAUR CHARACTERS

A centaur’s favored class is ranger. Their closeness to the lands

in which they live makes taking up this class an easy choice.

However, there are nearly as many bards and druids in their

tribes. Centaurs enjoy their music almost as much as their woods.

**Prestige Classes:** Centaurs can become arcane archers, members

of a prestige class normally reserved for elves and halfelves.

They do not have any special prestige classes of their own.

**Centaur Society**

Centaur stallions may be hunters, but the mares actually run the

tribe and supplement the local food supply with cultivated produce.

They also bring some less common goods into their communities

through trade. They pay with treasure stripped from

the monsters or people who have been foolish enough to challenge

them. They don’t care to trade with humans, as centaurs

consider them basically untrustworthy. They deal freely with

elves, however, mostly for elven foods and wines.

Centaurs are massive creatures, and they eat and drink a lot.

Unfortunately, they are notoriously wild drunks, given to highspirited

rampages when overindulging. Noncentaurs should note

that although centaurs have generally wonderful senses of

humor, they are sensitive about their physiology. They take

direct offense at any horse jokes. (“The horses don’t tell us

human jokes, you know. Nor do they ask if they can climb on

our backs!”) While centaurs can give most humanoids a ride in

times of need—and are often willing to offer such assistance

when it’s needed—they are offended when asked to perform

this service. They are noble and intelligent creatures, not beasts

of burden, and they are touchy about anyone even insinuating

otherwise.

Centaurs mate for life. Once they promise themselves to each

other, centaurs are always faithful, even should one of the pair

die. Divorce is unknown among these people.

Young centaurs are encouraged to play freely, and they

mostly do so by running wild through the forests that make up

their homes. As centaurs grow up, they are gradually asked to

share more and more of the tribe’s duties. When a centaur

reaches the age of five, she officially becomes an adult, and the

tribe hosts a large party to celebrate. Centaurs gallop in from

miles around to eat, drink, and race.

As centaurs get older, they start to slow down. Eventually,

when it’s their turn to die, they drift off into the woods and

expire peacefully and privately, offering their bodies up for the

creatures of the forest to consume, just as they have consumed

so many such creatures during their own lives.

Outside the tribe, most centaurs work alone, confident in

their ability to handle most situations. They are often happy to

join up with a band of adventurers, especially if there are any

elves in it. They know that they are unschooled in the ways of

civilization and are always happy to be given a hand dealing

with such situations.

**Language and Literacy**

Centaurs speak Sylvan among themselves, and most have

learned enough Common to be able to converse with any who

might impinge on the borders of their territory. After that,

those centaurs inclined to pick up another tongue usually learn

Elven so that they can easily trade with their favorite non-centaur

people. They might also learn Orc or Draconian so they can

properly threaten their most hated foes.

Centaurs are illiterate, except for those with player character

classes other than barbarian.

**Abilities and**

**Racial Features**

Centaurs have the following racial traits:

• +8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, –2 Intelligence, +2

Wisdom. Centaurs are literally as strong, fast, and healthy as

the proverbial horse. While they may not have a great deal of

formal knowledge, their practical experience in the wild serves

them well.

• Large: As large creatures, centaurs suffer a –1 size penalty on

attack rolls and Armor Class. They also suffer a –4 size

penalty on Hide checks. However, they can use larger weapons

than humans can, and their lifting and carrying limits are

twice those of Medium-size characters.

• Centaur face is 10 feet, with a reach of 5 feet.

• Centaur land speed is 50 feet.

• Darkvision up to 60 feet.

• Proficient with all simple weapons, the longsword, the heavy

lance, and the composite longbow.

• +2 natural armor.

• Monstrous Humanoid Hit Dice: A centaur has 4d8 racial Hit

Dice. A centaur character receives the maximum hit points for

her first monstrous humanoid Hit Die, and rolls her other

monstrous humanoid Hit Dice normally. She rolls all Hit Dice

from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit

points on her first class level Hit Die. A centaur’s monstrous

humanoid Hit Dice also provide a +4 base attack bonus and

saving throws of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Centaurs with

class levels add their class attack bonus and save bonuses to

their racial attack bonus and saves.

• Monstrous Humanoid Skills: A centaur’s monstrous humanoid

Hit Dice grant her skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum

1) ×7. Class skills for these skill points are Hide, Listen,

Move Silently, Spot, and Survival. A centaur does not get the ×4

multiplier for skill points acquired from her first class level.

• Monstrous Humanoid Feats: A centaur’s monstrous humanoid

Hit Dice grant her 2 feats. A typical centaur chooses Weapon

Focus (hoof) and Improved Natural Armor. A centaur with

class levels gains feats based on his total Hit Dice, as shown on

Table 2 in the Introduction.

• Natural Attacks: A centaur may make 2 hoof attacks, each

dealing 1d6 points of damage plus the centaur’s Strength

bonus. A centaur can attack with a weapon in her hands at her

normal attack bonus, and make 2 hoof attacks as secondary

attacks (–5 penalty on the attack roll, and half Strength bonus

on the damage roll).

• Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan, home region. Bonus

Languages: By region.

• Favored Class: Ranger.

• Level Adjustment: +3. Due to her racial HD, plus her size and

phenomenal physical ability, a centaur has an effective character

level of 7 plus her class levels. Thus, a 3rd-level centaur

ranger would have an ECL of 10. See Table 1 in the Introduction

for more information.

MINOR RACES

**Centaur Magic and Lore**

Centaurs have no special spells exclusive to their race. Centaur

arcane spellcasters prefer evocation and transmutation spells,

since these allow them to affect both intruders and the weather,

two constant worries in any centaur’s life.

CENTAUR MAGIC ITEMS

Centaurs can often make use of magic items intended for

horses. For instance, they can directly benefit from *horseshoes*

*of speed* and *horseshoes of the zephyr*. They may also use magical

boots or shoes on their front or rear pair of hooves (while

the items do alter to fit the centaurs’ hooves, they look

strange). Centaurs may wear gloves and similar items on their

arms like any other humanoid. A centaur is still limited to one

pair of boots, one pair of gloves, and so on, despite having an

extra pair of limbs.

Centaurs cannot wear humanoid armor, but may wear magical

barding. Barding costs four times as much as humanoid

armor of the same type, but can be made magical or masterwork

at the normal cost. For example, *+1 studded leather barding*

costs 1,000 gp for the magic portion of the item, 150 gp for the

masterwork price, and 100 gp for four times the normal cost of

studded leather armor, for a total of 1,250 gp.

**Centaur Deities**

Centaurs are not terribly devout. Most of their religious leaders

are druids, who also serve as the tribal leaders. When centaurs

choose a patron deity, it is almost invariably Silvanus. They

share the Oak Father’s love for the deep forests and mighty

trees of Faerûn and, like Silvanus, are not afraid to confront

those who would injure the forests. Less often, centaurs choose

members of the elven pantheon as patrons, such as Angharradh,

Rillifane Rallathil, or Solonor Thelandira.

**Relations with Other Races**

Centaurs don’t mind sharing territory with elves. In fact, the

two races can even be said to be friendly with each other. However,

centaurs do not hold other races in such high regard. They

tolerate halflings and gnomes, who are rarely a threat to the

centaurs and are well known for their deep and abiding respect

for nature. Centaurs don’t care for humans or dwarves at all;

when such people intrude upon a centaur’s home, they are asked

to leave, politely but forcefully.

Orcs, kobolds, and goblinoids, have earned an especially cold

place in a centaur’s heart. Most centaurs would not even consider

parleying with these races, and attack them on sight.

**Centaur Equipment**

Centaurs prefer to use greatclubs, heavy lances, and mighty composite

longbows. They also wear specialized centaur barding that

is a combination of a standard suit of humanoid armor and standard

barding. This costs four times what a Medium-size suit of

normal armor costs, and it weighs twice as much.

Medium or heavy barding reduces a centaur’s speed to 35 ft.

When wearing heavy barding, a centaur can only move triple its

normal rate instead of quadruple when using the Run action.

Removing or donning centaur barding takes five times as long

as removing or donning normal humanoid armor. See Table

7–6: Donning Armor on page 105 of the *Player’s Handbook*

for details.

ANIMALS AND PETS

Centaurs do not raise domestic animals for food or as beasts of

burden. They are friendly with all sorts of woodland animals,

but they generally do not keep pets.
