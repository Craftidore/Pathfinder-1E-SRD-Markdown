# Kalashtar
## Overview
The kalashtar are a compound race: incorporeal entities

from the alien plane of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams,

merged with human bodies and spirits to form a distinct

species. They were once a minority among the quori,

the native race of Dal Quor, hunted and persecuted

for their religious beliefs. Thousands of years after the

quori invaded Eberron and the connection between their

plane and the Material Plane was severed, the kalashtar

were the fi rst of the quori to discover a means to reach the

Material Plane once more. Fleeing persecution, they transformed

their physical forms into psychic projections that

allowed them to enter the Material Plane and possess

willing humans. Today, new kalashtar are born,

not possessed; neither spirit nor human,

they are a new race that breeds true.

It took three hundred years for the

other quori to discover a similar means

to psychically project their spirits out of

Dal Quor and possess human bodies,

forming the Inspired (*Eberron Campaign Setting* 290), while leaving their

own bodies behind—much as mortals project their minds

to Dal Quor when they dream. For fi fteen hundred years

now, the Inspired in their vast k ingdom of Riedra have

continued to persecute and oppress the kalashtar.

**Personality:** As a true hybrid of human hosts and

quori spirits, the kalashtar possess keen intellects but are

not ruled by logic. They seek the perfection of their minds

and spirits, often to the exclusion of any physical pursuits.

They are generally warm and compassionate, but their

manners and ways of thinking are alien to the native races

of Eberron. They are more interested in psionics than in

the magic that pervades Khorvaire, and often lace their

discourse with esoteric terms such as “matter,” “kinetics,”

and “ectoplasm.”

The kalashtar are outcasts from their home plane

and can never return there—not even in dream. The

combination of life in exile and a dreamless existence

makes the kalashtar slightly inclined toward madness, and

some have speculated that the kalashtar devote themselves

to psychic and physical discipline in order to keep

themselves safely sane.

**Physical Description:** Kalashtar appear very similar

to humans, but they have a grace and elegance that makes

them seem almost too beautiful. They are slightly taller

than t he a v erage human, a nd t heir f aces h av e a s light

angularity that sets them apart from the human norm, but

these deviations only make them seem more attractive.

**Relations:** Kalashtar are born diplomats and relate

fairly well to indiv iduals of all races—except, of course,

the Inspired. They relate best to humans, with whom they

share the greatest physical similarity, but some kalashtar

fi nd t hemselv es s trongly d rawn t o o ther r aces i nstead.

They oppose the Inspired in all ways, both within Riedra

and beyond its borders, and likewise oppose any group or

force that corrupts or degrades mortal souls.

**Alignment:** Kalashtar are generally lawful good.

They combine a sense of self-discipline that borders on

the ascetic with a genuine concern for the welfare of all

living things, or at least their souls.

**Kalashtar Lands:** The kalashtar homeland is a

region of Sarlona called Adar, a land of forbidding mountains

and hidden fortresses in the southeastern portion

of the continent. Even in Adar their numbers are small,

and the number of kalashtar found in Khorvaire is much

smaller still. However, they can be found in many of the

largest human cities. The largest kalashtar population in

Khorvaire is in the city of Sharn.

**Dragonmarks:** Kalashtar never possess dragonmarks.

**Religion:** Kalashtar do not follow gods, but they

have their own religion, called the Path of Light. The

center of this belief system is a universal force of positive

energy the kalashtar call il-Yannah, or “the Great Light.”

Through meditation and communion with this force, the

kalashtar seek to strengthen their bodies and minds for

the struggle against the forces of darkness that threaten

all life on Eberron. Though il-Yannah is not a deity, its

few clerics draw power from the Path of Light. A greater

number of devout followers of the Path are psions and

psychic warriors.

**Language:** Kalashtar speak Quor, the language of

the quori, and the common tongue of their homeland

(Common in Khorvaire, or Riedran in Adar). Quor is a

hissing, guttural tongue more suited to the alien forms

of the quori than their humanoid hosts. It has its own

written form, a f lowing, elegant script with many circular

letters.

**Names:** Kalashtar names have much in common with

the name of their people: They are three to fi ve syllables

long, with a combination of hard and hissing consonants.

Male names end with one of the masculine name suffixes

–harath, –khad, –melk, or –tash. Female names use the

feminine suffi xes –kashtai, –shana, –tari, or –vakri.

**Male Names:** Halkhad, Kanatash, Lanamelk, Minharath,

Nevitash, Parmelk, Thakakhad, Thinharath.

**Female Names:** Ganitari, Khashana, Lakashtari,

Mevakri, Novakri, Panitari, Thakashtai, Thatari.

**Adventurers:** Every kalashtar enters adulthood

facing a fundamental choice: Try to live a normal life as a

persecuted exile in Adar, or take up a more active role in

combating the Inspired in the world. Not surprisingly,

many kalashtar choose the latter option and live a life at

least bordering on that of the adventurer. Most kalashtar

adventurers are motivated primarily by their hatred of

the Inspired, but a few—primarily those advanced along

the Path of Light—are driven by their compassion for all

living beings and their desire to fi ght darkness in whatever

form it takes.

KALASHTAR RACIAL TRAITS

• Medium: As Medium creatures, kalashtar have no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

• Kalashtar base land speed is 30 feet.

• +2 racial bonus on sav ing throws a gainst mindaffecting

spells and abilities, and possession: The

kalashtar’s dual spirits help them resist spells that

target their minds.

• +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate

checks: Kalashtar are masters of social interaction,

infl uencing others through their commanding presence

and subtle psychic powers.

• +2 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate

a human: Kalashtar have a close physical

resemblance to humans.

• Kalashtar sleep but they do not dream. As

such, they have immunity to the *dream* and *nightmare*

spells, as well as any other effect that relies

on the target’s ability to dream.

• Naturally Psionic: Kalashtar gain 1 extra power point

per character level, regardless of whether they choose

a psionic class.

• Psi-Like Abilities: *Mindlink* (1/day)*.* This ability is like

the power manifested by a wilder of 1/2 the kalashtar’s

Hit Dice (minimum 1st level).

If you are not using the *Expanded Psionics*

*Handbook* in your game, use this description of the

*mindlink* power:

You forge a telepathic bond with another creature

within 30 feet, which must have an Intelligence score

of 3 or higher. The bond can be established only with

a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving

throw and gains no benefit from spell resistance.

You can communicate telepathically through the

bond even if you do not share a common language.

No special power or infl uence is established as a

result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works

over any distance (although not from one plane to

another), but only lasts for 1 round per character

level. This is a mind-affecting ability.

• Automatic Languages: Common and Quor. Bonus

Languages: Draconic and Riedran.

• Favored Class: Psion. A multiclass kalashtar’s psion

class does not count when determining whether he

takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
