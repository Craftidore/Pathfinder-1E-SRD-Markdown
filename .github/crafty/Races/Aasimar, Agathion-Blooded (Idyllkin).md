Like their agathion ancestors, idyllkin seek to spread good in its purest form, unconcerned with the trivialities of chaos and law. They often travel from place to place to spread their righteous wisdom, and recruit both intelligent creatures and animals to their cause. 

Idyllkin often possess bestial qualities such as dragon scales, fish scales, fur, manes, or talons. Slit pupils, pronounced canines, and furry ears are all common indicators of an aasimar’s agathion background. Just as agathions take on different traits depending on their animal aspect, so too do idyllkin. Descendants of avorals often possess feathery hair and enjoy wide-open areas such as plains, while the progeny of leonals are aggressive and often have sharp, clawlike fingernails. Many idyllkin, regardless of their animal aspect, feel called to walk the path of the druid, and idyllkin are among the most likely aasimars to become such protectors of nature. 

Idyllkin are usually found in the wild reaches of Golarion, such as Kyonin, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, or the Mwangi Expanse. They prefer villages to cities, and often work as hunters, herbalists, or herders if they haven’t carved out their own existence in the wilderness. They often put the ailments of nature and life before those of society and wealth, but when working with others idyllkin compromise to make sure everyone’s goals are met. 

Traits 

The following are race traits for idyllkin. 

**Enlightened Warrior**: You have always found it easy to maintain inner peace and enlightenment that translate well to the battlefield. You may take levels in monk even while maintaining a neutral or neutral good alignment. 

**Speech of the Wilds**: Like your agathion ancestor, you have a knack for communicating with other creatures, and you are adept at breaking down language barriers. You can speak one extra language.
