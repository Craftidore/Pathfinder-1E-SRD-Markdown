# Life-Drinker
## Overview
**Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 13th

**Slot** none

**Price** 40,320 gp

**Weight** 12 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 greataxe* is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.

Each time a *life-drinker* deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any negative levels gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Enervation (Spell)|enervation]]*

**Cost** 20,320 gp
