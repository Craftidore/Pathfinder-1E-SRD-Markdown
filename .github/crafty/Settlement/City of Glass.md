# City of Glass
## Overview
**Community Size**: Other
#Community-Size/Other

## Additional Details
**Location:** City of Glass

**Proper Name:** Lo Deniq (commonly referred to as the City of Glass)

**Ruler:** Governed by the members of the Council of High Magic.

**Government:** Magocracy; there are seven High Masters (one for each school of magic save divination).

**Placement:** The City of Glass floats over the capital of the Lendore (formerly Spindrift) Isles, Lo Reltarma.

**History:** The City of Glass is an artificial construct: a city created solely from magic; a testimony to power of the Suloise and the ability of their ancient Mages of Power.

The City of Glass was created by the Archmage Lendore in Cy -425 and he placed it in the air 8,888 feet above the capital of the Lendore Isles, Lo Reltarma. 

The entirety of the original structure is believed to be made up of glassteel.

It was originally connected to the capital below it by means of an artifact of Lendore's creation: the Gate of Glass. This artifact is said to have been deactivated (but not destroyed) by the high elven followers of Sehanine when they claimed the Lendore Isles for themselves.

Initially Lendore and his followers used a floating tower as his personal residence and place of power. Once construction on Lo Reltarma was well begun, more and more of Lendore's followers and their families relocated there. Finally only Lendore and eight of his best students remained. He then began a Master Shaping (epic magic) which when completed resulted in a circular disc 10 miles across covered by a clear, nearly invisible dome of hardened glassteel.

**Construction and Geography:** The base of the disc is 1/2 mile thick, though it is thought that only the outer foot or so is actually comprised of glassteel. The remainder appears to be stone, assorted minerals, and a top layer comprised of several feet of incredibly fertile topsoil.

An illusory sun followed by night sky travels across the time, keeping track with [[Liga]], Luna and Celene outside. 

In the exact center of the disc is the City of Glass proper, and it covers an area two miles in diameter . All of the major structures common to a city appear within it, though over 90% are empty. Each was made in the distinct architectural style of the ancient Suloise. Many, though not all, of the original structures are made from glassteel of varying colors, transparencies, and even textures.

The City of Glass itself is surrounded by wall of dark, almost black glassteel a foot thick and fifty feet high (this cannot be climbed without magical assistance). Eight circular towers are equally spaced around the wall and are largely set within it. Each is 400 feet high and 80 feet in diameter. The base of each tower has a double gate set within it allowing access into and out of the city itself.

Each tower is residence to a wizard of 17th-21st level known as a High Master. This supreme practitioner of a given school of magic (abjuration, conjuration, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation) sits on the Council of High Magic and through it governs the city. There is no tower of divination and no High Master of Divination; the tower for divination sits closed and empty and its gates have been sealed for over a thousand years. It is said that the last High Master of Divination was Lendore himself.

Broad (50 feet wide) avenues extend from the base each tower of magic to the central plaza at the heart of the city. The area between each of these forms the eight districts of the city. The districts are the Noble District, the Garden District, the Common District, the Trade District, the Foreign District, the Militant District, the Necropolis District, and the Divine District.

**Noble District:** The Noble District lies between the Divine District and the Garden District. It is filled with small walled compounds surrounded by park-like pleasances. The borders between these are colored glassteel walls pierced with gated archways.

**Garden District:** This district is mostly well manicured gardens and small ponds and lakes with a few small wooded groves. Some of the latter are wilder and far less manicured.

**Common District:** The common district is situated between the Garden and Trade districts. Here are the residences of common Suloise folk. Some are individual multi-storied structures while others are insulae. 

**Trade District:** Situated between the Foreign and Common Districts, all manufacturing, crafting (except for arcane artistry) and marketing is done here. Everything from small artisan shops to vast (mostly subterranean manufactories can be found here.

All public offices are found here, though these are far fewer than would be found in most cities. 

**Foreign District:** All those not of pure Suloise blood (either noble or common), as well visitors to the city reside here. This District is filled with many empty private residences as well as taverns, inns, and 5-8 story high towers of apartments known as insulae (each floor is given over to 2-8 apartments which share a common stairwell which is open at the top; only floors above the 4th may have a small balcony and it will never protrude beyond the walls of the structure).

**Militant District:** Between the Necropolis and Foreign districts lies the Militant District. Filled with empty parade grounds, barracks and several schools dedicated to the martial arts, the Militant District seems to have been created to hold a vast army.

**Necropolis District:** Lying in the area between the towers of Necromancy and Evocation, this district is filled with vast private crypts and large obelisks which are the public ossuaries of the common folk.

**Divine District**: The Divine District is a place of calm and serenity. Within it are temples (major and minor) to each of the deities once worshipped by the Suloise: [[Beltar]], [[Bralm]], [[Dalt]], [[Fortubo]], Jascar, Kord, Lendor, Lydia, Norebo, Osprem, Phaulkon, Phyton, Pyremius, Ranet, Syrul, [[Vatun]], Wastri, Wee Jas, and Xerbo. The two greatest of these is the House of Wee Jas, a massive cathedral whose main spire rises almost 600 feet high and the Hall of Lendor, an oddly shaped upright twisted ring structure which is larger on the inside than the outside.

**Central Plaza:** At the very center of the City of Glass lies a large central plaza. It is here that Lendore's tower can be found with his tomb lying beneath the pool below it. The other 'side' of the artifact known as the 'Gate of Glass' is also here, at the center of the plaza's large open pool. 

Access to the Gate of Glass is via 4 arching 20 feet wide bridges of glassteel.

**The Gate of Glass:** This artifact actually exists in two places at the same time. Half of it exists below in Lo Reltarma and the other side here in the City of Glass. It resembles nothing more than a 60' wide by 40' tall pane of almost ethereally clear glass floating a couple of feet above the pool below. Etched into its base in glowing runes are the cryptic words "Urbs Deniq." 

When both sides are active, looking through one side shows what is on the other. Now that the side in Lo Reltarma has been encased in a massive wall of stone (created by having multiple casters casting simultaneously), the side in the City of Glass seems to flicker every few seconds revealing images of strange doorways, gates and portals from ancient to possibly future times and from worlds other than [[Oerth]].

Anyone casting any form of teleportation magic while touching of the Gate of Glass 'locks' it to the desired location for up to 1 hour, creating a portal (cf. *[[Portal (Spell)|portal]]* spell) with the dimensions of the Gate of Glass which is dismissable and has no component costs. Unlike the *[[Portal (Spell)|portal]]* spell this can be used to create a portal which can access other planes and/or dimensions.

Unknown to anyone presently inhabiting the City of Glass is the fact that the Gate of Glass is the reason no divination magicks function there. A side effect of its vast power, the Gate of Glass blocks all divination effects within a 5 mile radius EXCEPT when the caster is touching the Gate itself. Because of the link between itself and the City of Glass, this blockage extends only to the outer edges of the dome and disc upon which the City of Glass sits. This antidivination power is so great not even the gods themselves it is believed (rightfully) can locate the City of Glass.

**Lendore's Tower:** This glassteel lattice tower sits on 4 legs and rises 1,500 feet above the central plaza. Its base is a square area measuring 400 feet per side. It has 3 levels, the lowest of which is 250 feet above the Central Plaza and is 200 feet square per side.  250 feet above this, another smaller level (100 feet square per side) and the topmost level (50 feet square per side). This uppermost level is rumored to be heavily warded since it is said to provide access to Lendore's Tomb.

Access to the first level is via magical moving staircases in each of the tower's legs (two ascend, two descend). Each staircase is 20 feet wide and ascends 250 to the first level of the tower. One merely stands at the base, steps upon the first step and it begins to ascend at a pace faster than a man can walk up stairs normally (the stairs ascend/descend at 50 feet per round).

**First Level:** The first level of Lendore's Tower is a large open area filled with benches made of glassteel which surround a central rostrum. This space was used by Lendore to lecture and instruct his students and apprentices prior to his 'death.'

Now it is the public assembly hall for the inhabitants of the City of Glass.

It is from here that the Council of High Magic governs the city. 

Once every 10 days, the High Masters of each tower assemble here for 6 hours. During this time, they dispense justice, inform the citizens of the city of events happening within the city (and outside it as well) and meet with any important newcomers to the City of Glass. Should one be indisposed or otherwise unavailable, his proxy is given over to the High Master of his choice.

**Second Level:** The second level of Lendore's Tower lies empty now. Once it provided the living spaces, kitchens, pantries, baths and other areas need by the students and apprentices of Lendore. It is connected to the first level via 4 more of the enchanted moving staircases.

In the center of the second level is a small locked chamber with a shaft (10' x 10') leading upward. The base of this circular shaft is actually a platform with a permanent *[[Suspension (Spell)|suspension]]* spell affecting it.

**Third Level:** This heavily warded area was the private sanctum of Lendore and it is here (rather than in his tomb) that all of his greatest treasures are kept. 

**Lendore's Tomb**

Beneath the pool which lies under Lendore's Tower is Lendore's Tomb. This small sepulchre has remained undisturbed for over 1,000 years. It is said to be heavily warded and to be protected by powerful constructs which have not been seen since the height of the Suloise Empire.

**GM Note:** This area is left for individual GMs to flesh out as they wish (or might be revealed at a later time in [[Oerth]] Journal). However, something to consider is that Lendore himself is not dead! Rather he is in *greater temporal stasis* he cast upon himself while he awaits the Final Calamity

**Inhabitants**

The inhabitants of the City of Glass are 90% pure Suloise (approx. 9,000 of which about 1,500 are of noble Suloise origin) with the remainder being made up of non-Suloise human races (there are no Bakluni to be found among them) and a few non-humanoid individuals (these number less 100 and range from at least one vampire to a shape-shifted dragon!).

Those born here are known as 'civii' and many can trace their lineage back to the original followers and students of Lendore.

A strange curse seems to affect the City of Glass in that those born here or anyone who spends more than 8 consecutive days here is unable to leave without suffering a lingering malady. This strange illness manifests itself 8 days after leaving the City of Glass itself (not the outer disc) in the form of a malaise (anyone who is a 'civii' loses 1 hp per day they are outside it; no form of magical healing stops this loss, only return to the City of Glass).

**GM Note:** This is actually a minor side effect of the Gate of Glass. Each of the High Masters possesses a small magical trinket which belonged to the 8 apprentices of Lendore who helped him create the City and Gate of Glass which allows the possessor to leave for any length of time.

**Outside the City of Glass**

The area immediately outside the City of Glass is known as the 'wilds'. Immediately outside the city walls  is a freshwater river 1/2 mile across and a 1/4 mile deep at its deepest point (next to the city wall). It is spanned by straight flat bridges of *glassteel* which radiate outward from each of the towers 50 feet above the river's surface. This body of water is called a river rather than a lake because it moves languidly in a clockwise direction.

This river is filled with a large variety of freshwater plants and aquatic life. 90% of this life is benign and people can be found daily sitting on the bridge or making use of small boats to fish.

Surrounding the river is a wilderness belt 3 miles wide. The terrain here varies from small glades to several belts of small steep hills. An abundance of game can be found, again with most of it being benign in nature and obviously suited for hunting.

A curious thing about this wilderness belt is that it has 'seasons.' If one extends imaginary lines from the Tower of Necromancy and the Tower of Illusion, the area which lies between is always in winter. With mild winter being found near each edge and extreme winter at its exact center. The area that would lie between the Tower of Illusion to the Tower of Abjuration is always in Spring. Between the Tower of Abjuration and the Tower of Enchantment it is always  summer and between the Tower of Enchantment and the Tower of Necromancy it is always autumn.

Every eight days, in a counterclockwise direction, one eighth of the wilds (the area, including both the fresh and saltwater areas, between any two adjacent towers undergoes the effects of a *[[Renew the Land (Spell)|renew the land]]* spell.

The outermost 'shore' of this belt opens onto a saltwater 'sea' which like its freshwater sister is 1/2 mile across and a 1/4 mile deep at its deepest point (next to the outer wall of the dome which covers the disc). Beds of kelp and coral can be found next to the shore which has a couple of beautiful beaches as well as several areas of tall cliffs (some of which have obvious sea caves).

The marine life here is abundant being made up of several varieties of game fish as well as  several small schools of sharks and even a small pod of orca. 

**Inhabitants**

The wilderness surrounding the City of Glass has a few inhabitants (less than 1,000 total) who are known as 'hospii.'  These are the mixed descendants of the Spindrift Isles inhabitants that escaped to the City of Glass when the elves took over the islands. Most of these are nomadic half-elves of high elf/Suloise heritage.

A similar malaise affects the 'hospii' as does the 'civii' except the 'hospii' are not permitted to build permanent encampments. They must move every 8 days or they begin to sicken. Any structure built of wood or stone immediately disappears when the *[[Renew the Land (Spell)|renew the land]]* effect affects the area in which it lies.

**Beyond the Dome**

Since the time of its creation, the City of Glass and the disc upon which it sits have hung in the sky above Lo Reltarma. For over 1,000 years it was used by sailors and travelers as a navigational aid. All of that changed when the elves took over the islands and began their pogrom.

When the elves began to drive out the non-elven inhabitants a great storm cloud 40 miles across and 5 miles high formed, centered on the dome and disc. Terrible waves of sheet lightning constantly rage while winds of up to 100 mile per hour blow. Even the mightiest of dragons would be buffeted about by the storm's power. There is no rain in this storm, just fury. Below it the Lendore Isles have been cloaked in mist by the Sehanine's priests and wizards. The storm seems to augment this affect with mists of its own often merging with those below.

**Conflicts and Intrigues**

A human resistance force operates from the City of Glass above Lendore Isle. The High Masters of Magic and their students daily open temporary portals to the lands below. Often these are opened onto locations within the Lendore Isles themselves for the purpose that advance the cause of the resistance.

Why haven't the elves invaded the City of Glass? There are probably several reasons for this.

First, the elves are isolationists. And religious fanatics. Even the cost of the occasional raids from the resistance is nothing compared to what it would take to storm a city which can only be entered via teleporation magic. And since it cannot be divined by normal means, it comes back to a 'you can't get there unless you have already been there' situation. 

Additionally there is the eternal storm ranging around the disc at all times. Even dragons could not survive its fury for long. And with visibility down to zero, how are you going to find it in an area 5 miles deep and 40 miles across. It would be impossible to fly an normal search grid.

This leaves subterfuge. A spy or spies if you will. This could lead to some amazing quests.

The Scarlet Brotherhood would love to infiltrate and then take over the City of Glass, it is after all perhaps the greatest magical achievement of the ancient Suloise. A series of adventures centered around this would certainly be of interest.

The Society of the Serpent's legendary headquarters could easily be set here. This would afford PC members of the Society an opportunity to visit. Who knows what could happen after that.

**The Final Calamity**

The City of Glass was prepared by Lendore for what he saw in his final visions, what he himself named the Final Calamity. However, Lendore never revealed what the exact nature of that catastrophe was. Was this omission deliberate? Very likely. However some things can be deduced from the nature of his greatest creation: the City of Glass itself. The Final Calamity must be something so devastating as to require a sheltered city of immense size. It seems to require that this city be self-sustaining for an indeterminate amount of time. It would appear that the Final Calamity will rival even the Twin Cataclysms.

So what is it? Here are three possibilities...

1) The destruction of [[Flanaess]] itself. In the ruins of what remains, the survivors could leave the City of Glass to repopulate the [[Flanaess]], restoring the Suloise to their former glory.

2) The destruction of [[Oerth]] itself. In this scenario, the City of Glass might drift in [[Greyspace]] circled by [[Liga]], [[Oerth]]'s sun. Perhaps its inhabitants could discover some method of moving it to another world.

3) The destruction of the Prime Material Plane. In such a case, the City of Glass becomes an interdimensional habitat, wandering through the multiverse.

**Special Material: Glassteel**

Glassteel may be created via one of two methods: Through an alchemical process requiring extensive knowledge of both metallurgy and glassblowing or by the 6th-level arcane spell of the same name (cf. *glassteel*); glassteel combines strength beyond iron with the transparency of glass. It mostly finds use as a building material in fantastic castles, but it can also be fashioned into weapons and armor (although plain glassteel armor is much more costly to craft than even the most ornate armor). Glassteel is stronger and lighter than iron and completely transparent, lacking the greenish tint of common glass. Colored or tinted glassteel may be created using slight variations of either method; glassteel may be textured from rough to smooth.

Items made of glassteel weigh only half what they otherwise would. Items not primarily made of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of glassteel. (A breastplate can be made of glassteel, but hide armor cannot.)

Glassteel armor counts as one armor category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. Arcane spell failure chances for armors and shields made of glassteel are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).

Glassteel has hardness 20 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness. This means that it is as hard as admantine but much lighter. Weapons and armor fashioned from glassteel are treated as masterwork items with regard to creation times, but the masterwork quality does not affect the enhancement bonus of weapons or the armor check penalty of armor.

Item Cost Modifier: light armor +2,000 gp, medium armor +6,000 gp, heavy armor +12,000 gp, shield +2,000 gp, weapon +500 gp, other items +100 gp/lb.

**Glassteel**

Transmutation

**Level:** Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6

**Components:** V, S, M

**Casting Time:** 1 minute/lb. created

**Range:** Touch

**Effect:** A glassteel object weighing up to 5 lb/level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

Glassteel is a magical substance created from normal, nonmagical crystal and glass. Glassteel is as strong and resistant to fire as steel, but retains the transparency (and color if any) of the original material. Spells that affect metal or glass (such as *[[Shatter (Spell)|shatter]]* and *[[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]]*) do not function on glassteel. Using this spell with [[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]] or a glass-related [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check, the caster can fashion glass or crystal items that function as steel items. Thus, glass plate armor and glass swords can be created that are as durable as their normal, steel counterparts.

**Hardening**

Transmutation

**Level:** Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6

**Components:** V, S, M

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./level; see text

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material’s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have hardness 16 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword’s hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A hardening spell does not in any way affect a substance’s resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on.

**Portal**

Conjuration (Creation)

**Level:** Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8

**Components:** V, S, M (small leather loop suspended from a bent wire of gold), XP (500 XP)

**Casting Time:** 3 rounds

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)

**Effect:** See text

**Duration:** Concentration + 1 round

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** DragonLance Campaign Setting, pg. 108

Casting *[[Portal (Spell)|portal]]* opens an interdimensional connection between two places on the same plane of existence, allowing travel between the locations in either direction. The *portal* itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. The *portal* has a front and back. Creatures moving through the *portal* from the front are transported to the other location: creatures moving from the back are not.

The interdimensional connection is forged through the [[Astral Plane]], so anything that blocks astral travel will also block the usage of the *portal.* Much like the *teleporation* spell, you must have a clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can't create a *portal* if you don't know where the terminus will end up. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the *portal* will form. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make traversing a *portal* more hazardous or even impossible. Use the following table to determine the success of the *portal's* opening.


| **Destination** <br>**Familiarity** | **Successful** <br> **Portal** | **Failed**<br>**Portal** |
|---|---|---|
| Very familiar | 01-97 | 98-100 |
| Studied carefully | 01-94 | 95-100 |
| Seen casually | 01-88 | 89-100 |
| Viewed once | 01-76 | 77-100 |
| Description | 01-60 | 61-100 |

**[[Renew the Land (Spell)|Renew the Land]]**

Conjuration

**Level:** Druid 6

**Components:** V, S, M (any seed pod)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** 1 square mile/level

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

Taking the seed pod in one and making the prerequisite gestures in the other, you cause the area  affected to experience an immediate renewal of all natural life (animal and plant). Plants and trees are immediately restored to perfect health and any that bear nuts or fruit are immediately bountifully laden. Any plants or trees that have been cut back or down in the past month are immediately restored to full life. This spell works as well on both fresh and salt water bodies as it does land.

Insects and animals (Int 3 and lower) are returned to full vigorous health with any that have been slain in the past month also being returned to full life.

This spell never causes more life to be renewed than could sustain itself for a month in the environment. It will not bring life to barren deserts (though it would affect an oasis) or to bare lifeless stone.

Any area suffering the effects of any form of magical blight must make an opposed caster level check or have that blight removed and the land renewed.

**[[Suspension (Spell)|Suspension]]**

Transmutation

**Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4

**Components:** V, S, M (small leather loop suspended from a bent wire of gold)

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Any nonliving object up to 1,000 lb./level

**Duration:** 1d4 days + 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

This spell functions like *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]*, except as noted above and as follows. You can mentally direct the object to move up or down as much as 45 feet each round for the duration of the spell; doing so is a move action. When you cease concentration, the object remains in place for the duration of the spell.

*[[Suspension (Spell)|Suspension]]* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. (HR)

**Note:** This material is taken and used without permission from the Shining South (WotC), pg. 51. Additionally as a house rule it has been modified to allow it to be made permanent.

**Temporal Stasis, Greater**

Transmutation

**Level:** Sorcerer 9, Wizard 9

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth 5,000 gp contained in a platinum coated glassteel hourglass worth at least 2,500 gp.)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature or object touched

**Duration:** see text

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (object)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

Like the spell *[[Temporal Stasis (Spell)|temporal stasis]]*, you use this spell to place something into suspended animation. But instead of the target being a creature only, it can be anything—living or nonliving. When cast on an object, any magical properties are suspended (but not dispelled). Potions cannot be opened, the text of magical scrolls is too fuzzy to [[Read Magic (Spell)|read, magic]] items do not operate, etc. At your discretion, you can set a condition or time whereby the spell’s magic releases the target. This is done verbally at the end of the spell’s casting and must be specific if a condition. For example, you might cast the spell on a king and state, “You are freed when the nations of Forann and Bretin make peace with each other.” Or if the target is a magic sword, you might state, “You are freed when the youngest son of the Diranges family enters this chamber.” Whether or not you choose to affix a condition to the spell, the magic of *greater temporal stasis* cannot be otherwise removed (such as by a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell or a *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]* spell).
