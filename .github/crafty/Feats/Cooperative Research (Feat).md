# Cooperative Research (Feat)
## Overview
Your assistance makes spell research far more efficient.

**Prerequisites:** [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 1 rank, relevant [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill 1 rank

**Benefit:** You can assist another character in spell research. You must both possess [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] and the the relevant [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill, but either one of you can fulfill any other prerequisites for researching the spell. You provide a +2 circumstance bonus on any [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks related to the research, and your assistance increases the research progress by 1 day.

**Normal:** Attempt a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check and a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check (arcana for an arcane spell, religion for a divine spell) against the spell research DC; If both checks succeed, you make 1 dayâ€™s progress toward completing the spell. When your days of progress equal the total number of days needed, the spell is completed and added to your spellbook or list of spells known.

**Special:** Each additional researcher or assistance beyond the first adds another day's progress if successful.
