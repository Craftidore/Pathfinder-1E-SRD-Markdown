# Wand Bonding (Feat)
## Overview
As a magical being of wood and metal, you have learned to power wands with your own energy.

**Prerequisites:** [[Warforged (Race)|Warforged]] ([[Gearforged (midgardpf)|gearforged]] or other construct), ability to spontaneously cast arcane spells or infusions.

**Benefit:** When activating a wand, you can choose to sacrifice an arcane spell slot or infusion slot of the level of the spell to be cast from the wand (or a higher level) instead of using one of the charges in the wand. In addition to powering the wand, this increases the caster level of the effect by one for every five caster levels you possess. A wand must have at least one charge for you to activate it in this way.

**Special:** A warforged sorcerer can take Wand Bonding as a bonus feat at 1st level in place of the summon familiar class feature.

A warforged artificer can add this feat to the list of available bonus feats.
