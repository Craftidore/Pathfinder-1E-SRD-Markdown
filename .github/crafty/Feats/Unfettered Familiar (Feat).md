# Unfettered Familiar (Feat)
## Overview
You can channel touch spells through your familiar without needing to be adjacent to it.

**Prerequisites**: Caster level 5th, familiar class feature.

**Benefit**: Once per day, you can cast a touch spell without being in contact with your familiar and designate your familiar as the “toucher.” You do not require line of sight to your familiar to use this ability, but you must be within 30 feet of your familiar when you cast the spell, and if you can’t see or hear your familiar, you must at least be able to speak with it.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another use of this feat, and the distance you can be from your familiar increases by 10 feet.

**Normal**: Your familiar must be in contact with you when a spell is cast in order for it to deliver the spell.
