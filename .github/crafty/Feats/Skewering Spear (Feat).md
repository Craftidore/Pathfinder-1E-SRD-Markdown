# Skewering Spear (Feat)
## Overview
The momentum of your spear is enough to impale your opponents. 

**PREREQUISITES:** [[Lunge (Feat)|Lunge]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (longspear or spear), [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]] ([[Longspear|longspear]] or spear).

**BENEFIT:** Whenever you use the [[Lunge (Feat)|Lunge]] feat to increase your effective reach with a spear or longspear, you may elect to increase the critical multiplier of that weapon by one step. 

**SPECIAL:** If you also have the Javelin Strike feat, you may use a javelin in conjunction with this feat.
