# Fast Item Creation (Feat)
## Overview
You have optimized your crafting techniques to save time.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craftsman (Feat)|Craftsman]], 9 ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]].

**Benefit:** You increase the rate at which you create magical items by 1,000 gp/8-hour day.

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times and stacks with itself. Each time it is chosen, add 1,000 gp to the value of a single magic item that the character can create each day.

*Commentary*—I’ve often found that most campaigns and adventures leave little time to utilize item creation feats. This can definitely help a character make better use of such feats.
