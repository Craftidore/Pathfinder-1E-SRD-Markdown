# Acrobatic Steps (Feat)
## Overview
You can easily move over and through obstacles.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 15, [[Nimble Moves (Feat)|Nimble Moves]].

**Benefit**: Whenever you move, you may move through up to 15 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. The effects of this feat stack with those provided by [[Nimble Moves (Feat)|Nimble Moves]] (allowing you to move normally through a total of 20 feet of difficult terrain each round).
