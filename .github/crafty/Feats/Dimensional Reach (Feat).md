# Dimensional Reach (Feat)
## Overview
You can transport small objects to you with an act of will.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a conjuration (summoning) spell of 3rd level higher available to cast, you can transport small items directly into your hand as a standard action. You must have line of sight to an item you wish to transport in this way, and it must be unattended. This ability works at a range of up to 5 feet per level of the highest-level summoning spell you have available to cast, and the item can weigh up to 2 pounds per level of that spell.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting conjuration (summoning) spells
