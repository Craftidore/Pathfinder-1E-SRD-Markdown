# Spell Exchange (Feat)
## Overview
You may exchange a memorized spell for one of lower level that you have mastered.

**Prerequisites:** [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]], Wizard leveI 3rd+.

**Benefit:** The wizard can cast any spell that he does not need a spellbook for (through the [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] feat) in place of one of equal or higher level. The original spell is considered cast and is lost.

Using this feat is considered a full round action.
