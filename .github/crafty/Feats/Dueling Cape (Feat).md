# Dueling Cape (Feat)
## Overview
You can use a simple cape to guard yourself and confound your foes.

**Prerequisites**: [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] 1 rank.

**Benefit**: As a move action, you can wrap a cape that youâ€™re wearing around your arm (removing it if necessary), and treat it as a buckler. If you are using the cape in this way, and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, as an immediate action you can spend 1 panache point to release your cape from your arm and entangle your foe in it. The foe can free it by using a full-round action to escape or by destroying the cape; a typical cape has hardness 1 and 3 hit points. You can use this feat with items similar in shape and weight to a cape, such as a cloak or a curtain.
