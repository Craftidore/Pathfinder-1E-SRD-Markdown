# Reckless Wand Wielder (Feat)
## Overview
You can increase the effectiveness of spells cast from a wand.

**Prerequisite:** [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] 1 rank, [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]].

**Benefit:** By expending an additional charge, you can use a wand as if its caster level was 2 higher than its normal level, changing all the spellâ€™s level-dependent effects. For example, by expending 2 charges at once, a *wand of magic missile* (created at caster level 3rd) can be used at caster level 5th, firing three missiles instead of two. You can expend only 1 extra charge at a time using this feat.

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pg. 82
