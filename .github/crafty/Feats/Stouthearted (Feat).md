# Stouthearted (Feat)
## Overview
You fight back your fear by voicing the song in your heart.

**Prerequisite**: Raging song class feature.

**Benefit**: While you are maintaining a raging song, if you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can expend a round of performing to reroll your saving throw as an immediate action. You must keep this second result, even if it lower.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 157
