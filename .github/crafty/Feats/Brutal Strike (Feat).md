# Brutal Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You can batter foes senseless with your mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, or flail. Few victims are willing to stand toe-to-toe with a warrior known for knocking his foes witless with a single strike.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you use your [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] feat to increase your damage with a bludgeoning weapon, you can attempt a brutal strike. You must declare your intention before making your attack. If the attack hits and your opponent takes damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your extra damage from the [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] feat on the attack) or be [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round.

You can use this feat once per round during your attack action.

**Special:** This feat cannot be used against a creature that is not subject to extra damage from critical hits.

A fighter can select Brutal Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.
