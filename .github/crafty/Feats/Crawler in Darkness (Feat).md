# Crawler in Darkness (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned the powers and limitations of alien senses that operate outside of the normal spectrum, and have learned methods to avoid them by keeping low to the ground.

**Prerequisite:** [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) 5 ranks, [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] 5 ranks

**Benefit:** As long as you move no faster than half normal speed, you can use [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] in conditions of dim light or darkness to hide from creatures with [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]] or [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]]. In addition, when you are [[Prone|prone]] (including while crawling, either normally or using abilities like Fast Crawl), you can flank creatures with all-around sight and creatures with [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]], and [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]] cannot automatically pinpoint your location and must make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to notice you if you are using [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]]. You also gain this benefit while climbing, as long as you move no faster than half your normal speed. This feat no effect when creatures can see you with normal sight and does not grant you the ability to [[Hide in Plain Sight|hide in plain sight]] if you do not already have this ability.

**Normal:** Creatures with [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], and [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]] do not usually need to make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to notice creatures within range.
