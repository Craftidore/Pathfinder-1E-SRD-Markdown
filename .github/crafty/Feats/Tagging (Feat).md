# Tagging (Feat)
## Overview
Tagging is a particularly flashy piece of showing off with your weapon, designed to temporarily dishearten your enemy. This could be anything from cutting off a lock of his hair to carving your initials in his shirt.

**Benefits:** When you land an attack on an opponent you may choose to deal no damage. The next time you strike that opponent with a critical hit during this encounter the damage multiplier is increased by 2, the damage die is increased by 1 level (thus 1d6 becomes 1d8), or your damage modifier (Str usually, though with some Finesse feats change this to Dex) is doubled. You may tag an opponent up to three times, each time choosing a different effect to apply to the target. Additionally, each time you tag an opponent the critical threat range of your weapon is increased by 1 (to a maximum of +3) while attacking that opponent, until a critical hit is rolled.
