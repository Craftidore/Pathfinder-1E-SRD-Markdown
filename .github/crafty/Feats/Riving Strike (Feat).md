# Riving Strike (Feat)
## Overview
When you infuse your weapon with arcane might, your attacks make foes more susceptible to magic.

**Prerequisites**: [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]], ability to cast arcane spells.

**Benefit**: If you have a weapon that is augmented by your [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]] feat, when you damage a creature with an attack made with that weapon, that creature takes a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for 1 round.
