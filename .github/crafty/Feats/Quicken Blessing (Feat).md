# Quicken Blessing (Feat)
## Overview
You can deliver one of your blessings with greater speed.

**Prerequisites**: Access to a blessing’s major power, blessings class feature.

**Benefit**: Choose one of your blessings that normally requires a standard action to use. You can expend two of your daily uses of blessings to deliver that blessing (regardless of whether it’s a minor or major effect) as a swift action instead.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you choose a different blessing.
