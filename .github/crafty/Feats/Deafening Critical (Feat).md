# Deafening Critical (Feat)
## Overview
Your critical hits cause enemies to lose their hearing.

**Prerequisites:** [[Critical Focus (Feat)|Critical Focus]], base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is permanently [[Deafened|deafened]]. A successful Fortitude save reduces the deafness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no effect on deaf creatures. This deafness can be cured by *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]*, *[[Regenerate (Spell)|regeneration]]*, *[[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|remove deafness]]*, or a similar ability.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [[Critical Mastery (Feat)|Critical Mastery]].
