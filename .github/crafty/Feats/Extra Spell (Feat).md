# Extra Spell (Feat)
## Overview
Your meditation and study have advanced your mind to such a degree that you can learn more magic.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13+, Wis 13+, Wizard leveI 3rd+.

**Benefit:** You can prepare one (and only one) extra spell of any level you can currently cast.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you may prepare an additional spell per day, however, never more than one spell of the same level. A 9th level wizard, with Extra Spell x3, could prepare an extra 5th, 4th, and 3rd level spell, but not 3 5th or 2 5th and a 4th.
