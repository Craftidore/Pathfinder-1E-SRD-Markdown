# Academic Priest (Feat)
## Overview
Your path to faith is more scholarly than those of other clerics.

**Prerequisites:** Intelligence 13+

**Benefit:** For the purpose of determining bonus divine spells per day and maximum divine spell level, your primary spellcasting ability is Intelligence. If you have more than one divine spellcasting class, the bonus applies to only one of those classes. Your spell save DCs are not affected by this change.

**Special:** You may only take this feat as a 1st-level character. If you take this feat more than once, it applies to a different divine spellcasting class each time. You may take this feat even if you have no divine spellcasting classes yet.

**Source:** Legends of the Twins (WotC), pg. 12
