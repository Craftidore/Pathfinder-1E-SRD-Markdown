# Shipwright (Feat)
## Overview
You are a master craftsman of all things nautical and naval.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) 3 ranks, [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) checks, and when you are building or repairing a boat, ship, or watercraft of any kind, use the item’s gp value as its sp value when determining your progress (do not multiply the item’s gp cost by 10 to determine its sp cost). When using [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) to repair a ship, you always take the minimum amount of time required based on the ship’s complexity and a complete repair costs only 1/20 the ship’s cost in raw materials.

If you have a set of artisan’s tools suitable for woodworking you can perform quick repairs on a boat, ship, or other watercraft. This takes 2d4 rounds
