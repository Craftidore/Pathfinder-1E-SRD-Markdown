# Wand Dancer (Feat)
## Overview
You are trained in a tradition of Garundi courtesans and court mages that melds dance with the use of magic wands.

**Prerequisite**: Dex 13, [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (dance) 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: When using a spell trigger item, you can move both before and after triggering the item, as long as the total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Choose one creature potentially affected by your spell trigger item. Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature only. You must move at least 5 feet before and after using your spell trigger item to utilize this feat.
