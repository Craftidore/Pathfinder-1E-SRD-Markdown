# Ranged Threat (Feat)
## Overview
You can take advantage of a foe who drops his guard near you.

**Prerequisite:** [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When armed with a ranged weapon, you threaten every square within 15 feet. If a target within this threatened area takes an action that provokes an attack of opportunity, you make one ranged attack at your highest attack bonus against that target. You may only use this feat once per round, and this counts as all of your attacks of opportunity for that round, even if you are normally allowed more than one.

**Special:** A fighter may selected Ranged Threat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
