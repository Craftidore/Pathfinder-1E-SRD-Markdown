# Master Craftsman (Feat)
## Overview
Your superior crafting skills allow you to create simple magic items.

**Prerequisites**: 5 ranks in any [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill. 

**Benefit**: Choose one [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill in which you possess at least 5 ranks. You receive a +2 bonus on your chosen [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill. Ranks in your chosen skill count as your caster level for the purposes of qualifying for the [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] and [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feats. You can create magic items using these feats, substituting your ranks in the chosen skill for your total caster level. You must use the chosen skill for the check to create the item. The DC to create the item still increases for any necessary spell requirements (see the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 of the *PF Core Rulebook*). You cannot use this feat to create any spell-trigger or spell-activation item.

**Normal**: Only spellcasters can qualify for the [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] and [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feats.
