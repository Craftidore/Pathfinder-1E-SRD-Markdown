# Twist Away (Feat)
## Overview
Your quick reflexes and dexterous movements make up for your lack of stamina.

**Prerequisite**: Evasion.

**Benefit**: While you are wearing light armor or no armor, if you are forced to attempt a Fortitude saving throw, you can use an immediate action to instead attempt a Reflex saving throw (at the same DC). If you succeed at this saving throw and the attack has a reduced effect on a successful save, you avoid the effect entirely. Whether the saving throw is successful or not, you are [[Staggered|staggered]] until the end of your next turn.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 158
