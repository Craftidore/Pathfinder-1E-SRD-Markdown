# Ranged Pin (Feat)
## Overview
You can perform a ranged grapple attempt against an opponent not adjacent to you.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** You can perform a ranged grapple attempt against an opponent by pinning a bit of its clothing to a nearby surface. The target must be within 5 feet of a wall, tree, or other surface in which a thrown weapon or projectile can be stuck and must be wearing some sort of clothing, armor, or other accoutrement. You must succeed on a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) and then win an opposed grapple check (your size modifier and the targetâ€™s size modifiers still apply). To break free, the victim must make a DC 15 Strength check or a DC 15 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check as a standard action.

**Special:** A fighter may select Ranged Pin as one of his fighter bonus feats. 

When using this feat, a character gains no benefit from the [[Improved Grapple (Feat)|Improved Grapple]] feat.
