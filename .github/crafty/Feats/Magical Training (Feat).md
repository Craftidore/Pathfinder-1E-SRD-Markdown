# Magical Training (Feat)
## Overview
You come from a land where cantrips are taught to all who have the aptitude to learn magic. Every crafter and artisan, it seems, knows a minor spell or two.

**Prerequisites:** Int 10 or Cha 10, elf (Evereska or Evermeet) or human (Halruaa or Nimbral).

**Benefit:** You can cast three 0-level arcane spells per day as either a sorcerer or wizard (your choice, so long as you have a score of at least 10 in the ability that controls the spellcasting for that class). You must make this decision when you first take the feat. Thereafter, you have an arcane spell failure chance if you wear armor and are treated as a sorcerer or wizard of your arcane spellcaster level (minimum 1st) for the purpose of determining level-based variables of the spells you cast.

If you choose to cast spells as a sorcerer, the DC for saves against your spells is 10 + your Cha modifier. You know two 0-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer/wizard list.

If you choose to cast spells as a wizard, the DC for saves against your spells is 10 + your Int modifier. You have a spellbook with three 0-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer/wizard list. You prepare your spells exactly as a wizard does.

**Special:** If you already have levels in sorcerer or wizard, increase the number of 0-level spells you can cast per day by three.

You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat provides the mandatory arcane casting requirement for the [[Dweomerkeeper (PrC)|Dweomerkeeper]] prestige class.
