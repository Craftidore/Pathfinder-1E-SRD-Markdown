# Battlefield Healer (Feat)
## Overview
In even the fiercest battles, you risk life and limb to save your allies.

**Prerequisite:** You must successfully cast a conjuration (healing) spell on an ally after being hit by an attack of opportunity, or have the Battle, Chaplain, or Healed background.

**Benefit:** When attempting a concentration check caused by receiving damage (including ongoing damage), you reduce the damage taken by 50% for the purposes of determining the concentration check DC.

**Goal:** Over time, provoke at least 20 attacks of opportunity for casting conjuration (healing) spells on allies. These spells donâ€™t have to succeed to count.

**Completion Benefit:** You automatically succeed at concentration checks for conjuration (healing) spells caused by taking damage.

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 67
