# Confounding Tumble Deed (Feat)
## Overview
You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.

**Prerequisites**: [[Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)|Amateur Swashbuckler]] feat or panache class feature, [[Canny Tumble (Feat)|Canny Tumble]], [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] 7 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you use [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move through an opponentâ€™s threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its armor class until the end of your next turn.
