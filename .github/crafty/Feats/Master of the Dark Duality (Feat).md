# Master of the Dark Duality (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the secrets of the Dark Duality.

**Prerequisite:** [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]], Cha, Int or Wis +24, ability to cast 7th-level spells or hexes.

**Benefit:** Your magic is now powered by the Dark Duality. 

Spells from the Illusion and Necromancy schools are cast with increased power and efficiency. Add a +2 bonus to the DC for all saving throws of spells you cast from those schools. Spells with the darkness descriptor or the shadow subschool add a +2 to the effective level at which they are cast. These bonuses are cumulative, so that a spell from the Necromancy school that has the darkness descriptor would have both a +2 to saving throw DCs and a +2 to the level it was effectively cast at.

These bonuses are cumulative with those from the [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]] feat.

Mastery of the Dark Duality removes all penalties (from the [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]] feat) for spells from the schools of Evocation and Transmutation as well as for spells with the light descriptor. 

Furthermore, Masters of the Dark Duality ignore disruptions to their spells from such things as dead or wild magic zones. Even an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* is often not enough to stop their spells. Dark Masters make a spell resistance check for each spell they cast while in *antimagic* areas, success means the spell functions normally.

Any attempt to identify spells cast by a Master of the Dark Duality through [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] have their DC increased by +5 (this penalty stacks with that from the [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]] feat). Spells and items which automatically identify spells in effect now require a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check.

**Special:** The permanent negative level gained by taking the [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]] feat is now removed.
