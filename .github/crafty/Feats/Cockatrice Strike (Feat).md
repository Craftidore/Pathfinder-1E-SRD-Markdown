# Cockatrice Strike (Feat)
## Overview
With a single strike, you transmute flesh to stone.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Gorgon's Fist (Feat)|Gorgon’s Fist]], [[Medusa's Wrath (Feat)|Medusa’s Wrath]], base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit**: As a full-round action, you can make a single unarmed strike against a [[Dazed|dazed]], [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Staggered|staggered]], [[Stunned|stunned]], or [[Unconscious|unconscious]] foe. If that attack is a critical hit, the target is [[Petrified|petrified]] unless it succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. This is a supernatural polymorph effect.
