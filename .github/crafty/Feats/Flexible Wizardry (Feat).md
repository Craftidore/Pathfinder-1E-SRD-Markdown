# Flexible Wizardry (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned a trick that makes your spellcasting more flexible.

**Prerequisites**: [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]], wizard level 1st+.

**Benefit**: When you prepare your spells each day, you can choose to keep a number of spell slots equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) flexibly prepared. Instead of preparing a single spell within each of these slots, you can partially prepare two spells. Anytime after you prepare these flexible slots, you can spend a full-round action to finalize one slot, choosing one of the two spells to be finished and fully prepared in that slot.
