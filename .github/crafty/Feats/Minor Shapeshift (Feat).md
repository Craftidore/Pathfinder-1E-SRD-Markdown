# Minor Shapeshift (Feat)
## Overview
Your mastery of shapeshifting magic allows you to reshape your flesh in small but significant ways.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 4th-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a polymorph spell of 4th level or higher available to cast, you can spend a swift action to grant yourself one of the following benefits:

*Might:* +2 bonus on melee damage rolls.

*Mobility:* +2 competence bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Balance and Jump), [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]],, and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks.

*Savagery:* Primary claw attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (assuming Medium size).

*Speed:* +5-foot enhancement bonus to any one movement mode you already possess.

*Vigor:* Temporary hit points equal to your HD.

The chosen benefit lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the highest-level polymorph spell you have available to cast. If you activate this feat a second time while a previous benefit is still in effect, the first benefit ends immediately.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting polymorph spells.
