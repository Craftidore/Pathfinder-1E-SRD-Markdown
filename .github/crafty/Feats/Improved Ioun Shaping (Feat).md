# Improved Ioun Shaping (Feat)
## Overview
Your skill at creating ioun stones far exceeds most.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], caster level 12+

**Benefit:** Your skill at creating ioun stones is so advanced you may choose one of the following benefits when crafting an ioun stone: when determining the gold piece cost in raw materials you need to craft any item, reduce the base price by 25%; or, when determining the time you need to craft any item, reduce the base time by 25%. You choose the benefit each time you craft an ioun stone. The benefit taken while using this feat stacks with any similar benefit from another crafting feat.
