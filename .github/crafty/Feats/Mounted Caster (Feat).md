# Mounted Caster (Feat)
## Overview
You are adept at casting while riding.

**Prerequisites**: [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] 1 rank, [[Mounted Combat (Feat)|Mounted Combat]].

**Benefits**: You can have a mount move both before and after you cast a spell, and cast a spell while your mount takes a run action, without needing to make a concentration check. You gain a +2 bonus to any concentration check you are forced to make while mounted.
