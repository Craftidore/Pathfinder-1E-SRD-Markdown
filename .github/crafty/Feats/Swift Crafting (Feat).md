# Swift Crafting (Feat)
## Overview
You can craft items both mundane and magical faster than most.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] 5 ranks or any item creation feat

**Benefit:** It takes you half as long to make non-magical items using [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills, and you treat magic items as being 20% cheaper for the purpose of determining how long it will take to create. This reduction does not stack with any other reduction in crafting time from class features, such as a vanguardâ€™s rapid construction ability.
