# Deny the Reaper (Feat)
## Overview
The lives you could not save stay with you to your final breath.

**Prerequisite:** You must have witnessed the death of a close companion in battle—a death that could have been prevented, such as from bleeding, failure to stabilize, or ongoing poison damage—or have the Death in the Family or The War background.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]], this bonus increases to +4. You can apply first aid as a move action and don’t take a penalty when treating deadly wounds without a healing kit.

**Goal:** Bring an ally back from the dead, including by using *[[Breath of Life (Spell)|breath of life]]* or *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*.

**Completion Benefit:** You and each ally within 10 feet of you gain a +2 bonus on saves against death effects. In addition, once per day you can spontaneously convert any 5th-level or higher conjuration (healing) spell into *[[Breath of Life (Spell)|breath of life]].*
