# Crossbow Mastery (Feat)
## Overview
You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 15, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point-Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Reload (Feat)|Rapid Reload]], [[Rapid Shot (Feat)|Rapid Shot]].

**Benefit**: The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can f ire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took [[Rapid Reload (Feat)|Rapid Reload]] no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.

**Special**: Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Crossbow Mastery as a combat style feat.
