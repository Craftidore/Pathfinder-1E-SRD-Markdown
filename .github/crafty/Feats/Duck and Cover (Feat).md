# Duck and Cover (Feat)
## Overview
Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.

**Benefit**: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, and both of you are required to make a Reflex saving throw against a spell or effect, you may take the result of your die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still apply to the roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your allyâ€™s result, you are knocked prone (or [[Staggered|staggered]] on your next turn, if you are already prone or cannot be knocked prone). In addition, you receive a +2 cover bonus to your AC against ranged attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield.
