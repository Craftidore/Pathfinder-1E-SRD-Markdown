# Studied Combatant (Feat)
## Overview
Your inspiration guides your strikes when you take a moment to assess your foe.

**Prerequisites**: Int 13, [[Amateur Investigator (Feat)|Amateur Investigator]], base attack bonus +6, 1 rank in at least one [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature.

**Benefit**: You can expend one use of inspiration as a move action to study a single enemy that you can see. When you do so, you gain a +2 insight bonus on melee attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit. Once affected by this feat, a target cannot be affect by your use of it again for 24 hours.
