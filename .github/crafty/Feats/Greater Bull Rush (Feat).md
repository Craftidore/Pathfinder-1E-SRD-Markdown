# Greater Bull Rush (Feat)
## Overview
Your bull rush attacks throw enemies off balance.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Bull Rush (Feat)|Improved Bull Rush]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

**Benefit**: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to bull rush a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Improved Bull Rush (Feat)|Improved Bull Rush]]. Whenever you bull rush an opponent, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

**Normal**: Creatures moved by bull rush do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
