# Aim for the Clouds (Feat)
## Overview
You are able disrupt a spellcaster with a well placed shot.

**Prerequisites:** Base Attack Bonus 1+, Initiative 2+

**Benefit:** Once per encounter, you may use one iterative attack to fire an arrow up into the air and cause it to strike an enemy spell caster as they are finishing their incantation in the same round. This is a standard ranged attack; a successful attack this way causes no damage, but forces the target to make a successful Concentration check (DC of 10 + half your level) or else they lose the spell they are trying to cast.

**Special:** A fighter may select Aim for the Clouds as one of his fighter bonus feats.
