# Mental Fortitude (Feat)
## Overview
The mental and spiritual disciplines you practice allow you to fortify the weakness of your body with the strength of your mind and personality.

**Prerequisite:** [[Mind Over Body (Feat)|Mind Over Body]].

**Benefit:** You may use your Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier (your choice) to determine your bonus hit points. Once this decision is made, it permanently replaces your Constitution modifier for all purposes. If you can cast arcane spells, you get a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class for every  three item creation feats you possess. This insight bonus stacks with that provided by metamagic feats possessed using the [[Mind Over Body (Feat)|Mind over Body]] feat.

**Normal:** Your Constitution modifier determines bonus hit points.

**Source:** The Mage's Tower
