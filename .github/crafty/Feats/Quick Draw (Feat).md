# Quick Draw (Feat)
## Overview
You can draw weapons faster than most.

**Prerequisite**: Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit**: You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] skill) as a move action.

A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).

Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.

**Normal**: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.
