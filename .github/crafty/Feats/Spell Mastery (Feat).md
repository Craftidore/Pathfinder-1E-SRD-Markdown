# Spell Mastery (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered a small handful of spells, and can prepare these spells without referencing your spellbooks at all.

**Prerequisite**: 1st-level wizard.

**Benefit**: Each time you take this feat, choose a number of spells that you already know equal to your Intelligence modifier. From that point on, you can prepare these spells without referring to a spellbook.

**Normal**: Without this feat, you must use a spellbook to prepare all your spells, except *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]**.*
