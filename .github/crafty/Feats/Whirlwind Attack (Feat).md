# Whirlwind Attack (Feat)
## Overview
You can strike out at every foe within reach.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, Int 13, [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]], base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit**: When you use the full-attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must make a separate attack roll against each opponent.

When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.
