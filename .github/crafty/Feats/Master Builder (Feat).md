# Master Builder (Feat)
## Overview
You are a master at designing and coordinating construction for massive objects. 

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Vehicles, Ships, Siege Engines, Sculptures, Stonemasonry or Carpentry) 5 ranks, or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Architect or Mason) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus to whatever skill you used to meet this featâ€™s prerequisite. Whenever you use a craft or profession skill to create vehicles, ships, siege engines, statues of large size or bigger, buildings, or fortifications, you cut the required time to complete the job in half. In addition, you gain a +3 bonus instead of +2 from every person who succeeds at their aid another check, even unskilled workers.

If you wish, you may divide the required time to craft the above objects in half, but doing so results in the crafted object possessing half its usual hit points.
