# Eschew Materials (Feat)
## Overview
You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material components.

**Benefit**: You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.
