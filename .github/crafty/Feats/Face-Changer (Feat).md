# Face-Changer (Feat)
## Overview
Your mastery of illusions allows you to subtly alter your appearance at whim.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a glamer spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can alter your appearance as the spell *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]*, except that the duration lasts 1 minute per level of the glamer spell.

This illusory transformation requires a full-round action to activate.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting glamer spells.
