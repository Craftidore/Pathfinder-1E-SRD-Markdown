# Extend Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You can make your spells last twice as long.

**Benefit**: An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level.
