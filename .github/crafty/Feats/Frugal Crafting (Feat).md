# Frugal Crafting (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the art of crafting on the cheap.

**Prerequisite:** Any item creation feat or any ranks in [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]].

**Benefit:** The cost of creating magic items is reduced to 1/3 its base cost in raw materials. The cost of crafting nonmagic items is reduced to 1/4 its base cost in raw materials.

*Commentary*â€”Essentially, this feat just saves you money. Its value depends a bit on the type of campaign you play in. If gold is tight, it may well be of great value; if gold is plentiful, this feat does little to strengthen your character.
