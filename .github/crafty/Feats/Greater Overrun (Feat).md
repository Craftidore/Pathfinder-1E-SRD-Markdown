# Greater Overrun (Feat)
## Overview
Enemies must dive to avoid your dangerous move.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Overrun (Feat)|Improved Overrun]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

**Benefit**: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Improved Overrun (Feat)|Improved Overrun]]. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked prone by your overrun.

**Normal**: Creatures knocked prone by your overrun do not provoke an attack of opportunity.
