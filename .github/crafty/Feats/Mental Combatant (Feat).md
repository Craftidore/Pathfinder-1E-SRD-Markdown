# Mental Combatant (Feat)
## Overview
You look for weaknesses in your opponent's fighting style, helping you to stay away from his weapon.

**Prerequisite:** Int 13+, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]].

**Benefit:** During your action, designate an opponent. You receive a dodge bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Intelligence modifier against all attacks from that opponent.

**Special:** Any condition that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also makes you lose dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses stack with each other.
