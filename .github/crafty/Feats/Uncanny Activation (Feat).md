# Uncanny Activation (Feat)
## Overview
You can coax greater power out of magical devices.

**Prerequisite:** [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] 12 ranks.

**Benefit:** If you exceed the [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] DC to activate a spell completion or spell trigger item by 5 or more, you can increase the item’s caster level by 1 for determining the spell’s effect. Alternatively, if you exceed the [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] DC by 10 or more when activating a magic item with charges, you can expend an additional charge to increase the caster level by 2 levels. Regardless, you can’t increase an item’s caster level to one that is higher than your own caster level.
