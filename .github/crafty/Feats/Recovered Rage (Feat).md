# Recovered Rage (Feat)
## Overview
You regain rounds of rage or raging performance when you drop a foe.

**Prerequisite**: Rage or raging song class feature.

**Benefit**: Whenever you reduce a foe to 0 or fewer hit points while you are raging or using raging song, you regain 1 round of rage or raging song (your choice if you have both abilities), as long as the number of Hit Dice that foe possesses are equal to or greater than 1/2 your character level. You cannot use this feat to regain more rounds of rage or raging song than your daily maximum number of rounds.
