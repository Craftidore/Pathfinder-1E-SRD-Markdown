# Residual Spell (Feat)
## Overview
Residual eldritch energy from your spell continues to harm your enemies after the spell’s main effect has expired.

**Benefit:** The feat can be applied to any one instantaneous spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, such as *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* or *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]*. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of energy persist, dealing 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type at the beginning of your next turn to all creatures initially damaged by the spell. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. A residual spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from Lingering Spell to Residual Spell to avoid duplication.
