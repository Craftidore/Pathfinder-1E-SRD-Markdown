# Arcane Master Craftsman (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the skills needed to craft magic items.

**Prerequisite:** Any item creation feat, [[Arcane Craftsman (Feat)|Arcane Craftsman]], arcane caster level 7+.

**Benefit:** When you make an item with using an item creation feat and [[Arcane Craftsman (Feat)|Arcane Craftsman]], you receive a 50% bonus to either the cost or time instead of 25% (for the [[Arcane Craftsman (Feat)|Arcane Craftsman]] feat).

**Special:** You may gain Arcane Master Craftsman up to two times. The second time it is taken, it applies to the other option; it cannot be taken twice for the same benefit.
