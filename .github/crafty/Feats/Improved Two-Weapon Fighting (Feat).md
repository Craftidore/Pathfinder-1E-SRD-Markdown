# Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at fighting with two weapons.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 17, [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: In addition to the standard single extra attack you get with an off-hand weapon, you get a second attack with it, albeit at a â€“5 penalty.

**Normal**: Without this feat, you can only get a single extra attack with an off-hand weapon.
