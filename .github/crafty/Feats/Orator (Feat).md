# Orator (Feat)
## Overview
Youâ€™re able to construct statements and commands that are much more convincing than their content would otherwise suggest.

**Prerequisite**: [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]]).

**Benefit**: You can use a [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] check in place of a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check to tell a falsehood or conceal information, in place of a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check to change the attitude of a creature, or in place of an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to force a creature to cooperate. You must deliver your attempt in a language the target understands.
