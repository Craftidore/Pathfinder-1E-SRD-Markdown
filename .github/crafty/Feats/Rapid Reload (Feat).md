# Rapid Reload (Feat)
## Overview
Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload such weapons quickly. 

**Prerequisite**: Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).

**Benefit**: The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.

If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

**Normal**: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.

**Special**: You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.
