# Spontaneous Healer (Feat)
## Overview
You can use your spellcasting ability to spontaneously cast cure spells.

**Prerequisite:** [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) 4 ranks, nonevil alignment, able to cast any cure wounds spell.

**Benefit:** You can use your spellcasting ability to spontaneously cast cure spells (from your class spell list) just as a cleric can. You may use this ability a total number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.

**Source:** Complete Divine (WotC), pg. 84

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Archivists use their Intelligence modifier in place of their Wisdom modifier to determine the total number of times per day this ability may be used.
