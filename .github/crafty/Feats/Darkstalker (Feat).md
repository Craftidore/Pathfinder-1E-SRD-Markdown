# Darkstalker (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned how to stalk and surprise creatures whose senses are very different from those of a humanoid.

**Benefit:** When you hide, creatures with blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense must make a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5: Listen check or a Spot check; whichever DC is higher) to notice you, just as sighted creatures would make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to detect you. You cannot hide in plain sight unless you have that ability as a class feature. In addition, you can flank creatures that have the all-around vision special quality.

**Normal:** Creatures with these senses do not need to make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5: Spot or Listen) checks to notice other creatures within range. Creatures with all-around vision canâ€™t be flanked.
