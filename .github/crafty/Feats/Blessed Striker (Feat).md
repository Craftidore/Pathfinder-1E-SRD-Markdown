# Blessed Striker (Feat)
## Overview
You attacks are augmented by the strength of your and your deity’s shared alignment.

**Prerequisites**: Base attack bonus +11, ability to cast divine spells, alignment must be within one step of your deity’s.

**Benefit**: All of your attacks are treated as having whatever alignment components you and your deity share for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Special**: If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity or no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the *[[Atonement (Spell)|atonement]]* spell on page 245 of the *Core Rulebook*).
