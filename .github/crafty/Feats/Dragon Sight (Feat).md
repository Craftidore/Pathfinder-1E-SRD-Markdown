# Dragon Sight (Feat)
## Overview
Your vision is sharper than normal, much like that of a dragon.

**Prerequisite:** [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Darkvision]] or [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]]. 

**Benefit:** The range of your [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]], if any, extends to 120 feet. If you do not possess [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]], this aspect of Dragon Sight has no effect.

If you have [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]], you now instead see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light. If you do not possess [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]], this aspect of Dragon Sight has no effect.
