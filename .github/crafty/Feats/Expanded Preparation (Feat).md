# Expanded Preparation (Feat)
## Overview
You can prepare more spells than other arcanists can.

**Prerequisite**: Arcanist level 1st.

**Benefit**: You gain an extra spell slot of the highest level you can cast. This is in addition to the number of spell slots you can normally prepare from your spellbook. You can instead add two spell slots, but both of these spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast as an arcanist. You must choose which benefit you gain when you take this feat.

**Special**: You can take this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you can choose either benefit.
