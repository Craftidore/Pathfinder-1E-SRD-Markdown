# Dimensional Jaunt (Feat)
## Overview
With a single step, you can cross an entire room. 

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 4th-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a teleportation spell of 4th level or higher available to cast, you can spend a standard action to teleport yourself and carried objects up to your heavy load a distance of 5 feet per level of the highest-level teleportation spell you have available to cast. You can teleport only to a location that you can see (including one you are currently scrying). You canâ€™t bring along another creature (except for a familiar).

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting teleportation spells.
