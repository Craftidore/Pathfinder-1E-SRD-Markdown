# Long Days (Feat)
## Overview
Your ability to craft is far beyond others, allowing you to get more done than most can in a day.

**Prerequisite:** Any item creation feat, Int 17+

**Benefit:** You may work for more than 8 hours a day on a crafting project when not adventuring. You have the ability to divide the day up into 3 8-hour blocks of time; two of which you may use for the purpose of crafting. This means you may craft for up to 16 hours per day. At least one of the 3 blocks of time must be used for rest and personal maintenance.

**Normal:** You can work for up to 8 hours each day. You cannot rush the process by working longer each day, but the days need not be consecutive, and you can use the rest of your time as you sees fit. If you are out adventuring, you can devote 4 hours each day to item creation, although you net only 2 hoursâ€™ worth of work. This time is not spent in one continuous period, but rather during lunch, morning preparation, and during watches at night. If time is dedicated to creation, it must be spent in uninterrupted 4-hour blocks. This work is generally done in a controlled environment, where distractions are at a minimum, such as a laboratory or shrine. Work that is performed in a distracting or dangerous environment nets only half the amount of progress (just as with the adventuring caster).

You can work on only one item at a time. If you start work on a new item, all materials used on the under-construction item are wasted.
