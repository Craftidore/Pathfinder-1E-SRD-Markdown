# Greater Dirge of Doom (Feat)
## Overview
The haunting sound of sepulchral intonations chills the most stalwart adversary to its very core.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Dirge of Doom (Feat)|Improved Dirge of Doom]], ability to perform dirge of doom.

**Benefit**: The effect of your dirge of doom lingers with a target for 2 rounds after the creature leaves the dirgeâ€™s area of effect. If you use your dirge on a creature that is [[Shaken|shaken]], it becomes [[Frightened|frightened]]. If you use it on a creature that is [[Frightened|frightened]], it becomes [[Panicked|panicked]].

**Normal**: Fear effects on a creature end immediately once it leaves the area of dirge of doom. A fear effect cannot be made more extreme by dirge of doom and can be changed only to the [[Frightened|frightened]] condition by the [[Improved Dirge of Doom (Feat)|Improved Dirge of Doom]] feat.
