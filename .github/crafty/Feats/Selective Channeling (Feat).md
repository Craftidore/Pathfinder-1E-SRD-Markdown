# Selective Channeling (Feat)
## Overview
You can choose whom to affect when you channel energy.

**Prerequisite**: Cha 13, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit**: When you channel energy, you can choose a number of targets in the area up to your Charisma modifier. These targets are not affected by your channeled energy.

**Normal**: All targets in a 30-foot burst are affected when you channel energy. You can only choose whether or not you are affected.
