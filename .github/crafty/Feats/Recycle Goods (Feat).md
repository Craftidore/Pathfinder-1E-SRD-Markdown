# Recycle Goods (Feat)
## Overview
You never let goods go to waste.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (any) 1 rank.

**Benefit:** By spending 1 hour per 1,000 gp of the cost of an item (rounded up), you can break it down into raw material components. This requires you succeed on the appropriate [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check required to make a week’s progress in creating the item, and compensates you with raw components equal to that item’s cost, which can be used to craft similar items. Magic items can be broken down in this way, but any items created from those materials must carry at least one special ability or magical property that the original item had (or, at the GM’s discretion, a related ability, such as breaking down a *wand of fireballs* and using the material to craft a *+2 [[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]] [[Longsword|longsword]]*).
