# Clutch of Earth (Feat)
## Overview
You briefly increase the earth's pull on the target creature.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have an earth spell of 2nd level or higher available to cast, you can spend a standard action to reduce the speed of any landbound creature within 30 feet of you. The creature's normal land speed, as well as its burrow and climb speeds, decrease by 5 feet per level of the highest-level earth spell you have available to cast, to a minimum speed of 5 feet. This effect lasts for 1 round.

A successful Fortitude save negates this effect and renders the target immune to the feat's effect for 24 hours. Creatures currently swimming or flying are immune to this effect.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting earth spells.
