# Empower Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You can increase the power of your spells, causing them to deal more damage.

**Benefit**: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half.

Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spellâ€™s actual level.
