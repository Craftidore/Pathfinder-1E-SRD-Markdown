# Raging Absorption (Feat)
## Overview
You can absorb hostile spell energy to refuel your continued bloodrage.

**Prerequisites**: Ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager spells, bloodrage class feature.

**Benefit**: While you are bloodraging, if you successfully save against a damaging arcane spell that either targets you or includes you in its area, and you take no damage from that spell, you can absorb a portion of its arcane energy to replenish your bloodrage. You regain 1 round of bloodrage for every 2 levels of the spell you successfully saved against. You cannot use this feat to regain more rounds of bloodrage than your daily maximum number of rounds.
