# Eidetic Spellcaster (Feat)
## Overview
Unlike other wizards, you can see within your mind the intricate arcane symbols, words, and gestures that define your spells. Your photographic memory acts as your spellbook, inscribing the spells you know within your mind.

**Prerequisites:** Int 17+, wizard level 1st.

**Benefit:** You do not need a spellbook, either to record spells you know or to prepare known spells. You can learn spells normally, either through gaining levels in wizard or learning from other spellbooks, and you must pay all the normal costs for learning new spells (used instead in special incenses rather than inks), but you do not need to put them into a spellbook.

**Source:** Dragon Magazine #357, pg. 88

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The special requirement of taking this feat only at 1st level means the first level of wizard, not necessarily the first 'character' level.

*Note:* This feat duplicates the Eidetic Spellcaster variant wizard class abilities from the Class Acts: Transversed Arcana article in Dragon Magazine #357 (pg. 88). This was done since some campaigns may not allow variant class abilities as detailed in Player's Handbook II (v3.5).
