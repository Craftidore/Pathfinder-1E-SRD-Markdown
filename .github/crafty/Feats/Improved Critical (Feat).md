# Improved Critical (Feat)
## Overview
Attacks made with your chosen weapon are quite deadly.

**Prerequisite**: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit**: When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is doubled.

**Special**: You can gain Improved Critical multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.

This effect doesnâ€™t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
