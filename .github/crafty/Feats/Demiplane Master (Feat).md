# Demiplane Master (Feat)
## Overview
You have greater control over demiplanes that you have created.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to cast either *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]], [[Create Demiplane, Greater (Spell)|create greater demiplane]], [[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|create lesser demiplane]],* or *[[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]]* spells.

**Benefits:** Your skill at casting *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]], [[Create Demiplane, Greater (Spell)|create greater demiplane]], [[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|create lesser demiplane]],* or *[[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]]* spells is such that you get an additional planar trait if casting the spell grants one. Also, should you desire to make your demiplane permanent the cost of doing so is reduced by 1,000 gp per caster level.
