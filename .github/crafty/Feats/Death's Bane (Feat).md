# Death's Bane (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned to know your undead foes and their weaknesses..

**Benefit:** You can make sneak attacks against undead creatures. However, you roll only one-half your normal sneak attack dice (rounded down) when determining bonus damage for such attacks. 

**Special:** When attacking an undead and are using an attack that does not suffer a miss chance against incorporeal opponents (like a ghost touch weapon), you can score critical hits against incorporeal undead.

This also allows you to use abilities and actions that only work against creatures subject to critical hits, such as coup de grace and sneak attack. A undead need never make a Fortitude save to survive a coup-de-grace.
