# Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)
## Overview
Though not a swashbuckler, you have and can use panache.

**Prerequisite**: No levels in a class that has the panache class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbuckler’s deeds class feature; once chosen, this deed cannot be changed.

At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points up to a maximum of your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the swashbuckler’s panache class feature. You can spend these panache points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.

**Special**: If you gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the [[Extra Panache (Feat)|Extra Panache]] feat.
