# Cooperative Crafting (Feat)
## Overview
Your assistance makes item crafting far more efficient.

**Prerequisites:** 1 rank in any [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill, any item creation feat.

**Benefit:** You can assist another character in crafting mundane and magical items. You must both possess the relevant [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill or item creation feat, but either one of you can fulfill any other prerequisites for crafting the item. You provide a +2 circumstance bonus on any [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks related to making an item, and your assistance doubles the gp value of items that can be crafted each day.
