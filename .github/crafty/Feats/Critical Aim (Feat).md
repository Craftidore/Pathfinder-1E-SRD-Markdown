# Critical Aim (Feat)
## Overview
You have become an expert marksman, enabling you to strike vulnerable spots with ruthless efficiency.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with a ranged weapon, [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], and [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]] with that ranged weapon, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** When firing your chosen weapon, your critical multiplier is increased by one (f*or example, a x3 critical multiplier becomes x4*).

**Special:** This feat may only be chosen with a ranged weapon. You may gain this feat more than once, choosing a different weapon for which you meet the prerequisites each time.

This effect does not stack with any other effect that increases the critical multiplier of a given weapon, but it does stack with the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat and other effects that increase a weaponâ€™s threat range (*though such effects still do not stack with each other*).

**Source:** UndeFEATable, the Collected Feats Sourcebook (LPJ Design), pg. 17

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Was previously known as Deadly Aim (UndeFEATable 6: Rangers, pg. 2) but name was changed by publisher to avoid duplication with core feat of the same name.
