# Additional Traits (Feat)
## Overview
You have more traits than normal.

**Benefit**: You gain two [[Character Traits|character traits]] of your choice (see Chapter 8 of the *Advanced Player's Guide*). These traits must be chosen from different lists, and cannot be chosen from lists from which you have already selected a character trait. You must meet any additional qualifications for the [[Character Traits|character traits]] you choose.

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide, pg. 150

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Removed the restriction that traits taken using this feat cannot be chosen from lists from which you have already selected a character trait.
