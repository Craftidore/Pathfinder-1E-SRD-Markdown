# Unseat (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at unseating your mounted opponents.

**Prerequisites**: Str 13, [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] 1 rank, [[Mounted Combat (Feat)|Mounted Combat]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], [[Improved Bull Rush (Feat)|Improved Bull Rush]], base attack bonus +1.

**Benefits**: When charging an opponent while mounted and wielding a [[Lance|lance]], resolve the attack as normal. If it hits, you may immediately make a free bull rush attempt in addition to the normal damage. If successful, the target is knocked off his horse and lands prone in a space adjacent to his mount that is directly away from you.
