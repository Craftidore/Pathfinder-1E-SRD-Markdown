# Disable Dweomer (Feat)
## Overview
You can disable a magic item, suppressing it for a short time.

**Prerequisites**: [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] 5 ranks, [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] 5 ranks, trapfinding.

**Benefit**: You can use [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to suppress the magic of a non-artifact magic item for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the suppression. Using [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] in this way takes 2d4 rounds, with a DC of 15 + the itemâ€™s caster level.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 144
