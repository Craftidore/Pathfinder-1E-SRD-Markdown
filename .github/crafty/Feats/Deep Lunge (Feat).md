# Deep Lunge (Feat)
## Overview
You can use your expert footwork to attack at great range

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +1

**Benefit:** When wearing light armor or no armor, you may treat any one-handed piercing weapon as a reach weapon. Reach attacks made using this feat provoke attacks of opportunity from anyone who threatens you. After the attack, you may choose to make a free five-foot step towards the enemy you attacked.

**Special:** A fighter may select Deep Lunge as a fighter bonus feat.

**Historical Note:** The exact origins of the lunge are debatable, but most 16th century fencing manuals include a similar type of attack. Notably, Camillo Paladini advises against the long lunge (because your opponent has the opportunity to counter). By the 17th century, the lunge was widespread, although in 1610 Ridolfo Capo Ferro calls it “the incredible increase of the long thrust.”
