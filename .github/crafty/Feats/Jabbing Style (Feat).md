# Jabbing Style (Feat)
## Overview
A cluster of quick strikes deals more damage than a single roundhouse swing.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]]; base attack bonus +6, brawlerâ€™s flurry class feature, or flurry of blows class feature.

**Benefit**: Once per round, when you hit a single target with two unarmed strikes, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to that target. That extra damage is added to the damage of your second attack. If you hit a single target with three or more unarmed strikes, you instead deal an extra 2d6 points of damage, which is added to your final unarmed strike against the target during the round.
