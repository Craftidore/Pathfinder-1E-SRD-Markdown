# Aberrant Dragonmark (Feat)
## Overview
Although you are not a recognized member of one of the dragonmarked families, you have manifested a dragonmark.

**Prerequisite:** Dragonmarked race (human, dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half-elf, or half-orc).

**Benefit:** This feat provides you with a single dragonmark spell-like ability that is not directly tied to the trueborn dragonmarked houses. All aberrant mark spell-like abilities can be used once per day.

When you select this feat, you must choose an aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability from the following list. You can never improve this mark in any way, and you can never gain a second mark. A character with one of the true dragonmarks (least, lesser, or greater) cannot select this feat, and a character with this feat cannot later select one of the true dragonmark feats. 

A saving throw against your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability has a DC of 10 + spell level + your Cha modifier. (Spell level for an aberrant dragonmark ability is always 1st.)

Your caster level for your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability is one-half your character level.

**Aberrant Mark Powers:** *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]**,* *[[Cause Fear (Spell)|cause fear]]**,* *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]**,* *[[Chill Touch (Spell)|chill touch]]**,* *[[Detect Secret Doors (Spell)|detect secret doors]]**,* *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]**,* *[[Floating Disk (Spell)|floating disk]]**,* *[[Inflict Light Wounds (Spell)|inflict light wounds]]**,* *[[Jump (Spell)|jump]]**,* *[[Light (Spell)|light]]**,* *[[Pass Without Trace (Spell)|pass without trace]]**,* *[[Produce Flame (Spell)|produce flame]]**,* *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]**.*

Aberrant dragonmarks are mutations that appear occasionally among the dragonmarked races (usually to those not of a dragonmarked house) that can be traced back to the blood lines of corrupted dragonmarked families eliminated in the War of the Mark. At a quick glance, an aberrant mark could be mistaken for an established dragonmark, but on close inspection its differences are readily apparent.
