# Borne Aloft (Feat)
## Overview
You can channel the magic of the winds to briefly grant you flight.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 5th-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have an air spell of 5th level or higher available to cast, you can fly up to 30 feet (perfect maneuverability) as a move action once per round. You must begin and end this flight solidly supported, or you fall. You can't use this ability if you wear heavy armor or carry a heavy load.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting air spells.
