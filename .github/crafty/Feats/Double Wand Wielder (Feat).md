# Double Wand Wielder (Feat)
## Overview
You can activate two wands at the same time.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]].

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can wield a wand in each hand (if you have both hands free), with one wand designated as your primary wand and the other your secondary wand. Each use of the secondary wand expends 2 charges from it instead of 1.

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pg. 77
