# Blooded Arcane Strike (Feat)
## Overview
Arcane energy guides your devastating attack.

**Prerequisites**: [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]], ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage class feature.

**Benefit**: While you are bloodraging, you don’t need to spend a swift action to use your [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]]—it is always in effect. When you use this ability with [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], [[Improved Vital Strike (Feat)|Improved Vital Strike]], or [[Greater Vital Strike (Feat)|Greater Vital Strike]], the bonus on damage rolls for [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]] is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you roll damage dice for one of those feats.
