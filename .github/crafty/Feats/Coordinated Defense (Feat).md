# Coordinated Defense (Feat)
## Overview
You are adept at working with allies to avoid being tripped, grappled, and subjected to other maneuvers.

**Benefit**: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense. This bonus increases to +4 if the creature attempting the maneuver is larger than both you and your ally.
