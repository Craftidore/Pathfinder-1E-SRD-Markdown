# Counterpunch (Feat)
## Overview
With deft reflexes, you capitalize on opponentsâ€™ mistake.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 18, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +16 or brawler level 12th.

**Benefit**: Once per round, when you are fighting unarmed with both hands free and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You must use an unarmed strike for attack of opportunity.
