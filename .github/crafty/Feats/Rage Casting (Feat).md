# Rage Casting (Feat)
## Overview
Your blood is raw and potent power, and you can burn it to empower your spells.

**Prerequisites**: Blood casting class feature.

**Benefit**: When you cast a bloodrager spell, as a swift action you can sacrifice some of your life force to augment the spellâ€™s potency. You can opt to take up to 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the spell you are casting, choosing the amount of dice before rolling. You cannot overcome this damage in any way, and it cannot be taken from temporary hit points. For each of these damage dice you roll, the DC of the spell you are casting increases by 1.
