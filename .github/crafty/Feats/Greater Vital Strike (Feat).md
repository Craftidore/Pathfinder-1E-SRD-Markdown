# Greater Vital Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You can make a single attack that deals incredible damage.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Vital Strike (Feat)|Improved Vital Strike]], [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit**: When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the damage dice for the attack four times and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]*), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally).
