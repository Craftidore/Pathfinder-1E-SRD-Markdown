# Esoteric Advantage (Feat)
## Overview
You’re able to discern subtle and ineffable flaws in a creature’s defenses.

**Prerequisite:** [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks. 

**Benefit:** After identifying an individual creature with a successful [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill check, you can spend a move action to adapt your tactics to reduce that individual’s natural defenses. Choose one of the following abilities that you identified: damage reduction, energy resistance, or spell resistance. For the next 24 hours you treat the selected ability as if it were 2 lower, to a minimum of 0 (for instance, you would treat DR 5/magic as if it were DR 3/magic). You can only benefit from this feat against one single creature at a time. If you use this feat to adapt your tactics to another individual before 24 hours have passed since you last adapted to a creature, the benefit provided against the first individual ends and is replaced by the benefit against the second individual. You can switch which identified creature you have adapted your tactics to (including which special ability you wish to treat as lower) as a move action.
