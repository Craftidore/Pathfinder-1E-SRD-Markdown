# Without a Trace (Feat)
## Overview
You’re able to use your ninjitsu art to completely vanish from your opponent’s senses.

**Prerequisites**: No trace class feature.

**Benefit**: Whenever you are using [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] to hide, creatures with [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], or [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] do not automatically detect you; they must succeed at a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to locate and notice you. This also applies to abilities that function as [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]] or [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], such as [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]] or [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|lifesense]]. In addition, *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* or concealment that you gain as a result of the effects of your [[Ninja Tricks|ninja tricks]] (such as darkfall or vanishing step) is not irrelevant to creatures with [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]] or [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]], allowing you to use those effects to hide normally. Finally, whenever you encounter a creature with [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]], or [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]], you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks against them as a result of the nervousness they instinctively feel at being unable to detect you with such abilities.
