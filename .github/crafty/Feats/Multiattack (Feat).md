# Multiattack (Feat)
## Overview
This creature is particularly skilled at making attacks with its natural weapons.

**Prerequisite:** Three or more natural attacks.

**Benefit:** The creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take only a –2 penalty.

**Normal:** Without this feat, the creature’s secondary attacks with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.

**GM Note**

**Multiple Arms**

All kinds of questions come up when you end up with more than two arms. The way the multiweapon feats are written, they assume each hand has its own weapon. It would be clearer if the rules simply addressed primary and secondary weapons as is done with natural attacks, but that is not the case. I would say, it’s best considered that each weapon other than the one that is claimed as the main-hand weapon is “off-hand,” no matter how many hands it has.

The rules say an off-hand weapon always does 1/2 Strength damage, but I would modify that to being 1/2 Strength less than normal to keep the balance between extra hands and extra attacks. Multihanded Weapon avoids that by using [[Double Slice (Feat)|Double Slice]] as a prerequisite, which means off-hand damage is normalized, and the 1/2 damage per hand rule covers all situations.

A reader may ask “Can a six-armed monster use three long bows at the same time?” I’d say yes, but the rules are not explicit there either. Worse yet, how many crossbows can a six-armed monster reload in one action? A strict reading would say only one but the spirit of the simulation suggests three.
