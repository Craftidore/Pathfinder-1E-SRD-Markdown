# Magic Sensitive (Feat)
## Overview
You literally see the emanations of magic around you.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a divination spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can sense magical auras (as if you had cast *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*). The range of your detection is equal to 5 feet per level of the highest-level divination spell you have available to cast. Activating or concentrating on this ability requires a standard action.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting divination spells.
