# Battlecaster Offense (Feat)
## Overview
You cunningly mix melee combat and spellcasting to increase the potency of both.

**Prerequisites:** [[Combat Casting (Feat)|Combat Casting]] or warmage edge, base attack bonus +1, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** The Battlecaster Offense feat allows the use of two tactical maneuvers.

*Spell and Sword:* If you deal damage to a foe with a spell, you gain a +1 bonus on your first melee attack roll made against that foe in the next round.

*Sword and Spell:* If you make a melee attack against a foe, you gain a +1 bonus to the save DC of the first spell you use against that foe in the next round. This bonus applies only against the foe or foes you attacked, not against any other creatures affected by the spell.
