# Mind Over Body (Feat)
## Overview
The aesthetics and mystics of your homeland have learned to overcome the frailties of the body with the unyielding power of the mind.

**Prerequisite:** *Forgotten Realms:* Elf (Silverymoon or Snow Eagle Aerie), half-elf (Silverymoon), human (Calimshan, 

                             Mulhorand, Shou Expatriate, or Thay), planetouched (Calimshan or Thay), or spirit folk (Ashane).

                         *Greyhawk:* Cha 15 or Int 15, 1st level character

**Benefit:** At 1st level, you may use your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice) to determine your bonus hit points. For all subsequent levels, you use your Constitution modifier, as normal. In addition, you gain +1 hit point every time you learn a metamagic feat. Furthermore, if you can cast arcane spells, you get a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class.

**Special:** You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** Removed regional prerequisites for general play outside of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.
