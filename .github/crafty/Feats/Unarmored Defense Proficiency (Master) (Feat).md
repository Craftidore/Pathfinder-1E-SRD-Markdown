# Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Master) (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the ability to defend yourself when wearing no armor.

**Prerequisites:** [[Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Beginner) (Feat)|Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Beginner)]], [[Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Intermediate) (Feat)|Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Intermediate)]].

**Benefits:** The bonus to your character's AC granted by the intermediate version of this feat is replaced with the following chart:


| **Level** | **Bonus** |  | **Level** | **Bonus** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | +7 |  | 11 | +12 |
| 2 | +8 |  | 12 | +13 |
| 3 | +8 |  | 13 | +13 |
| 4 | +9 |  | 14 | +14 |
| 5 | +9 |  | 15 | +14 |
| 6 | +10 |  | 16 | +15 |
| 7 | +10 |  | 17 | +15 |
| 8 | +11 |  | 18 | +16 |
| 9 | +11 |  | 19 | +16 |
| 10 | +12 |  | 20 | +17 |

**Special:** This bonus is applied even when your character is caught [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] or is denied his Dex modifier to his AC.

This bonus is an increase to the character's base AC and thus is not named.
