# Eldritch Researcher (Feat)
## Overview
You seek new applications for magical energy.

**Prerequisite:** You must have created a new spell, or have The Way Things Work background.

**Benefit:** When casting a spell you’ve created, add 1 to your caster level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]], this bonus increases to +4.

**Goal:** Create a new spell of at least 6th level.

**Completion Benefit:** The save DCs for any spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them. In addition, when applying metamagic feats to self-created spells, reduce the total level adjustment by 1. You can’t reduce metamagic costs to lower than the spell’s original level in this manner.

**Special:** For a self-created spell to benefit from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, *[[Delayed Blast Fireball (Spell)|delayed blast fireball]]* as compared to *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*) gain no benef it. Alchemists can benefit from this feat as though their formulae and extracts were spells.
