# Seize Advantage (Feat)
## Overview
You can take advantage of your foes when they overcommit on their attacks.

**Prerequisites**: Opportune parry and riposte deed.

**Benefit**: When your foe is using [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] and you successfully use the opportune parry and riposte deed to parry its attack and then respond with a riposte, you add your foe’s current bonus on damage rolls from [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] to your own damage roll, but you do not take the penalty to hit from your foe’s [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]].
