# Ioun Bond (Feat)
## Overview
You have chosen to link the power of your arcane bond to an ioun stone

**Prerequisite:** You must have chosen a bonded object as your arcane bond.

**Benefit:** Like the arcane discovery of the same name, you can form an arcane bond with an ioun stone. When you choose this feat, you gain a dull gray ioun stone as a bonded object at no cost. A bonded ioun stone must be orbiting your head to have effect. At 12th level, you can turn a bonded dull gray ioun stone into another kind of ioun stone as if you possessed the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feat; if you die or replace a bonded ioun stone that has been transformed in this way, the stone reverts to a dull gray ioun stone.

The transformed ioun stone can have a value no greater than 10,000 gp/caster level.

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

*House Rule:*  This feat duplicates the arcane discovery of the same name (*People of the River 9*).
