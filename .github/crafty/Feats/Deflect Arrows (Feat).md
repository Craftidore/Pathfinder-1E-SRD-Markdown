# Deflect Arrows (Feat)
## Overview
You can knock arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing them from hitting you.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]].

**Benefit:** You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn’t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can’t be deflected.
