# Arisen (Feat)
## Overview
Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need for answers.

**Prerequisite:** You must have been slain and brought back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.

**Benefit:** You don’t die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.

**Normal:** You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution score.

**Goal:** You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity’s chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon—a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM’s choice.

**Completion Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.
