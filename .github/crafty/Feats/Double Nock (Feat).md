# Double Nock (Feat)
## Overview
You have practiced nocking and firing two arrows at once, without either shooting yourself in the hand or sending both arrows flying wild with each shot.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15+, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Shot (Feat)|Rapid Shot]]

**Benefit:** As a move-equivalent action you can nock two arrows to your bow instead of one. In this way, your next attack with your bow will fire both arrows at your target. You make an attack roll with each of these arrows, with each attack suffering from a -5 circumstance penalty on the attack roll.
