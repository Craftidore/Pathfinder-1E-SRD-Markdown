# Lunging Spell Touch (Feat)
## Overview
You can extend your reach to touch foes that would normally be too far away.

**Prerequisite**: [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 6 ranks.

**Benefit**: You can increase the reach of your spells’ melee touch attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn by taking a –2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You must decide to use this ability before you attempt any attacks on your turn.
