**Prerequisite**: Studied target class feature.

**Benefit**: Select a creature type from the Ranger Favored Enemies table (*Core Rulebook* 64). When you designate a creature of this type as your studied target and hit it with a melee or ranged weapon attack, your bonus on damage rolls against it is doubled.
