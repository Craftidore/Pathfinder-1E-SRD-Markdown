# Favored Enemy Spellcasting (Feat)
## Overview
Your spells are more effective against creatures that you especially abhor.

**Prerequisite**: Ability to cast spells.

**Benefit**: When you select this feat, choose a creature type or a humanoid subtype from the Ranger Favored Enemies table (*Core Rulebook* 64). When creatures of the chosen type attempt saving throws against your spells, they treat the spells’ DCs as 1 higher. If you also have the favored enemy class feature and the chosen type is already a favored enemy of yours, such creatures treat your spells’ DCs as 2 higher.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, it applies to a different creature type.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 147
