# Weapon Finesse (Feat)
## Overview
You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to brute strength.

**Benefit**: With a light weapon, [[Rapier|rapier]], [[Whip (Spell)|whip]], or [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] made for a creature of your size category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

**Special**: Natural weapons are considered light weapons.
