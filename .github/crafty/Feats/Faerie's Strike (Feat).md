# Faerie's Strike (Feat)
## Overview
Ephemeral wisps of nature spirits dance about those you strike.

**Prerequisites**: Nature Magic or the ability to cast druid or ranger spells; [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you use [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]] (or [[Improved Vital Strike (Feat)|Improved Vital Strike]] or [[Greater Vital Strike (Feat)|Greater Vital Strike]]), the creature you hit with the attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be illuminated as if by *[[Faerie Fire (Spell)|faerie fire]]* for 1 minute. You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
