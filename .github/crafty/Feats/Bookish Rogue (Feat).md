# Bookish Rogue (Feat)
## Overview
Thanks to your preparation, your arcane ability is more varied than most.

**Prerequisite**: [[Minor Magic|Minor magic]] rogue talent.

**Benefit**: By studying a spellbook for 10 minutes, you can change one spell you are able to cast using your [[Minor Magic|minor magic]] or [[Major Magic|major magic]] rogue talent to one sorcerer/wizard spell of the same level contained in the spellbook. This change is permanent until you take the time to change it via this feat again.
