# Appraise Magic Value (Feat)
## Overview
Your ability to determine an item’s worth and your knowledge of magic allow you to determine the exact properties of a magic item without the use of the *[[Identify (Spell)|identify]]* spell or similar magic.

**Prerequisites:** [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] 5 ranks, [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) 5 ranks, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5 ranks. 

**Benefit:** If you know that an item is magical, you can use the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] skill to identify the item’s properties. This use of the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] skill requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work and consumes 25 gp worth of special materials. The DC of the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] check is 10 + the caster level of the item.
