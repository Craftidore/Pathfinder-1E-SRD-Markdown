# Skald's Vigor (Feat)
## Overview
Your song and your enthusiasm combine to invigorate you in battle.

**Prerequisites**: Raging song class feature.

**Benefit**: While maintaining a raging song, you gain fast healing equal to the Strength bonus your song provides, starting in the round after you begin the song. If you stop maintaining your song, the fast healing ends, even if the effects of your song persist.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 156
