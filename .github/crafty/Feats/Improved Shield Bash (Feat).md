# Improved Shield Bash (Feat)
## Overview
You can protect yourself with your shield, even if you use it to attack.

**Prerequisite**: [[Shield Proficiency (Feat)|Shield Proficiency]].

**Benefit**: When you perform a shield bash, you may still apply the shield’s shield bonus to your AC.

**Normal**: Without this feat, a character that performs a shield bash loses the shield’s shield bonus to AC until his next turn (see Chapter 6 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 128
