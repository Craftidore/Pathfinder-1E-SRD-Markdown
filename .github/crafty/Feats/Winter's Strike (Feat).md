# Winter's Strike (Feat)
## Overview
Your attacks afflict your foes with the relentless fatigue of a winter storm.

**Prerequisites**: [[Nature Magic (Feat)|Nature Magic]] or the ability to cast druid or ranger spells; [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), when you use [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]] (or [[Improved Vital Strike (Feat)|Improved Vital Strike]] or [[Greater Vital Strike (Feat)|Greater Vital Strike]]), your strike saps the strength of your opponent. The creature hit must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or become [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the target with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.
