# Arcane Consumption (Feat)
## Overview
You can sacrifi ce your physical health to strengthen a spell. This process leaves you wracked with pain, but the enhanced energy you draw from the spell might provide the margin between victory and defeat.

**Prerequisites:** [[Arcane Toughness (Feat)|Arcane Toughness]], [[Toughness (Feat)|Toughness]], arcane caster level 6th.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a swift action, you can grant the next spell you cast a +4 bonus on its save DC. You must cast and complete this spell on the same turn that you use a swift action to activate this feat. In return, you take a â€“4 penalty to Constitution for 12 hours and are [[Fatigued|fatigued]].
