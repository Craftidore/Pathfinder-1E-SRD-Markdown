# Craft Tome
## Overview
You can create magical tomes, books, and manuals that produce a variety of effects. 

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 5th

**Benefit:** You can create any magical tome whose prerequisites you meet (see Chapter Seven for prerequisites and a list of magical tomes). Crafting a tome takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the base price. To craft a tome, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. You can also mend a damaged tome if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft the tome in the first place. Some tomes incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. 

**Special:** *Note on Craft Wondrous Item*: While there were very few tomes detailed in the original core rules, this book expands upon the concept, adding a host of new items to choose from and warranting a separate feat.
