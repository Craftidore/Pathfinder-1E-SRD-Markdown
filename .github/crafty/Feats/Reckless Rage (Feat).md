# Reckless Rage (Feat)
## Overview
Your boundless rage grants your blows extra strength, though at the expense of accuracy.

**Prerequisites**: [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]]; rage or raging song class feature.

**Benefit**: When you use [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] while raging or while using raging song, you take an additional â€“1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you gain an additional +2 bonus on melee damage rolls. Modify this damage bonus appropriately based on the type of weapon you are using, as normal for [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]].
