# Fiery Burst (Feat)
## Overview
You channel your magical talent into a blast of fire.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a fire spell of 2nd level or higher available to cast, you can spend a standard action to create a 5-foot-radius burst of fire at a range of 30 feet. This burst deals 1d6 points of fire damage per level of the highest-level fire spell you have available to cast. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting fire spells.
