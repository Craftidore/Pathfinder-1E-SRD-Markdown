# Clap of Thunder (Feat)
## Overview
You can deliver a thunderous roar with a touch.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a sonic spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can deliver a melee touch attack as a standard action. This attack deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per level of the highest-level sonic spell you have available to cast. Additionally, the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1 round.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting sonic spells.
