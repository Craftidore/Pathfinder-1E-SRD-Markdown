# Mounted Combat (Feat)
## Overview
You are adept at guiding your mount through combat.

**Prerequisite**: [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] 1 rank.

**Benefit**: Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] check (as an immediate action) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] check result is greater than the opponentâ€™s attack roll.
