# Mobility (Feat)
## Overview
You can easily move through a dangerous melee.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]].

**Benefit**: You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
