# Improved Recycle Goods (Feat)
## Overview
Your ability to craft items made from other items that might have gone to waste has increased greatly.

**Prequisites:** [[Recycle Goods (Feat)|Recycle Goods]], [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (any) 5 ranks or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** By spending 1 hour per 2,000 gp of the cost of an item (rounded up), you can break it down into raw material components. This requires you succeed on the appropriate [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check required to make a week’s progress in creating the item, and compensates you with raw components equal to that item’s cost to create (not its sale price), which can be used to craft similar items. Magic items can be broken down in this way using a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check and any item may be created from the recycled materials (unlike [[Recycle Goods (Feat)|Recycle Goods]] which only allows like items to be made).

Please note that potions and scrolls may not be recycled.
