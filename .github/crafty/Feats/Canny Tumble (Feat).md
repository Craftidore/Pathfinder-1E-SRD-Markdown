# Canny Tumble (Feat)
## Overview
Your acrobatic prowess distracts your foes.

**Prerequisites**: [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you use [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move through an opponentâ€™s threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your next melee attack roll against that opponent, as long as you make that attack before the start of your next turn.
