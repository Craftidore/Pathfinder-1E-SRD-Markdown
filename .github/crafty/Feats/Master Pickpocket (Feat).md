# Master Pickpocket (Feat)
## Overview
There are thieves and there are masters of the craft. You fall into the latter category. You can steal anything from anyone at any time.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] 8 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your mastery of [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] allows you to steal an object from an adjacent opponent in combat as a standard action without provoking attacks of opportunity. You can take anything the character has on his or her person provided it is not held in hand. If you are in a grapple, you gain a +4 bonus on the attempt. In addition, when you make a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check as a free action, you take a –10 penalty rather than a –20 penalty on the attempt.
