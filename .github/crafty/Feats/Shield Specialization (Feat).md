# Shield Specialization (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the use of one type of shield.

**Prerequisites**: Proficiency with selected shield, [[Shield Focus (Feat)|Shield Focus]], fighter level 4th.

**Benefit**: Choose one type of shield (buckler, light, heavy, or tower shield). With the selected shield, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls. In addition, you may add your base shield bonus (including the bonus from [[Shield Focus (Feat)|Shield Focus]] but not including enhancement bonuses) to your CMD.

**Special**: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of shield.
