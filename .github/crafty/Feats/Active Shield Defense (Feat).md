# Active Shield Defense (Feat)
## Overview

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with shields, [[Shield Specialization (Feat)|Shield Specialization]].

**Benefit:** When fighting defensively and using a shield, you do not take the standard fighting defensively penalties on attacks of opportunity.

When using the total defense action and a shield, you still threaten the area around you as normal. You can make attacks of opportunity with a –4 penalty.

**Normal:** You take a –4 penalty on all attacks while fighting defensively. You cannot attack while using the total defense action.

**Special:** A fighter can select Active Shield Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.
