# Spontaneous Casting (Feat)
## Overview
You can swap a prepared spell on the fly.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 5th.

**Benefit:** You can exchange a spell you have prepared for another spell on your spell list (or for wizards, out of your spellbook) of the same level.

**Special:** Using this ability costs 2 action points (in campaigns that use action points).

**Source:** Eberron Campaign Setting, pg. 61

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In campaigns that do not use action points, you get 1 use of this feat for every three levels (starting at 1st level; one at 1st, another at 3rd, another at 6th, etc.).
