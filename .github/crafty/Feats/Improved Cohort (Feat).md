# Improved Cohort (Feat)
## Overview
You attract a more powerful cohort than you normally would.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 15, [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]].

**Benefit:** The maximum level of the cohort you gain from the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat is one lower than your character level.

**Normal:** Without this feat, a cohort’s maximum level is two levels below the associated PC’s level.

**Source:** Heroes of Battle (WotC), pg. 98
