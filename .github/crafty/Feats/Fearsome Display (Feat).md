# Fearsome Display (Feat)
## Overview
By performing quick and lethal looking tricks with your weapon, you can intimidate your opponents before ablow is struck.

**Prerequisites:** 6+ ranks in [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill, base attack bonus +3 or higher.

**Benefit:** So long as you,have a melee weapon drawn, you may take a full round action to put on a fearsome display. Select one opponent within 30 ft. to be the target and make an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check (DC 10 + target's character level.) Your opponent suffers a -2 morale penalty on attack and damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]].

You may not target the same creature more than once per day with this ability.

**Special:** This ability does not affect aberrations, constructs, dragons, elementals, oozes, outsiders, plants, undead, vermin and creatures immune to fear effects. Creatures with abaseattack bonus of +3 (or higher) above yours are immune to the effects of this feat.
