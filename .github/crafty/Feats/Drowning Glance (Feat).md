# Drowning Glance (Feat)
## Overview
With a look, you create a small but incapacitating amount of water in the subject's lungs.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 4th-level spells. 

**Benefit:** As long as you have a water spell of 4th level or higher available to cast, you can use a standard action to transform a small portion of the air in a living creature's lungs to water, making it difficult for the creature to breathe. The subject must be within 30 feet. The target becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]] for 1 round; if it succeeds on a Fortitude save, it is instead [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 round.

Whether or not a targeted creature successfully saves, it is immune to any further uses of your drowning glance for 24 hours. Creatures that can breathe water (or who don't breathe) are immune to this effect.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting water spells.
