# Crippling Critical (Feat)
## Overview
You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.

**Prerequisites**: [[Critical Focus (Feat)|Critical Focus]], base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit**: Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.

**Special**: You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [[Critical Mastery (Feat)|Critical Mastery]].
