# Clever Fighting (Feat)
## Overview
You slip past your enemiesâ€™ guards with pinpoint accuracy, increasing the damage you do in combat.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], base attack bonus +2.

**Benefit:** You are able to place finesse attacks where they deal greater damage. You may apply your Dexterity bonus instead of your Strength bonus to damage rolls when using any light weapon, as well as any weapon that can be used with [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], such as a [[Rapier|rapier]] or [[Whip (Spell)|whip]]. You cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to damage from Clever Fighting.
