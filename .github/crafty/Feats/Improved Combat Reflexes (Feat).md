# Improved Combat Reflexes (Feat)
## Overview
You react to any drop in your opponents' guard with lightning speed.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13+, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], base attack bonus +6

**Benefit:** For any given opportunity in melee combat, you can make two attacks of opportunity. The second attack is at a -5 penalty, just like your second normal attack in any given round. You still cannot exceed your normal maximum number of attacks of opportunity.
