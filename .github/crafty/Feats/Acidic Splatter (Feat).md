# Acidic Splatter (Feat)
## Overview
You can channel magical energy into orbs of acid.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have an acid spell of 2nd level or higher available to cast, you can throw an orb of acid as a ranged touch attack. The attack has a range of 5 feet per level of the highest-level acid spell you have available to cast and deals 1d6 points of damage per level of that acid spell.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting acid spells.
