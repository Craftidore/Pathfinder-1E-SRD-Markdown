# Truly Favored
## Overview
Your patron Jinn takes great interest in your exploits.

**Prerequisites:** Jinnborn, favored racial trait, character level 4th.

**Benefit:** You can use your favored ability as many times a day equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice; minimum 2 times per day). Furthermore you gain the following favored abilities: Once per day, gain a +2 modifier to a single attack roll; once per day, when you score a critical hit, automatically confirm; once per day, increase a single spell DC by 2 (you must choose to use this ability when the spell is cast, but before the effects are determined).
