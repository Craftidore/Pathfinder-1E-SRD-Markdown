# Initiate of the Threefold Path (Feat)
## Overview
**Prerequisites:** Int 20+, [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]], [[Flexible Wizardry (Feat)|Flexible Wizardry]], [[Improved Flexible Wizardry (Feat)|Improved Flexible Wizardry]], wizard level 12th.

**Benefit:** When you prepare your spells each day, you can choose to keep a number of spell slots equal to the number of spells you have mastered with [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] (and [[Adept Mastery (Feat)|Adept Mastery]] if that feat is possessed) flexibly prepared. Instead of preparing a single spell within each of these slots, you can partially prepare three spells. Anytime after you prepare these flexible slots, you can spend a standard action to finalize one slot, choosing one of the three spells to be finished and fully prepared in that slot.
