# Canny Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You have trained in harming others by careful placement of your blows to vital locations.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [[Clever Fighting (Feat)|Clever Fighting]], [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When using either a light weapon or any weapon that can be used with [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], such as a [[Rapier|rapier]] or [[Whip (Spell)|whip]], you deal an extra 1d4 points of damage with each attack per point of your Intelligence bonus. For example, a fighter with an Intelligence of 15 and wielding a cedeku deals an extra 2d4 points of damage with each successful hit. As with other bonus damage dice, this damage is not multiplied when a critical hit is confirmed. You cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to damage from Canny Strike.
