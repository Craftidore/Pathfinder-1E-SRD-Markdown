# Killing Flourish
## Overview
You inspire dread in other foes when you slay an enemy.

**Prerequisites**: [[Intimidating Prowess (Feat)|Intimidating Prowess]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] 4 ranks, slayer level 4th.

**Benefit**: When you reduce your target to below 0 hit points with a melee attack, as a swift action you can attempt an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your attack.
