# Wand Master (Feat)
## Overview
When you cast a spell from a wand, itâ€™s almost as effective as if you cast it yourself.

**Prerequisite:** [[Wand Adept (Feat)|Wand Adept]].

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a spell from a wand, it uses your primary spellcasting ability score modifier, rather than the minimum possible primary spellcasting ability score modifier required to cast the spell. This applies to all aspects of the spell, including its saving throw DC (if any). If you are not a spellcaster, and activate the wand using [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]], or similar, you use your Charisma modifier as your primary spellcasting ability score modifier for this purpose.

**Source:** A Necromancers Almanac 2013 (Necromancers of the Northwest), pg. 93

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Charisma modifier if you have the [[Pragmatic Activator (Trait)|Pragmatic Activator]] trait when activating a wand using the [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] skill.
