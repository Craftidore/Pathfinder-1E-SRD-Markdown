# Deadeye Shot (Feat)
## Overview
You carefully line up a ranged attack, timing it precisely so that you hit your opponent when his guard is down. When your target is busy dealing with an allyâ€™s melee attack, you strike.

**Prerequisites:** [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], base attack bonus +4, skirmish or sneak attack ability.

**Benefit:** By firing just as your ally connects with a blow, you take advantage of the distraction to strike the same enemy when his guard is ruined. If you ready a ranged attack to occur when an ally strikes a particular target, and your ally succeeds, that target loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against your attack.

**Special:** A fighter can select Deadeye Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
