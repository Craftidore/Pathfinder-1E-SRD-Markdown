# Diviner's Delving (Feat)
## Overview
Your keen magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and mystical clues quick and easy.

**Prerequisite**: [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] (divination).

**Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede divination (for example, *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]*). When using a divination spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration).
