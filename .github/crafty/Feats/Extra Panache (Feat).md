# Extra Panache (Feat)
## Overview
You have more panache than the ordinary swashbuckler.

**Prerequisite**: [[Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)|Amateur Swashbuckler]] or panache class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain two more panache points at the start of each day, and your maximum panache increases by two.

**Special**: If you have levels in the swashbuckler class, you can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, these benefits increase by two.
