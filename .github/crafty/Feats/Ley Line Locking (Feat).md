# Ley Line Locking (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned the secrets of locking ley lines.

**Prerequisite:** [[Ley Line Magic (midgardpf)|Ley Line Magic]], [[Ley Line Channeling (midgardpf)|Ley Line Channeling]], [[Ley Line Override (midgardpf)|Ley Line Override]], [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 15 ranks, Int 17+

**Benefit:** You have learned to perform a ritual that can lock a ley line (see the rules for ley lines below). This ritual takes a full day to complete and requires 5,000 gp in spell components. You can only lock a ley line to a metamagic you know and which appears in the effects table for a ley line of its power level. You may also use this ritual to unlock a ley line that is currently locked.
