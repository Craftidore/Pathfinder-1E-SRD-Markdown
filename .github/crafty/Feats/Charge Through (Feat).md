# Charge Through (Feat)
## Overview
You can overrun enemies when charging.

**Prerequisites**: Str 13, [[Improved Overrun (Feat)|Improved Overrun]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit**: When making a charge, you can attempt to overrun one creature in the path of the charge as a free action. If you successfully overrun that creature, you can complete the charge. If the overrun is unsuccessful, the charge ends in the space directly in front of that creature.

**Normal**: You must have a clear path toward the target of your charge.
