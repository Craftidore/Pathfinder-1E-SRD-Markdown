# Mercantile Background (Feat)
## Overview
You come from a wealthy family with numerous contacts in the trading costers and craft guilds of nearby bustling cities. You can get a good deal on almost anything you buy or sell.

**Prerequisite:** Dwarf (the Sword Coast or Underdark \[Darklands]), gnome (Lantan or Underdark \[Northdark]), halfling (Amn), or human (Amn, Lantan, Sembia, Shou Expatriate, Tashalar, Tharsult, Thesk, Turmish, the Vast, or Waterdeep).

**Benefit:** When you sell weapons, magic items, or other adventuring goods, you get 75% of the list price instead of 50%. Once per month, you can buy any single item at 75% of the offered price. You also receive an extra 300 gp to spend as you see fit during character creation.

**Special:** You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat.

**Source:** Player's Guide to Faerun (WotC), pg. 41

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Removed racial and regional requirements for non-Realms campaigns.
