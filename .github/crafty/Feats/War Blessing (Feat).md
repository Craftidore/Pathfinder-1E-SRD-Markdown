# War Blessing (Feat)
## Overview
Your fervent call to your deity imbues you with a temporary blessing.

**Prerequisite**: Mystery or domain class feature.

**Benefit**: Choose two warpriest blessings when you take this feat. Each of these blessings must be tied to a domain granted by your deity or to one of the two domains that represent your spiritual inclination and abilities. Twice per day, you can call upon the minor blessing from one or the other of your chosen blessings. This ability otherwise acts like the warpriest blessings class feature. Your effective warpriest level is the highest level that you have in the class that has the mystery or domain class feature.
