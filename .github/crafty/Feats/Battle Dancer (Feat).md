# Battle Dancer (Feat)
## Overview
You strike at your foes in time with the music you sing or in cadence with an oration you deliver. The magical power of your bardic performance drives you forward and improves your fighting ability.

**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +2, bardic music.

**Benefit:** During a round in which you grant any ally a bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, or saves with one of your bardic music abilities, you gain a +2 morale bonus on your attack rolls if you move at least one square before attacking. You lose this benefit for the remaining duration of your current use of bardic music if you do not move or if you do not attack on your turn. If you stand still and attack (or move without attacking), you do not gain this feat’s benefit, but this ability’s duration continues.

**Special:** A fighter can select Battle Dancer as one of his fighter bonus feats.
