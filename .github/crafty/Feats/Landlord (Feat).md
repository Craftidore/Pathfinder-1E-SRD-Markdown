# Landlord (Feat)
## Overview
By knowing the right nobles, making contacts with masons and artisans, or performing great deeds for a liege-lord, you have resources that help you build and expand your stronghold.

**Prerequisites:** The character must be at least 9th level.

**Benefits:** This feat gives you a small allowance that you can use to build or expand a stronghold. It’s not cash, so it only applies to stronghold purchases. (You can’t cash it out and spend it on something else.) In addition, the feat provides matching funds for expenditures made from your own purse of gold. For example, if you spend 50,000 gp of your own (beyond the allowance) to purchase stronghold components, walls, or wondrous architecture, the feat provides a bonus allowance of the same amount.

The exact nature of the resources depends on your campaign; you and your DM should decide on this beforehand. If you have performed missions successfully for a noble, rich merchant, or other power group, perhaps they have willed the land to you. If you’re a cleric, maybe the church sends supplicants to provide free labor. Regardless of your class or social standing, you might inherit a keep from a long-lost relative.

See Table 1–6: Landlord Funds for how much you can spend. When you first select the Landlord feat, you receive the amount listed under Stronghold Allowance. At each successive level, you get an additional allowance equal to the amount listed under Additional Funds Gained (which is equal to the difference between the Stronghold Allowance of your new level and the previous level). For example, if you take the Landlord feat at 9th level, you get 25,000 gp to spend on a stronghold. When you attain 10th level, you receive an additional 25,000 gp (50,000 – 25,000) to spend on your stronghold. Characters can save their allowance from level to level if they wish.

**Note:** Multiple characters can purchase this feat and pool their resources to construct a stronghold together. However, the feat only provides matching funds for your own contributions (that is, if one character from a group of four contributes 10,000 gp to the construction of the group’s stronghold, the feat provides matching funds for that character (10,000 gp), not for all four characters (40,000 gp), even if all four have the feat). If all four characters have the feat and each contributes funds to the cause, they each receive matching funds equal to their contribution.

| **Level** | **Allowance** | **Funds Gained** |

| 14 | 200,000 gp | 50,000 gp |
| 15 | 250,000 gp | 50,000 gp |
| 16 | 300,000 gp | 50,000 gp |
| 17 | 400,000 gp | 100,000 gp |
| 18 | 500,000 gp | 100,000 gp |
| 19 | 600,000 gp | 100,000 gp |
| 20 | 800,000 gp | 200,000 gp |

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* GMs are encouraged to allow players to gain matching funds for previous construction they might have done prior to attaining 9th level. However, such retroactive funds should only be allowed for a stronghold (no matter its form) not for other buildings they might have purchased and/or built.
