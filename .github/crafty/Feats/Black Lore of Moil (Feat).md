# Black Lore of Moil (Feat)
## Overview
Your study of the sinister knowledge and spellcasting techniques of the long-dead Nightlords of Moil makes your necromancy spells especially potent.

**Prerequisite:** [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] (necromancy), caster level 7th.

**Benefit:** Any necromancy spell you cast can be cast instead as a Moilian spell, dealing an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1d6 per two spell levels (+1d6 for 1st-level spells, +2d6 for 2nd or 3rd-level spells, and so on). If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spell's normal effect.

In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian rune bone - a small human bone (often a finger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft.

While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spell's level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts *[[Finger of Death (Spell)|finger of death]]* (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage.

A Moilian spell uses a spell slot of the spell's normal level.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Moilian magic taps into the Dark Duality. Because of this if the caster has both the Black Lore of Moil and [[Adept of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Adept of the Dark Duality]] feats, they receive a synergy bonus which increases the power of their Moilian magic; all extra damage from this feat has its damage die changed from d6 to d8.

Should the caster also have the [[Master of the Dark Duality (Feat)|Master of the Dark Duality]] feat, this bonus is increased even more, with the damage die being changed to d10.
