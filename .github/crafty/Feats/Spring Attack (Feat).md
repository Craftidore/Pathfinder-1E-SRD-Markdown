# Spring Attack (Feat)
## Overview
You can deftly move up to a foe, strike, and withdraw before he can react.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit**: You can move up to your speed and make a single melee attack without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack. You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn.

**Normal**: You cannot move before and after an attack.
