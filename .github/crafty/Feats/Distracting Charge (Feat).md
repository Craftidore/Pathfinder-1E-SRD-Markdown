# Distracting Charge (Feat)
## Overview
Your ally’s charge exposes an opening you can exploit.

**Benefit**: When your ally with this feat uses the charge action and hits, you gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target of that charge. This bonus must be used before your ally’s next turn, or it is lost.
