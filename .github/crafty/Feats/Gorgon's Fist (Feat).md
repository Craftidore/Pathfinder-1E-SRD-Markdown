# Gorgon's Fist (Feat)
## Overview
With one well-placed blow, you leave your target reeling.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Scorpion Style (Feat)|Scorpion Style]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from [[Scorpion Style (Feat)|Scorpion Style]]). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is [[Staggered|staggered]] until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are [[Staggered|staggered]].
