# Improved Underhanded Teamwork (Feat)
## Overview
You and your allies have trained together long enough to know how to exploit an opponentâ€™s disadvantage to make her predicament even worse.

**Prerequisites:** [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], Improved Dirty Trick, [[Underhanded Teamwork (Feat)|Underhanded Teamwork]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Whenever an ally who also has this feat performs the dirty trick combat maneuver against a foe that you both threaten, you may attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the same foe as an immediate action to inflict a second condition. If the foe uses an action to remove the first condition, it also removes the condition imposed by your immediate action.
