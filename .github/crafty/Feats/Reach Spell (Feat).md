# Reach Spell (Feat)
## Overview
Your spells go farther than normal.

**Benefit**: You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modif ied by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.

Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide, pg. 168

**GM Note**

Crafting a *wand of [[Vampiric Touch (Spell)|vampiric touch]]* at a higher caster level and adding this spell to the crafting process makes for a very unpleasant surprise for someone.
