# Inspired Alchemy (Feat)
## Overview
With some inspiration and elbow grease, you can recreate a consumed extract in a pinch.

**Prerequisites**: Ability to create 2nd-level extracts, alchemy class feature, inspiration class feature.

**Benefit**: You can recreate an extract that you consumed during the past hour. You must spend 10 minutes and expend a number of uses of inspiration equal to the level of the extractâ€™s formula to do so. When you recreate an extract in this way, it does not count toward the number of extracts you can prepare in a day.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 151
