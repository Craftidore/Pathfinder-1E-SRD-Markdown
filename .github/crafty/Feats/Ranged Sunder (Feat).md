# Ranged Sunder (Feat)
## Overview
You can attack an opponent’s weapon from a distance.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** When attacking objects, you deal full damage (instead of half damage) with slashing or bludgeoning ranged weapons. You can make ranged sunder attempts with piercing weapons, such as arrows, but you only deal half damage; divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the object’s hardness.  You must be within 30 feet of your opponent to make a ranged sunder attempt. Normal: Objects take half damage from ranged weapons (other than siege engines and the like). You can only sunder with a melee attack using a slashing or bludgeoning weapon.

**Special:** A fighter may select Ranged Sunder as one of his fighter bonus feats.

When using this feat, a character gains no benefit from the [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]] feat.
