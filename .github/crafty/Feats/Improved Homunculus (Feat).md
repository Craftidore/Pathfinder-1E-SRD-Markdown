# Improved Homunculus (Feat)
## Overview
You are adept at improving and modifying your homunculus. Whenever you advance your homunculus’s Hit Dice, you can also imbue it with special supernatural abilities.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] or craft homunculus class feature, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (any) 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its HD (see chart). If you use the [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] feat to construct a homunculus, it gets these abilities when you create it. If you use the craft homunculus class feature of the artificer class, your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its current HD, and additional natural armor or special abilities if you later increase its HD.

All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specifi ed, an ability can only be taken once.

Each time the homunculus gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. For example, an artificer with a 4-HD homunculus that has the climber special ability could choose to give it sneak attack instead if the homunculus’s Hit Dice were increased to 5.

This feat applies to the character’s homunculus regardless of its type. For new types of homunculi, see Chapter 6 (of *Magic of Eberron)*.

**Store Infusion (or Potion):** At the beginning of each day, the master can store one infusion (or potion) of up to 3rd level in the homunculus. This infusion (or potion) must be one that the master could normally create himself. This infusion (or potion) does not take effect when it is first stored. Instead, the homunculus can use a standard action to imbue itself with the infusion (or potion). No homunculus can store more than one infusion (or potion) at a time.

**Weapon Ability:** When this ability is granted, choose a weapon special ability with a base price modifier of “+1 bonus,” such as *[[Ghost Touch (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|ghost touch]]**,* *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]**,* or *[[Shock (MagWpnSpcAb)|shock]]*. The homunculus’s natural weapons are treated as if they had this special ability.

## Construct Modifications
**Construct Modifications**

Standard constructs can be modified to enhance their base abilities, alter their appearance or function, or perform a variety of tasks beyond the intentions of their basic designs. Performing a modification provides a construct’s creator with a simple way to create a unique construct. A modification can only be performed while the construct is inanimate or nonfunctioning.

Performing modifications on one’s own construct requires the [[Craft Construct (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Craft Construct]] feat, and the creator must pay any additional crafting requirements and/or costs associated with the modification. Completing a modification requires 1 day per 1,000 gp of the modification’s base price (minimum 1 day).

### Basic Modifications
**Basic Modifications**

These modifications are used to alter a construct’s basic properties: Armor Class, Hit Dice, and weaponry.

**Armor Modification**: This modification adds an enhancement bonus to the construct’s natural armor bonus or adds a magic armor property. The cost for magical enhancements equals the cost for creating magic armor as described in the *Core Rulebook*.

**Hit Dice Modification**: Hit Dice represent the overall strength and power of a construct. They affect a number of subsequent abilities, including hit points, saving throws, and base attacks. Determine the effects of a Hit Dice modification using the rules for adding creature Hit Dice on pages 290–291 of the *Bestiary*. Because a construct’s size is limited, a Hit Dice modification cannot increase its size. Therefore Hit Dice modification can never increase the base construct’s Hit Dice beyond 50% of its total HD. Some constructs have a defined cost for increasing Hit Dice. To calculate the cost per Hit Die of other constructs, divide the construct’s construction cost by its existing Hit Dice.

**Weapon Modification**: This modification enhances a construct’s physical weaponry. This process includes adding actual weapons (such as blades or spiked chains) to the physical structure of the construct or enhancing existing weapons with additional magical properties. Structural changes alter the construct’s damage only. A construct is automatically considered proficient with any weapon added to its structure as a weapon modif ication. The cost for adding a weapon is determined by the cost of the weapon or weapon enhancement added. The cost for magical enhancements to these weapons is the same as the cost for creating magic weapons as described on page 468 of the *Core Rulebook*. Performing a weapon modification also requires the Craft Magical Arms and Armor feat.

**Ability Score Modification**: Using this modification, a crafter can permanently increase one of the construct’s ability scores by +2 per modification. He cannot increase any abilities with a score of 0. The cost for permanently increasing an ability score is 5,000 gp.

### Complex Modifications
**Complex Modifications**

These modifications represent more complex changes to the structure and function of the construct. The cost is equivalent to the minimum level to cast the spell × the spell level × 250 gp.

**Bioconstruct Modification**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, *regenerate*

**CR Increase**: +1

**Cost**: 22,750 gp

Merging the arts of transmutation and necromancy, powerful spellcasters work living organs into a golem, imbuing it with properties normally associated with beings that are alive. These organs are placed in canopic jars of specially prepared arcane fluids that are then sealed into the golem’s body, though not necessarily in anatomically correct locations. Specific organs produce specific effects. Each organ is counted as a separate upgrade, and the costs of multiple bioconstruct organs are cumulative. Bioconstruct upgrades only work with golems, and cannot be placed into animated objects.

All bioconstruct upgrades have the same weakness—they are susceptible to critical hits. An attacker that confirms a critical hit against a golem with a bioconstruct upgrade deals damage to the construct and also destroys one upgrade. The damaged upgrade ceases to function and the construct loses abilities associated with the upgrade. If a construct has more than one bioconstruct upgrade, only one is damaged. The GM randomly determines the damaged organ.

*Heart*: This upgrade permits a golem to receive partial benefits of magical healing and provides a hit point bonus as if the golem had a Constitution score of 12, but the construct does not gain a Constitution score in this process. Negative energy spells cast upon the golem can affect the heart, causing it to cease functioning for the duration of the effect (or 1 round for instantaneous effects). If the spell has a save, the heart uses the golem’s saving throws.

*Brain*: This upgrade doesn’t permit the golem to think independently, but instead, the brain works as a storage device, permitting the golem to acquire skills and feats as if it had an Intelligence score of 10. Enchantment spells or spells with mind-affecting effects that are cast upon the golem can affect the brain, causing the brain to cease functioning for the duration of the spell. While the brain is suppressed in this fashion, the construct temporarily loses access to its skills and feats. If the spell has a save, the brain uses the golem’s saving throws.

**Construct Armor**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *animate objects*, the construct modified must be the same size as the creator

**CR Increase**: +1

**Cost**: 35,000 gp

This modification allows the construct to be worn like armor by its creator. So long as the creator wears it, the construct performs no independent actions, remaining under the control of the creator, and any attacks directed at the wearer first target the construct. When a construct is destroyed while serving as armor, the wearer loses all the benefits, but regains all the hindrances until the armor is removed, which takes the same amount of time that removing breastplate armor does. If the construct is still active, the creator can order the removal of the armor with a swift action, at which point the construct leaves the creator’s space and enters a space adjacent to the creator. Donning construct armor takes a full-round action if the construct is still active. The creator cannot don a construct with this modification if the construct has been destroyed.

The construct’s wearer retains his base attacks and saves. Construct armor counts as breastplate armor for purposes of determining AC, weight, Dexterity modifiers to AC, and chance of arcane spell failure.

**Crafter’s Eyes**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, *scrying*

**CR Increase**: none

**Cost**: 8,000 gp

The crafter gives her construct crystalline eyes that permit her to use a *scrying* or *greater scrying* spell to see from the perspective of her creation. This modification requires the crafter also to prepare a special crystalline orb magically bonded to the eyes, which serves as her focus for the *scrying* or *greater scrying* spell. The cost of creating that focus is included in the cost of modifying the construct.

Unlike normal *scrying* or *greater scrying*, there is no chance of failure for viewing creatures though the sensor; the creator simply sees what the construct sees for the duration of the spell. Spells cast through the sensor still have the normal chance of operating through the construct’s eyes.

**Construct Limb**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *animate objects*, Small or Tiny construct

**CR Increase**: none

**Cost**: 27,000 gp

This modification can be performed on a Small or Tiny construct, such as an iron cobra or a homunculus. The creator modifies the construct such that she can slip it over her arm and control its actions as part of her own. The construct limb retains any melee attacks that the construct has, and the creator can use special attacks as if she were the construct (using the construct’s attack statistics and effects), but treat the creator as the creature making attacks for the purpose of determining attacks of opportunity and other actions that could be triggered by an attack made by the creator.

The limb also provides the wearer with limited protection in combat, roughly equivalent to that of a heavy steel shield. The wearer is considered proficient in this shield. The wearer retains the remainder of her abilities.

A construct limb counts as a heavy steel shield for purposes of determining AC, weight, Dexterity modifiers to AC, and chance of arcane spell failure.

**Rune-Carved**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, variable (see below).

**CR Increase**: none

**Cost**: variable (see below)

This subcategory of complex modification allows a construct’s creator to carve a runic spell trigger into her creation. Choose one of the following runes. The cost of the rune and any prerequisites are detailed in the rune’s description. Once per day, the first time the rune is triggered, its effect occurs. As an immediate action, the creator can attempt to delay the effect until the next time it is triggered. Doing so requires that the construct be within line of sight of the creator (or for the creator to be using *scrying* or *greater scrying* through the crafter’s eyes construct modification) and that the caster make a Spellcraft check equal to 10 + the caster level of the rune’s effect.

A construct can have more than one rune-carved modification, and even multiple runes of the same type. If it has multiple applications of the same rune, the first one goes off when it is first triggered, the second one goes off when the trigger happens next, and so on. Multiple runes of different types go off when first triggered, even if the different runes share similar triggers.

It is rumored that there are many more runes than these, but the following are some of the best known and most common runes used by construct crafters.

**Rune of Agony**

**Aura** Moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Trigger and Effect**

This modification is triggered the first time the modified construct takes damage. Creatures within a 20-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or suffer from wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes the penalties imposed by the rune for 1 round.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *symbol of pain*; **Cost** 18,000 gp

**Rune of Imprisonment**

**Aura** Strong conjuration; **CL** 18th

**Trigger and Effect**

This rune is triggered the first time the construct is hit with a touch or ranged touch attack spell. The caster of the triggering spells must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be captured, both body and soul, within a gem embedded in the modified construct’s body. The gem holds the caster until either the gem or the construct is destroyed. A gem can only hold one creature at a time; once it captures a creature, the rune does not trigger again until the gem is replaced. 

While a creature is trapped within the gem, the gem is vulnerable to critical hits; if an attacker confirms a critical hit, the construct takes damage and the gem is destroyed, releasing the entrapped creature into a space adjacent to the construct. The broken gem must then be replaced before the *rune of imprisonment* can function again.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *trap the soul*, gem worth 20,000 gp to serve as the rune’s focus; **Cost** 57,600 gp

**Rune of Lightning**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Trigger and Effect**

This rune is triggered when the modified construct is hit by a melee attack. The rune releases a 5-foot-radius burst of electricity dealing 3d8 points of electrical damage to all creatures within the burst. A successful DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *shocking grasp*; **Cost** 2,000 gp

**Rune of Shielding**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Trigger and Effect**

This rune is triggered the first time the modified construct is attacked with a melee attack, ranged attack, or *magic missile*. The construct gains a +4 shield bonus to its Armor Class for 3 minutes. This is a force effect and applies against incorporeal touch attacks.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *shield*; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Rune of Terror**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 7th

**Trigger and Effect**

This rune is triggered the first time a creature moves adjacent to the modified construct. The rune creates 20-foot-radius spread of necromantic energy. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. If the Will save succeeds, the creature is shaken for 1 round.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *fear*; **Cost** 11,200 gp

**Shatter Stash**

**Requirements**: Craft Construct, *shatter*, and variable (see below)

**CR Increase**: none

**Cost**: variable (see below)

For this subcategory of complex modification, parts of the golem are made with hollowed sections carved from deliberately weaker materials, designed to shatter when struck by attackers. A confirmed critical deals critical damage to the construct and shatters the hollowed section, releasing whatever substance the creator placed inside. Once the shatter stash is damaged, this modification is destroyed (it cannot be repaired). A construct can only have one shatter stash at a time. After the modification is destroyed, the construct can be modified with shatter stash again at the normal cost.

The following are some of the more common shatter stashes, though others exist.

**Corrosive Jet Stash**

A 15-foot burst of corrosive liquid sprays out of the modified construct’s stash. Creatures within the burst must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or take 2d6 points of acid damage and be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the afflicted creature takes no damage but is sickened for 1 round.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *fireball*; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Firebomb Stash**

A 15-foot burst of fire explodes out of the modified construct’s stash. Creatures within the burst must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of fire damage. A successful save halves the damage.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *fireball*; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Frost Mist Stash**

A 15-foot burst of frosty mist erupts out of the modified construct’s stash. Any creatures within the burst must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or else take 1d6 points of damage and become entangled for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and the target does not become entangled.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *cone of cold*; **Cost** 1,000 gp

**Lightning Lash Stash**

A 30-foot burst of electricity cracks out of the modified construct’s stash. Those within the burst must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or take 3d8 points of electrical damage. A successful save halves the damage.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *lightning bolt*; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Willsap Gas Stash**

A 15-foot burst of toxic gas hisses out of this stash. Living creatures within this burst must succeed on a DC 13 Will saving throw or become confused for 1 round. This is a poison effect.

**Modification**

**Requirements** *stinking cloud*; **Cost** 2,000 gp

**Source:** Ultimate Magic, pgs. 113-116

## Monster Feat Advancement
**Monster Feat Advancement**

Creatures gain one feat at 1 Hit Die and one additional feat for every 2 Hit Dice above 1. Most additional feats should be focused on increasing the creature’s combat abilities, but metamagic feats and skill feats are also possible choices depending on the creature’s role.
