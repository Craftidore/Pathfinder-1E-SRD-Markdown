# Improved Counterspell (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at countering the spells of others using similar spells.

**Benefit**: When counterspelling, you may use a spell of the same school that is one or more spell levels higher than the target spell.

**Normal**: Without this feat, you may counter a spell only with the same spell or with a spell specifically designated as countering the target spell.
