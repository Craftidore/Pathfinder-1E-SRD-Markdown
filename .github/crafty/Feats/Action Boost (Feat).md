# Action Boost (Feat)
## Overview
You have the ability to alter your luck drastically in dire circumstances.

**Benefit:** When you spend an action point to alter the result of an attack roll, a skill check, an ability check, a level check, or a saving throw, you roll d8s instead of d6s and add the result to the d20 roll.

**Source:** Eberron Campaign Setting (WotC), pg. 47
