# Torch Handling (Feat)
## Overview
In your grasp, a simple torch becomes a beacon.

**Benefit:** You gain three benefits upon taking this feat. First, you treat torches as simple weapons. Second, the radius of normal and increased illumination shed by any torch or mundane light source you carry increases by 10 feet. Finally, once per day you may reroll a single saving throw to resist any effect that would otherwise extinguish your light source, such as having water thrown at you, being targeted by a *[[Quench (Spell)|quench]]* spell, and so on.
