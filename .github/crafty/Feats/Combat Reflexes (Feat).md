# Combat Reflexes (Feat)
## Overview
You can make additional attacks of opportunity.

**Benefit:** You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your Dexterity bonus. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

**Normal:** A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and canâ€™t make attacks of opportunity while [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

**Special:** The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability more than once per round.
