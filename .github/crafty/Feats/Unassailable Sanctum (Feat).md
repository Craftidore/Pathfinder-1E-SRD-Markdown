# Unassailable Sanctum (Feat)
## Overview
While you are within your [[Pearl of Power (3rd)|sanctum]], you are better protected from harmful spells.

**Prerequisite:** Must have at least one [[Places of Power_ Sanctums|sanctum]] with at least 5 sanctum points invested in it.

**Benefit:** As long as you are within your [[Places of Power_ Sanctums|sanctum]], whenever you are forced to make a saving throw to resist the effects of a spell or spell-like ability, you may roll twice and take the better result.
