# Spontaneous Nature's Ally (Feat)
## Overview
Instead of casting a cure spell, you can instead cast *summon nature’s ally*.

**Prerequisites**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) 5 ranks, ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, [[Animal (Domain)|Animal]] or [[Plant (Domain)|Plant]] domain.

**Benefit**: You can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature’s ally* spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a *cure* spell or an *inflict* spell as you normally would.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 157
