# Merry Men (Feat)
## Overview
You gain followers of a better calibre and level than usual.

**Prerequisites:** [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]], character level 7th.

**Benefit:** You gain additional skilled followers that are more like cohorts than followers. For every two character levels (rounded down) you gain an enhanced follower (a "Merry Man"). Merry men are normally 2 levels below the level of your cohort; however if you have the [[Improved Cohort (Feat)|Improved Cohort]] feat each merry man can be one level lower than your cohort. If you have the Practiced Cohort feat, teamwork benefits extend to your merry men even if they do not meet the prerequisites. 

When adventuring, for each merry man or cohort you bring along, you must also bring 1 follower. Followers and merry men do not necessarily have to actively adventure (ie. enter the dungeon, instead they may be keep watch on the camp and mounts, forage for food, etc.). 

The loss of a merry man or follower causes a -1 penalty to your leadership score until you level (this occurs even if the loss was a death that was subsequently negated through *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* or similiar magic); losses cannot be replaced until you level. 

Merry men and your cohort must be maintained within one upkeep level (DMG 130) of your own. Followers must be maintained within 2 levels. Followers, cohorts and merry men must equipped and maintained at NPC levels (DMG, pg. 127) except for those followers of first level, who come with basic gear. 

Merry men advance in level as cohorts do (ie. advancing in level when you do). 

You may not have more than 1 merry man per two character levels of any given character class except your favored class(es).

**Normal:** You receive followers as per the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat.

**Special:** N/A.
