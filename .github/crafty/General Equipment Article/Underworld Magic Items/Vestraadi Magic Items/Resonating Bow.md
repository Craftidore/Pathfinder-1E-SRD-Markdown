Made from the bones of huge aquatic beasts from the lightless depths of the Forever Deep, a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] firing an arrow with this bow may, as a bonus action, imbue his ***combat sonar*** or ***discerning pulse*** in the arrow, treating the place where the arrow lands as though the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] had emitted the pulse there.
