You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this whip, made from the tentacle of an unknowable monstrous thing from the depths. When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 psychic damage, as the whip comes disturbingly to life. A target hit that takes maximum damage from this attack also must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and canâ€™t use reactions for 1 minute.
