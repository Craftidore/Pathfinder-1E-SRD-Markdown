## Description
This grisly crown is made from unnaturally smooth obsidian inlaid with gemstones of varying colors and complexity, but entirely covered in gore that reappears as soon as it is wiped away.

The wearer of a *true* *[[Ahool|ahool]]** crown* gains the ability to mentally command swarms of creatures. As an action, you can target a number of swarms with a collective number of Hit Dice no greater than your own and subject them to a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma and Constitution modifiers. On a failed save, each of the individual creatures of the swarm are subject to your total and absolute, permanent mental control. [[Ahooling|Ahoolings]] controlled while in their swarm form and similar creatures that can assume swarm forms remain under your control upon reverting to their original forms.

While youâ€™re wearing the *true* *[[Ahool|ahool]]** crown*, you may control multiple swarms, but their total Hit Die may never exceed your own.
