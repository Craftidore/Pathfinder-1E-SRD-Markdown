## Description
These candles are made from the corpses of the dead with the *[[Fashion Blood Candle|fashion blood candle]]* cantrip. Blood is drained from the body, hair shaven and cut up. The former is mixed with wax to make a candle, lit by the latter as its wick. *A [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] lighting a blood candle with a soul inside sees it burn down rapidly—it takes a blood candle 1 minute per hit die or level of the creature’s soul to burn down.* When a *blood candle* has burned down, the soul within is siphoned down to the devils of Hel.
