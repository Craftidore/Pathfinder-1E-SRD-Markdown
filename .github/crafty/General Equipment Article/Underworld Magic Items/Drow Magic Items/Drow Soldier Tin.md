# Drow Soldier Tin
## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item
#Special-Item-Type/Magic-Item

**Group**: Wondrous Items

**Rarity**: Uncommon

## Description
This small, silver tin is a thin metal case that never appears to have anything inside. Once per day, it can be used to create a single one pound bar of semi-solid food that is odorless, tasteless, colorless and entirely invisible. While not nutritious, it’s enough for one medium sized creature to subsist on daily for a few weeks before malnutrition sets in. This bar of food never goes bad. The “food” from *[[Drow|drow]] soldier tins* can also be used as an improvised ranged weapon that duplicates the effects of a *grease* spell to the area targeted.
