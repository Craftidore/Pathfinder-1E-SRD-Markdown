## Description
This murky, dark water smells faintly of almonds. When a creature is doused in a gallon of *underwater*, shadows wrap around their body, granting a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. So long as a doused character is in complete darkness or within 10 feet of an area of dim light, they may make a Dexterity (Stealth) check even while being observed. *Underwater* dries quickly, lasting only 1d6+5 rounds when used while exerting oneself (running at full speed, taking an action to move in a round of combat or attacking in combat). It does not function underwater and is destroyed one round after being diluted.
