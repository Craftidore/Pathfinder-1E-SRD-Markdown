## Description
A [[Drow|drow]] with the serpent’s tongue feature may write down tailor-made insults towards a specific individual with a [[Drow Quill|drow quill]] on *[[Kllellek Paper|kllellek paper]]* in a process that requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and that the [[Drow|drow]] speaks the language of the target of the sheet. This creates a sheet that condemns the target for real or imagined atrocities concocted by the vicious mind of the [[Drow|drow]]. The paper can be added to either a weapon or an armor the [[Drow|drow]] uses as an action that provokes opportunity attacks. Only one sheet may be attached to a given item and an enemy may only be subject to one such item at any given time. Once attached, the insults, provided the target creature can understand and read them, irritate the target. The creature suffers from disadvantage to attack rolls for 1 round after clearly seeing the sheet. Most intelligent creatures are also wont to attack a [[Drow|drow]] sporting such a paper before other targets (subject to GM’s approval). The cost of such a sheet is equal to that of the *[[Kllellek Paper|kllellek paper]]*, though [[Drow|drow]] usually charge up to 5 gp times the challenge rating of a target to provide a condemnation sheet to interested parties.
