## Description
This stone cube is small, but when you use an action to place it on the ground and the command word is spoken, it grows to form a full blacksmithing forge 20 feet square and 20 feet high, with an unending fire, anvil, smith’s tools and chimney, allowing a craftsman to engage in the crafting downtime activity anywhere. The stone walls (AC 17, 50 hit points) extend 5 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over; if activated in a space it cannot fit, it expands to the maximum possible size. The structure has a small, simple wooden door (AC 15, 27 hit points) that opens only at the command of the person who uttered the command word. The *instant forge* springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the user. Creature nearby, with the exception of the owner must be careful not to be caught in the forge’s sudden growth. Creatures in the area where the forge appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, creatures are pushed to an unoccupied space outside, but next to the forge. Objects that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically. Damage to the forge can be repaired normally. The *instant forge* is deactivated by speaking the command word. It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.
