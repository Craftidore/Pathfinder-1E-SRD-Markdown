## Description
These enchanted greaves are made from [[Draaki|draaki]] scales covered in a reflective lacquer that shines a dull orange in torchlight. So long as the wearer has at least two surfaces no farther than 15 feet apart (for a Medium creature; 20 feet apart for a Large creature or 10 feet apart for a Small creature) to bounce against, they can ricochet their body from one to the next. Once on a new wall, they can fall slowly for 20 feet and before bounding across again, allowing them to fall any distance indefinitely.
