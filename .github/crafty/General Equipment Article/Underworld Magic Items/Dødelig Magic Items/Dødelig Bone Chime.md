## Description
This collection of bones seems to hang from its handle on invisible strings.

When played by a character proficient with a musical instrument (an action each turn), all creatures within 30 feet of the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to do nothing but dance for 1 round. Melee attacks against dancing creatures gain advantage and dancing creatures do not gain the benefits of shields and suffer disadvantage to Dexterity saving throws.
