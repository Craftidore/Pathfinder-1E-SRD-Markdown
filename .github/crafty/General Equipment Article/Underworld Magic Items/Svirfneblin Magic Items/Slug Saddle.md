## Description
This otherwise normal saddle is covered in a seemingly endless coating of greenish slime. When equipped to a [[Svirf Riding Slug|svirf riding slug]] (or any other slug mount), you are nigh impossible to unseat from your slug mount; you gain advantage on saves to avoid being unseated or falling prone from slugs or snails with this saddle.
