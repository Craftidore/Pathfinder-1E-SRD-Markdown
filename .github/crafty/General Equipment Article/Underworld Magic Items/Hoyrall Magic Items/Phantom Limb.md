## Description
Small carapaces of purples and golds mould together to make up this cap. When placed over the stub of a lost appendage, a new limb(colored as the cap is) appears within one round where the lost one used to be. It is just as strong, dexterous and sturdy as the original arm, leg, tail, tentacle or wing and is able to be used by the wearer just as a real limb would be. In addition to this, the wearer may make attacks with the *phantom limb*, which acts a magical weapon for the purpose of determining whether resistances or immunities of incorporeal beings like ghosts apply. Non-[[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] find the limb repulsive however, and the wearer suffers disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks against non-[[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] if the limb is exposed.
