## Description
This belt is made from the leathery skin of an unrecognizable creature from the Underworld of Aventyr and festooned with sheathed daggers. When a dagger is drawn from the belt by the wielder, another appears in its place. After being dropped, disarmed or used to make a ranged attack, a dagger from a *bandolier of endless daggers* disappears in one round. All daggers drawn from a *bandolier of endless daggers* are well-made, but never magical.
