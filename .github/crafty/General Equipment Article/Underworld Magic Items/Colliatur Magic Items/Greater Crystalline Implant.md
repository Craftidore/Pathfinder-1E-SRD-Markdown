## Description
This curious item looks much like a regular [[Crystalline Implant|crystalline implant]], except that it is jet black. A greater [[Crystalline Implant|crystalline implant]] is utilized in much the same way as its regular counterpart, but grants no *telepathic bond* or special consideration for cure and divination spells. The bearer of a greater [[Crystalline Implant|crystalline implant]] is granted immunity to indirect effects of the colloid; it never counts as difficult terrain for the wearer, and there are no drawbacks or ill effects from using any items derived from the colloid.
