# Crystalline Crossbow Rules
## Overview
***Capacity.*** Each crystalline crossbow has a Capacity to hold a number of bolts before requiring a reload. This is denoted by the firearm's Capacity rating.

***Reload.*** Each crystalline crossbow holds a different amount of ammunition, as denoted by the Capacity value of the crossbow. Reloading a crystalline crossbow once its Capacity is emptied requires focused concentration and takes an action during combat.

**Rates of Fire**

***Burst.*** The crystalline crossbow can fire short bursts, improving its damage. A burst consumes at least 3 bolts, but allows you to increase the damage inflicted on a successful attack by an additional damage die. A hand crossbow would deal +1d6 damage, for example, while a light crossbow would deal + 1d8 damage.

***Spread.*** Crystalline crossbows with the spread property allow the wielder to affect more than one creature or object per shot, but only at normal range. When firing the crossbow, any creatures adjacent to the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder’s proficiency bonus + wielder’s choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or take damage equal to one die step lower than the base damage die of the firearm used. A crossbow with a base damage of 1d6 would for example deal 1d4 piercing damage to targets affected by such shrapnel, while a crossbow with a base damage of 1d10 would deal 1d8 piercing damage from spread fire.

***Automatic Fire.*** Instead of shooting at a single target, crossbows with this rate of fire property can target a 10-foot cubical area within long range with bullets. Every creature in that area must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder’s proficiency bonus + wielder’s choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or suffer the damage of the attack. Creatures take no damage on a successful save. Targets have advantage on their saving throw if the distance is equal to or greater than the weapon’s normal range. An attack with an automatic fire crystalline crossbow consumes at least 10 bolts.

**Designer's note**

The [[Crystal Cannonade|crystalline cannonade]]’s system is intentionally designed so it works with the [[Firearm Rules|firearm rules]] introduced in this book. GMs who do not want black powder firearms in their campaign still can easily use the [[Crystal Cannonade|crystalline cannonade]].
