# Amberized Lodestone
## Overview
**Price**: 2000 gp (typically)

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

## Description
This mottled, fist-sized piece of orange stone is suffused with the precise magical energy of a specific [[Zwerc|zwerc]] enclave. By inserting one of these stones into an [[Amber Attenuator]] and concentrating on it, a magical resonance is generated in a 30-ft-sphere surrounding the attenuator, clinging to the creatures for 1 minute before vanishing. Any creatures attuned with this resonance that enter the Amber Road are immediately transported to the [[Zwerc|zwerc]] enclave keyed to the lodestone. *Detect Magic* can perceive resonance as a faint, amber aura. If two different resonances overlap, the interference becomes problematic: You roll a d%: On a 01–50, you incur a teleportation mishap and all teleported creatures (or objects) take 3d10 force damage and reroll. Multiple mishaps can occur thanks to the damage done to the Amber Road. On a 51–100, you arrive at a similar area.
