## Description
This is another strange creature from the cosmos, brought to Aventyr along with the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] and their savage, alien culture. Grown in hatcheries of eggs suspended from the ceiling (requiring a daily DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check to keep alive until they gestate), they ultimately look similar to a crossbow in form, bearing a very small familiarity to a miniature stingray set upon a stock handle. Siktauryi feed on poisons of any and all varieties. Their otherworldly metabolisms break toxins down into potent acid, kept in an organ near their ‘front’ that can be stimulated to fire its contents outward. A siktauryi’s shots deal acid damage and siktauryi have a Capacity of 12. Most [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] feed their siktauryi with their own, toxic blood, but siktauryi can break down just about any type of poison. One dose of poison is converted into 5 siktauryi shots. For poisons with a save DC of 15 or higher, increase the damage of a siktauryi’s shot to 2d6. For poisons with a DC of 20 or higher, increase the damage of a siktauryi’s shot to 3d6. For poisons with a DC of 25 or higher, increase the damage of a siktauryi’s shot to 4d6. Siktauryi have 20 hit points and a damage threshold of 10. They are not technically constructs or objects and are healed by cure spells just like any other living creature (though these odd aliens do not need to breathe or sleep, and are immune to acid damage). Siktauryi cannot fire [[Underwater|underwater]], just burp forth an impotent sludge.

**Rare Siktauryi**

There are supposedly rarer, more powerful forms of siktauryi. You can use the [[Firearm Rules|firearm rules]] presented in this book to further customize and create unique siktauryi.
