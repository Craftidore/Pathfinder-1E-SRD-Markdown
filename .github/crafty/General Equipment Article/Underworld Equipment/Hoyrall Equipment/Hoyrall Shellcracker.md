## Description
Known as “megalomania blades” by other races, these immense weapons were made for [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] that lack the coordination to wield multiple weapons. The ridiculously massive and heavy blades are enormous and look more like an oversized chunk of steel than an actual weapon: even the strongest [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] require all 4 of their arms to properly wield these monstrous blades. All shellcrackers are made for [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] and thus are Small, heavy, fourhanded weapons—their very design is different from usual blades. A shellcracker requires a Strength score of 16 or higher to even lift or carry and the wielder suffers from disadvantage on attack, initiative, and damage rolls if the wielder’s Strength score is beneath 20. Just carrying a shellcracker around is enough to be considered **encumbered**. If the wielder already is **encumbered**, it instead becomes **heavily encumbered**. Non-[[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] attempting to wield a shellcracker suffer from disadvantage on attack and damage rolls, and do not add proficiency bonus or attribute modifiers to the rolls—it requires 4 arms to effectively wield and is perfectly attuned to a [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]]’s size and physique: If the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] is subject to a size-increase, it suffers from disadvantage to attack rolls made with a shellcracker. These blades are nigh indestructible and have a damage threshold of 30 and 50 hp. [[Hoyrall]] with a Strength score of 16 or higher have proficiency with a shellcracker.
