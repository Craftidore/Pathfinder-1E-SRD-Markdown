## Description
These half circular or crescent-moon-shaped blades are called “shev’saluri” in the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] tongue, which translates roughly to “food-trail maker.” Since [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] can smell the heavily injured and dead, the implications are pretty obvious. The blades usually have a resin-wrapped handle roughly in the center of the weapon and usually are found and wielded in pairs of two or four. The more common known name of capblades was given to them by other underworld races, who noticed a similarity to the curvature of mushrooms. The [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] capblade is a martial weapon. [[Hoyrall]] have proficiency in a capblade’s use. Due to the similarity with katars and similar weapons, monks and assassins have proficiency with it as well.
