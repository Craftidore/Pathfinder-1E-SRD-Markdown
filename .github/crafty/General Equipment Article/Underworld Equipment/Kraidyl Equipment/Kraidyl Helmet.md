**Price**: 50 lbs. + special material

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

## Description
[[Kraidyl]] relish the feeling of ripping foes apart with their jaws—but unfortunately, there are creatures that are resistant to being chewed into itty-bitty pieces. This savage cap of leather may not be much of a helmet, but its straps on the snout can be fitted with “teeth” of different materials, allowing for the proper “eating your enemies” experience. [[Kraidyl]] helmets are treated as weapons, not as armor, for the purpose of which special materials (like silver, mithral, adamantine, cold iron...) can be applied to them. They never gain the benefits of armor made from the material. They convey their special material’s benefits to the [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]’s bite attack.
