# Camouflage Grit
## Overview
**Price**: 30 gp

**Weight**: â€”

## Description
Mixing together the fluids of prey and exotic substances from Underworld marshes, [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] have developed a strange concoction able to mix with water and absorb some of the color from any solid object. With one minute of time and a waterskin, camouflage grit can be used to create a makeup disguise that functions as nearly perfect camouflage. The creature applying the camouflage grit makes a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check and on a success, paints the camouflage grit sufficiently well enough to allow the creature wearing it to gain the benefits of being treated as though it were in a lightly obscured area, so long as it remains motionless and does not move from where the makeup was applied to emulate the surroundings. Any movement by the creature destroys camouflage grit. A creature may never apply camouflage grit to itself.
