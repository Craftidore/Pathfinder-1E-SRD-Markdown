# Staunching Moss
## Overview
**Price**: 50 gp

**Weight**: —

## Description
Like the [[Moss Net|moss net]], this item appears to be a tiny ball of compressed vegetable matter—unwary explorers have met untimely ends because they did not differentiate the two. A staunching moss also expands when used, but its area of effect is quite limited, covering a limb or patch of flesh without encumbering its user. When used in conjunction with Wisdom (Medicine) checks, staunching moss grants advantage to the check to treat an injury.
