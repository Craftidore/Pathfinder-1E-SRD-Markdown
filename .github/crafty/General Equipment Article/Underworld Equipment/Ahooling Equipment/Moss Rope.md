# Moss Rope
## Overview
**Price**: 30 gp

**Weight**: 8 lbs.

## Description
This rope normally has 6 hit points and can be torn with a DC 25 Strength check. Unlike standard ropes, however, a moss rope is capable of stretching considerably before breaking. Most moss ropes are designed for [[Ahooling|ahooling]], and thus support up to 350 pounds of weight at a length of 50 feet. For every additional 50 pounds of weight the moss rope bears, it extends by 10 feet, up to a maximum length of 100 feet. For every 20 feet the moss rope stretches, its effective hit points reduce by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and should it bear more than 500 pounds, it immediately snaps. Any exposure to fire (1 point of fire damage) entirely destroys a moss rope as it goes immediately up in flames.
