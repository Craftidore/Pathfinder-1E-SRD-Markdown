# Draaki Sinew Bowstring
## Overview
**Price**: +500 gp

**Weight**: 1/2 lb.

## Description
Not squeamish and fiercely nomadic, the [[Draaki|draaki]] waste very little of their dearly departed (though they do not normally eat each other; their remaining flesh is ritually sacrificed in lava), using the powerful remains of their dead to craft all manner of devices. One [[Draaki|draaki]] produces enough sinew to create a bowstring for a single longbow or heavy crossbow or two shortbows or light crossbows sized for a Medium creature. Adding *[[Draaki|draaki]] sinew bowstrings* to a ranged weapon allows you to add your Strength modifier to the damage roll with the ranged weapon instead of your Dexterity modifier. You also increase the range of your weapon by +10 feet and maximum range by +40 feet.
