# Magic Detector
## Overview
**Price**: 2500 gp

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

## Description
This metal contraption of dials, antennae, coils, and switches has a small glass screen that, when activated, lights up with different colors that denote the presence and strength of magic nearby (abjuration: cyan, conjuration: purple, divination: yellow, enchantment: pink, evocation: red, illusion: orange, necromancy: green, transmutation: brown, universal: white). An active magic detector has a constant extraordinary *detect magic* effect that consumes one charge per minute. Magic detectors have 8 charges per day, but can be recharged with the careful application of electricity: 1–5 points of lightning damage restores an equal number of charges, while 6 points or more lightning damage fully recharges a magic detector but permanently reduces its damage threshold by –1 (a magic detector is destroyed when its damage threshold equals 0). A magic detector has a damage threshold of 5 and 50 hit points.

Only svirf scientists can craft magic detectors; doing so requires the expenditure of 3 science dice as part of the crafting process.
