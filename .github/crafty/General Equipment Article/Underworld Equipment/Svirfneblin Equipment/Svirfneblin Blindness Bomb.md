# Svirfneblin Blindness Bomb
## Overview
**Price**: 420 gp

**Weight**: 1 lb.

## Description
Though this small metal canister doesnâ€™t appear to be very powerful, the mixture of magnesium, aluminum, and oxidizers within it can be ignited to create a light so bright that it prevents creatures from seeing anything near it. A [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] blindness bomb is activated by pulling its pin as a bonus action upon throwing it as a ranged weapon. At the beginning of the round after a [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] blindness bomb is activated, the mixture within it explodes with a powerful exothermic reaction that makes visual-based sight anywhere within a 30- ft. -radius of it impossible for the remainder of the round. This light does not permeate physical barriers and can be negated with *darkness*.
