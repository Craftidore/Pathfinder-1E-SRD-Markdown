## Description
Sometimes you just need power. The [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] multicrossbow is a collection of heavy crossbows modified into one. A multicrossbow has one trigger that fires all bolts at once and the crossbows are aligned so the bolts hit approximately the same spot. The alignment of the combined crossbows is done via an absurd amount of winches, cranks, and buttons, and thus only characters with an Intelligence score of 16 or higher may properly use these crossbows; all other characters can’t calculate the modifications required fast enough and thus suffer from disadvantage to all attack and damage rolls executed with the multicrossbow. For every additional crossbow added, this minimum Intelligence score is increased by +2—a [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] multicrossbow consisting of 4 heavy crossbows would for example require an Intelligence score of 20 to properly use. Additionally, a character needs to be able to carry a multicrossbow without being heavily encumbered to properly use it.

This power comes at an almost comical bulk, though: Carrying a [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] multicrossbow means that the wielder is automatically encumbered. If the wielder already is encumbered, he is heavily encumbered instead. [[Svirfneblin]] multicrossbows consisting of 3 or more crossbows added instead automatically have the wielder treated as heavily encumbered. If a character would already be heavily encumbered, he can’t properly wield the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] multicrossbow. Reloading a multicrossbow takes twice as long as a regular crossbow if two crossbows were combined, thrice as long if three were combined, etc. [[Svirfneblin]] multicrossbows are martial ranged weapons.

As an example: A [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] has a multicrossbow made of three heavy crossbows. He has the required Intelligence score of 18 to properly use the multicrossbow. Since the multicrossbow contains more than two crossbows, the character is **heavily encumbered**: His speed drops to 20 feet and the character has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity or Constitution. An attack with the crossbow would fire three bolts, all at the same target. The wielder rolls separately for these attacks. After that, the [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] would have to spend three times as long to reload the multicrossbow as it would take the character to reload a single heavy crossbow.
