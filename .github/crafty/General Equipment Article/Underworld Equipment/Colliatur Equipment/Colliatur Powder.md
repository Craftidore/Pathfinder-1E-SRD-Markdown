# Colliatur Powder
## Overview
**Price**: 100 gp per spell level.

**Weight**: —

## Description
The pulverized remains of a [[Colliatur|colliatur]]’s brain make for powerful material components when used in conjunction with spells of the divination school. Applying 100 gp worth of it per spell level of the base spell lets the caster cast it as though they prepared it in a spell slot of one level higher or, if your target creature or object is shielded from divination via *nondetection* or similar means, you may make a Charisma saving throw to penetrate this defense.
