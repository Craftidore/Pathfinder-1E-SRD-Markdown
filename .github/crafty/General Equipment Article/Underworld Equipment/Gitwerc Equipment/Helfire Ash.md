# Helfire Ash
## Overview
**Price**: 700 gp

**Weight**: —

## Description
This ash from the pits of Hel appears to be fine, powdered, black diamond dust, except that it smells overwhelmingly of clover. Any spell cast with *helfire ash* as a material component that does fire damage converts half that damage to necrotic damage. A spellcaster can only utilize three uses of *helfire ash* a day before the strain of creating a connection to the core of Aventyr becomes too much for a mortal to bear; a fourth use of the substance knocks them unconscious for 8 hours, with no means of waking the caster from this coma before the time has elapsed.
