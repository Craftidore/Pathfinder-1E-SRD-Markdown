# Hel Bottle
## Overview
**Price**: 300 gp

**Weight**: 1 lb.

## Description
Down near the core of Aventyr, flows of lava are not uncommon. [[Gitwerc]] bottle magma in special ceramic containers made with the blood of their victims, always warm to the touch. Hel can be thrown up to 60 ft. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the hel bottle as an improvised weapon. Hel bottles explode upon impact, erupting into a 20-ft. -radius sphere where they fall. Each creature in that radius must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) or take 2d6 necrotic and 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.
