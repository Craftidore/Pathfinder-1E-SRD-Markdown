# Aerodynamic Picks
## Overview
**Price**: +200 gp

## Description
Via a complex array of adjustments, [[Dvergr|dvergr]] can modify war picks, even magic war picks, and specially balance them to be thrown in battle. They have the same statistics as war picks, save that they gain the thrown (range 20/60) property.
