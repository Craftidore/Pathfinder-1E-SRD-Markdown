# Weapon Webbing
## Overview
**Price**: 360 gp

**Weight**: 1/2 lb.

## Description
This 10-foot-long, thin thong of spider’s silk rope attaches your weapon to your wrist. You treat a weapon with attached weapon webbing as though it had the reach property. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as a bonus action with a successful Dexterity check (DC 12).

While wearing weapon webbing, attacks made with weapons other than the one tied to weapon webbing receive a –2 penalty.

Alternatively, you may throw a weapon tied with weapon webbing as though it had the thrown (10/20) property. You use your Strength for this attack, unless you are using a weapon with the finesse property, in which case you can use either your choice of Strength or Dexterity. You may recover the thrown weapon as a bonus action with a successful Dexterity check (DC 12) that provokes an opportunity attack.
