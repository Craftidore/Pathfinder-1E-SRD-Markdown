# Web Shackles
## Overview
**Price**: 70 gp

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

## Description
This specially crafted ceramic bottle contains liquid webs that harden within one round of exposure to air. As an action, they may be carefully applied to a creatureâ€™s limbs to bind them or, otherwise, as a type of adhesive. A creature restrained must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 25) to free itself. Web shackles may be thrown as an improvised weapon up to 20 feet. With a successful ranged attack, the bottle explodes, dealing 2 points of bludgeoning damage and restraining any hit targets that fail a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw (the DCs to burst out of the entanglement are the same as above). Web shackles are dissolved by *universal solvent*.
