# Boletann
## Description
Underworld craftsman have mastered the use of mushroom skins to make numerous items, incorporating the natural resource into both weapons and armor. One Medium sized mushroom produces enough skin for a single suit of hide armor for a small sized creature, as well as a shield. Armor made from Boletann increases its AC by +1 against slashing damage if it’s light armor, by +2 against slashing damage if it’s medium armor and by +3 against slashing damage if it’s heavy armor.

The wearer also receives also receives resistance to acid, but since boletann is flammable, any wearer of boletann armor also suffers from fire vulnerability. Druids can wear Boletann with impunity. Weapons made from Boletann (which can be cured to provide a sharp blade or a hard blunt edge) remain slightly porous and can hold up to three doses of poison.

Boletann sheathes are sold with the weapon (for half the weapon’s cost) and can hold up to twelve doses of poison at a time; when sheathed in one, a Boletann weapon absorbs as much poison as it can (doing so at a rate of once per round).

Boletann’s fungoid structure can keep a [[Maculosfunglets|maculosfunglet]]’s poison potent for 2 days. Boletann weapons and armor cost two and a half times as much as usual and creating them takes twice as long as ordinary weapons and armor of that type.

Boletann has 8 hit points per inch of thickness and a damage threshold of 7; most mushroom skins are between an inch and two inches in thickness.
