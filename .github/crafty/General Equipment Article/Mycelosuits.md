# Mycelosuits
## Overview
Many of the mushrooms in the Fungi Forest have special properties utilized in the practice of magic but some spellcasters have mastered the art of crafting fungal skins into powerful items known as *mycelosuits*. As an action, a wearer may command a *mycelosuit* to spread around the body of the user, covering them in mushroom skin from head to toe when the appropriate command word is spoken (the same command causes it to recede to a Tiny item.

The type of mushroom used to create the *mycelosuit* indicates what abilities it grants.

When activated, a *mycelosuit* covers the wearer (and their equipment) from head to toe, but allows them to breathe and eat normally. While encased in a *mycelosuit*, the wearer suffers from disadvantage to all hearing- and scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks as the frills of the mushroom skin slightly overlap near the ears and nose. The skin is connected to the user in a primal fashion and recedes appropriately when access to equipment or parts of the body is needed; held items or those specifically excluded are not covered by a *mycelosuit*. Only one *mycelosuit* can be worn at a time.

These bizarre magical items are off-putting and exotic to surface dwellers. Creatures wearing these suits suffer disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with surface dwellers while the suit is activated. Even when withdrawn, the knowledge of an item on a personâ€™s body is more than enough to unsettle upperworlders and incur this penalty; *mycelosuit* owners that walk above often take care not to openly display their enchanted suits.

The articles in this grouping comprise the different [[Funglets|Funglet]] *mycelosuits* introduced in [[Underworld Races and Classes|Underworld Races & Classes]]. See the list of Governed Content on the right for a complete list of names and links.
