**Granted Powers:** You can speak with machines and magical or mechanical constructs, control constructs, and ultimately become metal-graced by Rava. You treat [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] as a class skill, and you may elect to make “repair metal” spells your class-specific spontaneous casting selection, no matter your alignment.

*Speak with Machines (Sp):* You can speak with machines, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your cleric level.

*Metal-Graced (Ex):* At 8th level, Rava graces you, her faithful, with a machine-like quality. A thin coating of metal covers your back, torso, and appendages, granting you a damage reduction 5/adamantine. This damage resistance increases to DR 8 at 12th level. At 20th level, you gain DR 10.

**Subdomains:** Construct, Metal. For the Construct subdomain, the Animate Servant granted power replaces the Goddess-Graced power of the Clockwork domain.

**Replacement Spells:** 7th—*[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, 8th—*[[Polymorph Any Object (Spell)|polymorph any object]]**.*

For the Metal subdomain, the Metal Fist ability replaces the Speak with Machines granted power of the Clockwork domain.
