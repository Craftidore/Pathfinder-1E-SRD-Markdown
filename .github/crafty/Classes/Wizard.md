Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.

**Role:** While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger. 

**Alignment:** Any.

**Hit Die:** d6.

**Class Skills**

The wizard’s class skills are [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] (Dex), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (all) (Int), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] (Int), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (Int).

Skill Ranks per Level: 2 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells:** A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in Chapter 10 (of the Core Rulebook). A wizard must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3–16. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 of the Core Rulebook).

A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages:** A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

**Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp):** At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. Rules for familiars appear on page 82 (of the Core Rulebook), while rules for bonded items are given below.

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see arcane school).

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] feat in Chapter 5 of the Core Rulebook). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

**Arcane School:** A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a [[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.

**Cantrips:** Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 3–16 under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below). 

**Scribe Scroll:** At 1st level, a wizard gains [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats:** At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]]. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] when choosing those feats.

**Spellbooks:** A wizard must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]*, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to his own (see Chapter 9 of the *PFRG Core Rulebook*).

## Alternate Favored Class Bonuses
**Alternate Favored Class Bonuses**

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a Favored Class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their Favored Classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have wizards as their Favored Class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed Favored Class reward. 


| **Race** | **Bonus** | **Source** |
|---|---|---|
| [[Dwarf]] | Add 1/3 to the effective caster level of wizard abjuration spells, but only to determine duration. | Horror Adventures, pg. |
| [[Elf]] | Select one arcane school power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the wizard's Intelligence modifier. The wizard adds +1/2 to the number of uses per day of that arcane school power. | Advanced Players Guide, pg. 13 |
| [[Gnoll]] | Add +1/2 to the wizard’s effective class level for the purposes of determining his familiar’s natural armor adjustment, Intelligence, and special abilities. |  |
| [[Gnome]] | Add +1/2 to the number of uses per day of arcane school powers. This increase only applies to arcane school powers available at 1st level and normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the wizard's Intelligence modifier. | Advanced Players Guide, pg. 15 |
| [[Halfling]] | Add +1/2 to the wizard’s effective class level for the purposes of determining his familiar’s natural armor adjustment, Intelligence, and special abilities. |  |
| [[Half-Orc]] | Add a +1 bonus on concentration checks made due to taking damage while casting wizard spells. |  |
| Human | Add one spell from the wizard spell list to the wizard's spellbook. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level he can cast. | Advanced Players Guide, pg. 23 |

## Arcane Schools
**Arcane Schools**

The following descriptions detail each arcane school and its corresponding powers.

**Abjuration School**

The abjurer uses magic against itself, and masters the art of defensive and warding magics.

*Resistance (Ex):* You gain resistance 5 to an energy type of your choice, chosen when you prepare spells. This resistance can be changed each day. At 11th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, this resistance changes to immunity to the chosen energy type.

*Protective Ward (Su):* As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. All allies in this area (including you) receive a +1 deflection bonus to their AC. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Energy Absorption (Su):* At 6th level, you gain an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times your wizard level per day. Whenever you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount. Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.

**Conjuration School**

The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic alike to bend to his will.

*Summoner’s Charm (Su):* Whenever you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). At 20th level, you can change the duration of all summon monster spells to permanent. You can have no more than one summon monster spell made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another summon monster spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.

*Acid Dart (Sp):* As a standard action you can unleash an acid dart targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acid dart deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modif ier. This attack ignores spell resistance.

*Dimensional Steps (Sp):* At 8th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per wizard level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you.

**Divination School**

Diviners are masters of remote viewing, prophecies, and using magic to explore the world.

*Forewarned (Su):* You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level, anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Diviner’s Fortune (Sp):* When you activate this school power, you can touch any creature as a standard action to give it an insight bonus on all of its attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Scrying Adept (Su):* At 8th level, you are always aware when you are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent *[[Detect Scrying (Spell)|detect scrying]]*. In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more familiar to you. Very familiar subjects get a –10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.

**Enchantment School**

The enchanter uses magic to control and manipulate the minds of his victims.

*Enchanting Smile (Su):* You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, up to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. At 20th level, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell of the enchantment school, that spell is ref lected back at its caster, as per *[[Spell Turning (Spell)|spell turning]]*.

*Dazing Touch (Sp):* You can cause a living creature to become [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round as a melee touch attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Aura of Despair (Su):* At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of despair for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Enemies within this aura take a –2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Evocation School**

Evokers revel in the raw power of magic, and can use it to create and destroy with shocking ease.

*Intense Spells (Su):* Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add 1/2 your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At 20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll twice to penetrate a creature’s spell resistance and take the better result.

**Force Missile (Sp):** As a standard action you can unleash a force missile that automatically strikes a foe, as *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]*. The force missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the damage from your intense spells evocation power. This is a force effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Elemental Wall (Sp):** At 8th level, you can create a wall of energy that lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This wall deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, determined when you create it. The elemental wall otherwise functions like *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]]*.

**Illusion School**

Illusionists use magic to weave confounding images, figments, and phantoms to baffle and vex their foes.

*Extended Illusions (Su):* Any illusion spell you cast with a duration of “concentration” lasts a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level after you stop maintaining concentration (minimum +1 round). At 20th level, you can make one illusion spell with a duration of “concentration” become permanent. You can have no more than one illusion made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another illusion as permanent, the previous permanent illusion ends.

*Blinding Ray (Sp):* As a standard action you can fire a shimmering ray at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray causes creatures to be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 round instead. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Invisibility Field (Sp):* At 8th level, you can make yourself invisible as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This otherwise functions as *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]*.

**Necromancy School**

The dread and feared necromancer commands undead and uses the foul power of unlife against his enemies.

*Power over Undead (Su):* You receive [[Command Undead (Feat)|Command Undead]] or [[Turn Undead (Feat)|Turn Undead]] as a bonus feat. You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, but only to use the selected feat. You can take other feats to add to this ability, such as [[Extra Channel (Feat)|Extra Channel]] and [[Improved Channel (Feat)|Improved Channel]], but not feats that alter this ability, such as [[Elemental Channel (Feat)|Elemental Channel]] and [[Alignment Channel (Feat)|Alignment Channel]]. The DC to save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Charisma modifier. At 20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the save against this ability.

*Grave Touch (Sp):* As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that causes a living creature to become [[Shaken|shaken]] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). If you touch a [[Shaken|shaken]] creature with this ability, it becomes [[Frightened|frightened]] for 1 round if it has fewer Hit Dice than your wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Life Sight (Su):* At 8th level, you gain blindsight to a range of 10 feet for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. This ability only allows you to detect living creatures and undead creatures. This sight also tells you whether a creature is living or undead. Constructs and other creatures that are neither living nor undead cannot be seen with this ability. The range of this ability increases by 10 feet at 12th level, and by an additional 10 feet for every four levels beyond 12th.

**Transmutation School**

Transmuters use magic to change the world around them.

*Physical Enhancement (Su):* You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution). This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. You can change this bonus to a new ability score when you prepare spells. At 20th level, this bonus applies to two physical ability scores of your choice.

*Telekinetic Fist (Sp):* As a standard action you can strike with a telekinetic fist, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The telekinetic fist deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Change Shape (Sp):* At 8th level, you can change your shape for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like *[[Beast Shape II (Spell)|beast shape II]]* or *[[Elemental Body I (Spell)|elemental body I]]*. At 12th level, this ability functions like *[[Beast Shape III (Spell)|beast shape III]]* or *[[Elemental Body II (Spell)|elemental body II]]*.

**Universalist School**

Wizards who do not specialize (known as as universalists) have the most diversity of all arcane spellcasters.

*Hand of the Apprentice (Su):* You cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe before instantly returning to you. As a standard action, you can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Intelligence modifier on the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (damage still relies on Strength). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Metamagic Mastery (Su):* At 8th level, you can apply any one metamagic feat that you know to a spell you are about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every two wizard levels you possess beyond 8th. Any time you use this ability to apply a metamagic feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you must use an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the feat adds to the spell. Even though this ability does not modify the spell’s actual level, you cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that you are capable of casting.

## Focused Arcane Schools
**Focused Arcane Schools**

Wizards that specialize in one of the schools of magic can instead chose to focus their studies still further. Wizards who choose a focused arcane school retain the bonus spells from their school and must select two prohibited schools as normal, but the focused school changes one or more of the powers granted by their arcane school. A wizard must take all of the replacement powers associated with his focused arcane school. Once a focused arcane school is chosen, it cannot be changed.

**Admixture School**

**Associated School:** Evocation.

**Replacement Powers:** The following school powers replace the force missile and elemental wall powers of the evocation school.

*Versatile Evocation (Su):* When you cast an evocation spell that does acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you may change the damage dealt to one of the other four energy types. This changes the descriptor of the spell to match the new energy type. Any non-damaging effects remain unchanged unless the new energy type invalidates them (an *[[Ice Storm (Spell)|ice storm]]* that deals fire damage might still provide a penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks due to smoke, but it would not create difficult terrain). Such effects are subject to GM discretion. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Elemental Manipulation (Su):* At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that transforms magical energy. Choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, and fire, and a second type to transform it into. Any magical source of energy of this type with a caster level equal to or less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white dragon’s frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire elemental’s fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Arcanamirium School**

**Associated School**: Universalist.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the hand of the apprentice power of the universalist school.

**Metacharge (Ex)**: As an Arcanamirium crafter, you gain a bonus feat at 3rd level, which must be an item creation feat or metamagic feat. You must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. When using metamagic feats to create magic items, your skill and understanding of the principles involved in the item’s creation give you a +2 bonus on the skill check made to create the item.

**Source:** Inner Sea Primer, pgs. 28-29

**Banishment School**

**Associated School:** Abjuration.

**Replacement Powers:** The following school powers replace the energy absorption power and the protective ward power of the abjuration school.

*Unstable Bonds (Su):* At 1st level, your touch can disrupt the bonds that hold a summoned or called creature on this plane. As a melee touch attack, you can cause a summoned or called creature to become [[Shaken|shaken]] and [[Staggered|staggered]] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Aura of Banishment (Su):* At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of banishment for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Any summoned or called creature in the area must make a Will save each round. Once the creature fails a Will saving throw, it is [[Staggered|staggered]] as long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second Will saving throw, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and the spell that summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more than one creature, only the creature that failed its saving throws is affected. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Controller School**

**Associated School:** Enchantment.

*Replacement Powers:* The following school powers replace the enchanting smile and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

*Force of Will (Su):* You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.

*Irresistible Demand (Sp):* At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the *[[Dominate Monster (Spell)|dominate monster]]* spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide (Paizo), pgs. 142-143)

**Counterspell School**

The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell’s level. If the check is failed, the target’s spell is wasted.

Creating an item to an exact specification might require a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill check, subject to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts.

*Creator’s Will (Sp):* At 8th level, you can cast *[[Minor Creation (Spell)|minor creation]]* as a spell-like ability. You can have no more than one minor creation active at a time.

*Prescience (Su):* At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next turn, it is lost. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Foretell (Su):* At 8th level, you can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While your foretelling is in effect, you emit a 30-foot aura of fortune that aids your allies or hinders your enemies, as chosen by you at the time of prediction. If you choose to aid, you and your allies gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks.

If you have a free hand, you can catch an object hurled toward yourself. You can move objects weighing up to 1 pound per wizard level.

**Associated School:** Necromancy.

**Replacement Powers:** The following school powers replace the power over undead and grave touch powers of the necromancy school.

*Healing Grace (Su):* Whenever you cast a spell that has targets, affects creatures in an area, or requires an attack roll, you may heal creatures affected by the spell a total of 1 point of damage per level of the spell. This healing may be spread out between the targets of the spell in any way you choose. If you assign any of the healing to an undead creature, it instead takes 1 point of damage for each point assigned. At 11th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 2 points of damage per level of the spell. This healing occurs when the spell is cast and has no effect on creatures that enter its area after the spell is in place. At 20th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 3 points of damage per level of the spell.

*Share Essence (Sp):* As a standard action, you can share your vital energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to or greater than your current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself temporary hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. This ability has no effect if you are immune to nonlethal damage.

**Replacement Powers:** The following school powers replace the dazing touch and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

*Beguiling Touch (Sp):* You can charm a living creature by touching it. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you.

Creatures that fail their save are affected by *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]* for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Shape Emotions (Su):* At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to either ward off or welcome emotional influence for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level.

If you chose to enhance emotional inf luence, enemies within the aura receive a –2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Binding Darkness (Sp):* As a standard action, you cast a *weave of shadows* at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The shadows entangle your foe for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every five wizard levels you possess. In conditions of bright light, this duration is halved (minimum 1 round). A creature entangled by your shadows has concealment from those without darkvision or the ability to see in darkness, and other creatures likewise have concealment relative to it. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Shadow Step (Sp):* At 8th level, you can use this ability to walk through the Shadow Plane and reappear as a standard action. You can travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in 5-foot increments and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons (see page 202 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). If this would place you in an occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in shadow and gain concealment as the *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]* spell for 1 round. You may bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you. They likewise re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in shadow for 1 round.

## Elemental Arcane Schools
**Elemental Arcane Schools**

Instead of specializing in one of the standard eight schools of magic, a wizard can choose to specialize in one of the four elemental schools of magic. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school’s spell list (see Chapter 5 of the Advanced Player's Guide). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.

**Air School**

The air elementalist uses the forces of the wind, sky, clouds, and lightning to confuse and destroy his foes, all while flying through the air with ease.

*Air Supremacy (Su):* You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* on yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]* on yourself at will. At 10th level, you can cast *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* on yourself at will. At 20th level, whenever you make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Lightning Flash (Su):* As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the [[Dazzled|dazzled]] effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Cyclone (Su):* At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Earth School**

The earth elementalist draws power from the stone around him, shaping it, shattering it, and bending it to his will. He can use it to defend himself or cause it to rise up and crush his foes.

*Earth Supremacy (Su):* You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to resist bull rush, pull, push, reposition, trip, and overrun attempts as long as you are touching the ground. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you and your foe are touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do not block the line of effect of your spells, although they do still block your line of sight.

*Acid Cloud (Su):* As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of acid vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the [[Sickened|sickened]] effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the cloud can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the cloud are affected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Earth Glide (Su):* At 8th level, you gain the ability to move through earth, dirt, and stone for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. You cannot move through worked earth or stone; only natural substances can be traversed. If your total duration expires before you exit the earth, you are flung back to the point where you entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage, and are [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor does it give any sign of your presence (although you can be detected by creatures with tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Fire School**

The fire elementalist sees a world around him that is made to burn, and he can bring that fire to consume his foes. He has also learned that fire can purify and protect, if properly controlled.

*Fire Supremacy (Su):* You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.

*Fire Jet (Su):* As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round. Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Dancing Flame (Su):* At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell, within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell, even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

(**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide (Paizo), pgs. 142-143)

**Metal School**

Metal represents firmness, rigidity, persistence, strength, determination, and electricity. It is commonly represented by gold and silver as its purest forms, though lower magic relating to iron and steel is part of the metal school.

*Metal Magic:* At 1st level, add the following spells to your wizard spell list at the listed spell level: 3rd—*[[Chill Metal (Spell)|chill metal]]*, *[[Heat Metal (Spell)|heat metal]]*, 5th—*[[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]]*, 9th—*[[Repel Metal or Stone (Spell)|repel metal or stone]]*.

Whenever you cast a spell that deals hit point damage, you deal extra damage to creatures made of metal or wearing medium or heavy metal armor. Affected creatures take additional damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level. This bonus damage is not increased by [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]] or similar effects. This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. The damage is of the same type as the spell.

At 20th level, whenever you cast a spell on a creature made of metal or wearing medium or heavy armor, you can roll twice to penetrate the creature’s spell resistance and take the better result.

*Iron Skin (Su):* You gain a +2 armor bonus to your Armor Class for 10 minutes; this bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels (maximum +6 at 20th level). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence bonus.

*Shrapnel Burst (Su):* At 8th level, as a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two wizard levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst. A Ref lex save halves this damage. In addition, the twisted scraps of metal make the area difficult terrain until your next turn (at which time they disappear). You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. At 10th-level, the shrapnel bypasses damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon.

*Metal Elementalist Wizard Spells:* 0—*[[Mending (Spell)|mending]]*; 1st—*[[Gravity Bow (Spell)|gravity bow]],* *[[Magic Weapon (Spell)|magic weapon]]**,* *[[Shocking Grasp (Spell)|shocking grasp]]*; 2nd—*defensive shock,* *[[Glitterdust (Spell)|glitterdust]]**,* *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]**,* *[[Shatter (Spell)|shatter]]**, silk to steel*; 3rd—*[[Chill Metal (Spell)|chill metal]]**,* *[[Heat Metal (Spell)|heat metal]]**,* *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]**,* *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]**, [[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|magic weapon (greater)]], [[Versatile Weapon (Spell)|versatile weapon]]*; 4th—*malfunction,* *[[Shout (Spell)|shout]]**,* *[[Stoneskin (Spell)|stoneskin]]*; 5th—*lightning arc,* *[[Major Creation (Spell)|major creation]]**, rapid repair,* *[[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]]**, soothe construct, unbreakable construct*; 6th—*[[Chain Lightning (Spell)|chain lightning]]**,* *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]**,* *[[Wall of Iron (Spell)|wall of iron]]*; 7th—*control construct, lightning rod,* *[[Statue (Spell)|statue]]*; 8th—*call construct,* *[[Iron Body (Spell)|iron body]]**, [[Shout, Greater (Spell)|shout (greater)]], [[Stormbolts (Spell)|stormbolts]]*; 9th—*[[Meteor Swarm (Spell)|meteor swarm]]**,* *[[Repel Metal or Stone (Spell)|repel metal or stone]]**, ride the lightning*.

(**Source:** Ultimate Magic (Paizo), pgs. 87-88)

**Water School**

The water elementalist draws magic from the ocean depths. His power is fluid as well, crushing foes in mighty waves or wearing them down through timeless erosion.

*Water Supremacy (Su):* You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th level, whenever you make a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Cold Blast (Su):* As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the [[Staggered|staggered]] effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Wave (Su):* At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the wave during the wave’s movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20 feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess. Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

(**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide (Paizo), pgs. 142-143)

**Wood School**

Wood represents flexibility, warmth, wind, generosity, cooperation, and idealism. Practitioners of this elemental magic often resemble druids in character and in the use of their magic.

*Wood Magic:* At 1st level, add the following spells to your wizard spell list at the listed spell level: 2nd—*[[Entangle (Spell)|entangle]]*, 3rd—*[[Tree Shape (Spell)|tree shape]]*, 4th—*[[Plant Growth (Spell)|plant growth]]*, 5th—*[[Command Plants (Spell)|command plants]]*, 6th—*[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]*, 7th—*[[Liveoak (Spell)|liveoak]]*, 8th—*[[Transmute Metal to Wood (Spell)|transmute metal to wood]]*, 9th—*[[Control Plants (Spell)|control plants]]*.

*Flexible Enhancement (Su):* A master of the wood element is able to bend like bamboo when stressed and snap back into place. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom ability score. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. You can change this bonus to a new ability score when you prepare spells. At 20th level, this bonus applies to two of these ability scores of your choice.

*Splintered Spear (Su):* As a standard action, you can create a wooden shortspear appropriate to your size, which hurls itself as a ranged attack against one target within 100 feet (range penalties apply), using your Intelligence modifier as an attack bonus instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The spear deals normal damage according to its size, plus your Intelligence modifier, then breaks into countless splinters; the target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round on its turn. At 6th-level and every 6 levels thereafter, the spear gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the bleed damage increases by +1. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Cooperative Defense (Su):* At 8th level, whenever a spell or effect targets you and one or more allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your allies to use your saving throw against the effect in place of their own. Each ally must make this choice individually before the rolls are made. Using this ability is an immediate action. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every four wizard levels beyond 8th.

## Familiars
**Familiars**

A familiar is an animal chosen by a spellcaster to aid him in his study of magic. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but is now a magical beast for the purpose of effects that depend on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar grants special abilities to its master, as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other. Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master’s level.

If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

\*A [[Raven (Bestiary PF1)|raven]] familiar can speak one language of its master’s choice as a supernatural ability.

**Familiar Basics:** Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar’s kind as described in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, but with the following changes.

*Hit Dice:* For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master’s character level or the familiar’s normal HD total, whichever is higher.

*Hit Points:* The familiar has half the master’s total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

*Attacks:* Use the master’s base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar’s Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to calculate the familiar’s melee attack bonus with natural weapons. Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar’s kind.

*Saving Throws:* For each saving throw, use either the familiar’s base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master’s (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

*Skills:* For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master’s skill ranks, whichever is better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar’s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar’s ability to use. Familiars treat [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]], [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]], and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] as class skills.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions:** All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master’s combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities are cumulative.


| **Master** <br>**Class Level** | **Natural**<br>**Armor Adj.** | **Int** | **Special** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1st–2nd | +1 | 6 | Alertness, [[Improved Evasion\|improved evasion]], share spells, empathic link |
| 3rd–4th | +2 | 7 | Deliver touch spells |
| 5th–6th | +3 | 8 | Speak with master |
| 7th–8th | +4 | 9 | Speak with animals of its kind |
| 9th–10th | +5 | 10 | — |
| 11th–12th | +6 | 11 | Spell resistance |
| 13th–14th | +7 | 12 | Scry on familiar |
| 15th–16th | +8 | 13 | — |
| 17th–18th | +9 | 14 | — |
| 19th–20th | +10 | 15 | — |

*Natural Armor Adj.:* The number noted here is in addition to the familiar’s existing natural armor bonus.

*Int:* The familiar’s Intelligence score.

*Alertness (Ex):* While a familiar is within arm’s reach, the master gains the [[Alertness (Feat)|Alertness]] feat.

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.

*Share Spells:* The wizard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on himself. A wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the familiar’s type (magical beast).

*Empathic Link (Su):* The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

*Speak with Master (Ex):* If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

*Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):* If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by the Intelligence of the conversing creatures.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master’s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar’s spell resistance.

*Scry on Familiar (Sp):* If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* spell) once per day.

## Arcane Spells and Armor
**Arcane Spells and Armor**

Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting any spell that has a somatic component. The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields (see page 151 of the Core Rulebook).

If a spell doesn’t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster’s hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks still apply normally). The metamagic feat [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]] allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell without the somatic component at one spell level higher than normal. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.

## Arcane Discoveries
**Arcane Discoveries**

Wizards spend much of their lives seeking deeper truths, hunting knowledge as if it were life itself. The wizard’s power is not necessarily the spells he wields; spells are merely the outward, most visible manifestation of that power. A wizard’s true power is in his fierce intelligence, his dedication to his craft, and his ability to peel back the surface truths of reality to understand the fundamental underpinnings of existence. A wizard spends much of his time researching spells, and would rather find an undiscovered library than a room full of gold. A wizard need not be a reclusive bookworm, but he must have a burning curiosity for the unknown. Arcane discoveries are the results of this obsession with magic. A wizard can learn an arcane discovery in place of a regular feat or wizard bonus feat.

## Wizard Alternative Class Features
**Wizard Alternative Class Features**

**EIDETIC SPELLCASTER**

Unlike other wizards, you can see within your mind the intricate arcane symbols, words, and gestures that define your spell. Your photographic memory acts as your spellbook, inscribing the spells you know within your mind.

**Level:** 1st.

**Replaces:** If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar OR (one or the other) the [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] feat (though you may take it later).

**Benefits:** You do not need a spellbook, either to record spells you know or to prepare known spells. You can learn spells normally, either through research, gaining levels in wizard or learning from other spellbooks, and you ust pay all the normal costs for learnin gnew spells (used instead in special incenses rather than inks), but you do not need to put them into a spellbook.

**Source:** Dragon 357, pg. 89

**IMMEDIATE MAGIC**

Other than having a single additional spell of each spell level, a specialist wizard functions like any other wizard. Your evoker’s [[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]] spell deals as much damage as that of a conjurer, diviner, or necromancer, and doesn’t look any different. By taking the immediate magic alternative class feature, you gain a useful trick that sets you apart from other specialists. Though giving up your familiar is a hardship, it means you have one less thing to worry about in a fight.

**Level:** 1st.

**Replaces:** If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

**Benefit:** You gain a spell-like ability that reflects your chosen school of magic. Activating this ability is an immediate action, and you can use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Its equivalent spell level is equal to one-half your wizard level (minimum 1st), and the caster level is your wizard level. The save DC (if any) is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Int modifier. This is an extraordinary ability.

You can’t activate this ability in response to an attack that you aren’t aware of. For instance, if an invisible rogue strikes at you, you can’t activate urgent shield to gain a bonus to your AC against the attack. All effects last until the start of your next turn unless otherwise noted.

To select this ability, you must also choose to specialize in a school of magic. The spell-like ability gained depends on your specialty (see below).

*Urgent Shield (abjuration):* You create a temporary shield of force that grants you a +2 shield bonus to AC.

*Abrupt Jaunt (conjuration):* You teleport up to 10 feet. You can’t bring along any other creatures.

*Glimpse Peril (divination):* You get a flash of foresight into the danger lying in your future. You gain a +2 insight bonus on the next saving throw you make before your next turn.

*Instant Daze (enchantment):* When an enemy that has HD equal to or less than your wizard level makes a melee attack against you, you can render him [[Dazed|dazed]] (Will negates). This is a compulsion, mind-affecting ability.

*Counterfire (evocation):* When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with a ranged attack or spell, you can respond with a glowing arrow of force. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per three wizard levels. Both attacks resolve simultaneously (neither can disrupt the other).

*Brief Figment (illusion):* You create a fi gment double of yourself (similar to *[[Mirror Image (Spell)|mirror image]]*). The image lasts until it is struck or until the start of your next turn.

*Cursed Glance (necromancy):* When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with an attack or spell, you can respond with a curse. If the enemy fails a Will save, he takes a –2 penalty to AC and on saving throws.

*Sudden Shift (transmutation):* You temporarily change your form to grant yourself a climb, fly, or swim speed equal to your current land speed. If you activate this ability during your turn, it lasts until the end of that turn; otherwise it lasts until the end of your next turn.
