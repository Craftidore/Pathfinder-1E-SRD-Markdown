# Mesmerist
## Overview
Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others—usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can’t comprehend. 

**Role**: Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes’ wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies—and often themselves—with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren’t the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind. 

**Alignment**: Any. 

**Hit Die**: d8. 

**Starting Wealth**: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp). 

**CLASS SKILLS** 

The mesmerist’s class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha). 

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + Int modifier. 

**CLASS FEATURES** 

The following are the class features of the mesmerist. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword caneUE, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields. 

**Spells**: A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the mesmerist spell list (see page 44). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier. 

Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–4: Mesmerist on page 39. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1–3 on page 17 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*). 

The mesmerist’s selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist’s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1–5: Mesmerist Spells Known. Unlike a mesmerist’s spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn’t affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1–5 are fixed. 

At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115522 5115522 5115522 455586 455586 455586 39 

the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. 

A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. 

**Consummate Liar**: A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesn’t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint. 

**Hypnotic Stare (Su)**: A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a –2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to –3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target’s mind; the creature doesn’t remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist’s focus than the target’s perception of his stare. It can’t be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist’s focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists’ stares don’t stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches’ evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect. 

**Knacks**: Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1–5. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal. 

**Mesmerist Tricks (Su)**: A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).

To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick’s description), even if it isn’t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick’s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn’t need line of sight to trigger it—but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells. 

Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can’t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick’s entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist’s level + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier. 

The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick’s description, a mesmerist can’t choose a particular trick more than once. 

*Astounding Avoidance*: The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick don’t stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features. 

*Compel Alacrity*: A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy’s reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can’t move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn’t count against the subject’s movement speed for that round. 

*False Flanker*: A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining f lanking, but can’t actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false f lanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. 

*Fearsome Guise*: A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject’s appearance is altered, as *disguise self*. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance brief ly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect. 

*Gift of Will*: A small portion of the mesmerist’s vast mental power buttresses his ally’s mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist’s Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist’s Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself.

*Levitation Buffer*: A mesmerist’s telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a –4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don’t stack with those from *hostile levitation* (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat* 231). Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that’s successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush. 

*Linked Reaction*: A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another’s reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn’t (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. 

*Mask Misery*: The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect’s duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn’t affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn’t need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick. 

*Meek Facade*: The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it’s part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy’s attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. 

*Mesmeric Mirror*: An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as *mirror image*). For every 5 class levels the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect. 

*Mesmeric Pantomime*: By orchestrating the movement of his ally’s body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist’s bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist’s Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. 

*Misdirection*: An enemy’s perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject’s attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn’t suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect. 

*Psychosomatic Surge*: Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist’s level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged. 

*Ref lection of Weakness*: Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115525 5115525 5115525 455589 455589 455589 42 

feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist’s choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inf licts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist’s choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn’t need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick. 

*Shadow Splinter*: The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker’s actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack’s damage was reduced. This shadow doesn’t require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can’t be triggered if there’s no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect. 

*Spectral Smoke*: A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject’s square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as *fog cloud*, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can’t be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. 

*Vanish Arrow*: With a f lourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker’s Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist’s person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist’s choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability. 

**Painful Stare (Su)**: When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist’s hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist’s class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn’t his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists’ painful stares in a round. 

**Towering Ego (Su)**: At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells (see page 144), he loses this bonus on saving throws. 

**Bold Stare (Su)**: At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist’s hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can’t be changed later. The mesmerist can’t choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist’s bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist’s hypnotic stare. 

*Allure*: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies on initiative checks and Perception checks. 

*Disorientation*: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies on attack rolls. 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115526 5115526 5115526 455590 455590 455590 43 

*Psychic Inception*: The hypnotic stare and its penalty can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects (such as an undead or vermin). The mesmerist can also partially affect such a creature with his mind-affecting spells and abilities if it’s under the effect of his hypnotic stare; it gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw (if any), and if affected, it still has a 50% chance each round of ignoring the effect. Ignoring the effect doesn’t end the effect, but does allow the creature to act normally for that round. 

*Sapped Magic*: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the DCs of spells and spell-like abilities used by the target, and to the target’s spell resistance (if any). 

*Sluggishness*: The target of the hypnotic stare has all of its speeds reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet), and the hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target’s Ref lex saving throws. 

*Susceptibility*: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target’s Sense Motive checks to oppose Bluff checks, and to the DCs of Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against the target. 

*Timidity*: The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to damage rolls. 

**Touch Treatment (Su)**: At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions—especially those that affect their minds—by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself ), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list. 

*Minor Conditions*: Fascinated, shaken. 

*Moderate Conditions*: Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened. 

*Greater Conditions*: Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned. 

A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of *break enchantment*. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment. 

**Manifold Tricks (Su)**: At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist’s tricks). 

**Mental Potency (Ex)**: At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5th-level mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with *sleep*, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with *hypnotism*, and change the categories for *color spray* to “3 HD or fewer,” “4 or 5 HD,” and “6 or more HD.” The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level. 

**Glib Lie (Su)**: At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist’s class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a *glibness* spell); failure means the magic doesn’t detect the mesmerist’s lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the *glibness* spell’s bonus on Bluff checks. 

**Masterful Tricks (Su)**: At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one. 

*Avian Escape*: The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy’s attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as *beast shape III*). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* 133). This is a polymorph effect. 

*Cursed Sanction*: A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject’s forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and

skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect. 

*Faked Death*: The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as *programmed image*), but actually turns invisible (as *invisibility*) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist’s level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer. 

*Free in Body*: When constrained, the subject can easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, *solid fog*, *slow*, and *web*). The subject gains the benefits of *freedom of movement* for 1 minute. 

*Greater Mask Misery*: This trick functions as the mask misery trick, but can be used to ignore greater conditions as well. A mesmerist must have the mask misery mesmerist trick to take greater mask misery. 

*Mental Fallback*: Mental commands placed deep in the subject’s mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by *charm monster* cast by an enemy, that enemy can’t try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by *confusion*, *crushing despair*, or *hold person*), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist’s level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. 

*Spatial Switch*: The mesmerist allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect. 

*Spell Anticipation*: The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like *dominate person* that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don’t match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy’s spell. The mesmerist’s spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject’s square. The enemy’s spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist’s spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it. 

*Vision of Blood*: When an enemy is struck by the subject, it believes its wound is far more severe, and the shock overwhelms it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack’s target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn’t get a saving throw. 

**Rule Minds (Su)**: At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell’s DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn’t a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as *dominate monster*) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can’t be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.
