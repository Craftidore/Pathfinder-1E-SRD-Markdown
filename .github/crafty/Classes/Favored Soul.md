# Favored Soul
## Overview
The favored soul follows the path of the cleric but is able to

channel divine power with surprising ease. She is able to

perform the same tasks as her fellow divine spellcasters but

with virtually no study; to her, it comes naturally. Scholars

wonder if favored souls have traces of outsider blood from

unions, holy or unholy, centuries ago and generations

removed. Others suggest that divine training of the proper

type awakens the ability, or that favored souls are simply

imbued with their gifts by their gods when they begin

the cleric’s path. In any case, favored souls cast their spells

naturally, as much through force of personality as through

study. Though this gives them extraordinary divine abilities

no normal person could ever match, they see their gift

as a call to action, and so in some ways may lag behind their

more studious colleagues.

Adventures: Favored souls are often loners, wandering

the land serving their deities. They are welcomed by their

churches but treated as unusual and are sometimes misunderstood.

They are emissaries of their deities and outside

the church’s command structure—respected mystics not

requiring the support normally crucial to a priest’s success.

This makes them sometimes revered

and sometimes envied by their cleric

cousins. While favored souls are

occasionally disrespected for their

perceived lack of discipline, devout

worshipers know that they are a

powerful message from, and indeed

a living manifestation of, their deities.

Characteristics: Favored souls cast

divine spells by means of an innate connection

rather than through laborious training

and prayer, so their divine connection is natural

rather than learned. These divine spellcasters

know fewer spells and acquire powerful spells

more slowly than clerics, but favored souls can

cast spells more often, and they have no need

to select and prepare them ahead of time.

Alignment: Divine magic is intuitive to a

favored soul, not a matter of careful prayer.

This intuitive nature leads to a freer interpretation

of faith and doctrine, and so favored

souls tend slightly toward chaos over law.

A favored soul is often of the same

alignment as her deity, though some

are one step away. For example, a

favored soul could serve a lawful

good deity and be neutral good

herself. A favored soul may not

be neutral unless her deity is

neutral.

Religion: A favored soul

can be of any religion.

The most common

deity worshiped

by human favored souls in civilized lands is Pelor,

god of the sun. Among nonhuman races, favored

souls most commonly worship the chief deity of

their racial pantheon.

Unlike clerics, favored souls are not able

to devote themselves to a cause or a

source of divine power instead

of a deity.

Background:

Favored souls learn

of their connection with the

divine at a young age. Eventually,

a young favored soul

understands the power that

she has been wielding unintentionally.

Favored souls, as naturally

inclined divine channelers,

are also born loners. Unlike

clerics in a temple, they gain

little by sharing their knowledge

and have no strong incentive

to work together.

Races: The innate talent of

spontaneously channeling divine

power is unpredictable, and it can

show up in any of the common

races.

Divine spellcasters from savage

lands or from among brutal

humanoid tribes (such as

orcs or half-orcs) are more

often favored souls than

clerics.

Other Classes: Favored souls have the most in

common with members of other self-taught classes,

especially sorcerers, but also druids and rogues. They

sometimes fi nd themselves at odds with members of the

more disciplined classes, specifi cally clerics, whom they

sometimes view as too wrapped up in doctrine and rigidly

defi ned attitudes.

Role: The favored soul serves as a group’s backup healer

and defensive magic specialist. She can hold her own in a

fi ght, especially if she chooses to focus on powers that aid

her in combat.

Game Rule Information

Favored souls have the following game statistics.

Abilities: Charisma determines how many spells the

favored soul can cast per day. Wisdom determines how

hard the favored soul’s spells are to resist (see Spells, below).

In addition to using Charisma and Wisdom for spellcasting,

a favored soul also benefi ts from high Dexterity, Strength,

and Constitution scores.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d8.

The favored soul’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),

Heal (Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession

(Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter

4 of the *Player’s Handbook* for skill descriptions.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the favored soul.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Favored souls are

profi cient with all simple weapons, with light and medium

armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A favored

soul is also profi cient with her deity’s favored weapon.

Although a favored soul is not profi cient with heavy armor,

wearing it does not interfere with her spellcasting.

Spells: A favored soul casts divine spells (the same type

of spells available to clerics), which are drawn from the

cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without

preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must.

To cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score

of 10 + the spell’s level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11

for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi culty Class for a

saving throw against a favored soul’s spell is 10 + the spell’s

level + the favored soul’s Wisdom modifi er.

Like other spellcasters, a favored soul can cast only a certain

number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base

daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–1: The Favored

Soul. In addition, she receives bonus spells for a high

Charisma.

Unlike a cleric, a favored soul’s selection of spells is

limited. A favored soul begins play knowing four 0-level

spells and three 1st-level spells of your choice. At each

new favored soul level, she gains one or more new spells,

as indicated on Table 1–2: Favored Soul Spells Known.

(Unlike spells per day, her Charisma score does not affect

the number of spells a favored soul knows; the numbers on

Table 1–2 are fixed.)

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered

favored soul level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a favored

soul can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she

already knows. In effect, the favored soul “loses” the old

spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level

must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and

it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level

favored soul spell the favored soul can cast. A favored soul

may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must

choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time

that she gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a cleric, a favored soul need not prepare her

spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any

time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day

for that spell level.

Deity’s Weapon Focus: At 3rd level, a favored soul

gains the Weapon Focus feat with her deity’s favored

weapon. If the character already has that feat, she can

choose a different one.

Energy Resistance (Ex): At 5th level, a favored soul

chooses an energy type and gains resistance 10 against that

type. At 10th level and 15th level, the character gains resistance

10 against another energy type of her choosing.

Deity’s Weapon Specialization: At 12th level, a favored

soul gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity’s

favored weapon. If she already has that feat, she can choose

a different one.

Wings (Ex): At 17th level, a favored soul gains wings

and can fl y at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).

A good-aligned favored soul grows feathered wings, and

an evil-aligned favored soul gains batlike wings. A favored

soul who is neither good nor evil may choose either type of

wings.

Damage Reduction (Su): A 20th-level favored soul

gains damage reduction. If the character is lawful-aligned,

the damage reduction is 10/silver. If the character is chaotic-

aligned, the damage reduction is 10/cold iron. A favored

soul who is neither lawful nor chaotic may choose either

type of damage reduction.
