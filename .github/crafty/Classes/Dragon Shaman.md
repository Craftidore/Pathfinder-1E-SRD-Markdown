# Dragon Shaman
## Overview
*“I possess a dragon’s power. Beware lest you awaken that*

*dragon’s wrath.”*

—Kalia, last and greatest dragon shaman

of the Blackspear tribe

Empires crumble, eons pass, and even gods wither and

die, but dragons remain. Mortal but eternal, the races of

true dragons weather the roll of the ages because of their

unsurpassed might. Few creatures can match a dragon in

its full fury, whether in a combat of arms or battle of wits.

Dragon shamans recognize this fact and see true dragons as

more than powerful beings. To a dragon shaman, the passing

shadow of a dragon fl ying overhead isn’t a sign that invokes

fear; it’s a blessing that reveals you to be in the presence

of greatness.

Dragon shamans respect true dragons as power incarnate.

Some worship dragons, but most simply aspire to gain dragon

powers for themselves. In assuming the abilities and the

likeness of a dragon, a dragon shaman seeks to emulate that

might and embody that power within himself.

If you gaze at dragons with awe and aspire to share their

power and majesty, then the dragon shaman is the class

for you. By choosing a totem dragon, you partake of a true

dragon’s power and take on aspects of a particular kind

of dragon.

MAKING A DRAGON SHAMAN

As a dragon shaman, you primarily act as a melee combatant,

but your class features also allow you to grant benefi ts to those

fi ghting around you. In a standard group of adventurers, you

can stand in for the fi ghter or the cleric. Your combat prowess

isn’t quite as great as a fi ghter’s, but you can employ special

attacks and special defenses a fi ghter can’t access. Although

you lack many of the cleric’s specialized spells, you do possess

the ability to heal and remove negative conditions. As a dragon

shaman, you can grow tough scales, breathe fi re or another

type of energy, and soar on dragon wings—and that barely

scratches the surface of the powers at your command.

Abilities: As with any melee-oriented class, Strength is a

key ability for dragon shamans. Constitution provides you

with increased hit points as usual, and it also increases the

save DC of your breath weapon. If you want to make good use

of the dragon shaman’s ability to heal and remove negative

conditions, you’ll need a high Charisma.

Races: Although humans make up the majority of dragon

shamans, any community of people with a close connection

to true dragons can produce dragon shamans. Typically,

dragon shamans come from savage societies that live near

the lairs of dragons, but even highly civilized populations

can produce dragon shamans. In any race or society, dragon

shamans tend to dedicate themselves to the dragons native to

the area. Thus, elf dragon shamans from a forest nation often

aspire to the qualities of a green dragon, whereas the dwarf

dragon shamans of a high mountain citadel would seek to

gain the qualities of a silver dragon.

Alignment: Attaining the abilities of a true dragon requires

a deep understanding of the chosen kind of dragon. An aspiring

dragon shaman must make a study of the dragon’s typical

mindset and emotions; adopting these for himself opens the

door to the dragon’s power. Thus, dragon shamans align their

morals to suit the outlook of the color of true dragon to which

they dedicate themselves. Each kind of metallic or chromatic

dragon has a particular alignment with which it is associated.

A dragon shaman who turns away from the alignment of his

chosen dragon type loses many of his powers unless he can

successfully adopt another dragon type as his chosen dragon

(see Ex-Dragon Shamans, below). Neutral individuals with no

preference for law, chaos, good, or evil cannot properly attain

the outlook of a true dragon and therefore cannot become

dragon shamans.

Starting Gold: 4d4×10 gp (100 gp).

Starting Age: As druid (*PH* 109).

CLASS FEATURES

As a dragon shaman, you function most effectively on the front

lines of any combat. Your class abilities allow you to boost your

combat effectiveness and that of your party, and the touch of

vitality ability provides you with the power to heal others and

remove negative conditions that affect them, giving you more

reason to take the fi ght to your foes and stay close to those

melee-oriented allies most likely to need your aid.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Dragon shamans are

proficient with simple weapons, with light and medium

armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Bonus Languages: A dragon shaman’s bonus language

options include Draconic.

CHAPTER 1

NEW CLASSES

Draconic Aura (Su): You can channel the mighty powers

of dragonkind to project an aura that grants you and nearby

allies a special benefi t.

Projecting an aura is a swift action (see page 4), and you can

only project one draconic aura at a time. An aura remains in

effect until you use a free action to dismiss it or you activate

another aura in its place. You can have a draconic aura active

continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of an

encounter even before you take your fi rst turn.

Unless otherwise noted, your draconic aura affects all

allies within 30 feet (including yourself) with line of effect

to you. Your aura is dismissed if you become unconscious or

are slain, but otherwise it remains in effect even if you are

incapable of acting.

The bonus granted by your aura begins at +1 and increases

to +2 at 5th level, +3 at 10th level, +4 at 15th level, and +5 at

20th level. As a 1st-level dragon shaman, you know how to

project three auras chosen from the list below. At every oddnumbered

level after that, you learn one additional draconic

aura of your choice, until all seven auras are known at 9th

level. Each time you activate a draconic aura, you can choose

from any of the auras that you know.

*Energy Shield:* Any creature striking you or your ally with

a natural attack or a nonreach melee weapon is dealt 2 points

of energy damage for each point of your aura bonus. The

energy type is that of your totem dragon’s damage-dealing

breath weapon (see below).

*Power:* Bonus on melee damage rolls equal to your aura bonus.

*Presence:* Bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks

equal to your aura bonus.

*Resistance:* Resistance to your totem dragon’s energy type

equal to 5 × your aura bonus.

*Senses:* Bonus on Listen and Spot checks, as well as on

initiative checks, equal to your aura bonus.

*Toughness:* DR 1/magic for each point of your aura bonus

(up to 5/magic at 20th level).

*Vigor:* Fast healing 1 for each point of your aura bonus, but

only affects characters at or below one-half their full normal

hit points.

Totem Dragon: You must choose a totem dragon from

among the true dragons appearing in the *Monster Manual* (black,

blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, or white).

You must choose a dragon whose alignment is within one

step of yours, as described in the following table. You gain

additional class skills and a particular sort of breath weapon

based on the dragon you select as your totem.

Skill Focus: At 2nd level, you gain Skill Focus as a bonus

feat. You must apply the feat to one of the three class skills

granted by your chosen totem dragon. For example, a blue

dragon shaman can select Skill Focus (Bluff), Skill Focus

(Hide), or Skill Focus (Spellcraft).

At 8th level, and again at 16th level, you gain Skill Focus

in another of the class skills granted by your chosen totem

dragon. If you already have Skill Focus in all three of the skills

associated with your totem dragon, you gain Skill Focus in

any other dragon shaman class skill.

Draconic Adaptation (Ex or Sp): At 3rd level, you take

on an aspect of your totem dragon. Some adaptations are

extraordinary abilities that are always active; others are spelllike

abilities that you can activate at will. Spell-like abilities

have a caster level equal to your class level and a save DC

equal to 10 + spell level + Cha modifi er.

*Black—*Water Breathing (Ex): You can breathe underwater

indefinitely and can freely use spells and other abilities

underwater (always active).

*Blue*—*Ventriloquism* (Sp): As the spell (at will).

*Brass*—*Endure Elements* (Sp): As the spell, except you can

only target yourself (at will).

*Bronze—*Water Breathing (Ex): You can breathe underwater

indefinitely and can freely use spells and other abilities

underwater (always active).

*Copper*—*Spider Climb* (Sp): As the spell, except you can

only target yourself (at will).

*Gold—*Water Breathing (Ex): You can breathe underwater

indefinitely and can freely use spells and other abilities

underwater (always active).

*Green—*Water Breathing (Ex): You can breathe underwater

indefinitely and can freely use spells and other abilities

underwater (always active).

*Red*—Treasure Seeker (Ex): You gain a +5 competence bonus

on Appraise and Search checks (always active).

*Silver*—*Feather Fall* (Sp): As the spell, except you can only

target yourself (at will).

*White*—Icewalker (Ex): You can walk across icy surfaces

without reducing your speed or making Balance checks

(always active).

At 13th level, you can choose as a swift action (see page 4)

to share the effect of your draconic adaptation with any or

all allies within 30 feet. In the case of spell-like abilities, you

must make this decision when you activate the ability. The

benefi t lasts until you spend a free action to rescind it or (if

the effect has a limited duration) the effect ends, whichever

comes fi rst.

Breath Weapon (Su): At 4th level, you gain a breath

weapon corresponding to your totem dragon. Regardless of

the area one affects or the type of energy damage it deals, all

CHAPTER 1

NEW CLASSES

breath weapons deal 2d6 points of damage, plus an extra 1d6

points of damage for every two additional class levels (3d6 at

6th level, 4d6 at 8th level, and so forth). A successful Refl ex

save halves the damage dealt; the save DC is equal to 10 +

1/2 your dragon shaman level + your Con modifi er. Just like

a true dragon, once you breathe you must wait 1d4 rounds

before you can use your breath weapon again.

Cone-shaped breath weapons extend out to 15 feet at 4th

level, increasing to 30 feet at 12th level and to 60 feet at

20th level. Line-shaped breath weapons are 30 feet long at

4th level, increasing to 60 feet at 12th level and to 120 feet

at 20th level.

Draconic Resolve (Ex): At 4th level, you gain immunity

to paralysis and sleep effects. You also become immune to

the frightful presence of dragons.

Touch of Vitality (Su): At 6th level, you can heal the

wounds of living creatures (your own or those of others) by

touch. Each day you can heal a number of points of damage

equal to twice your class level × your Charisma bonus. For

example, a 7th-level dragon shaman with a Charisma score of

14 (+2 bonus) can heal 28 points of damage. You can choose

to divide your healing among multiple recipients, and you

don’t have to use it all at once. Using your touch of vitality

is a standard action. It has no effect on undead.

Beginning at 11th level, you can choose to spend some

of the healing bestowed by your touch of vitality to remove

other harmful conditions affecting the target.

For every 5 points of your healing ability you expend,

you can cure 1 point of ability damage or remove the dazed,

fatigued, or sickened condition from one individual.

For every 10 points of your healing ability you expend, you

can remove the exhausted, nauseated, poisoned, or stunned

condition from one individual.

For every 20 points of your healing ability you expend,

you can remove a negative level or the blinded, deafened, or

diseased condition from one individual.

You can remove a condition (or more than one condition)

and heal damage with the same touch, so long as you

expend the required number of points. For example, if you

wanted to heal 12 points of damage and remove the blinded

and exhausted conditions from a target, you would have to

expend 42 points (12 hit points restored plus 20 points for

blinded plus 10 points for exhausted).

Natural Armor (Ex): At 7th level, your skin thickens,

developing faint scales. Your natural armor bonus improves

by 1. At 12th level, this improvement increases to +2, and at

17th level to +3.

Energy Immunity (Ex): At 9th level, you gain immunity

to the energy type of the breath weapon you gained

at 4th level.

Commune with Dragon Spirit (Sp): At 14th level, you

gain the ability to contact your dragon totem directly to ask

questions of it. This is the equivalent of casting a *commune*

spell, except that it has no material component, focus, or XP

cost and allows only one question per three class levels. After

using this ability, you cannot use it again for seven days.

Draconic Wings (Ex): At 19th level, you grow a pair of

wings that resemble those of your totem dragon. They allow

fl ight at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You can

even fl y while carrying a medium load, though your fl y speed

drops to 40 feet in this case.

If you already have wings, you can choose whether these

draconic wings replace your own.

PLAYING A DRAGON SHAMAN

As a dragon shaman, you believe the acquisition of power is

a worthy end in itself. By having power, you can effect your

will in the world, be it benefi cent or malign. Those who have

or seek power deserve your respect, while those who have

power but fail to use it earn your derision.

Your strength comes from devoting yourself to dragons,

the primal embodiment of the principle of power, but you

worship dragons in the abstract, honoring them much as a

cleric might honor light as a symbol of purity and goodness.

Dragons gather power to themselves simply by living and

aging, but you must actively seek the infl uence and might

you desire. As a dragon hungers for fl esh to feed itself or for

treasure to enlarge its hoard, so you hunger for power.

You adventure out of a desire to test yourself and prove

your worth; whatever the specifi c inducement, the urge to

gain more power underlies every quest. Drawn by your power,

others follow your lead, and you are happy to command them.

Being a great leader is just one of the many ways you can

manifest your power.

Religion

Dragon shamans can worship any deity, but most worship

divine powers that encourage their worshipers to be proactive

in pursuit of the deity’s goals. Dragon shamans often

worship Erythnul, Gruumsh, Heironeous, Hextor, Kord, or

St. Cuthbert, as well as dragon deities such as Bahamut and

Tiamat. They rarely fi nd much to admire in more passive

or protective deities such as Boccob, Ehlonna, Fharlanghn,

and Yondalla.

Dragon shamans from more primitive societies sometimes

worship true dragons. These savage dragon shamans might

worship all true dragons, assigning each color or metallic

hue its own place in a crude pantheon of totemic spirits. Or

they might worship a single color or metal as the best among

all the true dragons, fi nding it the most representative of

pure power. In rare cases, a dragon shaman worships and

serves a particular true dragon. How the dragon reacts to

such worship depends on that individual dragon; even good

dragons might take advantage of a dragon shaman’s worship

to achieve their own aims.

Other Classes

You work well with melee-oriented allies such as fi ghters,

duskblades, barbarians, rogues, and even druids. Those

characters value the benefi ts a dragon shaman can grant them

and rarely make an issue of their source. Clerics, paladins,

knights, and monks are often suspicious of your moral outlook

unless you have dedicated yourself to a kind of dragon

that associates itself with a code of ethics similar to their own.

Wizards, bards, and beguilers view you indifferently, whereas

sorcerers might seek you out to learn more of the source of

CHAPTER 1

NEW CLASSES

your power and your connection to dragons. Rangers might

or might not take issue with your abilities; a ranger whose

favored enemy is dragons might attack you on sight.

Combat

Dragon shamans lead from the front, rather than directing

battles from a safe position behind others. Keep as many

allies as possible within the range of your draconic aura, but

focus on those in melee with your foes. Pick a draconic aura

that grants your allies the best benefi t for the situation, and

don’t hesitate to switch it during the fi ght should conditions

change and another aura prove more useful. Outside combat,

employ the senses or presence aspects of your draconic aura.

If you have a cleric or other healer in your group, save your

touch of vitality for removing conditions or for emergency

healing. If no other healer is present, use it to heal yourself

and your allies after combat.

Advancement

You profi t most from remaining a dragon shaman

throughout your advancement, so that your

breath weapon and draconic aura continue

to improve as you gain levels. If you do

multiclass, a level of barbarian is an excellent

choice; the benefi ts it grants

help you in combat regardless of

when you take that 1st level. Alternatively,

you might consider

beginning your career as a 1stlevel

barbarian for the greater

hit points and skill points that

option offers, then multiclassing

into the dragon shaman

class at 2nd level. The fi ghter

class might seem like a strong

second choice, but unless you

need a fi ghter bonus feat for a

particular kind of character,

you’ll see better long-term advantages

from the barbarian

class. The bard class can be an

interesting multiclass option,

since the benefits provided

by bardic music stack with

those provided by your draconic

aura.

DRAGON SHAMANS IN THE WORLD

*“There are differences from one to another, based on the dragon each*

*shaman honors, but the main thing to remember is this: The whole*

*lot of them are mad for power.”*

—Durven Ironscale, a dwarf sorcerer

instructing the young of the Ironscale clan

Dragon shamans put the power and appeal of dragons in

players’ hands while providing DMs with a new way to put

dragons in the D&D game. The class provides an uncomplicated

way to have a new play experience, and each NPC

dragon shaman could provide the nucleus for an interesting

cult or villainous organization the PCs must face.

Daily Life

A dragon shaman remains ever ready to face the challenges

of a new day. Without the need to rest, study, or pray for

their powers, dragon shamans can leap up in pursuit of

power whenever they desire. This capability causes most

dragon shamans to be decisive and swift to act. Chaotic

dragon shamans are often impetuous and energetic, while

lawful dragon shamans tend to be more ready to improvise

and less rigid in their thinking than some might expect.

Dragon shamans desire power and constantly seek the

means to gain it. To dragon shamans, life and adventure

are one and the same.

Dragon shamans often possess the charisma and takecharge

attitude required of great leaders, but many suffer

from an inability to empathize with those they lead. Dragon

shamans respect the pursuit of might and its use, and they

often minimize the value of those who adhere to other

philosophies. Even among themselves, dragon shamans tend

to be contentious, and a single dragon shaman rarely takes

a leadership role over a group of his fellows for any length

of time. Although dragon shamans give great respect to one

another, each is always trying to outdo the others in all pursuits.

The most powerful dragon shaman leaders arise among

savage tribes that worship dragons, where a single dragon

shaman relies on his forceful personality and impressive

powers to win the hearts of comrades.

Notables

The pursuit of power garners notoriety for a dragon shaman,

but it also can bring about his death or force him into exile.

A powerful dragon shaman warlord might suddenly arise

and terrorize an area for a time, only to fall from power as

swiftly as he appeared. A case in point would be the history

of a barbaric human named Kalia. Under her leadership, her

tribe of red dragon worshipers raided and razed hundreds

of elf and human towns on the border between two nations.

Then she vanished, and soon afterward her leaderless tribe

was caught in an ambush and exterminated. Some say she

died in a squabble with a fellow dragon shaman, but other

believe she left her tribe to directly serve a red dragon wyrm

that laired in distant mountains.

Organizations

Dragon shamans rarely work together for long unless they

are led by a dragon of the type to which all the shamans

present have dedicated themselves. In such cases, the dragon

is either worshiped or leads because the dragon shamans

see it as the embodiment of all they seek; thus, obeying the

dragon’s edicts presents the swiftest path to that desired

goal. Rank and privilege rarely have much meaning in such

groups. Instead, the dragon decides each shaman’s duties

according to his or her merit, changing such assignments as

necessary. Such a group exists among the Ironscale clan. Tied

to a long-dead silver dragon by blood, the dwarf clan fosters

sorcerers and is led by a half-dragon. Despite these fi rm ties to

dragonkind, the clan views its dragon shaman members with

some suspicion, since they follow the orders of an unrelated

silver dragon that lairs near the clan home.

NPC Reactions

Dragon shamans who don’t show aspects of their affi liation

with dragons rarely elicit an unusual reaction from others.

To most they seem like simple warriors or perhaps barbarians.

Those who know of their pursuit of draconic power or

who see evidence of it, such as scales or a dragon shaman’s

breath weapon, react depending on their attitude toward the

dragon shaman’s totem dragon. This reaction is one step closer

to hostile if the dragon is of a kind feared or hated by that

individual. The reaction is one step closer to friendly if that

individual is directly associated with a dragon of that kind.

Clerics, paladins, and others who are deeply entrenched in a

particular moral outlook view the dragon shaman’s devotion

with suspicion, and their reaction is one step closer to hostile

regardless of the dragon shaman’s totem dragon.

DRAGON SHAMAN LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

dragon shamans to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including

the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Dragon shamans devote themselves to dragons and

aspire to their power.

DC 15: A dragon shaman devotes himself to a particular

kind of true dragon and gains powers based on the dragon

chosen. He can use the dragon’s breath weapon and grow

dragonlike scales. Very powerful dragon shamans can grow

dragon wings and fl y.

DC 20: In addition to the details above, this result allows

the PC to know that a dragon shaman projects an aura that

can bolster himself and his allies in a number of ways and

can heal damage or remove negative conditions somewhat

like a paladin.

DRAGON SHAMANS IN THE GAME

Dragon shamans fi t easily into any ongoing campaign because

true dragons are a cornerstone of nearly every DUNGEON &

DRAGONS game. The PCs might first learn of dragon shamans

by encountering a cult of dragon worshipers near a dragon’s

lair. Alternatively, a more civilized group of dragon shamans

might serve a dragon who rules a city. A lone dragon shaman

NEW CLASSES

makes an excellent new villain, a powerful temporary ally, or

an eager participant in an ongoing plot because his focused

pursuit of power can get him involved in anyone’s scheme

to gain it.

Dragon shaman PCs should present no more diffi culty

than introducing a monk or cleric of a lesser-known deity.

Although the character’s abilities might be somewhat foreign,

the idea that an individual is so dedicated to one philosophy

that it grants him powers should be easily understood. The

player of a dragon shaman usually finds the character’s

association with dragons to be the most entertaining part of

the class. Before featuring adventures that deal with dragons,

ask that player about her character’s philosophy concerning

dragons. Does the character admire dragons in the abstract,

worship them as living gods, or hold to a philosophy between

these extremes? The answer should inform your adventure

planning and inspire new adventure ideas. Be careful

about using the PC’s dedication to dragons to manipulate

the character’s actions: Occasional use of this idea might

provoke some interesting roleplaying, but the player won’t

enjoy your game if a dragon shows up every session to boss

her PC around.

Adaptation

You can alter the dragon shaman to suit your game in a number

of ways. You could decide that all dragon shamans are barbaric,

or that all them are civilized and sophisticated disciples of

dragons who prefer to work behind the scenes through such

agents. You might decide that only good dragons are available

to your players for their totem dragons, or that a particular

organization fosters dragon shamans devoted to a single kind

of dragon. If you feature other dragons prominently in your

game, such as the gem dragons from *Monster Manual II* or the

deep dragon and the shadow dragon from *Monsters of Faerûn*,

you might consider changing the class’s features to allow a

dragon shaman to follow other kinds of dragons as well.

Sample Encounter

Dragon shamans make excellent villains and tricky allies. As

a villain, a dragon shaman dedicated to an evil dragon can

be paired with a cult of followers, half-dragons, and dragons

of all ages to make for exciting themed encounters. As an

ally, a dragon shaman’s blind pursuit of power could create

interesting friction with the PCs and turn an ally into an

enemy. A dragon shaman might become embroiled in the

PCs’ pursuits if they come into possession of an item of great

power, if both the PCs and dragon shaman seek the same

source of power, or if the dragon shaman’s attempts to gather

power endanger the PCs or those they care about.

The power of the dragon and the futility of the defenders’

efforts against it frightened him, but he also found the spectacle

strangely thrilling. When he was older, Thane learned all

he could about blue dragons. With each new bit of knowledge,

his respect for them grew. In his search for information he

met a dragon shaman, and that encounter changed his life.

Now a dragon shaman himself, Thane seeks ever greater

power and hopes one day to have enough to challenge the

dragon that laid waste to his childhood home and prove

himself the stronger of the two. Thane seems single-minded

and focused. He always has a mental list of goals he wants

to achieve in any situation and doggedly pursues them.

Although outwardly calm and cold, he explodes into action

in an instant when thwarted.

EX-DRAGON SHAMANS

Dragon shamans who change alignment could lose their powers.

If a dragon shaman changes to an alignment still appropriate

to the dragon to which he is already dedicated, nothing happens.

However, if the dragon shaman changes to an alignment

inappropriate for his chosen dragon, he immediately loses all

abilities granted by the dragon shaman class and becomes an

ex-dragon shaman.

An ex-dragon shaman can choose a new color or metallic hue

of true dragon to emulate and thus regain the powers granted

by the class. To switch to a new totem dragon, he must find a

dragon shaman of higher level who is dedicated to that dragon

type. The higher-level dragon shaman must willingly expend

all her touch of vitality on the ex-dragon shaman each day for

a week. At the end of the week, the ex-dragon shaman gains

the class features of a dragon shaman dedicated to the newly

chosen totem dragon, including exchanging the focus of any

class-granted Skill Focus feats. Most dragon shamans who are

asked to perform this service demand payment in the form

of some great deed. This deed might be a demand that the

ex-dragon shaman retrieve magic items that will add to his

sponsor’s power or simply a short quest to prove the ex-dragon

shaman’s worth.

Dragon shamans can go through the same process to switch

chosen totem dragons even if they don’t change alignment. If

a dragon shaman has an alignment appropriate for a different

true dragon color or hue, the shaman can switch to that kind of

dragon through a process identical to the one described above

for ex-dragon shamans.
