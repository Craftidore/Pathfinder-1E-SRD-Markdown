# Shugenja
## Overview
A class inspired by the mythologies of Asian cultures, the

shugenja is a divine spellcaster who casts spells by attuning

himself to the primal energies around him and focusing

such energy through his body to produce magical effects.

Like the samurai (described in *Complete Warrior),* shugenjas

are often members of the noble class, though they are not

as bound by honor and the code of *bushido* as their martial

counterparts.

Adventures: Shugenjas often adventure to increase

their magical knowledge and personal power. They are

particularly drawn to investigate disturbances in the natural

harmony of the four classical elements (earth, air, fi re,

and water). Some shugenjas dedicate their lives to keeping

the world’s magic in balance, while others simply crave the

power that the unchecked elements offer. Still others are

drawn to plumb the depths of magic for magic’s own sake,

hoping eventually to learn the mysteries of void, the “fi fth

element” that binds the others together.

Characteristics: Shugenjas are much more than

spell slinging sorcerers. In a fantasy culture inspired by

real-world Japan, they can be the foundation of religious

life—priests who teach the rituals of piety, venerate the

memory of long-departed ancestors, and even measure the

passage of time. They study for years to learn even the fundamental

elements of their magical practice, and are the most

literate class in many quasi-Asian societies. A shugenja’s

spells are written on *ofudas* (nonmagical prayer scrolls) that

the shugenja carries with him, serving as a divine focus for

casting the spell.

Alignment: While many shugenjas attempt to follow the

standards of honor and loyalty, and thus adhere to a lawful

alignment, not all shugenjas live up to those standards. Shugenjas

have no alignment restrictions.

Religion: If you use shugenjas in your game, you should

probably also develop an Asian culture with its own religious

traditions to represent their home—even if the specifi

c shugenjas in your campaign are thousands of miles

away from it, hailing from a far-off land you don’t plan to

visit. Some shugenjas exiled in a traditional D&D setting

express an affi nity for Boccob, Obad-Hai, or Wee Jas, while

others see a parallel between the code of *bushido* and the

teachings of Heironeous.

Background: Shugenjas are often members of the noble

class. They learn the practice of magic in religious orders

attached to each clan or region, like their samurai kin. You

can easily invent your own shugenja orders, employing

the same principles you’d use when inventing your own

domain.

Races: Traditionally, Asian-themed D&D games have

dispensed with or replaced the nonhuman races, so shugenjas

have been overwhelmingly human. You can invent your

own Asian races, use those described in *Oriental Adventures*,

or mix Asian culture with the elves, dwarves and other

races of traditional fantasy. With such a mix, dwarves and

gnomes would be slightly more likely to become shugenjas

because they have an affi nity for earth.

Other Classes: Like samurai, shugenjas are set apart by

their noble station and tend to look down upon members of other classes. Despite the

prevailing view of society, shugenjas

do not believe that martial

prowess is the ultimate

expression of honor—in fact,

they look down on the samurai

who settle any disagreement

or matter of honor with a duel

to the death. Shugenjas have

little respect for members of

other classes; however, shugenjas,

especially adventurers,

wisely understand that different

classes have specialized skills and

abilities often needed for success.

Role: Because they’re the preeminent

spellcasters in their culture, shugenjas’

spell lists run the gamut from top-notch

combat spells to powerful healing and versatile

utility spells. But they’re less durable

in a fi ght than their cleric brethren, and

like sorcerers, they have a limited set of

spells to choose from.

Oriental Classes in Nonoriental

Settings: Some DMs may choose to

allow classes such as the shugenja and

the samurai in their nonoriental settings.

If they do, the character is most likely to

be a traveler from a faraway land, most

likely trained in his homeland in his

oriental class. Specifi c details of the

character’s background can be worked

out with the DM and the player.

Game Rule Information

Shugenjas have the following game statistics.

Abilities: Charisma

determines how powerful

a spell a shugenja can

cast, how many spells the

shugenja can cast per day,

and how hard those

spells are to resist. To

cast a spell, a shugenja

must have a Charisma score of

10 + the spell’s level + the shugenja’s

Charisma modifi er. High Dexterity is

helpful for a shugenja (who typically

wears little or no armor) because it provides

him with an Armor Class bonus.

A good Constitution gives a shugenja extra hit

points, a resource that he is otherwise low on.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Skills

The shugenja’s class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft

(Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge

(all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession

(Wis), Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the

*Player’s Handbook* for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifi

er) × 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the shugenja.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Shugenjas are profi

cient with all simple weapons and with the short sword

(they often carry a masterwork short sword called a *wakizashi*).

They are not profi cient with any type of armor, nor with

shields. In their home culture, it is considered inappropriate

for a shugenja to wear armor, although shugenjas serving

with the military or traveling in foreign lands sometimes

take the time to learn how to wear armor properly. Armor

check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the

skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move

Silently, Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble. Armor does

not interfere with his spellcasting.

Spells: A shugenja casts divine spells (the same type of

spells available to clerics and druids), which are drawn from

the shugenja spell list (page XX). He can cast any spell he

knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard

or a cleric must (see below).

To learn or cast a spell, a shugenja must have a Charisma

score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level

spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi -

culty Class for a saving throw against a shugenja’s spell is 10

+ the spell level + the shugenja’s Charisma modifi er.

Like other spellcasters, a shugenja can cast only a certain

number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily

spell allotment is given on Table 1–3: The Shugenja. In

addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high

Charisma score (see page 8 in the *Player’s Handbook*).

A shugenja’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A

shugenja begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two

1st-level spells of his choice, plus one 0-level spell and one

1st-level spell determined by his shugenja order. At each

new shugenja level, he gains one or more new spells as

indicated on Table 1–4: Shugenja Spells Known. (Unlike

spells per day, the number of spells a shugenja knows is

not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table

1–4 are fi xed.) One spell of every level is determined by

the shugenja’s order; sometimes these spells are normal

spells on the shugenja spell list, but often they are additions

to the spell list. These spells are listed with the

shugenja spell list below. Half of the spells a shugenja

knows must be of his chosen element, as indicated on

Table 1–4.

A shugenja may use a higher-level slot to cast a lower-level

spell if he so chooses. For example, if an 8th-level shugenja

has used up all his 3rd-level spell slots for the day but wants

to cast another one, he could use a 4th-level slot to do so. The

spell is still treated as its actual level, not the level of the slot

used to cast it.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered

shugenja level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a shugenja can

choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows.

In effect, the shugenja “loses” the old spell in exchange for

the new one. The new spell’s level must be at least two levels

lower than the highest-level shugenja spell the shugenja

can cast. For instance, upon reaching 4th level, a shugenja

could trade in a single 0-level spell (two spell levels below

the highest-level shugenja spell he can cast, which is 2nd)

for a different 0-level spell. At 6th level, he could trade in a

single 0-level or 1st-level spell (since he now can cast 3rdlevel

shugenja spells) for a different spell of the same level.

A shugenja may swap only a single spell at any given level,

and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. A

shugenja still must honor his elemental focus.

Shugenjas do not have spellbooks, though they write

their spells on *ofudas*. These *ofudas* serve as divine focus

items and must be read as part of the spellcasting process.

Shugenjas can use the Scribe Scroll feat to create magic

scrolls that work the same as a wizard or cleric’s scrolls.

When casting metamagic spells, remember that the shugenja

has not prepared the spell in advance, and is doing so

on the spot. The shugenja, therefore, must take more time

to cast a metamagic spell than a regular spell. If its normal

casting time is 1 standard action, casting a metamagic spell

is a full-round action for a shugenja. For spells with a longer

casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the

spell. Shugenjas cannot use the Quicken Spell metamagic

feat.

\* At each level, a shugenja gets an order spell for each spell level, starting at 1st. The “o” on this list represents that. The

number in the middle is the number of spells of the shugenja’s favored element, and the final number is the additional

number of spells known of any element.

Element Focus: All shugenjas have a favored element:

air, earth, fi re, or water. A shugenja’s choice of specialized

element is sometimes determined by the shugenja order in

which he studies. At least half the spells a shugenja knows

at each spell level must belong to his favored element, and

the spell dictated by his order often belongs to that element

as well. This is refl ected on Table 1–4, which indicates how

many spells of each level must be spells of the shugenja’s

favored element. At 1st level, for example, the shugenja Kitsu

Mari must know at least three 0-level water spells—one

water spell determined by his order and two additional

water spells, plus two other 0-level spells of any element.

He also knows one 1st-level water spell from his order, one

additional 1st-level water spell, and one 1st-level spell of

any element. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefi ts of

the Spell Focus feat (+1 to spell DCs) for spells from their

favored element, regardless of its school.

As the cost of specializing in one element, a shugenja is

prohibited from learning spells associated with a different

element. The prohibited element is dictated by the favored

element, as described below.

*Air:* Air spells are subtle, involving travel, intuition, infl uence,

divination, and illusion. Earth is the prohibited element

for air shugenjas. The Order of the All-Seeing Eye and

the Order of the Spring Zephyr specialize in air magic.

*Earth:* Earth spells involve resilience and resolve, health

and growth, and the strength of its body. Air is the prohibited

element for earth shugenjas. The Order of the Impenetrable

Crucible and the Order of the Perfect Sculpture

specialize in earth magic.

*Fire:* Fire spells are destructive and blatant, though they

also deal with intelligence, inspiration, and creativity. Water

is the prohibited element for fi re shugenjas. The Order of the

Consuming Flame specializes in fi re magic.

*Water:* Water spells involve transformation, cleansing,

healing, and friendship. Fire is the prohibited element

for water shugenjas. The Order of the Forbidding Wasteland

and the Order of the Gentle Rain specialize in water

magic.

The shugenjas of the Order of the Ineffable Mystery can

specialize in any of the four elements. The Ineffable Mystery

also trains shugenjas who specialize the fi fth element,

void. (See the void disciple prestige class in Chapter 2.)

*Sense Elements* (Sp) *:* One of the fi rst “spells” a shugenja

learns—a magical effect so basic that it becomes a spell-like

ability—is the ability to sense elements. As a full-round

action, a shugenja can become aware of all sources of one

chosen element (air, earth, fi re, or water) within 10 feet of

him. The shugenja learns the size of the objects but not their

precise location or actual nature.

By concentrating longer, a shugenja can either extend

her magical senses or gather more information about the

elements he has detected. Each additional round spent in

concentration allows the shugenja to add 5 feet to the radius

of his sense ability, to a maximum of 5 additional feet per

shugenja level. Thus, at 4th level, Kitsu Mari can sense elements

to a maximum range of 30 feet by concentrating for

fi ve full rounds. Alternatively, the shugenja can focus on one

source of the sensed element per round, attempting a Spellcraft

check to determine more about that single item. The

amount of information he learns depends on his Spellcraft

check result:

**Check Result Information Learned**

20 or higher Item’s general location (square containing

it, or its nearest boundary if it is larger than

a 5-foot square)

25 or higher Whether the item is natural or a spell effect.

(A normal Spellcraft check against DC 20 +

spell level can then determine the nature of

the spell effect.)

30 or higher Whether the item is a creature or an object.

35 or higher The exact nature of the item (for example

whether a creature is an efreeti or a fire

elemental, whether an object is gold or

stone, whether air is breathable or not.)

In subsequent rounds, a shugenja can retry his Spellcraft

check on the same item, shift his attention to a different

item, or extend the range of his senses.

A 1st-level shugenja can use this ability three times per

day. Every fi ve levels he advances as a shugenja allows him to

use the ability an additional time per day (four times at 5th

level, fi ve times at 10th level, and so one). Like many divination

spells, a shugenja’s sense elements ability is blocked by

1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead,

or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

For example, Kitsu Mari enters a room and concentrates

to sense water. (Athough he is a water shugenja, he could

just as easily sense any other element, including fi re.) He

becomes aware of all sources of water within 10 feet. A basin

of water rests on the nightstand, a person lurks behind the

door (living creatures are usually made of all four elements)

holding a vial of poison—Kitsu Mari discovers

three sources of water within 10 feet of him: one Medium,

one Small, and one Fine. Focusing on the Medium source and concentrating for a round, he makes a Spellcraft check

and gets a result of 31. He learns that the Medium source

of water is a creature, that it is natural, and where it is. If

the assassin behind the door has not already jumped out to

attack him, he has learned that a creature is hiding behind

the door ... but more likely, he has learned this too late.
