# Survivor
## Overview
*“T hey tried to kill me, once...”*

—Tybren Swiftfoot

Armies sweep through villages, slaughtering indiscriminately.

Dragons ravage the countryside, orcs rape and plunder, and horrors

beyond imagination rise up from shallow graves to prey upon honest

commoners. And yet, despite the attrition, the death, and destruction,

life continues. This is a testament to the tenacity of life, but it’s also

the foundation for a breed of warrior called the survivor.

A survivor is a hardened combatant, a living weapon tempered by

adversity. Having lived despite all the odds, the survivor takes the

brutal experiences of his past and grows stronger for it. Like the

monk, the survivor specializes in fighting with the weapons he’s

born with: his hands and feet. While he doesn’t have the speed of

his counterpart, he has incredible intuition that allows him to react

to dangerous threats, allowing him to avoid harm and anticipate

dangers before they appear.

Creating a Survivor

The survivor functions in many ways like a monk. Rather than being

trained in the fighting arts of a combat monastery, the survivor learns

through trial and error, discovering new combat techniques from the

hard lessons of life. As a survivor, you have the benefit of high hit

points and the best attack bonus. Add to this an Armor Class and

initiative bonus, and damage reduction, you easily make up for your

lack of armor and weapons.

In combat, you specialize in delivering powerful melee attacks, but

instead of building on weapon training, all of your skills revolve

around the improvement of your unarmed attacks. Since you are a

melee specialist, you need to reach your enemies, which, thanks to

your high Armor Class, you can do without fear of taking too many

hits along the way.

As you gain levels, you acquire special techniques to defeat your

foe’s defenses. The most important ability is shattering strike, which

allows you to give up extra attacks to overcome your foes’ damage

reduction. At higher levels, you develop other techniques that allow

you to sicken, and eventually stagger enemies, giving your allies the

means to destroy your opponents.

Abilities

Strength is easily the most important ability for you. Since you rely

on melee attacks, it helps to compensate for your slightly smaller

damage at low levels. Dexterity and Wisdom are also critical since they

add to your Armor Class. Though you have a high Hit Die, a good

Constitution ensures you keep your feet throughout the combat.

Races

So long as there is war and hardship, any race can produce survivors.

Humans are the most common, since they are numerous and

widespread. As well, halflings are often survivors since many monsters

prey on them. Interestingly, half-orcs make excellent survivors, being

born from adversity.

Alignment

Survivors embrace freedom, self-reliance, and independence, and

eschew concepts of order, duty, and the rule of law. Survivors make

their own laws, knowing in their hearts what is right and what

is wrong. Most survivors are chaotic. However, the survivor class

draws good, neutral, and evil characters in equal numbers, since

survivors can appear after an attack by well-intentioned paladins,

just as survivors can be born from a savage assault by ogres, giants,

and other evil races.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the survivor class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency

The survivor is proficient with all simple weapons. He is not proficient

with any kind of armor or shields, and when wearing armor, using a

shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, he loses his AC bonus,

as well as his initiative bonus.

AC Bonus (Ex)

The survivor has a keen ability to anticipate and avoid his opponent’s

attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, the survivor adds his

Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus

to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five survivor

levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th).

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the

survivor is caught flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is

immobilized or helpless, when he wears any kind of armor, when

using a shield, or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

Initiative Bonus (Ex)

Having endured all manner of hardships, the survivor has developed

a preternatural instinct for anticipating danger. He may add his

Wisdom bonus on initiative checks. In addition, the survivor gains

a +1 bonus on initiative checks at 4th level. This bonus increases by

1 for every four survivor levels thereafter (+2 at 8th, +3 at 12th, +4

at 16th, and +5 at 20th).

Unarmed Strike

At 1st level, the survivor gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus

feat. His attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from

elbows, knees, and feet. This means that he may even make unarmed

strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack

for the survivor when striking unarmed. He may thus apply his full

Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.

Usually the survivor’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he

can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his

attack roll. The survivor has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal

damage while grappling.

His unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured and natural

weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve

either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

12th–15th 1d10 3d6

16th–19th 2d6 3d8

20th 2d8 4d8

The survivor also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than

a normal person would, as shown on **Table 2–5: The Survivor**. The

unarmed damage on **Table 2–5** is only if he is Medium. If Small, the

survivor deals less damage, and if Large, he deals more; see **Table**

**2–6: Small or Large Survivor Unarmed Damage**.

Bonus Feat

At 1st level, the survivor may select either Agile or Athletic as a

bonus feat. At 4th level, he may select either Blind-Fight or Combat

Reflexes as a bonus feat. At 8th level, he may select either Great

Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes as a bonus feat. At 12th

level, the survivor may select either Diehard or Power Attack as a

bonus feat. At 16th level, he may select either Improved Bull Rush

or Improved Overrun as a bonus feat. And at 20th level, the survivor

may select either Knock Down (see **Chapter Three: Supplemental**

**Rules**) or Spring Attack as a bonus feat. He need not have any of

the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them. If

the survivor already has all the listed feats for the level, he may select

any other bonus feat offered at a lower level.

Shattering Strike (Ex)

Starting at 2nd level, the survivor can take a full-round action to

make a single powerful unarmed strike. The attack ignores 1 point

of damage reduction or object hardness per two class levels (1 point

at 2nd, 2 at 4th, 3 at 6th, and so on).

Evasion (Ex)

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever the survivor makes a successful

Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage

on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The survivor can

only use evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor. The survivor

does not get the benefit of evasion when he is helpless.

Burst (Ex)

Starting at 5th level, the survivor may push himself to move faster

than normal. As a swift action, he may gain a +20-foot enhancement

bonus to his land speed for 1 round. On the following round, this

bonus drops to +10 feet, and on the third round, it drops to +5 feet.

The survivor must wait one minute in between each use of burst.

Indomitable (Ex)

At 5th level, whenever the survivor fails a saving throw, he may

immediately make a second saving throw at a –5 circumstance penalty

to resist the effects. Once he uses this ability, the survivor must wait

5 rounds before using it again.

Ignore Condition (Ex)

At 6th level, the survivor gains immunity to a specific condition.

Choose one from any of the following: checked, confused, dazed,

dazzled, fascinated, fatigued, sickened, or stunned. If you use Green

Ronin’s *Advanced Gamemaster’s Guide,* add the following conditions

to this list: besotted, bewildered, enamored, groggy, and stupefied.

Other conditions, drawn from other sources, may be available at the

GM’s discretion. At 11th and 16th level, the survivor gains immunity

to an additional condition.

Damage Reduction (Ex)

Beginning at 7th level, the survivor gains damage reduction. Subtract

1 from the damage he takes each time he is dealt damage from a

weapon or a natural attack. At 9th level, and every two survivor

levels thereafter (11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level), this damage

reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to

0 but not below 0.

Sickening Strike (Ex)

Upon reaching 8th level, the survivor can take a full-round action

to make a single unarmed strike to sicken his opponent. If he hits,

the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half his

class level + his Strength bonus) or become sickened for 1 round. A

sickened character takes a –2 penalty to attack and weapon damage

rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks. Targets immune

to critical hits are immune to sickening strike.

Improved Evasion (Ex)

At 10th level, the survivor’s evasion ability improves. He still takes

no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but

henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. If the survivor

is helpless, he does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

Staggering Strike (Ex)

Beginning at 14th level, the survivor may take a full-round action to make

a single unarmed strike to stagger his opponent. If he hits, for 1 round

the target may only take a single move or standard action. This condition

affects the target even though the staggered condition ordinarily occurs

only when a target’s nonlethal damage exactly equals its current hit point

total. Targets immune to critical hits are immune to staggering strike.

Deny Massive Damage (Ex)

At 18th level, whenever the survivor takes 50 or more points of

damage from a single attack, he need not make a Fortitude save to

avoid death. Damage that reduces the survivor to –10 hit points or

more still kills him.

Massive Damage

One of the subtle changes in the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*

is to make the well–known (and well–despised) massive

damage rules an optional rule. If your group isn’t using

the massive damage rules, substitute this ability for deny

massive damage:

Internal Resolve

At 18th level, whenever the survivor makes a save against

a spell with a death effect (a “save–or–die” spell), he gains

a +5 bonus on his saving throw. In addition, unlike most

saving throws, rolling a one in this special instance is not

an automatic failure.

Devastating Strike (Ex)

Finally, at 20th level, the survivor may take a full-round action to

make a single unarmed strike to invoke fear in his opponent. If he

hits, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half

the survivor’s class level + his Strength bonus) or cower for 1 round.

A cowering character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. As

well, it takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class and it loses its Dexterity

bonus (if any). Targets immune to fear are immune to devastating

strike. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
