# Brawler
## Overview
Deadly even with nothing in her hands, a brawler eschews

using the fighter’s heavy armor and the monk’s mysticism,

focusing instead on perfecting many styles of brutal

unarmed combat. Versatile, agile, and able to adapt to

most enemy attacks, a brawler’s body is a powerful weapon.

**Role**: Brawlers are maneuverable and well suited for

creating f lanking situations or dealing with lightly

armored enemies, as well as quickly adapting to a rapidly

changing battlefield.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

**Parent Classes**: Fighter and monk.

**Starting Wealth**: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp).

**Class Skills**

The brawler’s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb

(Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal

(Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering)

(Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession

(Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the brawler.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A brawler is proficient

with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword,

and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is

proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Brawler’s Cunning (Ex)**: If the brawler’s Intelligence

score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of

meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.

**Martial Flexibility (Ex)**: A brawler can take a move action

to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn’t possess. This

effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat’s

prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per

day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).

The brawler can use this ability again before the duration

expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with

another choice.

If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as

Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using

this ability count toward that feat’s daily limit.

At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the

benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select

one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action.

She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of

the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace

a feat currently fulfilling another’s prerequisite without

also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual

feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.

At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit

of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat

as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a

move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite

of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet

a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected

counts toward her daily uses of this ability.

At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the

benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three

combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected

counts toward her daily uses of this ability.

At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the

benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each

feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.

**Martial Training (Ex)**: At 1st level, a brawler counts her

total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels

for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as

both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that

have different effects based on whether the character has

levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a *monk’s*

*robe*). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally

granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely

Stunning Fist.

**Unarmed Strike**: At 1st level, a brawler gains Improved

Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with

fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler

may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler

applies her full Strength modifier (not half ) on damage

rolls for all her unarmed strikes.

Usually, a brawler’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage,

but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with

no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to

deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.

A brawler’s unarmed strike is treated as both a

manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose

of spells and effects that modify either manufactured

weapons or natural weapons.

A brawler also deals more damage with her unarmed

strikes than others, as shown on Table 1–5: Brawler. The

unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium

brawlers. A Small brawler deals less damage than the

amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a

Large brawler deals more damage; see the following table.

Small or Large Brawler Unarmed Damage

**Damage Damage**

**Level (Small Brawler) (Large Brawler)**

1st–3rd 1d4 1d8

4th–7th 1d6 2d6

8th–11th 1d8 2d8

12th–15th 1d10 3d6

16th–19th 2d6 3d8

20th 2d8 4d8

**Bonus Combat Feats**: At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter,

a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained

from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that

affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler

must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.

Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a

brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place

of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the

brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new

one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite

for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler

can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose

whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new

bonus combat feat for the level.

**Brawler’s Flurry (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can

make a brawler’s f lurry as a full-attack action. When doing so,

a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking

with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from

the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the “monk”

special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons

to use this ability.

A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage

rolls for all attacks made with brawler’s f lurry, whether the

attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded

in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and

trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler’s

f lurry. A brawler with natural weapons can’t use such weapons

as part of brawler’s f lurry, nor can she make natural weapon

attacks in addition to her brawler’s f lurry attacks.

At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-

Weapon Fighting feat when using brawler’s f lurry. At 15th

level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting

feat when using brawler’s f lurry.

**Maneuver Training (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a brawler can select

one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains

a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that

combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending

against that maneuver.

At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler

becomes further trained in another combat maneuver,

gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and

to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous

maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a

brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her

bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she

then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses

to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)

**AC Bonus (Ex)**: At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or

no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This

bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.

These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She

loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing

medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium

or heavy load.

**Knockout (Ex)**: At 4th level, once per day a brawler can

unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target

unconscious. She must announce this intent before making

her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage

from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving

throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the

brawler’s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious

for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target

may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a fullround

action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are

immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use

this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three

times per day.

**Brawler’s Strike (Ex)**: At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed

strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed

attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose

of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses

one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful;

her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment

component cannot be the opposite of the brawler’s actual

alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.)

At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as

adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction and bypassing hardness.

**Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: At 5th level, a brawler’s

damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a

close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a

brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that

weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a

punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the

weapon’s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more

damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability

does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler

can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of her

adjusted unarmed strike damage—this must be declared

before the attack roll is made.

**Awesome Blow (Ex)**: At 16th level, the brawler can as a

standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver

against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the

combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage

as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or

an unarmed strike, it is knocked f lying 10 feet in a direction

of the brawler’s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can

only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent

can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it started

in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s

move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points

of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space

adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster

feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)

**Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)**: At 20th level, the brawler

can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than

as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any

size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can

immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling

another combat maneuver check with all the same

modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll

is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the

damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.
