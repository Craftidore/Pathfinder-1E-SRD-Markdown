# Bloodrager
## Overview
While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep

reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic

power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers’

veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this

power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in

which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes

of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power.

In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells

instinctively. The bloodrager’s magic is as fast, violent, and

seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.

**Role**: Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash

fearful carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and

combat prowess. The bloodrager’s place is on the front lines,

right in his enemies’ faces, supplying tremendous martial

force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

**Parent Classes**: Barbarian and sorcerer.

**Starting Wealth**: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp).

**Class Skills**

The bloodrager’s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb

(Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha),

Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex),

Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the bloodrager.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Bloodragers are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium

armor, and shields (except tower shields). A bloodrager can

cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium

armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure

chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance

for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other

arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or

wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if

the spell in question has somatic components.

**Bloodline**: Each bloodrager has a source of magic

somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages,

bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source ref lects

a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due

to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere

in his family’s past. Regardless of the source, this inf luence

manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one

bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once

made, this choice cannot be changed.

When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager’s alignment

doesn’t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come

from an abyssal bloodline, a celestial bloodline could beget

an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an

infernal bloodline could be chaotic, and so on. Though

his bloodline empowers him, it doesn’t dictate or limit

his thoughts and behavior.

The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th

level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers

a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline.

For all spell-like bloodline powers, treat the character’s

bloodrager level as the caster level.

At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager

receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each

bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites

for these bonus feats.

At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an

additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells

are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1–4.

These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at

higher levels.

If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants

a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if

that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must

change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can

change his former bloodline to make them conform.

**Bloodrage (Su)**: The bloodrager’s source of internal power

grants him the ability to bloodrage. At 1st level, a bloodrager

can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to

4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he

can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary

increases to Constitution (such as those gained from

bloodraging or spells like *bear’s endurance*) don’t increase

the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage

per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day

is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours

need not be consecutive.

A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While

in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his

Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on

Will saves. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class.

The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points

per Hit Die, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and

are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging,

a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or

Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate,

and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When

the bloodrage ends, he’s fatigued for a number of rounds

equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage.

A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued

or exhausted, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple

times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager

falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing

him in peril of death.

Bloodrage counts as the barbarian’s rage class feature

for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic

item abilities, and spell effects.

**Fast Movement (Ex)**: A bloodrager’s land speed is faster

than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies

only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium

armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before

modifying the bloodrager’s speed due to any armor worn

or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses

to the bloodrager’s land speed.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react

to danger before his senses would normally allow him to

do so. He cannot be caught f lat-footed, nor does he lose his

Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still

loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager

with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if

an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.

If a bloodrager already possesses uncanny dodge from a

different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny

dodge (see below) instead.

**Blood Sanctuary (Su)**: At 3rd level, due to the power of his

blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects

of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus

on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.

**Blood Casting (Su)**: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains

the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He

can also cast these spells defensively and can make

concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging.

While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only

his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes

cannot be cast during this state.

**Eschew Materials**: At 4th level, the bloodrager gains

Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the

ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from

the bloodrager spell list (see page 22). To learn or cast a

spell, a bloodrager must have a Charisma score equal to

at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows

without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw

DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the

bloodrager’s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a

certain number of spells of each level per day. His base

daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–3. In addition, he

receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score

(*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* 17, Table 1–3). The bloodrager

does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can

cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn’t yet

used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.

The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th

level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice.

A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as

indicated on Table 1–4. Unlike spells per day, the number

of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his Charisma

score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from

his bloodline.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 5th level, a bloodrager

can no longer be f lanked. This defense denies rogues (or

other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak

attack the bloodrager by f lanking him, unless the attacker

has at least four more rogue levels (or levels in the class

granting sneak attack) than the target has bloodrager levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another

class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge

stack when determining the minimum rogue level required

to f lank the character.

**Damage Reduction (Ex**): At 7th level, a bloodrager gains

damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the bloodrager

takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural

attack. At 10th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage

reduction increases by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce

damage to 0, but not below 0.

**Greater Bloodrage (Su)**: At 11th level, when a bloodrager

enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and

Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will

saves increases to +3. In addition, upon entering a bloodrage,

the bloodrager can apply the effects a bloodrager spell he

knows of 2nd level or lower to himself. The spell must have

a range of touch or personal. If the spell’s duration is greater

than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the bloodrage.

This use consumes a bloodrager spell slot, as if he had cast the

spell; he must have the spell slot available to take advantage

of this effect.

Greater bloodrage counts as the barbarian’s greater rage

ability for the purposes of feat prerequisites, feat abilities,

magic item abilities, and spell effects.

**Indomitable Will (Ex)**: At 14th level, a bloodrager gains a

+4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while

bloodraging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers,

including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives

during his bloodrage.

**Tireless Bloodrage (Su)**: At 17th level, a bloodrager no

longer becomes fatigued at the end of his bloodrage.

**Mighty Bloodrage (Su)**: At 20th level, when a bloodrager

enters a bloodrage, the morale bonus to his Strength and

Constitution increases to +8, and the morale bonus on his

Will saves increases to +4. Furthermore, the spell he can

apply to himself at the beginning of a bloodrage due to the

greater bloodrage class feature is not limited to only spells

of 2nd level or lower.

**Bloodrager Bloodlines**

When a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, he often takes on

a physical transformation inf luenced by his bloodline

and powered by the magic that roils within him. Unless

otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline

powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends,

all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and

any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert,

restoring him to normal.

Aberrant

There is a taint in your blood that is both alien and bizarre.

When you bloodrage, this manifests in peculiar and

terrifying ways.

**Bonus Feats**: Combat Ref lexes, Great Fortitude, Improved

Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved

Unarmed Strike, Iron Will.

**Bonus Spells**: *Enlarge person* (7th), *see invisibility* (10th),

*displacement* (13th), *black tentacles* (16th).

**Bloodline Powers**: While bloodraging, you gain the abilities

and immunities of some aberrations, but show signs of your

tainted heritage.

*Staggering Strike (Su)*: At 1st level, when you confirm a critical

hit the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be

staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2

your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. These

effects stack with the Staggering Critical feat; the target must

save against each effect individually.

*Abnormal Reach (Su)*: At 4th level, your limbs elongate; your

reach increases by 5 feet.

*Aberrant Fortitude (Su)*: At 8th level, you become immune

to the sickened and nauseated conditions.

*Unusual Anatomy (Su)*: At 12th level, your internal anatomy

shifts and changes, giving you a 50% chance to negate any

critical hit or sneak attack that hits you. The damage is

instead rolled normally.

*Aberrant Resistance (Su)*: At 16th level, you are immune

to disease, exhaustion, fatigue, and poison, and to the

staggered condition.

*Aberrant Form (Su)*: At 20th level, your body becomes truly

unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks.

In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and

your bloodrager damage reduction increases by 1. You have

these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.

Abyssal

Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into the essence of

your bloodline. While it doesn’t manifest in all of your kin,

in those moments when you’re bloodraging, you embody

its terrifying presence.

**Bonus Feats**: Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Bull

Rush, Improved Sunder, Intimidating Prowess, Power

Attack, Toughness.

**Bonus Spells**: *Ray of enfeeblement* (7th), *bull’s strength* (10th),

*rage* (13th), *stoneskin* (16th).

**Bloodline Powers**: The power of the Abyss courses

through your veins, causing horrif ic transformations

during your bloodrage.

*Claws (Su)*: At 1st level, you grow claws while bloodraging.

These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you

to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full

base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage

each (1d4 if you are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At

4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the

purpose of overcoming damage resistance. At 8th level, the

damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At

12th level, these claws become *f laming* weapons, which deal

an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a hit.

*Demonic Bulk (Su)*: At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage,

you can choose to grow one size category larger than your

base size (as *enlarge person*) even if you aren’t humanoid.

*Demon Resistances (Su)*: At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to

acid, cold, and fire. At 16th level, these resistances increase

to 10.

*Abyssal Bloodrage (Su)*: At 12th level, the morale bonus to

Strength granted by your bloodrage increases by 2, but the

penalty to AC becomes –4 instead of –2. At 16th level, this bonus

increases by 4 instead. At 20th level, it increases by 6 instead.

*Demonic Aura (Su)*: At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage

you can choose to exude an aura of fire. The aura is a 5-foot

burst centered on you, and deals 2d6 + your Constitution

modifier points of fire damage to creatures that end their

turns within it.

*Demonic Immunities (Su)*: At 20th level, you’re immune to

electricity and poison. You have this benefit constantly,

even while not bloodraging.

Arcane

While others of your kin may be powerful wizards and

sorcerers, the eldritch nature of the blood coursing through

your veins transforms you into a spell-breaking terror.

**Bonus Feats**: Combat Ref lexes, Disruptive\*, Improved

Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Quick Draw,

Spellbreaker\*. (Your bloodrager levels count as fighter levels

for the purposes of qualifying for any feats marked with an

asterisk \[\*].) This stacks with any levels in fighter you have.

**Bonus Spells**: *Magic missile* (7th), *invisibility* (10th), *lightning*

*bolt* (13th), *dimension door* (16th).

**Bloodline Powers**: When you bloodrage, arcane power

transforms you into an arcane juggernaut who can cut down

even the most careful caster.

*Disruptive Bloodrage (Su)*: At 1st level, the DC to cast

spells defensively increases by 2 for enemies within your

threatened area. This increase stacks with that granted by

the Disruptive feat.

*Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)*: At 4th level, when entering a

bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells and

apply its effects to yourself: *blur*, *protection from arrows*, *resist*

*energy* (choose one energy type), or *spider climb*. These effects

last for as long as you continue bloodraging, regardless of

the spell’s normal duration.

*Greater Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)*: At 8th level, when entering

a bloodrage, you can choose to apply the effects of either

*displacement* or *haste* to yourself. This is in addition to arcane

bloodrage, and otherwise works as that ability.

*Caster’s Scourge (Ex)*: At 12th level, you gain a number of

extra attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity modifier

(minimum 1). You can use these attacks of opportunity

only against spellcasters in your threatened area who cast

or attempt to cast defensively. The Spellbreaker feat, the

caster’s bane bloodrage power (see below), or some similar

effect is still required to make attacks of opportunity

against spellcasters who are casting defensively. You have

this ability constantly, even while not bloodraging.

*True Arcane Bloodrage (Sp)*: At 16th level, when entering

a bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells

and apply its effects to yourself: *beast shape IV* (choose a

creature your size or larger only), *form of the dragon I*, or

*transformation*. This is in addition to arcane bloodrage

and greater arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as

those abilities.

*Caster’s Bane (Ex)*: At 20th level, spellcasters with a caster

level lower than your bloodrager level always provoke attacks

of opportunity within your threatened area, even when

casting defensively. You have this ability constantly, even

while not bloodraging.

*Angelic Attacks (Su)*: At 1st level, your melee attacks are

considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of

bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, when you deal

damage with a melee attack to an evil outsider, you deal an

additional 1d6 points of damage. This additional damage

stacks with effects such as *align weapon* and those granted

by a weapon with the *holy* weapon special ability.

*Celestial Resistances (Ex)*: At 4th level, you gain resistance 5

to acid and cold. At 12th level, these resistances increase to 10.

*Conviction (Su)*: At 8th level, once per bloodrage you can

*Destined Strike (Su)*: At 1st level, as a free action up to

three times per day you can grant yourself an insight

to five times per day.

*Fated Bloodrager (Su)*: At 4th level, you gain a +1 luck bonus

at 20th level).

*Certain Strike (Su)*: At 8th level, you may reroll an attack

roll once during a bloodrage. You must decide to use this

ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the

results. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.

*Defy Death (Su)*: At 12th level, once per day when an attack

or spell that deals damage would result in your death, you

can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you succeed, you are

instead reduced to 1 hit point; if you succeed and already

have less than 1 hit point, you instead take no damage.

*Unstoppable (Su)*: At 16th level, any critical threats you

score are automatically conf irmed. Any critical threats

made against you confirm only if the second roll results

in a natural 20 (or is automatically confirmed).

*Victory or Death (Su)*: At 20th level, you are immune to

paralysis and petrif ication, as well as to the stunned,

dazed, and staggered conditions. You have these benefits

constantly, even while not bloodraging.

Draconic

with your bloodline. Now, the sublime monster’s ancient

power fuels your bloodrage.

Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Fly), Toughness.

**Bonus Spells**: *Shield* (7th), *resist energy* (10th), *f ly* (13th),

Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of your

bloodline powers deal damage and grant resistances based

on your dragon type, as noted below.

*Claws (Su)*: At 1st level, you grow claws. These claws are

treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw

attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus.

These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each (1d4 if you

are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these

claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the damage

increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level,

these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of your

energy type on a hit.

*Draconic Resistance (Ex)*: At 4th level, you gain resistance 5

against your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus to AC.

At 8th level, your energy resistance increases to 10 and your

natural armor bonus increases to +2. At 16th level, your natural

armor bonus increases to +4.

*Breath Weapon (Su)*: At 8th level, you gain a breath weapon

that you can use once per day. This breath weapon deals

1d6 points of damage of your energy type per bloodrager

level. Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a

Ref lex saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is

equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution

modifier. The shape of the breath weapon depends on your

dragon type (as indicated on the above table). At 16th level,

you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can

use this ability three times per day.

*Dragon Wings (Su)*: At 12th level, when entering a

bloodrage, you can choose to have leathery wings grow

from your back, giving you a f ly speed of 60 feet with average

maneuverability. At 16th level, your f ly speed increases to

80 feet with good maneuverability.

*Dragon Form (Su)*: At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage,

you can choose to take the form of your chosen dragon

type (as *form of the dragon II*, but with average or good

a charge attack, that creature becomes shaken for a number of

rounds equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1). This

effect does not cause an existing shaken or frightened condition
