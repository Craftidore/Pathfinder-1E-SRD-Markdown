# Corsair
## Overview
*“The treasure’s nice and all, but it’s the thrill that keeps me coming back to kick in the teeth of my enemies.”*

—Bloody Lucille, Corsair

Pirate, buccaneer, adventurer—the corsair is all these things and more. The consummate adventurer, the corsair laughs in the face of danger, throws caution to the wind, and somehow escapes harm even in the most desperate of situations. Whether riding the waves on the deck of a swift schooner or swinging from a chandelier in a great hall, the corsair lives for the thrill of danger.

The corsair is, at heart, a combatant. Unlike other martial characters, she eschews heavier armors in favor of speed and mobility. To compensate for her lighter armor, she uses every trick she can to overcome her opponents. At first, she comes to rely on unfair fighting techniques to slip past defenses and land crippling wounds. As she grows in power, she becomes more comfortable in unstable environments, fighting with finesse anywhere, from the rigging of a ship to the rolling deck of a galleon in a storm-tossed sea.

**Creating a Corsair**

The corsair is a fast, agile combatant, capable of delivering devastating damage under the right circumstances. Maneuverability is the corsair’s strength, slipping past the enemies’ front lines to wreak havoc from behind, similar to how a rogue functions in combat. In addition, most corsairs are charismatic, having strong personalities that aid them in positions of leadership.

**Abilities**

A high Dexterity is the corsair’s most important ability, as she is restricted to light armor, and many of her class skills rely on this ability. Charisma is also important, for both skills and her reckless abandon class feature. As a combatant, though, no corsair should overlook her Strength and Constitution to see her through to the end of a fight.

**Races**

Half-elves and humans are the most common corsairs as they find it easy to sever their ties to family and homeland. Halflings also make for great corsairs, being naturally athletic and prone to a nomadic existence. Likewise, elves have a natural gift of agility allowing them to navigate the ships and develop skills at swordplay that put their human and half-elven counterparts to shame. Dwarves and half-orcs generally lack the personality or wit to make good corsairs. Among the planetouched, both aasimars and tieflings do well in this class. Aasimars excel because they are naturally charismatic, while tieflings have the advantage of quick minds and incredible reflexes.

**Alignment**

Though corsairs may be of any alignment, chaotic corsairs are by far the most common. It takes a free spirit to leave everything behind and embrace a life of adventure. In ethical terms, corsairs are drawn neither toward good or evil, as this class attracts the best and worst of people.

**Class Features**

All of the following are class features of the corsair class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**

Corsairs are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and the buckler.

**Bonus Feat:** At 1st level, a corsair selects a bonus feat from the following list. She must meet all the prerequisites for that feat. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, she selects another bonus feat from the list for that level or any earlier levels at which she gains a bonus feat.

*1st-Level Bonus Feat:* [[Acrobatic (Feat)|Acrobatic]], [[Agile Maneuvers (Feat)|Agile Maneuvers]], or [[Athletic (Feat)|Athletic]].

*5th-Level Bonus Feat:* [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], or [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]].

*10th-Level Bonus Feat:* [[Improved Feint (Feat)|Improved Feint]], [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]], or [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]].

*15th-Level Bonus Feat:* [[Greater Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Greater Two-Weapon Fighting]], [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]], or [[Whirlwind Attack (Feat)|Whirlwind Attack]].

*20th-Level Bonus Feat:* Any fighter bonus feat.

**Dirty Fighting:** If a corsair can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Her attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not) or when she flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d4 at 1st level, and it increases by +1d4 at 5th level and again every five levels thereafter. Should she score a critical hit with dirty fighting, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as dirty fighting only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a corsair can use dirty fighting to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. Unlike the rogue’s sneak attack, a corsair can use any weapon to deal nonlethal damage with dirty fighting by taking a –4 penalty to the attack roll.

A corsair must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. She cannot use dirty fighting while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

Extra damage from dirty fighting stacks with similar types of extra

damage including sneak attack damage.

**Corsair's Luck (Ex):** A corsair has an uncanny ability to escape danger unscathed. Starting at 2nd level, she can use corsair’s luck to add one-half her class level (maximum +10) as an insight bonus to any attack roll, ability or skill check, or saving throw. She need not declare the use of this ability prior to the roll, however, she must declare use before the GM announces the success or failure of the roll.

**Sea Legs (Ex):** At 3rd level, a corsair gains Sea Legs as a bonus feat. She need not meet the prerequisites to gain this feat.

**Canny Defense (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, a corsair can add her Charisma bonus (if any) as a dodge bonus to her Armor Class. She retains this bonus even if caught flat-footed. She loses this bonus, however, if she wears medium or heavy armor or carries a heavy load.

**Rope Monkey (Ex):** At 6th level, a corsair gains Rope Monkey as a bonus feat. She need not meet the prerequisites to gain this feat.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** Also at 6th level, she can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, a corsair still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

If the corsair already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

**Improvised Weapon Fighting (Ex):** A corsair can use just about anything as a weapon. Beginning at 8th level, she takes only a –2 penalty on attack rolls when fighting with an improvised weapon or a weapon with which she is not proficient. In addition, when fighting with a weapon inappropriately sized for her, the corsair takes only a –1 cumulative penalty per size difference.

**Fast on your Feet (Ex):** At 9th level, the corsair can maneuver more easily. In place of taking a 5-foot step, she can immediately exchange positions with an adjacent ally.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** Upon attaining 11th level, the corsair can no longer be flanked, denying opponents from dealing sneak attack damage (or similar extra damage effects) to her when flanking, unless the attacker has at least four more levels than she does. If the corsair already has improved uncanny dodge from a second class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank her.

**Defensive Roll (Ex):** Starting at 14th level, the corsair can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the corsair can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the corsair must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability. If the corsair has evasion from another class, it does not apply to the defensive roll since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage.

**Greater Improvised Weapon Fighting (Ex):** The corsair can use just about anything as a weapon. At 16th level, she never takes a penalty to attack rolls made with an improvised weapon, nor does she take a penalty when fighting with a weapon one size larger than her. The corsair does, however, take a –1 penalty to attack rolls when using weapons more than one size larger or smaller, such as a Medium corsair fighting with a Tiny greatsword or Huge dagger. Finally, when fighting with a weapon with which she is not proficient, the corsair takes only a –1 penalty to attack rolls.

**Uncanny Tumbler (Ex):** At 18th level, a corsair gains a +5 bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks. When making an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check to tumble, the corsair’s movement is not penalized, so each square of movement she tumbles through costs only 1 square of movement. In addition, as an immediate action, she can substitute an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check for a Reflex save and if she succeeds, she may move up to one-half her speed. She must wait 5 rounds between each substitution use of this ability.

**Uncanny Balance (Ex):** At 19th level, the corsair may always take 10 on an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks to balance even if rushed or threatened. When making such [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks, roll twice and take the better result. She never loses her Dexterity bonus to AC while being attacked when balancing, and she takes no penalty for accelerated movement while balancing. Finally, when opposing a combat maneuver to trip or bull rush, she may substitute an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check for her Strength or Dexterity check. She must wait 5 rounds between each substitution use of this ability.
