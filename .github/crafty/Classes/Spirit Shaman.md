# Spirit Shaman
## Overview
Master of the spirit world, the spirit shaman follows a different

divine tradition than the cleric or the druid. Her world

is fi lled with powerful, living spirits, some helpful and some

malign. By bargaining with these spirits, the spirit shaman

gains power over the natural world and mighty divine magic

with which to aid her comrades or smite her enemies.

Adventures: Spirit shamans exist to mediate between

the human world and the spirit world and make sure that

humans (and dwarves, elves, orcs, and all other humanoid

races, of course) respect the spirits as is only right and

proper. Spirit shamans adventure to advance the causes of

whichever spirits they favor. Those who venerate helpful

spirits seek to assist people deserving of the spirits’ protection.

Those who revere dark and vengeful spirits promote

the chaos and suffering in which their patrons delight.

Through their actions, spirit shamans prove the power of

their patron spirits and earn prestige and status in the spirit

world.

Characteristics: Spirit shamans cast divine spells much

the same way druids do, though they get their spells from

powerful spirits of nature. Their spells, like the druid’s, are

oriented toward nature and animals. In addition to spells,

spirit shamans gain an increasing array of spirit powers as

they advance in level.

Alignment: Spirit shamans, in keeping with the indifference

of the spirits, tend toward some measure of dispassion.

Unlike druids, they are more tribal than solitary, and

involve themselves in the affairs of their fellows. Most spirit

shamans are neutral on at least one alignment axis, but it is

not uncommon to fi nd a spirit shaman who has become so

caught up in the affairs of the living that she has lost her

distance from human concerns.

Religion: A spirit shaman reveres the essence of religion

more than the practice. She gains her magical powers from

the spirits that inhabit all things, living and dead, animate

and inanimate. She combines ancestral worship with animal

and nature worship. The typical spirit shaman, like a druid,

pursues a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with

nature rather than devoting herself to a divine entity. Still,

some spirit shamans give honor to deities of nature such as

either Obad-Hai (god of nature) or Ehlonna (goddess of the

woodlands).

Background: Spirit shamans are fi rst taught by older

shamans. When a tribe’s spirit shaman feels that the time

is right, she chooses a potential successor from among the

young folk of the tribe. Taking the youth into her own

home, she spends years teaching her student the ways

of both the natural world and the spirit realm. Typically,

when the young spirit shaman is ready, the older shaman

then sends her student out to wander the world for a time

in order to gain the wisdom and experience necessary to

serve as the tribe’s spirit shaman on his return. Sometimes,

a young shaman impatient with an overly cautious master

strikes out on his own to seek out the knowledge he feels

his master is withholding.

Races: Halfl ings, humans, and half-orcs are the races that

more commonly give rise to the tribal cultures in which shamans

fl ourish. While rare groups of barbaric dwarves, elves,

or gnomes favor a shamanic tradition instead of a cleric or

druid one, these communities are uncommon at best.

Other Classes: Spirit shamans perceive a world that no

other class truly understands. As such, they feel it is their

duty to advise their comrades and protect them from the

wrath of the spirits. Spirit shamans respect druids and get

along well with them, but they feel that clerics do not pay

suffi cient respect to the spirit world, and often form long

and bitter rivalries with clerics they meet.

Role: The spirit shaman is only a mediocre melee combatant,

but she can hurl spell after spell in a combat situation.

No other character matches her ability to study a situation

and customize her spell selection for offense, defense, or

special purposes. Like the druid, she can serve as a party’s

healer, but she is best in settings where she does not need to

devote many of her spell choices to healing and can maximize

spell choices that provide offense for the party and aid

her companions in battle.

Game Rule Information

Spirit shamans have the following games statistics.

Abilities: Wisdom determines how powerful a spell a

spirit shaman can cast and how many spells she can cast per

day. Charisma determines how hard those spells are to resist

(see Spells, below). Like a druid, the spirit shaman benefi ts

from high Dexterity and high Constitution due to the fact

that she begins with profi ciency with only light armor.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Dice: d8.

Class Features

All of the following are class features

of the spirit shaman.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

A spirit shaman is profi

cient with the club, dagger,

dart, hand axe, javelin, longspear,

quarterstaff, shortspear,

spear, sling, shortbow, throwing

axe, and with light armor

and shields. These are the

weapons commonly used

by the tribal societies in which

spirit shamans are found.

Spells: A spirit shaman casts

divine spells from the druid spell list.

She can cast any spell she has retrieved, much like a bard or sorcerer can cast any spell she knows

without preparing it ahead of time.

To retrieve or cast a spell, a spirit shaman must have a

Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell level (Wisdom 10 for

0-level spells, Wisdom 11 for 1st-level spells, and so on). The

Diffi culty Class for a saving throw against a spirit shaman’s

spell is 10 + the spell level + the spirit shaman’s Charisma

modifi er.

Like other spellcasters, a spirit shaman can cast only a

certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her

base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–5: The Spirit

Shaman. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she

has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1–1: Ability Modifi ers

and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

Like a sorcerer, a spirit shaman knows only a small

number of spells. However, each day a spirit shaman may

change the spells she knows. When a spirit shaman meditates

to regain her daily allotment of spells (see below), she

sends forth her spirit guide to bargain with the spirits and

retrieve knowledge of the specifi c druid spells she will be

able to use that day. She can cast any spell she has retrieved

at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells

per day for that spell level. For example, a 3rd-level spirit

shaman can retrieve three 0-level, two 1st-level, and one

2nd-level druid spells. She can cast 0-level spells fi ve times,

1st-level spells four times, and her 2nd-level spell two times

in the course of the day. She might end up using the same

0-level spell fi ve times, or one 0-level spell two times and

another 0-level spell three times, or any combination that

adds up to fi ve uses of any of her 0-level spells.

If a spirit shaman knows any metamagic feats, she applies

them to her spells when she retrieves her spells for the day.

For example, a spirit shaman might choose to retrieve an

*empowered fl ame strike* by using a 6th-level spell retrieved

slot. Any time she uses *fl ame strike* during the ensuing day,

she must use a 6th-level spell slot to cast it, and it is always

empowered. A spirit shaman could use a 4th-level spell slot

and a 6th-level spell slot to retrieve *fl ame strike* and *empowered*

*fl ame strike* if she wanted to have both spells available

to her in a day. A spirit shaman cannot choose to alter her

spells with metamagic feats on the fl y, as other spontaneous

casters do. Spirit shamans using metamagic feats do not

have an increased casting time as sorcerers do.

Each spirit shaman must choose a time at which she must

spend 1 hour in quiet meditation to regain her daily allotment

of spells and bargain with the spirits for the specifi c

spells she knows on that day.

Spirit Guide: All spirit shamans have a spirit guide, a

personifi cation of the spirit world. In some sense a spirit

shaman and her guide are one being, both knowing and

seeing and experiencing the same things. Unlike a familiar,

a spirit guide is not a separate entity from a spirit shaman.

She is the only one who can perceive or interact with her

guide. It exists only inside her own mind and soul.

The spirit shaman’s spirit guide confers greater awareness

of her surroundings, and grants her the Alertness feat. The

spirit guide grants additional abilities at 5th and 10th level

(see Follow the Guide and Guide Magic, below).

**Spirit Guide Characteristics**

Wolf Loyalty, interdependence

The exact form of the spirit guide is chosen by the spirit

shaman at 1st level, usually for the qualities it represents,

as shown above. The exact form of a spirit guide is purely

personal preference, and confers no special advantages or

disadvantages.

Wild Empathy (Ex): Guided by her insight into animal

spirits, a spirit shaman can use body language, vocalizations,

and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (a

monster of the animal type). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person

(see Chapter 4: Skills in the *Player’s Handbook*). The spirit

shaman rolls 1d20 and adds her spirit shaman level and her

Charisma modifi er to determine the wild empathy check

result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude

of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the spirit shaman and the animal

must be able to study each other, which means that they

must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions.

Generally, infl uencing an animal in this way takes 1

minute (as with infl uencing people, use of this ability might

take more or less time).

A spirit shaman cannot use this ability to infl uence a

magical beast.

Chastise Spirits (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a spirit

shaman can use divine energy granted by her patrons in

the spirit world to damage hostile spirits (see the What is a

Spirit? sidebar).

Chastising spirits is a standard action that deals 1d6

damage/shaman level to all spirits within 30 feet of the

shaman. The affected spirits get a Will save (DC 10+ shaman

level + Cha modifi er) for half damage.

When using this ability against incorporeal creatures, a

spirit shaman does not have to roll the normal 50% miss

chance—the effect hits the spirits automatically. A spirit

shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal

to 3 + her Charisma modifi er.

*Detect Spirits* (Sp): The spirit shaman’s spirit guide perceives

nearby spirits. At will, the spirit shaman can use

*detect spirits* as a spell-like ability. It functions just like

*detect undead,* except it detects creatures that are considered

spirits.

*Blessing of the Spirits* (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a spirit

shaman can perform a special rite to gain a special blessing.

The shaman goes into a meditative state in which she travels

to the spirit world. Performing the rite requires 10 minutes;

the spirit shaman can only ward herself with this ability and

cannot perform the rite for anyone else. The blessing functions

just like *protection from evil*, except it protects against

spirits and lasts until it is dismissed or dispelled. If this ability

is dispelled, the spirit shaman can recreate it simply by

taking 10 minutes to do so.

Follow the Guide (Su): At 5th level and higher, a spirit

shaman’s spirit guide helps her maintain control of her

mind. If a spirit shaman is affected by an enchantment spell

or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again

1 round later at the same DC. She only gets this one extra

chance to succeed on her saving throw.

Ghost Warrior (Su): Beginning at 6th level, a spirit

shaman confers the ghost touch special ability (see Magic

Weapon Special Ability Descriptions, page 223 of the *Dungeon*

*Master’s Guide*) to any weapon she holds for as long as she

holds it. She also becomes resistant to the touch attacks of

incorporeal creatures, and may use her normal Armor Class

(not her touch AC) against any touch attack delivered by an

incorporeal creature.

*Warding of the Spirits* (Sp): Starting at 7th level, a spirit

shaman can perform a special rite once per day to ward herself

and her companions against hostile spirits. Performing

the rite requires 1 minute. The warding lasts for 10 minutes

per level and otherwise functions like *magic circle against*

*evil*, except it protects against spirits.

Spirit Form (Su): At 9th level and higher, a spirit shaman

learns how to temporarily transform herself into a spirit.

Once per day, as a standard action, she can make herself

incorporeal for up to 1 minute.

While incorporeal, a spirit shaman gains all the advantages

of the incorporeal subtype (see the Glossary of the

*Monster Manual*), including immunity to all nonmagical

attack forms, a 50% chance to ignore damage from any

corporeal source, and the ability to enter or pass through

solid objects. The spirit shaman loses any armor or natural

armor bonus to AC, but gains a defl ection bonus equal to her

Charisma modifi er (minimum +1).

She has no Strength score against corporeal creatures or

objects and cannot make physical attacks against them, but

she gains the ability to make a melee touch attack (add the

spirit shaman’s Dexterity modifi er to her attack roll) that

deals 1d6 points of damage to a corporeal target. This effect

is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

At 15th level and higher, a spirit shaman can use her spirit

form twice per day. At 20th level, she can use this ability

three times per day.

spirit shaman can assign her spirit guide the task of concentrating

on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained

through concentration. The spirit shaman can act normally

while her spirit guide concentrates on the spell. A spirit

guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. If necessary

to maintain the spell, the spirit guide makes Concentration

checks for the spirit shaman, using the spirit shaman’s

normal Concentration modifi er. A spirit guide does not

have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such

as the spirit shaman taking damage. The spirit itself is not

present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact with.

*Recall Spirit* (Sp): At 11th level, a spirit shaman gains the

ability to call back the spirit of a dead creature before the

spirit of the deceased has completely left the body. Once per

week, she can reconnect a spirit to its body, restoring life to a

recently deceased creature. The ability must be used within

1 round of the victim’s death. This ability functions like *raise*

*dead,* except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no

Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature is only

restored to –1 hit points (but is stabilized).

Exorcism (Su): Starting at 13th level, as a full-round

action, a spirit shaman can force a possessing creature or

spirit out of the body it inhabits (for example, a ghost with

the malevolence ability). To exorcise a possessing creature,

she makes a class level check (also adding her Charisma

modifi er, if any), against a DC of 10 + the possessing

creature’s HD + its Charisma modifi er (if any). If her result

equals or exceeds the DC, she succeeds in forcing the possessor

from the body, with the normal results based on its

method of possession. A spirit so exorcised cannot attempt

to possess the same victim for 24 hours.

Weaken Spirits (Su): At 16th level and higher, a spirit

shaman can choose to strip spirits of their defenses instead

of damaging them with her chastise spirits ability. When

a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance and any

damage reduction overcome by magic weapons, silver or

cold iron weapons, and aligned weapons (but not damage

reduction overcome by adamantine weapons or not overcome

by anything). In addition, an incorporeal spirit loses

its immunity to nonmagical attack, its 50% chance to ignore

damage from corporeal sources, and its ability to move into

or through objects.

To weaken spirits, a spirit shaman uses her chastise spirits

ability but chooses to do less damage in exchange for weakening

the spirits for a short time. For each 3d6 of chastise

spirit damage the spirit shaman foregoes, the affected spirits

are weakened for 1 round. For example, a 16th-level spirit

shaman chastising two dread wraiths deals 16d6 points of

damage to each dread wraith, but she could choose to deal

7d6 points of damage to each wraith and weaken them for 3

rounds. Spirits that make their Will save against the chastise

spirits damage are unaffected by the weakening effect (but

still take half the damage).

*Spirit Journey* (Sp): A spirit shaman knows how to vanish

bodily into the spirit world beginning at 17th level. This

ability functions like the spell *shadow walk,* except that a

spirit shaman can only transport herself. She need not use

the ability in a shadowy area, and she travels through the

Plane of Spirits, not the Plane of Shadows. A spirit shaman

can use this ability once per day.

*Favored of the Spirits* (Sp): At 19th level, a spirit shaman

learns how to perform a special rite that guards her from

death. Performing the rite requires 8 hours, and the spirit

shaman must bargain away part of her life force, expending

1,000 experience points. The rite’s effect lasts until it is

dismissed or discharged.

While under the protection of this rite, a spirit shaman

instantly receives the benefi t of a *heal* spell (caster level

equal to her spirit shaman level) if she is reduced to 0 hit

points or lower or has any ability score reduced to 0. The

spirit shaman receives the spell’s effect immediately, even if

reduced to –10 hit points or lower by an enemy attack, and

thus may survive a blow that otherwise would have killed

her. The rite’s protection is discharged once it is triggered,

and the spirit shaman must perform a new rite to use this

ability again.

Spirit Who Walks (Ex): At 20th level, a spirit shaman

becomes one with the spirit world. She is forevermore

treated as a fey instead of a humanoid for purposes of spells

and magical effects. Additionally, she gains damage reduction

5/cold iron.

GM Note

WHAT IS A SPIRIT?

Several of the spirit shaman’s abilities affect spirits. For purposes

of the spirit shaman’s ability, a “spirit” includes any of

the following creatures:

• All incorporeal undead

• All fey

• All elementals

• Creatures in astral form or with astral bodies (but not a

creature physically present on the Astral Plane)

• All creatures of the spirit subtype (see *Oriental Adventures*)

• Spirit folk and telthors (see *Unapproachable East*)

• Spirit creatures created by spells such as *dream sight* or *wood*

*wose* (see Chapter 7).

In the spirit shaman’s worldview, elementals and fey are simply

spirits of nature, and incorporeal undead are the spirits of the

dead.
