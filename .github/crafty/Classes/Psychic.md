# Psychic
## Overview
Within the mind of any sentient being lies power to rival that of the greatest magical artifact or holy site. By accessing these staggering vaults of mental energy, the psychic can shape the world around her, the minds of others, and pathways across the planes. No place or idea is too secret or remote for a psychic to access, and she can pull from every type of psychic magic. Many methods allow psychics to tap into their mental abilities, and the disciplines they follow affect their abilities. 

**Role**: With a large suite of spells, psychics can handle many situations, but they excel at moving and manipulating objects, as well as reading and inf luencing thoughts. 

**Alignment**: Any. 

**Hit Die**: d6. 

**Starting Wealth**: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp). 

**CLASS SKILLS** 

The psychic’s class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). 

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier. 

**CLASS FEATURES** 

The following are the class features of the psychic. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A psychic is proficient with all simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield. 

**Spells**: A psychic casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class’s spell list (see page 69). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a psychic’s spell is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + the psychic’s Intelligence modifier. 

A psychic can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–7: Psychic. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 on page 17 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*). 

The psychic’s selection of spells is limited. A psychic begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the psychic’s choice. At each new psychic level, she learns one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1–8: Psychic Spells Known. Unlike a psychic’s spells per day, the number of spells a psychic knows isn’t affected by her Intelligence score; the numbers on Table 1–8 are fixed. 

At 4th level and every even-numbered level thereafter (6th, 8th, and so on), a psychic can choose to learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the psychic loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell from the psychic’s class list that the psychic can cast. A psychic can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. 

A psychic need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. 

**Knacks**: Psychics learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 1–8. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they don’t consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots (due to metamagic feats, for example) consume spell slots as normal. 

**Phrenic Pool (Su)**: A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum number of points in a psychic’s phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours don’t need to be consecutive. The psychic might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess of the pool’s maximum are lost. 

**Phrenic Amplifications**: A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplif ications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell’s effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification’s description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can’t be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can’t be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function. 

*Complex Countermeasure (Ex)*: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were *nondetection*, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115544 5115544 5115544 455608 455608 455608 61 

is cast and lasts for the spell’s duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell’s DCs by 4. 

*Conjured Armor (Su)*: By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 def lection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level. 

*Defensive Prognostication (Su)*: When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell’s level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells. 

*Focused Force (Su)*: When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell’s damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell’s damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can’t be amplified in this way. 

*Intense Focus (Ex)*: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus. 

*Mindshield (Su)*: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can’t grant different bonuses to different targets. 

*Mindtouch (Su)*: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target’s mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of *detect thoughts*). If the linked spell doesn’t already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell’s level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target’s thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect. 

*Ongoing Defense (Su)*: The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any *intellect* 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115545 5115545 5115545 455609 455609 455609 62 

*fortress*, *mental barrier*, *thought shield*, or *tower of iron will* spell to extend the spell’s duration by 1 round. 

*Overpowering Mind (Ex)*: The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw. 

*Relentless Casting (Su)*: The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check. 

*Undercast Surge (Su)*: When the psychic undercasts a spell (see page 144), she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell’s effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can’t use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows *mind thrust III* but not *mind thrust IV* could cast *mind thrust II* and spend 2 points to treat it as *mind thrust III*, but couldn’t spend 4 points to treat it as *mind thrust IV*. This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast. 

*Will of the Dead (Su)*: Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic’s mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature’s immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren’t undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor. 

**Psychic Discipline (Ex or Sp)**: Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental state. This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at 1st level; once made, it can’t be changed. Each psychic discipline gives the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels), and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic’s level + the psychic’s Intelligence modifier. 

At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th

level and every 2 levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1–8. Spells learned from a discipline can’t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. 

Specific psychic disciplines are further described starting on page 64. 

**Detect Thoughts (Sp)**: At 2nd level, a psychic can use *detect thoughts* as a spell-like ability once per day. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast *detect thoughts*. If she does so, she uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will save DC. When a psychic gains this ability, if she knows *detect thoughts,* she can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of *detect thoughts*, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one. 

**Telepathic Bond (Sp)**: At 9th level, a psychic can use *telepathic bond* as a spell-like ability once per day, using her psychic level as her caster level. She can’t leave herself out of a bond created in this way. She can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast *telepathic bond*. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the psychic can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. For instance, if the psychic knows Extend Spell, she can use a 5th-level spell slot to cast extended *telepathic bond* as a full-round action. When a psychic who knows *telepathic bond* gains this ability, she can learn a different 4th-level spell in place of *telepathic bond*, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one. 

**Major Amplifications**: At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification. 

*Dispelling Pulse (Su)*: The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it’s affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted *dispel magic* spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell’s level or lower. If the linked spell doesn’t already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell’s level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object. 

*Dual Amplification (Ex)*: When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can’t apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects. 

*Mimic Metamagic (Ex)*: When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell’s level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell’s level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell’s casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn’t quicken a 2nd-level spell because she’s unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn’t require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time. 

*Space-rending Spell (Su)*: The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as *dimension door*). The maximum number

of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell’s level. 

*Subordinate Spell (Ex)*: The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can’t be lower than 5th level and can’t take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can’t add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell’s casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell’s level – 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell’s level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic’s spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check. 

*Synaptic Shock (Su)*: The psychic manipulates an enemy’s mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell’s targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification). 

*Turning Shield (Su)*: The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that def lects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell’s level to gain the benefit of *spell turning* for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell. 

**Telepathy (Su)**: At 17th level, the psychic can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as both speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. When a psychic who knows *telepathy* (see page 189) gains this ability, she can learn a different 5th-level spell in place of *telepathy*, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one. 

**Remade Self (Sp)**: At 20th level, the psychic is affected by one of the following spells as a constant spell-like ability: *arcane sight*, *f ly*, *haste*, *heroism*, *nondetection*, or *tongues*. This ability is chosen when the psychic reaches 20th level and can’t be changed. While the psychic is under the effects of this spell-like ability, each time she casts a psychic spell, she can link one phrenic amplification or major amplification she knows that has a point cost of 1 to that spell without spending any points from her phrenic pool. This amplification is in addition to the normal maximum of one amplification per spell. 

**PSYCHIC DISCIPLINES** 

The following disciplines represent those most commonly chosen by psychics. Followers of a discipline might come to it in a variety of different ways, and though some might join together in orders, others follow personal, singular interpretations of the discipline. Spells with an asterisk (\*) appear in Chapter 4 of this book. 

Abomination 

Your mind is impure, tainted by outside forces. These might be monstrous ancestors whose blood still f lows within you, or powerful and unknowable psychic forces that intrude upon your mind. Like a psychic disease, this inf luence consumes part of your brain, creating a dark counterpart to your normal self. Every time you call forth a psychic spell, you’re drawing on this dangerous force—and potentially giving it a greater hold on you. This malign inf luence might stem from creatures like rakshasas and aboleths, or perhaps malign entities that dwell in the voids between the stars. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Charisma. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Ray of enfeeblement* (1st), *alter self* (4th), *excruciating deformation*UM (6th), *black tentacles* (8th), *explode head*\* (10th), *repulsion* (12th), *insanity* (14th), *orb of the void*UM (16th), *telekinetic storm*\* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers allow the dark inf luences to take over, and it can be difficult to come back from the brink. 

*Dark Half (Su)*: By allowing the dark forces to overcome you, you can enter a state of instinctual cruelty as a swift action. While you’re manifesting your dark half, you increase the DCs of your psychic spells by 1, gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and become immune to fear effects. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage while manifesting your dark half, you can cause one creature that took damage from the spell to also take 1 point of bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage increases to 2 points at 5th level and to 1d6 points at 13th level. While manifesting your dark half, you can’t use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration other than casting spells using psychic magic, using phrenic amplifications, or attempting to return to normal. You can attempt to return to your normal self as a free action, but must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If you fail, you continue to manifest 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115548 5115548 5115548 455612 455612 455612 65 

your dark half and can’t attempt to change back for 1 round. You can manifest your dark half for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your psychic level + your Charisma modifier; when these rounds are expended, you return to your normal self without requiring a concentration check. 

*Morphic Form (Ex)*: At 5th level, while manifesting your dark half, you gain DR 5. This damage reduction can be overcome by a random type of damage each time you manifest your dark half, determined by rolling on the table below. 

**d% Damage Reduction** 

1–35 DR 5/bludgeoning 

36–60 DR 5/cold iron 

61–100 DR 5/magic 

*Psychic Safeguard (Su)*: At 13th level, you project constant mental defenses, gaining spell resistance equal to 8 + your caster level. While manifesting your dark half, this spell resistance increases to 16 + your caster level. 

Dream 

You discover deeper and more powerful corners of your mind through journeys you make in your dreams. Your consciousness expands outward into other dreaming minds, allowing you to explore the psychic landscapes of unconsciousness or regions of nightmare and horror. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Charisma. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Sleep* (1st), *oneiric horror*\* (4th), *deep slumber* (6th), *sleepwalk*APG (8th), *nightmare* (10th), *cloak of dreams*APG (12th), *ethereal jaunt* (14th), *dream voyage*\* (16th), *microcosm*\* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your mind can powerfully inf luence dreaming consciousnesses. 

*Dream Leech (Su)*: While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature’s dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day. 

*Oneiromancy (Su)*: As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature’s mind by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping creature’s attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill. The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent to the sleeping creature to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of *dream, minor dream*ARG*,* or *nightmare.* In this case, the oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this effect. 

*Mind Heist (Sp)*: At 5th level, you can delve into the subconscious mind of a sleeping target. You can cast *detect thoughts* as a spell-like ability on any adjacent sleeping creature. Additionally, you can gain the benefit of *detect thoughts* on a target of your *dream, minor dream*ARG*,* or *nightmare* spells as if you had studied the target for 3 rounds. If you cast *dream scan* (see page 166), you know whether you received false information from the dream. A successful Will save negates mind heist. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. 

*Waking Dream (Sp)*: At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability functions like *magic jar*, except that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no receptacle necessary and the target creature’s consciousness remains dreaming and unaware of its body’s actions. When waking dream ends or the host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn’t been destroyed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Creatures that don’t dream are immune to this effect. 

Faith 

Your belief in a higher power fuels your psychic abilities. Whether your mental abilities truly come to you as a divine gift or are simply enhanced by the power of your belief, none can say. In many ways, you resemble a divine caster, and prayers often factor into your casting of psychic spells. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Wisdom. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Bless* (1st), *spiritual weapon* (4th), *magic vestment* (6th), *guardian of faith*ACG (8th), *commune* (10th), *psychic surgery*\* (12th), *greater scrying* (14th), *greater planar ally* (16th), *miracle* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers serve to protect or cure you and your allies. 

*Deity (Ex)*: At 1st level, choose a deity to worship. Your alignment must remain within one step of your deity’s 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115549 5115549 5115549 455613 455613 455613 66 

or you lose access to all this discipline’s bonus spells and discipline powers. 

*Divine Energy*: You can channel spell energy into cure or inf lict spells. This ability functions similarly to the cleric’s ability to spontaneously cast cure or inf lict spells, and the type of spells you can convert depends on your alignment in the same way. The cure or inf lict spells don’t count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects. Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast. Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

*Resilience of the Faithful (Su)*: At 5th level, you gain a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels you possess beyond 5th. 

*Prayer Aura (Su)*: At 13th level, as a free action, you can extend an aura around you to bolster your allies and make your enemies less effective. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds don’t need to be consecutive. This functions as the *prayer* spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a –1 penalty on your enemies’ rolls of those types. If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to –2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn’t change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic). 

Lore 

By collecting expert information and reading all sorts of treatises and chapbooks on occult subjects, you learn proper techniques and rituals to empower your mental abilities. Your abilities become stronger through study and science, not instinct. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Wisdom. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Comprehend languages* (1st), *hypercognition*\* (4th), *dispel magic* (6th), *mind probe*\* (8th), *retrocognition*\* (10th), *legend lore* (12th), *greater arcane sight* (14th), *moment of prescience* (16th), *divide mind*\* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers relate to your extensive knowledge and your ability to alter and adapt your memory. 

*Illuminating Answers (Su)*: You can glean deeper truths from advice you magically obtain, even if the information itself is specious. When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as *augury*, *blood biography*APG, or *contact other plane*) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

*Mnemonic Cache (Su)*: You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes’ worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn’t confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn’t go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn’t confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you’re in telepathic contact with another creature (through *telepathic bond*, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity. 

You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as *explosive runes* or *sepia snake sigil*) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can’t destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved. 

*Superior Automatic Writing (Ex)*: At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you’d used *commune* instead of *augury* or *divination*. This type of *commune* requires no material 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115550 5115550 5115550 455614 455614 455614 67 

component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity. 

*Memory Palace (Su)*: At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you’ve studied. This ability functions as *mage’s magnificent mansion*, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn’t contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of *unseen servants* equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn’t need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day. 

Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within—including you—a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you’re not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn’t in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace’s library bonuses apply. 

Pain 

Mental blocks prevent your immense inborn psychic energies from f lowing freely. They are unleashed only when you suffer pain. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Charisma. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Persuasive goad*UM (1st), *pain strike*APG (4th), *vampiric touch* (6th), *mass pain strike*APG (8th), *synapse overload*\* (10th), *mass inf lict pain*\* (12th), *waves of exhaustion* (14th), *horrid wilting* (16th), *mass suffocation*APG (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers allow you to cause and endure pain. 

*Painful Reminder (Su)*: As a swift action, you can cause an enemy to take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if you dealt damage to that enemy with a spell since the start of your previous turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 8th level and to 3d6 at 15th level. 

*Power from Pain (Su)*: If your painful reminder deals at least 5 points of damage, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

*Live On (Sp)*: At 5th level, you can use lay on hands as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You also gain access to mercies as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You can target only yourself with lay on hands or mercies gained from this discipline. This stacks with lay on hands abilities gained from other sources. 

*Agonizing Wound (Su)*: At 13th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can also make that creature frightened or sickened (your choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. If you expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting painUM effect. 

Psychedelia 

You ingest hallucinogens to expand your mind. Experimentation and study show you which ones will have the greatest effect. Your psychedelic forays put you into a different mental space from others, and normal people don’t really understand you. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Wisdom. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Polypurpose panacea*UM (1st), *mad hallucination*UM (4th), *synesthesia*\* (6th), *confusion* (8th), *mirage arcana* (10th), *joyful rapture*UM (12th), *waves of ecstasy*UM (14th), *euphoric tranquility*APG (16th), *astral projection* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: You distort your own mind and perceptions, and can impress your altered states onto others. 

*Drug Resistance (Ex)*: When you ingest drugs, you take half as much ability damage (minimum 1). You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming addicted to a drug or to overcome being addicted (*Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide* 236). 

*Cognatogen (Su)*: Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per psychic level. In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a –2 penalty to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist’s mutagen ability (*Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide* 28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115551 5115551 5115551 455615 455615 455615 68 

attempt if he drinks your cognatogen. If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery. 

*Warped Brain (Su)*: At 5th level, your mind becomes difficult to comprehend. When another creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you, that creature must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it becomes nauseated for 1 round. This ability triggers even if you succeed at your save (or are otherwise unaffected by the spell or ability), but doesn’t apply if you’re a willing subject of the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect. 

*Hallucinogenic Aura (Su)*: At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that fails its save doesn’t need to continue making saves while it’s confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You’re immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose’s effects last for 1 month. 

Rapport 

Forging a close bond with other people brings out the best in you, making it easier for you to link your mind with theirs. Through bonding your psyche with another person, you’re able to fill in your own mental gaps and develop new psychic powers. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Charisma. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Charm person* (1st), *enthrall* (4th), *coordinated effort*APG (6th), *lesser geas* (8th), *telepathy*\* (10th), *battlemind link*UM (12th), *mass hold person* (14th), *mass charm monster* (16th), *overwhelming presence*UM (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers meld several minds together, or allow you to more easily inf luence others. 

*Emotional Bond (Su)*: You can create an empathic link between yourself and your allies, allowing you to monitor their emotional states. Setting up the link requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration from you and all subjects, who must remain within 10 feet of you. You can link with a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier. This bond lasts until the next time you regain your spells, or until you go unconscious or voluntarily end the bond as a free action. If the bond ends, you can establish a new bond at will with another 10 minutes of mutual concentration. This link allows you to monitor emotions, detecting when allies become angry, surprised, confused, fearful, or the like, but doesn’t allow them to communicate specific details. You can also easily tell whether a subject is unconscious. If a subject dies or moves to a different plane than you, your bond with that creature is severed. The distance between you and the subjects doesn’t affect the bond as long as you’re on the same plane of existence. At 4th level, the bond also gives you the benefits of the *status* spell with all subjects of the emotional bond. 

*Emotional Push (Su)*: You can draw upon the intense power of your own emotions in desperate situations, and your allies can call upon you through your emotional link to protect themselves. When you or a subject of your emotional bond must attempt a saving throw, the person attempting the save can gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on the save as an immediate action. This ability can be used once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 psychic levels you possess. Allies using this ability don’t need your permission, since the emotional connection is so direct, though you know when one of the uses has been expended. If the ally’s saving throw is successful, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. 

*Share Memory (Sp)*: At 5th level, you can use *share memory*UM at will, but only with a willing target. 

*Team Player (Ex)*: At 5th level and 13th level, you gain a bonus teamwork feat. 

*Shared Skill (Ex)*: At 13th level, each time you set up an emotional bond, you can choose one Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill from the list of psychic’s class skills. Any subject of your bond can use your bonus instead of his own when attempting checks with that skill as long as the bond lasts. 

Self-Perfection 

You take a holistic view of psychic power, believing that you must hone both your mental and physical attributes to remain in balance. The focus you find while exercising, fasting, and otherwise tending to your body broadens your psychic powers. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Wisdom. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Expeditious retreat* (1st), *bear’s endurance* (4th), *haste* (6th), *freedom of movement* (8th), *echolocation*UM (10th), *transformation* (12th), *ethereal jaunt* (14th), *iron body* (16th), *akashic form*\* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your powers alter your body through your force of will. 

*AC Bonus (Ex)*: When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus (if any) to your AC and CMD. The bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you’re f lat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you’re immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, when you carry a shield, or when you carry a medium or heavy load. 

*Physical Push (Su)*: By channeling your psychic energy, you can make your body capable of greater physical feats. 

Occult Adventures (Paizo) *paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015 paizo.com #2227320, Mike Tortoriello <dth_gaurd@yahoo.com>, Aug 3, 2015* 5115552 5115552 5115552 455616 455616 455616 69 

When you attempt a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Constitution-based ability check or skill check, you can gain a bonus on the check equal to your Wisdom bonus. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is part of the action used to attempt the skill check (if any). If you succeed at the check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. 

*Bodily Purge (Su)*: You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of *lesser restoration* (affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of *neutralize poison*, *remove disease*, or *restoration* (affecting yourself only). To use *restoration* to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects. 

*Pure Body (Ex)*: At 13th level, you gain immunity to diseases and poisons. 

Tranquility 

Psychic magic f lows through you when you attain a peaceful mental state. Regular meditation expands your mind, allowing new powers to develop. 

**Phrenic Pool Ability**: Wisdom. 

**Bonus Spells**: *Telempathic projection*\* (1st), *silence* (4th), *mantle of calm*ACG (6th), *mass daze*UM (8th), *serenity*UM (10th), *psychic surgery*\* (12th), *mind blank* (14th), *euphoric tranquility*APG (16th), *time stop* (18th). 

**Discipline Powers**: Your stable mind protects you and your allies. 

*Mental Placidity (Su)*: As an immediate action, you can gain a +2 bonus on a Will saving throw you are about to attempt. This bonus increases to +4 against an enchantment spell or effect. Any ally who attempts a saving throw against the same effect gains a +1 bonus on the Will save, or a +2 bonus if the effect is an enchantment. If you succeed at the saving throw, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

*Calming Presence (Su)*: At 5th level, you become a calming force. You can use *calm emotions* as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. 

*Purge Disquiet (Su)*: At 13th level, you can banish mental distress. You become immune to fear spells and effects and to the confused condition. As a standard action, you can choose a willing creature that is either within 30 feet or in telepathic contact with you. For 1 round per psychic level you possess, you suppress any fear effect or confused, cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken condition affecting that creature. You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you previously chose. 

**PSYCHIC SPELLS** 

Psychics gain access to the following spells. Many of these spells are found in the *Core Rulebook*; the spells marked with an asterisk (\*) appear in Chapter 4 of this book, and those that are found elsewhere are marked with superscript abbreviations denoting their source. The psychic casts all spells as psychic spells.
