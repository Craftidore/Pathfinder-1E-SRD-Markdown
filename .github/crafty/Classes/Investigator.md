# Investigator
## Overview
Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove,

or a criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by

an intense curiosity about the world and use knowledge

of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness into

a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of

surprises. Observing the world around them, they gain

valuable knowledge about the situation they’re in, process

that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut

to the quick of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators

are always evaluating situations they encounter, sizing up

potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers, all while

using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to

find solutions to the most perplexing problems.

**Role**: Investigators live to solve mysteries and find

inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors

and support for their adventuring parties, but can take

center stage when knowledge and cunning are needed.

No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise

attacks and use inspiration to bring those attacks home.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

**Parent Classes**: Alchemist and rogue.

**Starting Wealth**: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp).

The investigator’s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex),

Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int),

Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha),

Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha),

Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis),

Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis),

Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Stealth (Dex), and

**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the investigator.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Investigators are

proficient with simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow,

rapier, sap, shortbow, short sword, and sword caneUE.

They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.

**Alchemy (Su)**: Investigators are highly trained in the

creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical

potionlike extracts.

When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical

item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal

to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an

investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as

if using *detect magic*. He must hold the potion for 1 round

to attempt such a check.

Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells

by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own

magical power into a number of extracts, and then

effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These

extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to

their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form,

and as such their effects can be dispelled by *dispel magic*

and similar effects, using the investigator’s level as the

caster level.

An investigator can create only a certain number of

extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment

of extracts per day is given on Table 1–8: Investigator. In

addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high

Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus

spells per day.

When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the

chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned

from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become

inert if it leaves the investigator’s possession, reactivating

as soon as it returns to his keeping—an investigator cannot

normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract,

once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its

magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every

day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.

Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the

cost of those materials is insignificant—comparable

to the valueless material components of most spells. If

a spell normally has a costly material component, that

component is expended during the consumption of that

particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells

that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate

divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.

An investigator uses the alchemist formula list

(*Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide* 32) to determine

the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an

extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract,

an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score

equal to 10 + the extract’s level. The saving throw DC for

an investigator’s extract is equal to 10 + the extract’s level

+ the investigator’s Intelligence modif ier.

An investigator may know any number of formulae.

He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula

book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares

an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1stlevel

formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional

formulae equal to his Intelligence modif ier. At each new

investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level

that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae

to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook,

using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A

formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator

can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that

is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard,

however, cannot learn spells from a formula book.

An investigator can also learn formulae from another

investigator’s or an alchemist’s formula book (and vice

versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane

writing before copying that formulae.

**Inspiration (Ex)**: An investigator is beyond knowledgeable

and skilled—he also possesses keen powers of observation

and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An

investigator typically uses these powers to aid in their

investigations, but can also use these f lashes of inspiration

in other situations.

An investigator has the ability to augment skill checks

and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration.

The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his

investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum

1). An investigator’s inspiration pool refreshes each day,

typically after he gets a restful night’s sleep. As a free

action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his

pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any

on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the

check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An

investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll.

The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge,

Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending

a use of inspiration, provided he’s trained in the skill.

Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving

throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration

each time from the investigator’s pool. In the case of saving

throws, using inspiration is an immediate action rather

than a free action.

**Trapfinding**: An investigator adds 1/2 his level to

Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable

Device checks (minimum 1). An investigator can use Disable

Device to disarm magical traps.

**Poison Lore (Ex)**: An investigator has a deep

understanding and appreciation for poisons. At 2nd level, he

cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison

to a weapon. If the investigator spends 1 minute physically

examining the poison, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature)

check to identify any natural poison or Knowledge (arcana)

check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison’s

saving throw DC). Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can

spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC =

the poison’s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the

poison. Success renders the dose harmless. The investigator

has no chance of accidentally poisoning himself when

examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.

**Poison Resistance (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an investigator

gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison.

This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th

level. At 11th level, the investigator becomes completely

immune to poison.

**Investigator Talent (Ex or Su)**: At 3rd level and every

2 levels thereafter, an investigator gains an investigator

talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator

talent can only be selected once.

Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (\*) add effects

to an investigator’s studied combat or studied strike. Only

one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack,

but the decision can be made when the damage is dealt.

*Alchemist Discovery (Ex)*: The investigator can select one

of the following alchemist discoveries as an investigator

talent: combine extracts, concentrate poison, dilution,

elixir of life, enhance potion, eternal potion, extend potion,

infusion, mutagenUM, and poison conversionUC. When

selecting an alchemist discovery, he must be high enough

level to qualify for that discovery, using his investigator

level as his alchemist level to determine if he qualifies. This

talent can be selected multiple times; each time grants a

new alchemist discovery.

*Amazing Inspiration (Ex)*: When using inspiration, the

investigator rolls a d8 instead of a d6. At 20th level, the

investigator rolls 2d8 and adds both dice to the result. An

investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.

*Blinding Strike\* (Ex)*: When the investigator deals

damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed

at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently blinded.

A successful saving throw reduces this to dazzled for 1d4

rounds. The DC for this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + 1/2

the investigator’s level + his Intelligence modifier. This

talent has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes

for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although

multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM’s

discretion). Blindness can be cured by *heal, regeneration,*

*remove blindness,* or similar abilities. An investigator must

be at least 17th level to select this talent.

*Combat Inspiration (Ex)*: When an investigator uses

inspiration on an attack roll or saving throw, he expends

one use of inspiration instead of two. An investigator must

be at least 9th level to select this talent.

*Confusing Strike\* (Ex)*: When the investigator deals

damage with studied strike, the opponent must succeed

at a Fortitude saving throw or become confused for 1d4+1

rounds. A successful saving throw reduces the duration

to 1 round. The DC for this Fortitude save is equal to 10

+ 1/2 the investigator’s level + his Intelligence modifier.

Constructs, mindless creatures, oozes, plants, undead,

incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical

hits are not affected by this ability. An investigator must

be at least 19th level to select this talent.

*Deafening Strike\* (Ex)*: When an investigator deals damage

with studied strike, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude

saving throw or be permanently deafened. A successful

Fortitude saving throw reduces the duration of this effect

to 1 round. The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the

investigator’s level + his Intelligence modifier. This talent

has no effect on deaf creatures. Deafness can be cured by

*heal*, *regeneration*, *remove blindness*, or similar effects. An

investigator must be at least 15th level to select this talent.

*Device Talent (Ex)*: The investigator can use the Use

Magic Device skill even if not trained in that skill. If the

investigator is trained in Use Magic Device, he can use

the inspiration ability with that skill without expending

uses of inspiration.

*Effortless Aid (Ex)*: The investigator can use an aid another

action as a move action instead of as a standard action. An

investigator can expend one use of inspiration to instead

perform an aid another action as a swift action.

*Eidetic Recollection (Su)*: An investigator can always choose

to take 10 on any of his Knowledge checks, even if he’s in

immediate danger or distracted. An investigator may

expend one use of inspiration to take 20 on a Knowledge

skill check even if he’s in immediate danger or distracted.

An investigator must be at least 11th level to select this talent.

*Empathy (Ex, Su)*: When attempting a Sense Motive check,

the investigator makes two d20 rolls and takes the higher

result. If an investigator uses inspiration on a Sense Motive

check, he rolls the inspiration dice twice and takes the

higher result. Once per day, the investigator can expend

one use of inspiration to target a single creature that he can

see and hear within 30 feet. Upon doing so, the investigator

detects the surface thoughts of the target’s mind, as if he

concentrated for 3 rounds while using the *detect thoughts* spell,

unless the creature succeeds a Will saving throw. The DC of

this save is 10 + 1/2 the investigator’s level + his Intelligence

modifier. If the target fails, the investigator can continue

to detect the surface thoughts of the target creature for a

number of rounds equal to 1/2 his investigator level. An

investigator must be at least 5th level to select this talent.

*Expanded Inspiration (Ex)*: An investigator can use his

inspiration ability when attempting Diplomacy, Heal,

Perception, Profession, and Sense Motive checks without

expending uses of inspiration, provided he’s trained in

the skill.

*Greater Combat Inspiration (Ex)*: Choose a single weapon

type (such as sword cane or short sword). As long as the

investigator has at least 1 inspiration point in his inspiration

pool, he no longer has to expend a use of inspiration to

use that ability with attacks made with this weapon. An

investigator must have the combat inspiration investigator

talent and be at least 19th level to select this talent.

*Hidden Agendas (Ex)*: An investigator learns to obscure

his thoughts and endeavors from prying eyes and even

intrusive magic. When an investigator uses inspiration

while attempting a Bluff check to pass secret messages

or attempting a Linguistics check to create forgeries, he

can roll his inspiration dice twice and take the higher

result. In addition, the investigator can use inspiration

when attempting a saving throw against a divination

spell or effect without expending a use of inspiration. An

investigator must be at least 11th level to select this talent.

*Inspirational Expertise (Ex):* When an investigator succeeds

at a Knowledge check to identify a monster’s special powers

or vulnerabilities, he can expend one use of inspiration as

a swift action to grant allies within 30 feet that can hear

him a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against that monster

or type of monster for 1 round. An investigator must be at

least 7th level to take this talent.

*Inspired Alertness (Ex)*: Whenever the investigator becomes

f lat-footed, he can expend one use of inspiration to ignore

that condition. He must be conscious to do so, and must

decide to do so when he becomes f lat-footed. Using this

ability doesn’t require an action.

*Inspired Intelligence (Ex)*: An investigator can add his

inspiration die to all Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft

checks without expending a use of inspiration, even those

he’s not trained in.

*Inspired Intimidator (Ex)*: When the investigator succeeds

at an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent, he can

expend one use of inspiration to automatically increase

the result of the check by 5 for the purpose of determining

the duration of the demoralize effect. He can choose to

spend multiple uses to inspiration in this manner to

further increase the duration of the demoralize effect.

He must be trained in Intimidate to take this talent. The

underworld inspiration investigator talent has no effect

on this talent.

*Item Lore (Ex)*: An investigator can use Spellcraft to

identify the properties and command words of magic

items without the use of *detect magic* or similar spells. An

investigator must be at least 7th level to take this talent.

*Perceptive Tracking (Ex)*: The investigator can use

Perception instead of Survival to both f ind and follow

tracks, using the same DCs listed under the Survival skill

(*Core Rulebook* 107). An investigator must be trained in

Perception to select this talent.

*Quick Study (Ex)*: An investigator can use his studied

combat ability as swift action instead of a standard action.

*Repositioning Strike\* (Ex)*: When the investigator deals

damage with studied strike, he can perform a repositionAPG

combat maneuver as a free action against the creature

damaged by studied strike. This reposition does not

provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be

at least 13th level to select this talent.

*Rogue Talent (Ex)*: An investigator can select one of

the following rogue talents in place of an investigator

talent: assault leaderAPG, black market connectionsUC,

camouf lageAPG, canny observerAPG, charmerAPG, coax

informationAPG, combat swipeAPG, convincing liarUC,

cunning triggerAPG, deft palmUC, expert leaperAPG, fast

fingersAPG, fast getawayAPG, fast picksAPG, fast stealth, firearm

trainingUC, guileful polyglotAPG, gritUC, hard to foolAPG,

hold breathUC, honeyed wordsAPG, iron gutsUC, lasting

poisonAPG, ledge walker, major magic, minor magic, nimble

climberAPG, peerless maneuverAPG, quick disable, quick

disguiseAPG, quick trapsmithAPG, resilience, rogue crawl,

rope masterUC, stand up, strong strokeUC, terrain masterUC,

trap spotter, or wall scramblerUC. Any talent effects based

on rogue level use the investigator’s class level. If the rogue

talent has a prerequisite (such as the major magic rogue

talent requiring the minor magic talent), the investigator

must fulfill the prerequisite before selecting that rogue

talent. This talent can be selected multiple times; each

time, it grants the investigator a new rogue talent.

*Sapping Offensive\* (Ex)*: When the investigator damages

a studied target, that creature cannot make attacks of

opportunity for 1 round. An investigator must be at least

5th level to select this talent.

*Sickening Offensive\* (Ex)*: When the investigator damages

a studied target, that creature is also sickened for 1 round.

An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.

*Stealing Strike\* (Ex)*: When the investigator deals damage

with studied strike, he can perform a stealAPG combat

maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged

by studied strike. This steal does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. An investigator must be at least 13th level to

select this talent.

*Studied Defense (Ex)*: When an investigator with this talent

uses his studied combat ability, he can chose to apply that

ability’s insight bonus to his AC against attacks made by

the target of his studied combat instead of to attack rolls

against the target of his studied combat. (The insight

bonus on damage rolls remains.) He must choose which

type of bonus he gains when using studied combat, and it

cannot be changed until he uses studied combat again. An

investigator must be at least 9th level to select this talent.

*Tenacious Inspiration (Ex)*: When an investigator rolls his

inspiration die, he can roll an additional inspiration die

and take the higher result. The investigator must at least

13th level to select this talent.

*Toppling Strike\** (Ex): When the investigator deals

damage with studied strike, he can perform a trip combat

maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged

by studied strike. This trip does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. An investigator must be at least 9th level to

select this talent.

*Unconventional Inspiration (Ex)*: An investigator can pick

any one skill that he is trained in but that he can’t use his

inspiration with. He can use inspiration with that skill. An

investigator must be at least 17th level to select this talent.

*Underworld Inspiration (Ex)*: An investigator can use his

inspiration on Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate,

or Sleight of Hand checks without expending uses of

inspiration, provided he’s trained in the skill.

**Keen Recollection**: At 3rd level, an investigator can

attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.

**Trap Sense (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an investigator gains

an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps,

granting him a +1 bonus on Ref lex saving throws to avoid

traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps.

At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses

increase by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).

**Studied Combat (Ex)**: With a keen eye and

calculating mind, an investigator can assess

the mettle of his opponent to take advantage of gaps in

talent and training. At 4th level, an investigator can use

a move action to study a single enemy that he can see.

Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an

insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on

damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for

a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modif ier

(minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied

strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls

is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

An investigator can only have one target of studied

combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target

of an investigator’s studied combat, he cannot become the

target of the same investigator’s studied combat again

for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of

inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.

**Studied Strike (Ex)**: At 4th level, an investigator can

choose to make a studied strike against the target of his

studied combat as a free action, upon successfully hitting

his studied target with a melee attack, to deal additional

damage. The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6

for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th

level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage

and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are

immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.

If the investigator’s attack used a weapon that deals

nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike),

he may choose to have the additional damage from studied

strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If

the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal

weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual

–4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal

nonlethal damage.

The investigator must be able to see the target well

enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach

such a spot. An investigator cannot use studied strike

against a creature with concealment.

**Swift Alchemy (Ex)**: At 4th level, an investigator can

create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes

an investigator half the normal amount of time to create

alchemical items. He can also apply poison to a weapon as

a move action instead of a standard action.

**True Inspiration (Ex)**: At 20th level, an investigator can

use inspiration on all skill checks—even ones he isn’t trained

in—and all ability checks without spending inspiration.

In addition, whenever he expends inspiration on an

ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, he

adds 2d6 rather than 1d6 to the result. Some talents can

affect this. If using the amazing inspiration investigator

talent, he rolls 2d8 instead. If using this with empathy,

tenacious inspiration, underworld inspiration, or a similar

talent, he rolls two sets of inspiration dice and uses the

higher of the two results.
