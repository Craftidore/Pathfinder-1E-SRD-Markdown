# Assassin v2
## Overview
*“It’s a good thing Freeport’s nobles are all cowards. Otherwise,*

*I’d be out of a job.”*

—Red Alice, Assassin

The assassin is a killer for hire, a ruthless and remorseless agent whose

purpose is to rub out the opposition. The assassin’s main strengths

come from the element of surprise, because she has no interest in

a fair fight. Such nonsense gives her prey the chance to react and

poses a risk of the mission failing. The best assassins can set aside

their misgivings and eliminate any target, no matter the age, the

gender, or the status.

An assassin’s life is no easy thing and many missions they undertake can

take them to distant cities, into the bowels of the earth, and just about

any place else “adventurers” might go. Rare is the assassin who pursues

adventure for the standard reasons: gold, fame, or notoriety. Instead,

they see such expeditions as a means to end, a mission to advance their

training so they can get back to the business of killing for gold. Of

course, an adventurer’s life is often the perfect cover for the assassin: It

gives her access to powerful people, a steady stream of revenue between

jobs, and a means to slip out of town if a job goes sour.

Creating an Assassin

The assassin is a master of surprise and stealth, of cunning and

underhanded tactics. She does not have the strength of a barbarian or

fighter, the versatility of a bard, or the breadth of skills of a rogue, but

she combines a potent array of combat abilities and skills, augmented

by special talents to give her the edge she needs to survive.

Abilities

An assassin does her job by using the element of surprise and as such

she needs abilities to augment her stealthy skills. Dexterity is by far

her most important ability, as it is vital to her combat capabilities as

well as many of her subterfuge skills. Wisdom is also important since

it reflects her ability to perceive her surrounding, spot hidden guards,

and hear the sounds of approaching foes. Intelligence is another key

ability as it aids the assassin in crafting poisons, sabotaging equipment

and devices, and helping her learn more about the target she’s after.

Races

Any race with the capability to murder, to harness the inherent evil

of the act, can become an assassin. Of the common races, humans

and half-orcs are the most likely. Humans, for all their merits, are

capable of great cruelty and thus produce some of the most infamous

assassins in the world. Half-orcs, with their natural tendencies toward

evil, find it easy to kill for money, a fact especially true for those who

endured unhappy upbringings, enduring the scorn of humanity or

the cruelty of orcs.

Other races are less likely to produce assassins, though when they

do, they are exceptional. The natural stealth and cunning of elves

make them ideal killers, but rare is the elf—excepting, of course,

the drow—who can stomach the business of cold-blooded murder.

Half-elves find it easier to follow this path, but even then, half-elf

assassins are rare.

Dwarf, gnome, and halfling assassins have a number of advantages

over their rivals. A dwarf ’s natural resilience to poison reduces the

risk of accidentally poisoning himself, and his natural hardiness and

combat capabilities make him especially effective in a fight. What

gnomes lack in speed and strength, they make up for in magical talent

and hardiness. They share the dwarf ’s inherent toughness, and also

can spin illusions with incredible skill, masking their approach until

they are ready to strike. Finally, halflings’ natural athleticism and

awareness give them a slew of advantages when taking down their

opponents. In all cases though, none of these races are noted for the

mercilessness required by this grim profession.

Alignment

The assassin’s objective, even when justified, is firmly rooted in evil.

Murder, no matter what the reason, can never be construed otherwise,

and so assassins are never good and nearly all are evil. In exceptionally

rare cases, an assassin might be neutral, but such characters tend to

employ different tactics and may confront their prey head on rather

than skulking about and slipping a knife between the ribs. Chaotic

assassins are paranoid loners, unable to keep their homicidal urges in

check and often ruin their own cover by acting on impulse. Lawful

assassins follow a strict code of who may be killed and when. They

despise slaughter for its own sake, and kill only outside a contract

when they or their immediate masters are threatened.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the assassin.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Assassins are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand

crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. They are proficient

with light armor, but not with shields.

Ambush (Ex)

Assassins are particularly skilled at striking targets unawares.

Whenever assassins attack a flat-footed opponent, they add their

Intelligence bonus (if any) to their attack and damage rolls.

Contract (Ex)

Assassins earn income by accepting commissions to kill a particular

creature or creatures. Whenever they successfully complete a mission

for which they were contracted, they earn an amount of money equal

to their opponent’s Challenge Rating minus their class level × 100

gp (minimum 100 gp or the max gold of the community). However,

they must enter into a contract to gain this gold; simply butchering

commoners will not earn them extra income. To get a contract, they

must name a price and then make a special Diplomacy check adding

their reputation (see following) to the roll. This check requires 2d10

days plus the community’s size modifier. The DC depends on the size

and alignment of the community, as shown on the following tables.

**Community Size DC Max Gold per Job Modifier**

Thorp 50 10 gp +1

Hamlet 45 25 gp +0

Village 40 50 gp –1

Small town 35 200 gp –2

Large town 30 700 gp –3

Small city 25 3,500 gp –4

Large city 20 10,000 gp –5

Metropolis 15 25,000 gp –6

**Alignment DC Modifier**

Lawful good +15

Neutral good +10

Chaotic good +5

Lawful neutral +10

Neutral +5

Chaotic neutral +0

Lawful evil +5

Neutral evil +0

Chaotic evil –5

\* Freeport is considered a neutral small city, while Libertyville counts

as a chaotic neutral village.

Even on a successful check, a target worth the set price may not be

available. The GM is the final arbiter of the possible marks, and it

may take several days before the assassin can track down the target.

Once they get a contract and eliminate the mark, they must wait

1d20 days minus the community’s size modifier before they may

seek out another.

Poison Save (Ex)

Extensive work with poisons and toxins lends assassins you some

natural resilience to their effects. At 1st level, they gain a +1

competence bonus on Fortitude saves against poison. This bonus

increases by one at 4th level and every three levels thereafter as

indicated on **Table 2–1.**

Backstab

The assassin can strike a vital spot when she catches an opponent

when he is unable to defend himself effectively. Her attacks deal

extra damage whenever her opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus

to AC (but *not* when she flanks her opponent). This extra damage is

1d6 at 2nd level, and it increases by +1d6 every three levels thereafter.

Should she score a critical hit with backstab, this extra damage is not

multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as backstabs only if the target

is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, the assassin can use

backstab to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.

The assassin must be able to see the target well enough to pick out

a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Assassins cannot

use backstab against a creature with concealment or when striking

the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

Extra damage from backstab stacks with similar types of extra damage

including sneak attack damage.

Poison Use (Ex)

At 3rd level, assassins complete their training in a variety of poisons

and are never at risk of accidentally poisoning themselves when

applying poison to a weapon.

Tools of the Trade (Ex)

On attaining 3rd level, and at every four levels thereafter, the assassin

gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.

She may only gain each one once.

*Bonus Languages:* Assassins gain fluency in a number of languages

equal to their Intelligence bonus (minimum 1 language). These

languages are in addition to the extra languages gained for having a

high Intelligence score.

*Deep Cover:* If the assassin spends at least one day preparing a disguise,

she gains a +10 competence bonus on Disguise checks.

*Empower Poison:* When crafting a poison, an assassin may increase

the poison’s Craft DC by 10 to increase all variable numeric effects

by one-half so that the poison deals half again as much initial and

secondary damage as it normally would. This tool of the trade does not

affect non-variable effects such as blindness, death, and paralysis.

*Extend Poison:* When crafting a poison, the assassin may increase

the poison’s Craft DC by 5 to delay the onset of the poison’s initial

effects by up to one hour after the target’s initial exposure. The assassin

decides the delay at the time of the poison’s crafting. This tool of the

trade has no effect on the poison’s secondary damage, which occurs

one minute later as usual.

*Maximize Poison:* When crafting a poison, the assassin may increase

the poison’s Craft DC by 20 to modify all of the poison’s variable

numeric effects so that the poison deals the maximum possible value.

This tool of the trade does not affect non-variable effects such as

blindness, death, and paralysis.

*Poison Focus:* Choose one type of poison from any of the following—

contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. When using a poison of this type,

the assassin increases the save DC to resist its initial effects by +1.

*Preternatural Instincts:* The assassin may add her Intelligence bonus

(if any) as a competence bonus on all initiative checks.

*Quick Change:* The assassin may now make a Disguise check in 1d3

× 10 rounds by taking a –5 penalty to the check or in 1 round by

taking a –20 penalty to the check.

*Quicken Poison:* When crafting a poison, the assassin may increase

the poison’s Craft DC by 25 to force a target exposed to the poison

to suffer both the initial and secondary effects at the same time.

The target is still entitled to a separate saving throw to resist both

effects.

*Skill Savant:* Select one of the assassin class skills. The assassin gains

a +5 competence bonus on all checks made using that skill.

*Talented Poisoner:* When manufacturing drugs or poison, for every +5

the assassin adds to the Craft (alchemy) check DC, she may increase

the save DC to resist the poison by 2.

*Weapon Focus:* The assassin gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat.

Shadowspawn (Ex)

The assassin is adept at striking from the shadows, emerging unseen

to deliver a deadly blow and then melting back into the darkness.

Starting at 4th level, she increases the benefits of concealment derived

from low or no illumination by 10%, so that her opponents’ miss

chance when attacking her while in an area of dim light is 30% and

when in areas of darkness, the miss chance is 60%.

Death Attack (Ex)

When the assassin reaches 5th level, she has learned how and where to

strike opponents to kill or paralyze them with a single attack. To use

this ability, the assassin must study her victim for 3 rounds and then

make a backstab with a melee weapon. If the attack deals damage, the

backstab has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing

the target (the assassin’s choice). While studying the victim, the assassin

can undertake other actions so long as her attention stays focused on

the target and the target does not detect her or recognize her as an

enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 the assassin’s class level + his Int modifier) against the kill effect,

he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim

is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per

two class levels. If the victim’s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just

a normal backstab. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of

study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save)

or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of

completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before she

can attempt another death attack.

Reputation (Ex)

An assassin’s reputation as a ruthless killer lends her a great deal of

street credibility and helps her land the lucrative jobs. At 5th level, she

gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks to find “work.” In addition, she

may add this bonus as a competence bonus on all Intimidate checks.

Every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2 (+3 at 10th,

+5 at 15th, and +7 at 20th level).

Uncanny Dodge (Ex)

Starting at 6th level, the assassin can react to danger before her

senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity

bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by

an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to

AC if immobilized.

If the assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she

automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

Ruthless (Ex)

At 7th level, the assassin no longer provokes attacks of opportunity

when making coup de grace attacks. She is quick and business-like

when snuffing the life from a foe. In addition, as a 1 round action,

the assassin can kill her opponent brutally. This functions exactly

like a normal coup de grace attack, but the assassin provokes attacks

of opportunity as normal and the DC to resist this attack increases

by 5.

Greater Poison Use (Ex)

By 9th level, the assassin has learned to apply poison more quickly to

her weapons. She may apply contact or injury poisons to a weapon as

a move action. Alternatively, she may apply these poisons as a swift

action, but the save DC to resist these toxins decreases by 5.

Assassins and Assassins

The assassin class presented in this chapter is intended to replace the assassin prestige class in the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook,* since

both classes fill the same niche, achieve the same ends, and pursue the same goals. The differences, however, between the assassin

prestige class and the base class in this sourcebook are enough that you could retain the prestige class in your games. If you intend

to do so, it’s recommended that you fit the assassin prestige class into a larger organization, an elite group of killers trained in

sorcery to aid them in their missions.

Adjudicating Assassinations

Handling assassinations on the fly can be tricky, requiring you to whip up stat blocks, locations, and all the other minor details with

little or no preparation. This may be more than you, as the GM, are willing or able to handle in the middle of a game session. If a

player wishes to pick up a “job,” feel free to put off resolving the scenario until the next session when you’re ready to deal with the

encounter. As well, you should be aware that the contract ability can give the player more spotlight than you may be comfortable

with giving. If this becomes a problem, you can handle such assassination attempts “off-screen” for minor characters with a simple

class level check against a DC 10 + the target’s CR, consulting the following chart to see what happens.

**Check Result Outcome**

Success by 10 or more Target eliminated. Assassin gains +1 reputation for 1d6 months.

Success by 5 or more Target eliminated. Assassin gains +1 reputation for 1d4 months.

Success Target eliminated. Sloppy work.

Failure Mission failed. Assassin can attempt again, but at a –2 penalty.

Failure by 5 or more Mission botched. Assassin injured, reduced to 50% hit points. Assassin’s reputation suffers a –2 penalty for 1d4

months. May not try again against same target until reputation improves.

Failure by 10 or more Mission utter failure. Assassin captured and imprisoned. Reputation suffers –4 penalty for 1d6 months. May not

try again against same target until reputation improves.

Natural 1 Assassin slain.

Stalker (Ex)

Also at 9th level, when hiding and moving more than half but less

than full speed, the assassin takes no penalty to Stealth checks. When

running (but not when attacking or charging), the penalty to her

Stealth checks drops to –10.

Improved Ambush (Ex)

Starting at 10th level, the assassin may add her Intelligence bonus (if

any) to her attack and damage rolls whenever she flanks an opponent

as well as when she is attacking a flat-footed opponent. In addition,

when making a death attack, she may sacrifice 1d6 points of backstab

damage to increase the save DC to resist the attack by 2.

Uncanny Sniper (Ex)

Whenever the assassin has successfully hidden from an opponent

that is at least 10 feet away, she can make one ranged attack and then

immediately make a Hide check to conceal her position. She takes a

–10 penalty to this check instead of the normal –20.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)

At 12th level, the assassin can no longer be flanked. This defense

denies rogues the ability to use sneak attack (or similar extra damage

effects) against the assassin when they flank her, unless they has at

least four more rogue levels than she has assassin levels.

If the assassin already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second

class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead,

and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to

determine the minimum rogue level required to flank her.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)

Beginning at 13th level, the assassin can use the Stealth skill even

while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of

shadow, she may hide herself from view in the open without having

anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her

own shadow.

Poison Use Mastery (Ex)

At 15th level, the assassin may apply poison to a weapon as a swift

action without reducing the poison’s save DC. In addition, if she

spends a standard action to apply poison to a weapon, the weapon

retains its virulence for two successful hits or two touches.

Crippling Strike (Ex)

Starting at 16th level, the assassin can backstab opponents with such

precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent

damaged by one of her backstabs also takes 2 points of Strength

damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the

rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.

Blindsense (Ex)

Upon attaining 18th level, the assassin’s senses have become so acute

that she can now notice things she cannot see. She usually does not

need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature

within range of her blindsense ability, provided she has line of effect to

that creature. Any opponent she cannot see still has total concealment

against her, and she still has the normal miss chance when attacking

foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects her movement. The

assassin is still denied her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against

attacks from creatures she cannot see.

Shadow Strike (Ex)

Finally, at 19th level, whenever the assassin successfully kills, disables,

or reduces an opponent’s hit points below 0, she may make a Hide

check as a swift action and move up to 10 feet in any direction. To

use this ability, the assassin must be within 10 feet of a shadow. As

with hide in plain sight, she cannot hide in her own shadow.
