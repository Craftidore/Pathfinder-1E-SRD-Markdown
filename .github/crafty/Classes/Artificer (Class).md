# Artificer (Class)
## Overview
Artificers are the practical technicians of the magical world. Unlike wizards or sorcerers who pursue more theoretical research, or clerics and druids who are tied to the mandates of their deities or churches, artificers take the practice of magic and tailor it to the needs of the situation. From maintaining complex enchantments along lightning rail lines or on board an elemental airship, to customizing the combat enchantments from a strike team deep behind enemy lines, artificers take the magic that is already at hand and applies in a more efficient manner, essentially getting more spell for the silver.  

Role: An artificer takes on the role of a magical item expert, providing much of the flexibility as a wizard, the critical eye of a rogue and combining access to magical effects that the rest of the party would not normally have access to. The artificer is often looked to provide solutions for situations where either brute strength is not enough or the available spells are not appropriate to the task at hand. While they are not incredibly suited for front-line combat, given the proper time to prepare, an artificer's infusions can easily turn the rest of the party into a tailor-made fighting force against their chosen foe.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the artificer.

    Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Artificers are proficient with all simple weapons, all crossbows, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). If the campaign allows for firearms or siege weapons, artificers also also proficient in these weapons as well.

    Infusions: An artificer casts infusions, which are like spells but are neither arcane nor divine. Like spells, artificers have a limited number of infusions per day, based on their level. Similar to other spellcasters, artificers get additional infusions per day based on their Intelligence attribute and regain their infusions per day after a normal 8 hours of rest and 15 minutes of concentration. Like sorcerers and bards, artificers can cast any infusion he knows without preparing them ahead of time, classifying him as a spontaneous spellcaster. However, given how limited his selection is, he automatically knows all infusions on the infusion list of any level he is capable of casting. Should an artificer encounter some rare or ancient infusion that does not appear on the normal infusion list, he can learn it by studying it for 8 hours and making a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + the infusion level. However, this is specifically not intended for artificers to reverse engineer normal spells to become infusions.

    Infusions, like spells, are subject to concentration checks, using the same DCs as normal spellcaster and using his Intelligence modifier to the concentration check. Likewise, infusions have components (verbal, somatic and material) which must be met when casting an infusion. However, the somatic components are simple enough that artificers do not suffer spell chance failure from light or medium armor or from any shield, except tower shields. While rare, infusions that have saving throws have their DC equal to 10 + the infusion level + the artificer's Intelligence modifier. Infusions can be modified by metamagic feats spontaneously with the same alteration to the casting time as sorcerers. Like spells, infusions are identified using Spellcraft checks with same DCs. 

    Where infusions differ from spells is that no infusion qualifies for spells when making magical items or activating items, even if they are functionally similar when cast. For example, even though Light appears as both a spell and an infusion, the artificer does not have Light for the purposes of making magical items or activating a wand of Light.

    Cantrips: An artificer automatically knows all 0-level infusions that appear on the infusion list, but unlike normal infusions, they do not require spell slots and can all be used repeatedly. In all other aspects, they act as normal infusions.

    Artificer's Knowledge: Unlike normal spellcasters, artificers count as both casters and manifesters for the purposes of creating magical and psionic items. Likewise, they can create spell trigger, spell completion, power trigger and power completion items without having the ability to cast the necessary spells or manifest the necessary powers. They still need the necessary item creation feats, but the artificer can continue the item creation process with only a working knowledge of each spell or power needed. When an artificer puts their first rank into Knowledge: Arcana, they are considered to have a working knowledge of all 0th arcane spells from any arcane spell list. The same is also true for Knowledge: Religion and 0th divine spells from any divine spell list and Knowledge: Psionics and 0th level psionic powers from any power list. For each additional two ranks placed into a given skill, the working knowledge of the associated spell or power list increases by one level, to a maximum of 9th level spells or powers at 19 ranks. 

    When determining the spell or power level of a spell or power that appears on multiple lists, search the spells and powers list that have the full 9 levels of spells or powers first (i.e. sorcerer / wizard, cleric / oracle, druid, witch and psion / wilder). If the desired effect is on one or more of those lists, the artificer has the choice of which list to take it from, notating the spell or power level and, in the case of spells, whether it is arcane or divine. If, and only if, the desired effect is not located on any of those lists, check the spells and powers lists that only have 6 levels of spells or powers (i.e. bard, summoner, inquisitor  psychic warrior, etc). If the desired effect is on one or more of those lists, the artificer has the same choice. If, and only if, the desired effect is not located on any of those lists, check the spells and powers lists that only have 4 levels of spells or powers (i.e. paladin, ranger, etc). If the desired effect is one or more of those lists, the artificer has the same choice. If, and only if, the desired effect is not on any of the above lists examined, then the artificer is free to duplicate from whatever spell or power list remaining. The choice of exactly which list the spell or power is taken from will determine the spell or power level mimicked and, in the case of spells, whether or not the effect is arcane or divine. 

    If an artificer needs a spell or power that he does not have a working knowledge of, he can still duplicate it with a successful Use Magic Device check with a DC equal to 20 + twice the spell or power level. Other item creation requirements can also be substituted as well, with the exception of the caster or manifester level. The artificer makes another Use Magic Device check, with the same DC as what is needed to emulate the needed class features, ability scores, race or alignments. Only one check per requirement is allowed. 

    All other aspects of item creation remain following the same rules for item creation (feats required, time, cost, etc). The artificer uses his caster level as either the caster level or manifester level for comparing to the item's requirements. After all Use Magic Device checks have been made, the normal Spellcraft check to actually create the magical or psionic item still needs to be made to see if the item is successfully created. If a spell or power is required for the item creation (like that for scrolls, wands, dorjes, etc) and it is not successfully emulated, the entire item creation process (time and construction cost) is wasted. 

    Thus, attempting to create a Minotaur Belt (a Wondrous Item with a CL of 4, requiring Bull's Strength and Feather Step) has a normal Spellcraft or Craft DC: 19 for someone that did not met either spell prerequisites. However, an artificer that does not have a working knowledge of either spell can make two UMD checks (first for Bull's Strength at a DC of 24, second for Feather Step at a DC of 22) to lower the final Spellcraft or Craft DC to just 9.

    Artisan Bonus: An artificer gains a bonus to all Use Magic Device checks equal to one half his artificer level, round down, to a minimum +1.

    Bonus Feats: As an artificer progresses in level, he gains the following feats as bonus feats. He does not need to qualify for the specified feats listed, but does for any bonus feat he gets to choose. Artificers gain Brew Potion and Scribe Scroll at 1st level, Craft Wondrous Item and Craft Wand at 3rd level, Craft Magic Arms and Armor at 5th level, Forge Ring at 7th level, Craft Rod at 9th level and Craft Staff at 11th level. 

    In addition to these specific feats, at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, artificers gain an additional bonus feat chosen from the following list: any metamagic feat, any item creation feat not already listed (like Craft Construct), Attune Magic Weapon, Extra Ingenuity, Extra Rings, Exceptional Artisan, Extraordinary Artisan, and Wand Mastery.

    Ingenuity: An artificer has a pool of ingenuity points equal to his artificer level plus his Intelligence modifier. This pool refreshes when an artificer regains his infusions for the day. While points from an artificer's ingenuity pool can be spent on other class features, the artificer can also spend a point from his ingenuity pool as part of casting an infusion that has a range of touch and does not involve an attack roll to cast it with close range instead. This increase in range for touch based infusions does not stack with with any other source that alters the range of an infusion.

    Trapfinding: An artificer gains a bonus to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks equal to one half his artificer level, round down, to a minimum +1. An artificer can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps and this feature is in all other ways identical to the rogue's trapfinding ability.

    Rugged Craftsman: At 2nd level, when an artificer is crafting magical items while adventuring on in a dangerous environment, he gains the full benefit of 4 hours per day, rather than the normal 2 hours of work for 4 hours of effort. The amount of gold piece value achieved per hour is still based on the normal 8 hours per day and divided normally. The artificer can also create multiple magical items in single day, provided that the total gold piece value is still within his gold piece limit per day for enchanting.

    Unravel: Starting at 2nd level, the artificer can spend a point of his ingenuity pool to disrupt the magical energies that power magical and psionic items. At 5th level and every three levels thereafter, this ability improves. Unless stated otherwise, assume the artificer class level is the caster level and any saving throw DCs are Intelligence based.

    Suppression (Su): By spending one point of ingenuity and a full-round action that provokes, the artificer can attempt to suppress an unattended magical or psionic item or an unattended object that is the subject of a magical or psionic effect for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier. Doing so requires the artificer to touch the item and succeed in a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the caster or manifester level of the item or the effect on the item. Using this ability on magical or psionic traps causes the trap to be bypassed for as long as it is suppressed. This ability can used to suppress a cursed item, although removing a suppressed cursed item does not always remove the effects of the curse. If the artificer knows the item is cursed before he attempts to suppress it, he is not subject the effects of the cursed item.

    If necessary, the artificer can spend another point of ingenuity as a free action to immediately end the suppression.

    Greater Suppression (Su): At 5th level, the artificer can use his unravel (suppression) ability has a standard action and, if successful, the effect lasts for minutes equal to his Intelligence modifier. Ending the suppression still requires a free action, but does not cost a point of ingenuity. He can also use this ability on attended magical items if successful with a melee touch attack that provokes.

    Dispel (Sp): At 8th level, the artificer can spend one point of ingenuity to cast Dispel Magic as a spell-like ability.

    Greater Dispel (Sp): At 11th level, the artificer can spend one point of ingenuity to cast Greater Dispel Magic as a spell-like ability.

    Area Dispel (Sp): At 14th level, the artificer can spend one point of ingenuity to cast Greater Dispel Magic as a spell-like ability, except that the area dispel option does effect magical and psionic items in the area of effect, using a single caster level check and applying to all such items. If successful, magical and psionic items in the area of effect are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.

    Disjunction (Sp): At 17th level, the artificer can spend ingenuity to cast Mage's Disjunction as a spell-like ability. If the artificer is using the area of effect option, the ingenuity cost is three points. If the artificer is using the single targeted item option, the ingenuity cost is one point for regular magical items, three points for the attempt to disjoin an artifact (with the appropriate risks of destroying an artifact). 

    Item Augmentation: Starting at 3rd level, the artificer can spend some of his ingenuity pool to temporarily enchant or augment existing enchantments. At 6th level and every three levels there after, this ability improves. Unless stated otherwise, assume the artificer class level is the caster level and any saving throw DCs are Intelligence based.

    Charge Storing (Su): At 3rd level, the artificer can spend a number of ingenuity points to temporarily create a wand or dorje with a single charge. The artificer must have a mundane object to put the charge into and the artificer must have a working knowledge of the desired effect, as per his Artificer's Knowledge class ability. The artificer cannot use a Use Magic Device check to duplicate the desired effect as he would use during a normal enchantment process. 

    The wand or dorje can only hold a single charge and the charge only lasts for one minute. However, unlike normal wands and dorjes, the wand or dorje uses the artificer's caster level and uses their Intelligence modifier, at the time of the enchantment, for any saving throw DCs. Likewise, the effect is not limited to 4th level or less. If the desired effect has a material component worth more than 1 gp, however, the material component must be consumed normally during the enchantment.

   The number of ingenuity points necessary is equal to the spell or power level, to a minimum of 1. The desired effect cannot be placed into the temporary wand with any metamagic or metapsionic feat (although see Spell Trigger below) and, in the case of psionic powers, cannot be augmented. This ability always provokes.

    Using this ability starts of as a full-round action. At 6th level, it becomes a standard action. At 9th level, it becomes a move action and at 12th level, it becomes a swift action. Only the artificer can use the charge, using the same rules as using a wand or dorje, but he does not need to make a Use Magic Device check to activate it. 

    Spell Trigger (Su): At 6th level, an artificer can apply any one metamagic or metapsionic feat he knows to a spell or power cast from a spell or power trigger item that could not normally be augmented in this way, such as a wand or dorje. To do this, the artificer must spend a number of ingenuity points equal to 1 plus the spell level adjustment from the metamagic feat, or 1 plus 1/2 the power point cost for a metapsionic feat (round up), to a minimum of 2 points. The maximum number of ingenuity points that can be spent using this ability is equal to one half the number of ranks the artificer has in Use Magic Device, rounded down. Using this ability is part of activating the spell or power trigger item.

    Saving Throws (Su): At 9th, whenever an artificer is using a magical or psionic item that creates one or more effects that requires a saving throw, he can spend one point of ingenuity per effect (not per affected target) to replace the normal saving throw DC of the magical item with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the artificer's level + the artificer's Intelligence Modifier. This ability cannot be used on spell or power trigger items (wands, staves, dorjes, psicrowns, etc) or on spell or power completion items (scrolls, power stones, etc), nor can it be used in constructs. 

     Using this ability is part of activating or releasing the magical or psionic item. If the augmented effect(s) does not get triggered immediately, like in the case of an Alluring Golden Apple, or the effect is sustained for a period of time, the increase to the save DC lasts for 24 hours.

    Spell Completion (Su): At 12th, the artificer can apply any one metamagic or metapsionic feat he knows to a spell or power cast from a spell or power completion item, such as a scroll or power stone. To do this, the artificer spend a number of ingenuity points equal the spell level modifier of the metamagic feat or 1/2 the power point cost of the metapsionic feat (round up). The maximum number of ingenuity points that can be spent using this ability is equal to one half the number of ranks the artificer has in Use Magic Device, rounded down. Using this ability is part of the same action as using the spell or power completion item.

    Recharge (Su): At 15th level, an artificer can recharge certain enchanted items by spending ingenuity points. Only items that can be recharged normally, like staves and psicrowns, can be recharged by the artificer and regardless of the type of item recharged, it takes a standard action that provokes and the artificer must be wielding or wearing the item. If the item is recharged by sacrificing spell slots, the amount of ingenuity points required to recharge a single charge in the item is equal to the highest level spell that the item can generate. If the item is recharged by sacrificing power points, the amount of ingenuity required to recharge a single charge is equal to half the recharge value of the item, rounded up.

    In any case, the artificer must have a working knowledge, as per Artificer's Knowledge, of the highest spell or power that the item can generate in order to recharge it.

    Redesign (Su): At 15th level, an artificer can spend one point of ingenuity to temporarily redesign a magical item. The artificer must have all of the item creation feats necessary to create the original magical item and the desired item is limited in the following ways: 

    The new item's total gold piece value cannot exceed the current gold piece value of the original item (modified appropriately for reduced charges, etc).

    The new item cannot involve any item creation feats that the original item did not use.

    The caster level of new item cannot exceed the caster level of the original item.

    If the original item took a body slot, the desired item must use the same body slot or be slotless (costing appropriately more).

    If the new item would normally have charges or uses (either finite or per day), the new item only has a number of charges or uses equal to the artificer's Intelligence modifier. 

    If there is any condition that would cause the new item to become non-magical, like a single use wondrous item, the original item is no longer enchanted.

    Using this ability requires a standard action that provokes and the artificer must be touching the item. The redesign lasts for a number of minutes equal to the artificer's Intelligence modifier, at which point, it reverts back to its original state (if able given how the temporary item was used).

   Duplication (Su): At 18th level, an artificer can spend one point of ingenuity to temporarily duplicate all of the properties of one enchanted item onto another item, non-magical or otherwise. If the item that is being altered is already enchanted, all of the target item's current properties are suppressed for the duration of this ability. Likewise, the item that is being altered must be same type (weapon, armor, wondrous item, etc) and use the same body slot, if applicable, as the item being duplicated. For this purpose, wands and dorjes as the same type. Staves and psicrowns are not considered the same as psicrowns take up the head slot while staves do not.

    Any property that would not normally function on the altered item (like duplicating the Keen quality onto a mace) does not function, but is still present in case the altered item can somehow make use of it later. If the original item has charges or uses (either finite or per day), the duplicated has a number of charges or uses equal to the original, to a maximum of the artificer's Intelligence modifier. 

    Using this ability requires a standard action that provokes and the artificer must be touching both items. The duplication lasts for a number of minutes equal to the artificer's Intelligence modifier, at which point, it reverts back to its original state. An enchanted item can only have one duplicate at a time and a duplicated item cannot be used to duplicate another item. The original item cannot be a spell or power completion item, like a scroll or power stone, or a construct.

    Craft Homunculus: At 4th level, an artificer is considered to have the Craft Construct feat, but only for constructs that are of Small size or smaller and have a maximum Hit Die equal to his artificer level minus 2. Any attempt to create a construct larger than Small size or with more HD then his artificer level minus 2 still requires the normal Craft Construct feat. All other aspects of the construct creation process remain the same (time, money, skill checks, etc).

    Retain Essence: At 5th level, an artificer gains the ability to salvage the gold piece value from an enchanted item for the sole purpose to create a new enchanted item or further enchant an existing magical or psionic item. In this sense, 'magical' and 'psionic' are interchangeable. The artificer must spend 8 consecutive hours with the item and he must also have all of the necessary item creation feats to create the item he is salvaging. After the 8 hours, the item, including the mundane item the enchanted was original placed on, is destroyed and the artificer now has a collection of reagents with a gold piece value of the construction cost of the enchanted item, which is usually one half the base price of the magical item. See the specific magical item for any unusual requirements in its creation. 

    This collection of reagents weighs one quarter of the original item and can be used by anyone that has the necessary item creation feats from the original magical or psionic item. These reagents never include talismanic components, like dragonshards or any part that is unique to a specific magical item.

    For example, if an artificer with the Craft Wondrous Item feat recovers a Handy Haversack that he needs to convert, he spends 8 hours with the item to break down the item and recovers 1,000 gp worth reagents (the construction cost to make the item in the first place). Those reagents can then be used toward the cost of making any magical item, provided that whomever is making the item has the Craft Wondrous Item feat in addition whatever feats needed for the new item.

    Attempting to salvage a cursed magical item can be done, but if the item is not identified as cursed before being salvaged, the artificer must make a Will save with a DC of 10 + the item's caster level or suffer a drawback (as per Corebook, pg. 538) and the cursed item is remains intact. If the cursed item is a specific cursed item, failing the initial Will save also means the artificer is wielding or wearing the cursed item, replacing whatever he might have been wielding or wearing at the time. 

    Magical items with Hit Dice can be salvaged using this class feature, but the item must be controlled by the artificer for the entire 8 hours, otherwise the item will automatically attack the artificer. Also, if the item is less than full hit points, the amount salvaged is less than it would normally be. If the item's hit points are less than full but more than its Hit Dice, the artificer can salvage 2/3 of the construction cost to make the magical item, rounded down. If the item has equal or less hit points than Hit Dice, but has at least 1 hit point, it can be salvaged for 1/2 of the construction cost to make the magical item. A magical item that is destroyed (either by conditions or 0 hit points) cannot be salvaged. Likewise, if destroying the item would be dangerous, like an Elemental Bound item, the artificer must deal with that situation at a randomly determined time during that process. Any combat that arises from a salvage attempt assumes that the artificer starts the first round of combat prone, but not surprised.

    Artifacts (both major and minor), as well as magical items that do not have gold piece value, like living constructs, cannot be salvaged.

    Skill Mastery: At 13th level, an artificer can take 10 when making Spellcraft or Use Magic Device checks, even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so. This ability circumvents the normal rule that a character may not take 10 on a Use Magic Device check.

    Efficient Crafting: At 19th level, the rate at which the artificer crafts magical and psionic items increases by a factor of 10. Thus, an artificer that normally crafts at a rate of 1,000 gp per day now crafts at a rate 10,000 gp per day. Any increases to the the default rate also increase by the same factor of 10, so if the artificer normally created wondrous items at 1,300 gp per day, he now creates it at a rate of 13,000 gp per day.

    Grand Weaving: At 20th level, the artificer can use his ingenuity pool for the following effects.

    Instant Enchantment: Assuming the artificer has necessary raw materials and mundane items, he can spend ingenuity points to instantly create an enchanted item. The resources, rules and necessary checks to make the item are still the same, but the total time required is a single standard action that provokes. The artificer must spend one ingenuity point per 10,000 gp of the intended item's price. If the intended item is physically larger that the artificer, then it assembles itself adjacent to the artificer as if grew in place. Otherwise, the artificer is wielding (but not wearing), the finished item.

    Mass Disjunction: The artificer can his Unravel (disjunction) ability to target all magical items worn or wielded by a single target with a separate Mage's Disjunction, using the individual target item option with the -5 to the saving throw, by spending a point of ingenuity per item, resolving separately. The artificer cannot target items he cannot see or is otherwise not aware of. Otherwise, this functions exactly like the Unravel (disjunction) ability.

    Mass Duplication: The artificer can his Item Augmentation (duplication) ability to copy the properties of a single magical item he is touching onto any appropriate item within 60', spending one point of ingenuity per item that is being copied. Anyone wielding a targeted item to be copied can resist with a successful Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the artificer's level + the artificer's Intelligence modifier. With the exception of the original item having multiple copies, this functions exactly like the Item Augmentation (duplication) ability.

Favored Class

    Instead of receiving an additional hit point or skill rank whenever they gain a level in a Favored Class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their Favored Classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have artificers as their Favored Class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed Favored Class reward.

Core Races:

Dwarves: Select one item creation feat known by the artificer. Whenever he crafts an item using that feat, the amount of progress he makes in an 8-hour period increases by 200 gp. This does not reduce the cost of the item; it just increases the rate at which the item is crafted. Determine this rate before applying any percentage discounts to the time needed.

Elves: Add a total bonus of 1 foot of any one existing movement rate to any construct(s) you create or alter. This does not have any appreciable benefit until multiples of five are met (a movement rate of 34 is the same as 30). You can change which movement rate you apply this bonus to any time you alter the construct in a way that requires item crafting rules.

Gnomes: Add +1/2 to Knowledge (arcana) and any checks made to control, regain control or otherwise command Elemental Bound magical items.

Half-elves: Add a total bonus of 1 foot of any one existing movement rate to any construct(s) you create or alter. This does not have any appreciable benefit until multiples of five are met (a movement rate of 34 is the same as 30). You can change which movement rate you apply this bonus to any time you alter the construct in a way that requires item crafting rules.

Human: Add +1/2 to your ingenuity pool.

Half-Orcs: Add +1/2 to your ingenuity pool.

Other Races:

Goblins: Add +1/2 to Disable Device and to Perception checks concerning traps.

Hobgoblins: Add +1/6 hit point per Hit Dice to any construct(s) you create. This does not apply to altering constructs unless you have increased their Hit Dice by at least 1.

Warforged: Add +1/4 to the caster level of any infusion cast that only targets yourself.
