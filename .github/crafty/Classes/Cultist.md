# Cultist
## Overview
Cultists are members of proscribed religious sects lurking on the fringes

of civilized society. Often city-based, cultists seem like ordinary folk, but

unbeknownst to their friends and neighbors, they dedicate themselves

to alien and usually evil gods. Some do it to get ahead, others to fulfill

long-repressed desires, and others to relieve the tedium of everyday life.

Dressing up in robes and visiting “forbidden temples” is quite exciting

after all, at least it is at first. The thrill-seekers rarely last long. Once

they realize the ultimate p0wer won’t be theirs by cutting off the heads

of a few chickens, they move on to pursue a new distraction. Those that

remain dedicated are rewarded with magic, but the road is a long and

arduous one. Cultists who persevere eventually assume a leadership role,

either taking over the cult or leaving found one of their own.

As an NPC class, a cultist’s Challenge Rating is equal to its level

minus 1.

Using the Cultist

The cultist class is specifically designed for NPCs, though it is open

to player characters. Most characters that enter this class are low- to

mid-ranking members of a subversive organization. Cult leaders

may begin as ordinary cultists, but to take command of a cult, they

typically become clerics (see **Greater Cultists**).

**Starting Gold:** 3d4 × 10 gp (75 gp)

**Starting Age:** As rogue

**Class Skills:** Bluff, Craft, Disguise, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Linguistics, Perception, Profession, Sense Motive, Sleight

of Hand and Stealth.

**Skill Ranks per Level:** 4 + Int modifier

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the cultist.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency

The noble is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. In

addition, she is also proficient with her deity’s favored weapon.

Aura

If the cultist worships a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity, she has a

particularly powerful aura corresponding to her deity’s alignment (see

the *detect evil* spell for details). If the cultist doesn’t worship a specific

deity but chooses the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain, she has

a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

Spellcasting

Starting at 4th level, the cultist may cast divine spells drawn from

the cultist spell list (see following). Like a cleric, she must choose

and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, she cannot

spontaneously cast *cure* or *inflict* spells.

To prepare or cast a spell, the cultist must have a Wisdom score equal

to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw

against her spell is 10 + the spell level + her Wisdom modifier.

The cultist does not acquire her spells from books or scrolls, nor does

she prepare them through study. Instead, the cultist meditates or prays

for her spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through her own

strength of faith. The cultist must choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to

regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect

on whether she can prepare spells.

Like other spellcasters, the cultist can cast only a certain number of

spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given

on **Table 2–7: The Cultist**. In addition, she receives bonus spells per

day if she has a high Wisdom score.

When **Table 2–7: The Cultist** indicates that the cultist gets 0 spells

per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would

be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level.

Finally, in order to cast any cultist spells, the cultist must have a holy

symbol or some other divine focus important to her chosen deity.

Through 3rd level, she has no caster level. At 4th level and higher,

her caster level is one-half her cultist level.

Cultist Spell List

The following spells originate from the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook* and

this book (marked with a †). Your GM may add additional spells from

other sources at her discretion.

**1st level:** *bane, bewilder*†*, cause fear, cure light wounds, curse water,*

*detect chaos/evil/good/law, detect magic, disguise self, doom, guidance,*

*inflict light wounds, light, magic weapon, read magic, resistance, shield*

*of faith, summon monster I, unhinge*†

**2nd level:** *alter self, augury, cure moderate wounds, darkness, death knell,*

*desecrate, divine favor, enthrall, hold person, inflict moderate wounds, scare,*

*shatter, silence, sound burst, suggestion, summon monster II, undetectable*

*alignment*

**3rd level:** *animate dead, bestow curse, blindness/deafness, contagion,*

*continual flame, cure serious wounds, deeper darkness, glyph of warding,*

*inflict serious wounds, prayer, speak with dead, summon monster III*

**4th level:** *cure critical wounds, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dismissal,*

*dispel magic, divination, freedom of movement, giant vermin, lesser planar*

*ally, poison, sending, summon monster IV, tongues*

**5th level:** *contact other plane, dispel chaos/evil/good/law, insect plague,*

*scrying, slay living, spell resistance, summon monster V, symbol of pain,*

*symbol of sleep, true seeing, unhallow*

Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells

The cultist’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can

perform, her values, and how others see her. Choose one domain

from among those belonging to the cultist’s deity. She can select an

alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment

matches that domain.

If the cultist isn’t devoted to a particular deity, she still selects a domain

to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on

alignment domains still applies.

The cultist’s domain gives her access to a domain spell at each spell

level she can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. Where

a “d” is indicated on **Table 2–7,** she fills this spell with the domain

spell that corresponds to its level or lower.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells

The cultist can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her

deity’s (if she haa one). Spells associated with particular alignments

are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their

spell descriptions.

Fanatic (Ex)

As a servant of a strange and maddening god, the cultist is a bit

unhinged and in times of stress, she may call upon her insanity to

great effect. Once per encounter, the cultist may gain an insight

bonus to a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check equal to the

number of Insanity Points she has accumulated. Using this ability is

an immediate action.

Skill Focus (Bluff)

Since the cultist is a member of a subversive cult, she must be a skilled

liar. At 1st level, she gains Skill Focus (Bluff) as a bonus feat.

Sneak Attack

Starting at 3rd level, the cultist deals an extra 1d6 points of damage

whenever she successfully attacks a target she flanks or a target that

is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This ability functions exactly

like the rogue ability of the same name (see the *Pathfinder Core*

*Rulebook* for details). This extra damage increases by +1d6 at 8th

level and every five levels thereafter and stacks with other instances

of sneak attack.
