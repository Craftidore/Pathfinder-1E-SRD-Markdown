# Marshal
## Overview
Sometimes it is not enough to be a conquering warrior, a champion

of all that’s right, an experienced sellsword, or an elite foot

soldier. Sometimes the circumstances require a solid commander

of soldiers and situations. Sometimes the circumstances demand

a marshal.

Marshals inspire trust in those they lead. They earn that trust

by slogging through harsh landscapes, dangerous battlefields,

and haunted catacombs along with those under their command.

With a look, they can see where to best deploy their resources

or come up with a sneaky ruse to fool their enemies. A marshal

has a tactician’s mind, a cartographer’s overview of the disputed

landscape (or dungeon warren), and a way with words that can

inspire battle-hardened fighters to give it their all when melee

breaks out.

Adventures:Whether leading troops or a company of adventurers,

marshals accept commissions in return for their service.

Once a commission is accepted, most marshals feel honorbound

to see the contract through to its end. If the choice is

between honoring the commission and the survival of his company,

though, many a marshal will break the commission and

lead his forces to a new patron in distant lands.

Characteristics: Trained in the basics of fighting, marshals

possess a general knowledge of weapons and armor. Their real

strength is their ability to lead those who follow them to success

they might not otherwise reach in combat. Marshals make passable

warriors themselves, when personal danger finds them.

Alignment:Marshals may be of any alignment. Good-aligned

marshals are often crusading leaders who seek out and fight

evil. Lawful-aligned marshals accept commissions from people

who face invasion by foreign aggressors. Chaotic-aligned marshals

lead mercenaries to wherever the pay is best. Evil-aligned

marshals tend to lead forces of foreign aggressors set on invasion

and plunder.

Religion: Marshals often worship Heironeous (god of

valor) or Kord (god of strength). Some worship St. Cuthbert

(god of retribution), Hextor (god of tyranny), or Erythnul (god

of slaughter).

Background: Marshals come to their profession through

study and desire. Most have had formal training in a noble’s

army, where they were given positions of authority. Others have

trained in formal academies, preparing themselves for careers

as a military officers. Marshals see others of their class as part of a special group, especially those they have studied with. Even

enemy marshals can be afforded some respect, though the enemy’s

forces must be crushed all the same.

Races: Human marshals often follow in the footsteps of their

parents, who served as officers in earlier wars, conflicts, or mercenary

companies. Dwarf marshals are trained to lead strike

teams that protect the underground dwarven

kingdoms. Elf marshals rarely enroll

in military academies, though half-elves

often do. Half-orc marshals fight an uphill

battle in trying to garner respect in

mixed-race units.

Among the brutal humanoids, few

manage to enroll in the academies where

the elite skills of command are taught.

Other Classes: The marshal relies on

the other classes in all ways—it is his

job to support a team, magnifying the

strengths of each member for success in

battles or forays into dangerous cavern

complexes.

Role: In most adventuring parties, the

marshal serves as the lead tactician, while

his comrades support him with spells,

ranged attacks, and other effects. However,

once a plan is in motion, most marshals

enter the melee to assure victory.

GAME RULE

INFORMATION

Marshals have the following game statistics.

Abilities: Charisma is especially important

for marshals because it improves their

standing with those they lead, as well as permitting

them to magnify the efforts of the group. Constitution is

important for a marshal’s staying power. Intelligence is important

for the many skills required by marshals to complete their

commissions.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the marshal.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Marshals are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with

shields (except tower shields).

Auras (Ex): The marshal exerts an effect on

allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different

effects, or auras, over the course of his

career. The marshal may project one

minor aura and (starting at 2nd level)

one major aura at a time.

Projecting an aura is a swift action

(see Chapter 2: Magic). The aura

remains in effect until the marshal

uses a free action to dismiss it or activates

another aura of the same kind

(major or minor). A marshal can have an

aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in

effect at the start of a combat encounter

even before the marshal takes his

first turn.

Activating an aura involves haranguing,

ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling,

or calming allies. A marshal sizes up the enemy, allies, and the

terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do

their best.

Unless otherwise noted, a marshal’s aura affects all allies

within 60 feet (including himself ) who can hear the marshal.

An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be

able to understand the marshal’s language to gain the bonus.

A marshal’s aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood

by his allies.

A marshal begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice.

As his marshal level increases, he gains access to new auras, as

indicated on Table 1–5: The Marshal.

All bonuses granted by a marshal’s auras are circumstance

bonuses that do not stack with each other.

Minor Aura: A minor aura lets allies add the marshal’s

Charisma bonus (if any) to certain rolls.

*Accurate Strike:* Bonus on rolls made to confirm critical hits.

*Art of War:* Bonus on disarm, trip, bull rush, and sunder

attempts.

*Demand Fortitude:* Bonus on Fortitude saves.

*Determined Caster:* Bonus on rolls to overcome spell resistance.

*Force of Will:* Bonus on Will saves.

*Master of Opportunity:* Bonus to Armor Class against attacks of

opportunity.

*Master of Tactics:* Bonus on damage rolls when flanking.

*Motivate Charisma:* Bonus on Charisma checks and Charismabased

skill checks.

*Motivate Constitution:* Bonus on Constitution checks and Constitution-

based skill checks.

*Motivate Dexterity:* Bonus on Dexterity checks, Dexterity-based

skill checks, and initiative checks.

*Motivate Intelligence:* Bonus on Intelligence checks and Intelligence-

based skill checks.

*Motivate Strength:* Bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based

skill checks.

*Motivate Wisdom:* Bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based

skill checks.

*Over the Top:* Bonus on damage rolls when charging.

*Watchful Eye:* Bonus on Reflex saves.

Major Aura: Beginning at 2nd level, a marshal can project a

major aura in addition to his minor aura. A major aura lets allies

add +1 to certain rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 7th, 14th,

and 20th level.

*Hardy Soldiers:* The marshal’s allies gain damage reduction equal

to the amount of bonus the aura provides. For example, if the

marshal is 10th level, everyone affected gains DR 2/–.

*Motivate Ardor:* Bonus on damage rolls.

*Motivate Attack:* Bonus on melee attack rolls.

*Motivate Care:* Bonus to Armor Class.

*Motivate Urgency:* Allies’ base land speed is increased by a

number of feet equal to 5 × the amount of bonus the aura provides.

For example, the allies of a 10th-level marshal (+2 major

aura) add 10 feet to their base land speed.

*Resilient Troops:* Bonus on all saves.

*Steady Hand:* Bonus on ranged attack rolls.

Skill Focus (Diplomacy): Because a marshal has a way with

people, he gains this feat as a bonus feat. If the marshal already

has the feat, he can choose a different one.

Grant Move Action (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a marshal can

direct and motivate his allies to act immediately. Once per day, as

a standard action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all

of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself ). Each of the affected

allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their

current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies’

initiative count; the round continues normally after the marshal’s

turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative

count immediately follows the marshal’s may get an extra

move action from the marshal, followed directly by a full round

worth of actions on the ally’s turn.)

At 8th level, a marshal gains the ability to grant an extra move

action to his allies twice per day. The frequency increases to three

times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and

five times per day at 20th level.

A character can take only one extra move action per round. (In

other words, two marshals can’t use this ability on the same ally

in the same round.) If an ally chooses not to take the extra move

action, it is lost.
