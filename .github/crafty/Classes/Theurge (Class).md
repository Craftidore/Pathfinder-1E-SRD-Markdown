Some spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts. Others devote their lives to the gods, acting as emissaries of the divine. The theurge seeks to achieve a perfect balance between the divine and the arcane, blending both kinds of magic into a powerful and cohesive whole. Theurges revel in the unbridled wonders of all magic, regardless of its source. They strive to refine their magical abilities, and are often consumed by their quest to discover ever greater feats of spellcasting. 

**Role:** Although many theurges choose to worship a specific deity, typically a god or goddess of magic, others choose instead to venerate personifications of magical forces or perhaps even magic itself. Theurges are obsessed with an unquenchable thirst to further their understanding and mastery of spellcasting and magic. Their strength lies in the ability to draw upon, combine and manipulate the powers of magic in all its forms to overcome any obstacle and danger. 

**Alignment:** Any 

**Hit Die:** d6.

**Class Skills** 

The theurge’s class skills are [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] (Dex), [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] (Wis), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (all) (Int), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] (Int), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] (Wis), and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (Int). 

**Skill Ranks per Level:** 2 + Int modifier. 

**Starting Wealth:** 2d6 × 10 gp (Average: 70 gp). 

**Class Features** 

The following are class features of the theurge. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A theurge is proficient with all simple weapons. A theurge is not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a theurge’s movements, which can cause his arcane spells with somatic components to fail. 

**Spells:** A theurge casts divine spells drawn primarily from the cleric spell list and arcane spells drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A theurge must choose and prepare his spells in advance. Over time, a theurge also learns to uncover, research, and prepare non-sorcerer/wizard arcane spells and non-cleric divine spells as well. 

To prepare or cast an arcane spell, a theurge must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a theurge’s arcane spell is 10 + the spell level + the theurge’s Intelligence modifier. 

To prepare or cast a divine spell, a theurge must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a theurge’s divine spell is 10 + the spell level + the theurge’s Wisdom modifier. 

A theurge can cast only a certain number of arcane and divine spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Theurge. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence or Wisdom score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). Note that a theurge receives bonus arcane spells for a high Intelligence score and bonus divine spells for a high Wisdom score. 

A theurge must choose and prepare his arcane spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the theurge decides which arcane spells to prepare. 

The theurge does not know all divine spells of the appropriate level as a cleric does. Instead, he must prepare divine spells from his prayerbook, which contains his collection of written divine spells. 

During the time he studies his spellbook, the theurge must also meditate and study his prayerbook. When doing so, he decides which of his divine spells to prepare. 

**Cantrips and Orisons:** Theurges can prepare a number of cantrips (0-level arcane spells), and orisons (0-level divine spells) each day, as noted on Table: Theurge under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. 

**Spellbook:** A theurge must study his spellbook each day to prepare his arcane spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]*, which all theurges can prepare from memory. 

A theurge begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells plus three [[1st Level Wizard Spells|1st-level wizard spells]] of his choice. The theurge also selects a number of additional [[1st Level Wizard Spells|1st-level wizard spells]] equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new theurge level, he gains two new wizard spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new theurge level) for his spellbook. At any time, a theurge can also add spells from arcane scrolls or from borrowed or captured spellbooks to his own. In this way, a theurge can learn and prepare non-sorcerer/wizard arcane spells (magus or witch spells, for example). The two free arcane spells he gains at each new theurge level must always be selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list however. 

**Prayerbook:** A theurge does not receive his divine spells directly from the deity or other mystical force he venerates. Instead, he must search for and collect new divine spells to record in his prayerbook, much in the same way he does arcane spells for his spellbook. These divine spells can come from divine scrolls, holy tablets or other magical writings. The theurge cannot prepare any divine spell not recorded in his prayerbook. 

A theurge begins play with a prayerbook containing all [[0 Level Cleric Spells|0-level cleric spells]] plus three [[1st Level Cleric Spells|1st-level cleric spells]] of the player's choice. The theurge may also select a number of additional [[1st Level Cleric Spells|1st-level cleric spells]] equal to his Wisdom modifier to add to his prayerbook. At each new theurge level, he gains two new cleric spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new theurge level). At any time, a theurge can also add divine spells found on scrolls or other magical writings to his prayerbook. In this way, a theurge can learn and prepare non-clerical divine spells (druid or inquisitor, for example). The two free divine spells he gains at each new theurge level must always be selected from the cleric spell list however. 

**Bonus Languages:** A theurge’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, Draconic and Infernal. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race. 

**Scribe Scroll:** At 2nd level, a theurge gains [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] as a bonus feat. 

**Focused Caster (Ex):** Beginning at 3rd level, a theurge may roll twice on any concentration check and take the higher result. 

**Combined Spells (Su):** Starting at 4th level, the theurge can prepare and cast arcane spells using available divine spell slots and vice versa. Spells prepared and cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they otherwise would have occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. 

At 4th level, a theurge can prepare 1st-level arcane spells using available 2nd-level divine spell slots or 1st-level divine spells using available 2nd-level arcane spell slots. Every three levels thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a maximum of 6th-level spells at 19th level (such spells would take up 7th-level spell slots). Despite being prepared and cast using a higher spell slot, a combined spell is still treated in all ways like a spell of its actual level. 

For example, a 7th level theurge who has already prepared all his allotted third-level arcane spells for the day could still prepare a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell by preparing it using an available fourth-level divine spell slot. The fireball would still be considered in all ways a third-level arcane spell, the theurge simply used the higher divine spell slot to prepare and cast it. 

**Spell Synthesis (Su):** At 5th level, a theurge can cast two spells he has prepared, one arcane and one divine, using one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time. The theurge can make any decisions concerning the spells independently of each other. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a –4 penalty on saves made against each spell. A theurge receives a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. The theurge may use this ability once per day at 5th level and one additional time per day at 11th and 17th level. 

**Innate Spells (Sp):** As the theurge’s mastery of magic grows deeper, he learns to cast a small number of spells spontaneously. Beginning at 6th level, a theurge may select one 1st-level arcane or divine spell he knows and is able to cast. He may now cast this spell once per day as a spell-like ability without needing to prepare it ahead of time. A spell cast in this way is in addition to the theurge’s normal allotment of spells and does not count against his standard spells per day. The caster level for this spell is equal to the theurge’s caster level. 

At 9th level and every three levels thereafter (12th, 15th, and 18th level), the theurge may select an additional spell which he can cast once per day as a spell-like ability. The maximum spell level which can be chosen at each of these intervals is indicated on the table below. 

**Theurge Innate Spells** 


| **Level** | **Maximum Spell Level** |
|---|---|
| 6th | 1st |
| 9th | 2nd or lower |
| 12th | 3rd or lower |
| 15th | 4th or lower |
| 18th | 5th or lower |

**Bonus Feats**: At 8th, 14th and 17th level, a theurge gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he must choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]], [[Greater Spell Focus (Feat)|Greater Spell Focus]], [[Spell Penetration (Feat)|Spell Penetration]] or [[Greater Spell Penetration (Feat)|Greater Spell Penetration]]. The theurge must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The theurge is not limited to the categories or specific feats listed above when choosing those feats. 

**Master Theurge (Su)**: At 20th level, the theurge becomes a true master of arcane and divine magic. The theurge no longer needs to expend a spell slot one level higher when using combined spells. In addition, the theurge may apply any single metamagic feat that he knows to a spell he is about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. The theurge can apply a metamagic feat in this way a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (whichever is higher).
