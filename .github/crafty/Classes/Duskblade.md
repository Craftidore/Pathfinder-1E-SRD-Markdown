# Duskblade
## Overview
*“My blade and my magic are one and the same.”*

—Yele, elf duskblade

The duskblade blurs the line between spellcaster and

warrior, marrying the power of magic with hand-to-hand

combat prowess.

A student of ancient elven spellcasting techniques, the

duskblade combines arcane spellcasting with the combat

skills of a fi ghter. While the ability to cast arcane spells in

armor originated with the elves, over the millennia the secrets

of the duskblade have been disseminated to the other races,

and today members of any race can become a duskblade.

If you find you can’t choose between being an arcane

spellcaster who zaps your enemies with powerful spells and

a nimble, powerful front-line melee character who lays them

low with a sword, the duskblade is the perfect class for you.

Combining arcane magic with melee prowess, you’re prepared

in any situation. Enemies who underestimate you never get

a second chance, since you don’t even have to switch back

and forth between hands-on combat and spellcasting; you

can do both simultaneously.

MAKING A DUSKBLADE

The duskblade is a quintessential hybrid character, simultaneously

a potent spellcaster and an effective melee combatant.

The original duskblades were elite guardians in an ancient

elf empire, duelmasters and arcane spellcasters beyond

compare. Historical accounts vary on why they were called

duskblades; some say the name is symbolic of how they

combined swordplay and arcane magic—a night-and-day

combination. Others contend that the duskblades earned

their name when they were charged with preserving the elf

race in the face of a tide of darkness and evil.

The most powerful duskblades can duel a fi ghter to a standstill

and match a wizard spell for spell—for a while, at least.

But the class really comes into its own when you embrace your

hybrid nature, using a quick-cast spell to supplement your

melee attacks or combining a touch spell with a devastating

sword strike.

The duskblade is a good choice for players who know they

want a sword-wielding arcane spellcaster from the beginning.

By contrast, multiclass fi ghter/wizard combinations

and prestige classes such as the eldritch knight are better

suited for characters who begin their careers as fi ghters or

arcane spellcasters and only later contemplate embracing

their opposite.

Abilities: Your Intelligence and Strength scores should be

as high as possible, since your spellcasting and melee combat

depend upon them. Your Constitution is also important,

because you need all the hit points you can get.

Races: The duskblade class originated among the ancient

elves, and to this day most duskblades are elves. However,

some humans and half-elves also have proved adept at

mastering the class’s dual focus on combat and spellcasting.

Halfl ings, gnomes, dwarves, and half-orcs rarely enter

this class.

Alignment: Since the duskblade class originated among

the elves, those who undergo the intense training required to

master the class abilities at the hands of an elf mentor often

end their apprenticeship sharing the chaotic good alignment

of most elves. However, duskblades are highly individualist

and can be of any alignment.

Starting Gold: 6d4×10 gp (150 gp).

Starting Age: As wizard.

CLASS FEATURES

Your class features are simple to characterize: constant

improvement in your spellcasting, a fi ghter’s base attack

bonus progression, and ever-increasing mastery of arcane

magic in melee combat.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Duskblades are profi

cient with all martial weapons, as well as all armors and

shields (except tower shields).

Spells: You cast arcane spells, which are drawn from the

duskblade spell list on page 98. You can cast any spell you

know without preparing it ahead of time.

To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score

equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 10 for 0-level spells,

Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi culty Class

for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell level +

your Int modifi er.

You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell

level per day. Your base daily spell allotment is given on Table

1–3. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have

a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–1: Ability Modifi ers

and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the *Player’s Handbook.*)

Spells Known: You begin play knowing two 0-level spells

and two 1st-level spells, chosen from the duskblade spell list.

You also know one additional 0-level spell for each point of

Intelligence bonus.

Each time you gain a new class level, you learn one

additional spell of any level you can cast, chosen from the

duskblade spell list.

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every subsequent oddnumbered

level, you can choose to learn a new spell in place

of one you already know. In effect, you lose access to the old

spell in exchange for gaining the new one. The new spell’s

level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged,

and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level

spell you can cast. For instance, upon reaching 9th level, you

could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two levels below the

highest-level spell you can cast, which is 3rd) for a different

1st-level spell. You can swap only a single spell at any given

level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the

same time that you gain new spells known for the level.

You need not prepare spells in advance. You can cast any

spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used

up your spells per day for that spell level.

Arcane Attunement (Sp): You can use the spell-like

powers *dancing lights, detect magic, fl are, ghost sound,* and *read*

*magic* a combined total of times per day equal to 3 + your Int

modifi er. These spell-like powers do not count against your

total of spells known or spells per day.

Armored Mage (Ex): Normally, armor of any type interferes

with an arcane spellcaster’s gestures, which can cause

spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A

duskblade’s limited focus and specialized training, however,

allows you to avoid arcane spell failure so long as you stick

to light armor and light shields. This training does not

extend to medium or heavy armors, nor to heavy shields.

This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different

spellcasting class.

At 4th level, you learn to use medium armor with no chance

of arcane spell failure.

At 7th level, you learn to use a heavy shield with no chance

of arcane spell failure.

Combat Casting: At 2nd level, you gain Combat Casting

as a bonus feat.

Arcane Channeling (Su):

Beginning at 3rd level, you can

use a standard

action to cast

any touch spell you know and deliver the spell through your

weapon with a melee attack. Casting a spell in this manner

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The spell must

have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If the melee

attack is successful, the attack deals damage normally; then

the effect of the spell is resolved.

At 13th level, you can cast any touch spell you know as

part of a full attack action, and the spell affects each target

you hit in melee combat that round. Doing so discharges the

spell at the end of the round, in the case of a touch spell that

would otherwise last longer than 1 round.

Quick Cast: Beginning at 5th level, you can cast one spell

each day as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the

spell is 1 standard action or less.

You can use this ability twice per day at 10th level, three

times per day at 15th level, and four times per day at 20th

level.

Spell Power (Ex): Starting at 6th level, you can more

easily overcome the spell resistance of any opponent you

successfully injure

with a melee attack.

If you have injured

an opponent with a

melee attack, you gain

a +2 bonus on your

caster level check to

overcome spell resistance

for the remainder

of the encounter. This

bonus increases to +3 at

11th level, to +4 at 16th

level, and to +5

at 18th level.

PLAYING A DUSKBLADE

A duskblade can take the fi ghter’s place in the front ranks

of a party or ensorcel his foes from a distance like a wizard.

While you aren’t quite as good as either a dedicated fi ghter or

a dedicated wizard or sorcerer in those roles, you’re reasonably

effective in either, and you can change roles on a round-byround

basis as needed.

Choosing the path of the duskblade means you don’t have to

choose between being a combat specialist and a spellcaster. You

enjoy the best of both worlds, and you’ll undertake any quest

that promises to improve either your spellcasting or your melee

prowess. Driven to simultaneously master both swordplay

and spellcasting, you might devote yourself to delving into

ancient ruins to learn more about the original duskblades or

wander far and wide looking for other duskblades interested

in restoring the class to its previous glory.

Religion

The demands of martial and arcane discipline don’t leave

much room for religion in the typical duskblade. Goodaligned

duskblades typically venerate Corellon Larethian,

even if they aren’t elves, because he supposedly taught the

fi rst duskblades the secret of combining melee combat with

arcane casting. A few worship Boccob as the personifi cation

of their own mastery of magic, while more honor Wee Jas,

who exemplifi es both the magic they wield and also the

death that they deal.

Other Classes

You get along well with members of other classes who share a

rigorous devotion to a chosen path, such as paladins, dragon

shamans, and monks. You are the object of envy to sorcerers

and of admiration to bards, who sometimes try to emulate

your abilities (often with disastrous results). Among members

of the two classes whose portfolios you draw from, fi ghters

and wizards, some view you with disdain while others are

fascinated by your unique meld of melee combat and arcane

spellcasting. Barbarians, clerics, and knights tend to distrust

you, while rogues, rangers, druids, and beguilers view you

and other duskblades with indifference.

Combat

You might sometimes feel you have too many options, too

many things you can do in a single round. Use that fl exibility

to confound your enemies, outfi ghting what you can’t outspell

and outspelling what you can’t outfi ght. The monster that

engages you in melee, hoping to get an attack of opportunity

that spoils your next spell, is in for a surprise—a surprise

consisting of three feet of razor-sharp steel.

Most of a duskblade’s spells target a single creature or have

a range of touch, so you are most effective when you single 

out and focus upon defeating a single opponent. Your spells

that affect areas are limited mostly to cones, which means

you need to be on or near the front lines to get the greatest

effect from them. Even if you come close to being as effective

as a fi ghter or a sorcerer in his chosen fi eld, you’re certainly

not as effective as a fi ghter *and* a sorcerer. You’ll occasionally

cast a spell and strike with your blade in the same round, but

pure spellcasters such as the sorcerer are more able to affect a

crowd of foes or blast a group of opponents. That said, actions

are the D&D game’s most fundamental currency, and you’ll

be able to take advantage of additional actions in the round, as

you combine spellcasting with melee attacks and eventually

gain the ability to cast any spell you know as a swift action

a number of times per day.

Advancement

Like the sorcerer, you face a crucial decision: which spells to

put on your spells known list. The offensive spells on your

spell list fall into three primary categories: touch spells,

single-target ranged spells, and short-range cones. Choose at

least one touch spell, such as *shocking grasp,* to take advantage

of your arcane channeling ability. You should also take a

movement spell, such as *swift expeditious retreat,* and an attackenhancing

spell such as *true strike* or *magic weapon*. Future

spell selections can tailor your repertoire to the role you fi nd

yourself most commonly fi lling, whether it be a front-line

fi ghter or a fi nesse caster.

Assign as many skill points as possible to Concentration,

Knowledge (arcana), and Sense Motive. For feats, take the

Weapon Focus (longsword) feat and also consider sudden

metamagic feats, such as Sudden Silent and Sudden Empower,

both from the *Complete Arcane* supplement.

Do not neglect to put some thought into your gear as well.

Spend 30% of your wealth on the heaviest armor you can

manage without risking arcane spell failure chance (often

mithral and/or having the twilight special ability). Spend

20% on your primary weapon and 20% on items that improve

your Intelligence, Strength, and saving throws. Spend 20% on

wands and scrolls and the remaining 10% on miscellaneous

items and a basic adventuring package.

Your spellcasting and fi ghting prowess also allow you the

opportunity to enter into prestige classes that are suited to

either melee or spellcasting.

DUSKBLADES IN THE WORLD

*“Your spells cannot penetrate my magical defenses. You are helpless,*

*wizard!”*

—Last words of Zufi r Halaq, rakshasa lord

The duskblade combines the best features of the fi ghter and

wizard. Duskblades make dangerous foes because they have

so many options, magical and martial, available to them every

round; their ability to deliver touch spells through a melee

attack is particularly potent.

Daily Life

The life of a duskblade is one of constant training. Each

duskblade must simultaneously be a swordmaster, a deft

spellcaster, and an expert in the esoteric techniques of

arcane channeling. Each of those elements requires years

to master; put them together, and you have a training regimen

that only the most driven characters can maintain.

The typical duskblade is doing calisthenics in the castle

courtyard before the other characters wake up in the morning

and practicing somatic gestures long after everyone

else has gone to sleep in the evening. Exceptions exist,

of course, but in general duskblades have a reputation as

driven, focused individuals.

Notables

Since duskblades are few and far between, they are natural

loners, wandering far and wide in search of adventures that

will prove a suitable challenge for their unique combination

of abilities. Such is the case with Gwilor the Swift, a wild elf

who adventured in the woodlands of his people for a century

Player's Handbook II

(WotC)

23

CHAPTER 1

NEW CLASSES

or so before he committed himself entirely to a crusade

against the duergar and spent the rest of his long career on

extended forays into the underground.

Other duskblades join like-minded adventuring groups.

Given their own mix of melee and spellcasting abilities,

duskblades are willing to try unusual combinations, such

as in the case of Taiglin the Fair, a gray elf duskblade who

formed a highly successful party with a human hexblade and

a halfl ing warmage.

Still others are restless, moving from group to group and

area to area in search of new challenges. For example, Hallia

Yelebane, a self-taught half-elf duskblade, rarely stays in the

same country more than a month or two. She arrives, seeks

out a suitable challenge for her talents, throws herself into

that adventure, and then moves on. In the course of her

career (brief by elven standards), she has rescued a halfl ing

metropolis from a cabal of mind fl ayers who were “farming”

the small humanoids for their brains, teamed with a githzerai

monk to defeat a famed githyanki knight (and claimed his

silver sword as her own), and exposed malenti infi ltrators in

an aquatic elf community and thus turned back a sahuagin

invasion, along with other exploits. Hallia’s nickname derives

from her unexpected victory, early in her career, over one of

her fellow duskblades, the elf Yele, who until then had boasted

that he had never been defeated in a one-on-one duel. The

two became fast friends and now make a point to duel at least

once every year.

Organizations

Because of the elven heritage of the class, many duskblades

gravitate toward the elf lands even if they aren’t elves

themselves. Knowledge of duskblade fighting techniques

is sufficiently rare that no large company of duskblades

exists—or, if one does, it’s a well-kept secret. For centuries,

the class has been sustained by nothing more than solitary

masters who teach duskblade skills and spells to worthy

apprentices, and by those who have taught themselves the

techniques from long-neglected tomes and training manuals.

More recently, some self-taught duskblades have appeared

who master the diffi cult techniques required by the class

through some innate instinct. No matter what their origin,

all are equals in the eyes of their fellow duskblades.

Duskblades love to test themselves against each other; on

the rare occasions when the paths of two duskblade adventurers

happen to cross, they will always make time for a friendly

duel before they part. Given elf life spans, some duskblades

maintain friendly rivalries that can last for centuries.

NPC Reactions

Few common folk understand who or what duskblades truly

are, and most assume those duskblades they happen to meet

are simply fi ghters with a bit of sorcerer ability (or vice versa).

Legends speak of elf heroes skilled with both blade and spell,

but these tales do little to inform anyone of the specifi c abilities

of the duskblades. Most adventurers react to duskblades

with some wariness because a duskblade’s combination of

abilities makes it very hard to judge how powerful or capable

such a character is in any situation.

DUSKBLADE LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

duskblades to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including

the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Some elves have the ability to cast arcane spells

while engaged in melee combat; such elves are known as

duskblades.

DC 15: Not all duskblades are elves; sometimes members of

other races master the class’s special techniques of spellcasting

in melee.

DC 20: Duskblades preserve an ancient tradition that enables

them to deliver spell damage through weapon strikes.

DUSKBLADES IN THE GAME

Duskblades fi t easily into an ongoing game because of their

small numbers and enigmatic mix of abilities. The presence

of the class is easily explained as your players explore more of

the world—they simply hadn’t encountered any duskblades

until now, or had mistaken those they did encounter for

multiclass fi ghter/wizards. Now that they’ve discovered this

aspect of the setting, however, they’re free to multiclass into

the duskblade class or to begin a new character with levels

only in the new class.

Adaptations

One of the more interesting ways to adapt this class to your

campaign is to keep the class abilities more or less the same

but to change the race involved. For example, the githyanki

have a tradition of multiclass fighter/wizards known as

gish; these individuals could easily be reconceived as a gith

duskblade class. Unexpected combinations would be the most

striking, such as a previously unrevealed halfl ing duskblade

class. After all, few expect halfl ings to engage in melee except

when making sneak attacks, but when magically boosted

by *bull’s strength* and the like and fighting with oversized

weapons, they could prove unexpectedly deadly against those

who underestimate them—which, after all, is the essence of

the duskblade class.

Sample Encounter

An encounter with a duskblade should highlight his combined

use of spells and melee abilities. The duskblade should

use his spells to force the PCs to close into melee with him,

and then he should batter them with a barrage of touch spells

delivered through his melee attacks. Fighting a villainous

duskblade should be tricky, because he’ll use the tools that

are most effective against each character (for example, spells

requiring Refl ex saves against the fi ghter and powerful melee

attacks against the wizard).

EL 7: Yele has always been drawn to both physical combat

and the study of magic. As a duskblade, he combines the two

into one seamless fi ghting style. An adventurer by trade, Yele

could encounter the characters as a friend or a foe. If as a foe,

it is because some enemy of the adventurers has encouraged

Yele to go after them for some reason, perhaps to gain some

magical treasure currently in their possession that would

signifi cantly boost either his swordplay or his spellcasting.
