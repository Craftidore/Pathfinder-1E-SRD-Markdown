# Archer
## Overview
Precision and patience are keys to being an archer (Arc). These warriors rely upon their skill with a missile weapon, trying to take enemies down before they can be engaged in close combat. Skill and precision is their pride, but they are also skilled enough warriors to fight with other weapons if needed. However most standing armies understand the true place of an archer is behind a defensive line of infantry, and even adventurers understand that the ranged strength and abilities of an archer should be protected. The damage a skilled archer can deal to an advancing enemy is terrifying indeed, and many battles are won by bow and crossbow long before the armies themselves meet on the field.

An archer is never without his missile weapon. Just as fighters spar and train, archers practice regularly, shooting from a variety of stances at any number of targets, near and far.

Not all archers are trained military and militia-men, however. Many cultures respect the archer as a huntsman, able to provide food for the tribe and also double as defensive forces for a village. Many huntsmen take track as their first feat instead of a missile weapon feat, increasing their ability to bring home large game, while others multiclass as archer-rangers. Archers are especially useful on ships, where they are the last defense against boarding actions, able to significantly reduce the attacking men’s strength before they board.

**Adventurers:** Many archers are recruited into adventuring instead of looking for it. Few groups underestimate the power of a well-used bow more than once. Once they become adventurers, archers rarely tire of the opportunity to take down powerful and terrifying creatures with little risk to their own hide, relying on other adventurers to take the brunt of most attacks.

**Characteristics:** Nowhere near as well-rounded as the fighter, or even as a warrior, archers usually become the pinnacles of their craft, never attempting to master a second weapon beyond the one they chose when they began their career.

**Alignment:** While archers can be of any alignment, generally they tend towards law over chaos, as they must avoid headstrong temptations that could lead into melee combat. But they are free to be of any alignment, with some archers fighting to protect society and their people, and others caring not for such niceties, aiming only to fill their own purse with as little risk to self as possible.

**Background:** Archers come to their profession in many ways. Most have been trained in military unit of longbowmen or crossbowmen (although some gnomish and halfling archers have their training with slings instead), or at least in the local militia. Some have instead come from backgrounds as hunters or sportsmen, either way using their skills to take down game for food or pleasure. Some few are completely self-taught, having found a knack for a missile weapon at a younger age, and have attempted to perfect their skills with it at the expense of their other training, or have taken up the bow as a means to defend a family homestead or just themselves. Few archers are trained in academic facilities. Archers tend to share a certain camaraderie, although they tend to look askance at those archers who specialize in a different weapon than they do. Bows are not seen as a weapon of valour – while it is the nobles on their steeds who charge into combat in plate mail with swords, it is the serfs and peasants who pick up the bow and strike from a distance. Thus few nobles ever become archers outside of the elven nations.

**Races:** Human archers range the gamut of experience and origins, although especially so among humans, archery is a sport of the rich, but only a military service for the poor. Dwarven archers are more rare than most races because they are often seen as less useful tactically in the confines of their underground homes and battlefields. Most are trained in the heavy crossbow instead of a longbow, and even more are actually fighters trained in crossbow handling. In fact, the typical ranged weapons of the race are most often hurled melee weapons instead of the missile weapons the archer specializes in. Elven archers are quite common, due in part to the elven skill with bows, elves are also the only race that does not see the profession of the archer as being one for the lower class, and many an elven noble has taken up the bow instead of sword. Half-orc archers are a rare, but brutal breed. Their great strength means that they seek out the most powerful composite longbows for their use, and this alone makes people look twice at a half-orc archer. Halfelves often take up the bow as both part of their elven heritage, but also because they are generally already looked down on by human society, and the bow is a lower class weapon. Gnome archers are usually trained as part of a local militia in either the use of sling or shortbow, depending on social rank and the richness of the militia group, some also specialize in the sling as a source of mischief, able to “tag” someone at significant distances and still have no visible weapon on their person. Halfling archers are a rare breed, as the race is best known for their thrown weapons instead of missiles. Most often, those halflings that do take this calling live in hostile areas or villages constantly at war, and train primarily in the use of the sling.

The archer class is also usable for those who would specialize in thrown weapons such as javelins and thrown rocks (a strange preference among some halfling societies).

**Other Classes:** Archers excel in environments where the enemy can be held at bay for them, avoiding melee combat is an essential goal for most archers. Therefore, the archer relies on others for support, fighters to keep the enemies at bay, clerics for healing, and rogues for scouting, to find the enemies while still distant enough for the archer to take full advantage of the situation. Of all the classes, archers often have the least respect for arcane spellcasters, as they see themselves as the precision artillery of a team, although they drudgingly respect the mass destructive capability of certain area of effect spells.

**Abilities:** Dexterity is of prime importance to archers, as their primary weapon is one of accuracy, not raw power. Strength is also useful, not only because sometimes fighting does come close enough to require melee weapons and skill, but because the best bows can be made to accommodate the advantage of a significant strength bonus.

**Class Features:**

All of the following are class features of the archer. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** The archer is proficient in the use of all simple and martial ranged weapons. He is also proficient in the use of all simple melee weapons and light martial weapons. The archer is proficient in light and medium armor, but not with shields. Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket and Tumble. Primary Weapon: When a character takes her first level of archer, one of the following ranged weapons is selected and is considered to be her primary weapon: heavy crossbow, light crossbow, longbow, shortbow, or sling. At 1st level the character receives a +2 competence bonus to all attacks made with her primary weapon. This bonus increases by one every five levels: at 5th level the bonus increases to +3, at 10th level the bonus increases to +4, at 15th level the bonus increases to +5, and at 20th level the bonus increases to +6. This bonus stacks with the bonus from the Weapon Focus feat, and any other competence bonuses to attack the archer may have.

**Point Blank Shot (Ex):** The archer gains the benefits of the Point Blank Shot feat at level 1, as long as he is in light or medium armor. This grants an additional +1 to attack and damage rolls made against targets within 30 feet. This ‘virtual feat’ also acts as the prerequisite for other archer-based feats.

**Pinpoint Accuracy (Ex):** At 2nd level and higher, the archer gains the benefits of the Pinpoint Accuracy feat (see the Feats chapter). By spending a full-round action doing nothing else but aiming at a target, the archer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his attack roll against that target. (Aiming can last up to three rounds, or the character’s Wisdom bonus in rounds, whichever is less, for a maximum of +6 to the attack roll on the fourth round.) The archer must use a full-attack action to make one attack that receives this bonus and he cannot be in an area threatened by an enemy while aiming or making the attack.

**Fletcher (Ex):** Beginning at 3rd level, the archer gains a competence bonus on all Craft (bowyer) checks equal to one-half the archer’s class level (rounded down).

**Extra Shot (Ex):** At 4th level, the archer can make one additional attack with his best attack bonus if he makes a full attack action. This extra shot stacks with the additional shot he may get with the Rapid Shot feat (although if using the Rapid Shot feat, all attacks that round are done at a –2 penalty, including the extra shot from this ability).

**Archery Feat (Ex):** At level 3 and every 4 levels thereafter, the archer gains a bonus feat that must be selected from the following list. The archer must meet all prerequisites for the feat to select it. Available archery feats: Dead Shot, Double Nock, Far Shot, High Ready, Improved Crossbow Handling, Improved Threatened Zone, Killing Shot, Mounted Archery, Master Mounted Archer, Overpenetrate, Perfect Shot, Precise Shot, Ranged Trip, Rapid Shot, Reactive Shot, Shot on the Run, Threaten Zone, Triple Nock.

**Dead Shot (Ex):** At 6th level and higher, the archer gains the benefits of the Dead Shot feat (see the Feats chapter). An archer with this feat is able to mitigate some of the benefits that a target would receive from cover. The degree of cover of cover a target receives from cover is reduced by one category, so long as the degree of cover is not total. For example, if a character were behind three-quarters cover for a cover bonus of +7 to AC, he would instead receive only a +4 cover bonus to AC, as if he were behind one-half cover. If the archer is unable to see his target, he is not able to make use of this ability. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with another feat or ability that gives a bonus to hit or damage a target with the benefit of cover.

**Weapon Specialization (Ex):** At 8th level, the archer becomes eligible to take the Weapon Mastery feat. He does not gain the feat as a bonus feat, and must still gain the feat normally.

**Improved Point-Blank Shot (Ex):** At 10th level, the archer’s ability to hit targets within 30 feet with his primary weapon improves. He gains a +2 competence bonus to hit and damage for these attacks. This ability supersedes (does not stack with) the Point-Blank Shot feat.

**Long-distance Accuracy (Ex):** At 14th level and higher, the archer does not receive a –2 penalty for firing into the second range increment of his primary weapon. Range penalties after the second range increment accumulate as normal. For example, an archer using a heavy crossbow with a range increment of 120 feet suffers a –2 penalty to his attack roll beginning at 240 feet, increasing by –2 for every 120 feet thereafter.

**Ranged Disarm (Ex):** At 18th level the archer may take a full attack action (using his primary weapon) to shoot something out of an opponent’s hand. The target of the attack must make a successful Reflex save versus the archer’s attack roll in order to maintain hold of whatever he has in his hand. The archer’s target gets a +4 bonus to his save for every size category of the item larger than Small. If the defender is carrying an item or wielding a weapon with two hands, he receives an additional +4 bonus to the save. If the defender fails the Reflex save, he drops the targeted item.

**Extended Range (Ex):** At 20th level the archer has the ability to shoot opponents (with his primary weapon) who are at a fantastic range. He may now shoot an additional 2 range increments. Standard range modifiers still apply.
