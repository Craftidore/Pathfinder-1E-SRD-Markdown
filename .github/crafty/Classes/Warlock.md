# Warlock
## Overview
Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master

the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike sorcerers or

wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of

spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing

more than an effort of will. By harnessing his innate magical

gift through fearsome determination and force of will, a warlock can perform feats of supernatural stealth,

beguile the weak-minded, or scour his foes with blasts

of eldritch power.

Adventures: Many warlocks are champions of dark

and chaotic powers. Long ago, they (or in some cases, their

ancestors) forged grim pacts with dangerous extraplanar

powers, trading portions of their souls in exchange for

supernatural power. While many warlocks have turned

away from evil, seeking to undo the wrongs of their

former colleagues, they are still chained by the old

pacts through which they acquired their powers. The

demand to further the designs of their dark patrons,

or to resist them, drives most warlocks to seek the

opportunities for power, wealth, and great deeds (for

good or ill) offered by adventuring.

Characteristics: Warlocks harbor great reserves

of mystical energy. The font of dark magic burning

in their souls makes them resistant to many forms

of attack and arms them with dangerous power.

Warlocks do not wield spells, but they do learn to

harness their power to perform a small number

of specifi c attacks and tricks called invocations.

Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by

being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers

or wizards.

Alignment: Warlocks are often chaotic or evil (and

more than a few are both). The powers they serve can

be cruel, capricious, and wild, unbound by conventional

views of right and wrong. However,

even warlocks who derive their powers from

the most sinister of patrons have

been known to turn the black

powers at their command

against evil. A good-aligned

warlock is a grim and fearsome

enemy of evil. All

too familiar with the

darkness lurking in his

heart, he gazes unfl inchingly

on the evil in others

and battles the foulest of

foes without fear.

Religion: Warlocks

know fi rsthand the power

of supernatural beings, so

they do not scorn religion.

Evil warlocks sometimes

seek the favor of cruel and

bloodthirsty deities, while

good warlocks often turn

to the worship of noble and

true deities for the strength

to win the battle raging in their

tortured souls.

Background: Warlocks are

born, not made. Some are the descendants

of people who traffi cked

with demons and devils long ago.

Some seek out the dark powers as

youths, driven by ambition or the desire

for power, but a few blameless

individuals are simply marked

out by the supernatural forces as

conduits and tools. The exact nature

of a warlock’s origin is up

to the player to decide; just as a

sorcerer is not beholden to the

magic-wielding ancestor that

bequeathed his bloodline with

arcane power, a warlock is not

bound to follow the source

that gifted him with magic.

Warlocks are not half-fi ends

or tiefl ings by default (although

many creatures of those kinds

become some of the most

powerful and terrifying

representatives of

the class). The mark

that the supernatural

powers leave on

their servants is often a mark in the soul, not the fl esh. In

fact, many warlocks are created by nonevil powers—

wild or fey forces that can be every bit as dangerous

as demons or devils. Whatever their origin, warlocks

are widely feared and misunderstood. Most are wanderers

who rarely stay in one place for long.

Races: Ambitious and often unprincipled,

humans are the most

likely to seek out the dangerous

shortcuts to power that

lead to life as warlocks.

Half-orcs are common

as warlocks as well,

since they often fi nd

that the powers that

create warlocks do

not discriminate

against individuals

of mixed

heritage.

Warlocks

of other

races are

rare at best.

Other

Classes:

The warlock

views

sorcerers and

wizards as bitter

rivals. He values the strength and

cleverness of resourceful fi ghters and

rogues but rarely gets along with clerics

or paladins. Of course, most warlocks

understand that it’s a bad idea to antagonize

their comrades (especially

those who hold the key to healing

magic), and so they work out an uneasy

truce with characters who otherwise

might ostracize them.

Role: A warlock serves much the

same role in an adventuring party

as a sorcerer or wizard would. He is

much more limited in his abilities

compared to the spell selection of

spellcasters, and he must rely on his

*eldritch blast* in place of the spell power

of an arcane caster. Like a bard, he

often fi ts best in a party that already

has another spellcaster or two, since

his unique abilities provide him

with little magic to use for his

companions’ benefi t.

GAME RULE INFORMATION

Warlocks have the following game statistics.

Abilities: A high Charisma score makes a warlock’s

invocations harder to resist. High Dexterity is very valuable

to a warlock, allowing him to better aim his eldritch blasts,

and a good Constitution score is also useful.

Alignment: Any evil or any chaotic.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the warlock.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Warlocks are profi cient

with all simple weapons. They are profi cient with light armor

but not with shields.

Because the somatic components required for warlock

invocations are relatively simple, a warlock can use any of

his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring

the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like arcane

spellcasters, a warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or

using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all

invocations, including *eldritch blast,* have a somatic component).

A multiclass warlock still incurs the normal arcane

spell failure chance for arcane spells received from levels in

other classes.

Invocations: A warlock does not prepare or cast spells

as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a

repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations

that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses

his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will,

with the following qualifi cations:

A warlock’s invocations are spell-like abilities; using an

invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks

of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a

spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a

Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he

is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would

be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by

making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking

attacks of opportunity. A warlock’s invocations are subject to

spell resistance unless an invocation’s description specifi cally

states otherwise. A warlock’s caster level with his invocations

is equal to his warlock level.

The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 +

equivalent spell level + the warlock’s Charisma modifi er.

Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock

cannot benefi t from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however,

benefi t from the Ability Focus feat (see page 303 of the *Monster*

*Manual*), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects

for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability

and Empower Spell-Like Ability (see pages 303 and 304 of

the *Monster Manual).*

The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative

power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins

with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the

lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns

new invocations, as summarized on Table 1–1 and described

below. A list of available invocations can be found following

this class description, and a complete description of each

invocation can be found in Chapter 4 of this book.

At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation,

he can also replace an invocation he already knows with

another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th

level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows

with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a

new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At

11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation

he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower

grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which

could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock

can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows

with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in

addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least,

lesser, greater, or dark).

Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations

are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described

under Weapon and Armor Profi ciency above. Warlocks

can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for

spellcasters; see Warlocks and Prestige Classes, page 18,

for details.

Eldritch Blast (Sp): The fi rst ability a warlock learns is

*eldritch blast.* A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power,

using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes

impart other debilitating effects.

An *eldritch blast* is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged

touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving

throw. An *eldritch blast* deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st

level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An

*eldritch blast* is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal

to one-half the warlock’s class level (round down), with a

minimum spell level of 1st and a maximum of 9th when a

warlock reaches 18th level or higher.

An *eldritch blast* is subject to spell resistance, although the

Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster

level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to *eldritch*

*blast.* An *eldritch blast* deals half damage to objects. Metamagic

feats cannot improve a warlock’s *eldritch blast* (because it is a

spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus

(*eldritch blast*) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any)

associated with a warlock’s *eldritch blast* by 2. See page 303 of

the *Monster Manual.*

Detect Magic (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, a warlock can

use *detect magic* as the spell at will. His caster level equals his

class level.

Damage Reduction (Su): Fortifi ed by the supernatural

power fl owing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to

physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage

reduction 1/cold iron. At 7th level and every four levels

thereafter, a warlock’s damage reduction improves as shown

on Table 1–1.

Deceive Item (Ex): At 4th level and higher, a warlock has

the ability to more easily commandeer magic items made

for the use of other characters. When making a Use Magic

Device check, a warlock can take 10 even if distracted or

threatened.

Fiendish Resilience (Su): Beginning at 8th level, a

warlock knows the trick of fi endish resilience. Once per day,

as a free action, he can enter a state that lasts for 2 minutes.

While in this state, the warlock gains fast healing 1.

At 13th level, a warlock’s fi endish resilience improves.

When in his fi endish resilience state, he gains fast healing 2

instead. At 18th level, a warlock’s fi endish resilience improves

to fast healing 5.

Energy Resistance (Su): At 10th level and higher, a

warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following

energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fi re, and sonic. Once the

types are chosen, this energy resistance cannot be changed.

At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 against the two

selected types of energy.

Imbue Item (Su): A warlock of 12th level or higher can

use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he

does not know the spells required to make an item (although

he must know the appropriate item creation feat). He can

substitute a Use Magic Device check (DC 15 + spell level for

arcane spells or 25 + spell level for divine spells) in place of

a required spell he doesn’t know or can’t cast.

If the check succeeds, the warlock can create the item as if

he had cast the required spell. If it fails, he cannot complete

the item. He does not expend the XP or gp costs for making

the item; his progress is simply arrested. He cannot retry this

Use Magic Device check for that spell until he gains a new

level.

WARLOCK INVOCATIONS

Warlocks choose the invocations they learn as they gain

levels, much like bards or sorcerers choose which spells to

learn. However, a warlock’s arcane repertoire is even more

limited than that of a sorcerer, and his invocations are spelllike

abilities, not spells.

In addition to its grade (least, lesser, greater, or dark),

every invocation has a spell level equivalent, which is used

in the calculation of save DCs and for other purposes. A

least invocation has a level equivalent of 1st or 2nd; a lesser,

3rd or 4th; a greater, 5th or 6th; and a dark invocation has a

level equivalent of 6th or higher (maximum 9th). The level

equivalent for each invocation is given in its description in

Chapter 4.

A warlock can dismiss any invocation as a standard action,

just as a wizard can dismiss a spell.

Invocations and Eldritch Blast: *Eldritch blast* is not an

invocation, but some invocations provide a warlock with

the ability to modify his *eldritch blast* or add new eldritch

attacks.

ELDRITCH ESSENCE INVOCATIONS

Some of a warlock’s invocations, such as *frightful blast,*

modify the damage or other effects of the warlock’s *eldritch*

*blast.* These are called eldritch essence invocations. Unless

noted otherwise, *eldritch blasts* modifi ed by eldritch essence

invocations deal damage normally in addition to imparting

the effects described in the invocation description.

A warlock can apply only one eldritch essence invocation

to a single *eldritch blast,* choosing from any of the eldritch

essence invocations that he knows. When a warlock applies

an eldritch essence invocation to his *eldritch blast,* the spell

level equivalent of the modifi ed blast is equal to the spelllevel

of the *eldritch blast* or of the eldritch essence invocation,

whichever is higher. If a warlock targets a creature with an eldritch essence blast that has immunity to the invocation’s

effect, it still takes the damage from the blast normally

(provided it isn’t also immune to the *eldritch blast*).

A warlock can apply an eldritch essence invocation and a

blast shape invocation (see below) to the same blast. When

a warlock uses both kinds of invocations to alter an *eldritch*

*blast,* the spell level equivalent is equal to the spell level of

the *eldritch blast,* the level of the eldritch essence invocation,

or the level of the blast shape invocation, whichever

is higher.

Example: Morthos, a 1st-level warlock, decides to make

his *eldritch blast* attack into a *frightful blast.* Morthos’s *eldritch*

*blast* is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell, while *frightful blast*

is an effect equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. His *frightful blast*

is thus the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

Least Eldritch Essence Invocations

Frightful Blast: Target must make Will save or become

shaken.

Sickening Blast: Target must make Fortitude save or

become sickened.

Lesser Eldritch Essence Invocations

Beshadowed Blast: Target must make Fortitude save or

become blind for 1 round.

Brimstone Blast: Blast deals fi re damage and target must

make Refl ex save or catch fi re.

Hellrime Blast: Blast deals cold damage and target must

make Fortitude save or take –2 penalty to Dexterity.

Greater Eldritch Essence Invocations

Bewitching Blast: Target must make Will save or be

*confused* for 1 round.

Noxious Blast: Target must make Fortitude save or be

nauseated.

Repelling Blast: Target must make Refl ex save or be

knocked back.

Vitriolic Blast: Blast ignores spell resistance and deals

acid damage for several rounds.

Dark Eldritch Essence Invocation

Utterdark Blast: Target must make Fortitude save or gain

two negative levels.

BLAST SHAPE INVOCATIONS

Some of a warlock’s invocations, such as *eldritch spear,* modify

the range, target(s), or area of a warlock’s *eldritch blast.* These

are called blast shape invocations. Unless noted otherwise,

*eldritch blasts* subject to blast shape invocations deal damage

normally in addition to imparting the effects described in the

invocation description. A warlock can apply only one blast

shape at a time to an *eldritch blast,* and he can choose from

any of the blast shape invocations that he knows. A warlock

need not apply a blast shape invocation to his *eldritch blast.*

When a warlock applies a blast shape invocation to his *eldritch*

*blast,* the spell-level equivalent is equal to the spell level of

the *eldritch blast* or of the blast shape invocation, whichever

is higher.

A warlock can apply a blast shape invocation and an eldritch

essence invocation (see Eldritch Essence Invocations above)

to the same blast. When a warlock uses an eldritch essence

and a blast shape to alter an *eldritch blast,* the spell-level

equivalent is equal to the spell level of the *eldritch blast,* the

eldritch essence invocation, or the blast shape invocation,

whichever is higher.

Example: Morthos decides to make his *eldritch blast* attack

a *hellrime eldritch spear.* As a 6th-level warlock, Morthos’s

*eldritch blast* is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell. *Eldritch spear*

is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell, while *hellrime blast* is

the equivalent of a 4th-level spell. His *hellrime eldritch spear*

is therefore the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Least Blast Shape Invocations

Eldritch Spear: Blast range increases to 250 feet.

Hideous Blow: Melee attack channels *eldritch blast.*

Lesser Blast Shape Invocation

Eldritch Chain: Blast jumps from initial target to secondary

targets.

Greater Blast Shape Invocation

Eldritch Cone: Blast takes the shape of a cone.

Dark Blast Shape Invocation

Eldritch Doom: Blast affects all enemies within 20 feet.

**OTHER INVOCATIONS**
