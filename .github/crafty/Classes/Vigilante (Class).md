# Vigilante (Class)
## Overview
Life can be unfair. Think of the starving peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with building the king’s newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week. There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they see all around them.

Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place. Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either case, the vigilante is a character of two natures—the face that everyone knows and the mask that inspires fear.

**Role:** A vigilante can take on many tasks within a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in dangerous environments.

**Alignment:** Any.

**Hit Die:** d8.

**Starting Wealth:** 5d6 × 10 (average 175 gp).

**CLASS SKILLS**

A vigilante’s class skills are [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (Dex), [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] (Cha), [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] (Str), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] (Dex), [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] (Cha), [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] (Dex), [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) (Int), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) (Int), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (Wis), [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (Cha), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] (Dex), [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] (Wis), [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] (Dex), [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (Dex), [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] (Wis), [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] (Str), and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] (Cha).

**CLASS FEATURES**

The following are the class features of the vigilante. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Vigilantes are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Dual Identity (Ex):** A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante’s true identity revealed to the world at large.

The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante’s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a *[[Hat of Disguise|hat of disguise]]* and similar spells and effects that change the user’s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.

Despite being a single person, a vigilante’s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity’s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante’s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.

Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.

**Seamless Guise (Ex):** A vigilante knows how to behave in a way that appears perfectly proper and normal for his current identity. Should anyone suspect him of being anything other than what he appears to be while either in his social or vigilante identity, he can attempt a [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check with a +20 circumstance bonus to appear as his current identity, and not as his other identity.

**Social Talent:** Starting at 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a social talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet other prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as having another social talent or attaining a minimum vigilante level. Once a talent has been chosen, it cannot be changed.

*Any Guise (Su):* A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldn’t normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead. A vigilante must be at least 17th level and have the everyman social talent to select this talent.

*Case the Joint (Ex):* The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location’s layout (such as a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check to sneak into the location, a [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check to disable an alarm, or a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can’t case the same joint more than once a week.

*Celebrity Discount (Ex):* The vigilante’s social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90% of the market price, rather than the full price. If he has the great renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 2,000 gp, and if he possesses the incredible renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 8,000 gp. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.

*Celebrity Perks (Ex):* The vigilante is a celebrity in his area of renown, and adoring fans are all too eager to shower him with the fundamental necessities. While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to 1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of 1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth 1 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently). If he has the great renown social talent, he can receive gifts of up to 5 gp, receive fine food and lodgings (worth up to 10 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 10 gp or less. If he has incredible renown, he can receive gifts of up to 25 gp, receive exquisite food and lodgings (worth up to 100 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 100 gp or less. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.

*Double Time (Ex):* The vigilante’s social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day’s work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he’s chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.

*Everyman (Su):* The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn’t grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante’s training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks to properly play the part of the individual. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the many guises social talent to select this talent.

*Feign Innocence (Ex):* The vigilante’s social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the *innocence* spell. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to take this talent.

*Gossip Collector (Ex):* The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baff ling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 × 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn’t allow him to gather information that isn’t available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.

*Great Renown (Ex):* The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks from his renown social talent while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6. A vigilante must be at least 7th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.

*Immediate Change (Ex):* The vigilante can change identities as a move action, and he no longer needs to spend extra time to adjust his appearance and persona. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and must have the quick change social talent to select this talent.

*In Vogue (Ex):* The vigilante’s crafting or professional business is always at the height of the local trends, allowing the vigilante to gain more profits than usual. Goods he crafts with a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time and social grace social talents to take this talent.

*Incredible Renown (Ex):* The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 25,000 individuals (a large city) or up to two smaller cities of no more than 10,000 individuals each (two small cities). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus to [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] from his great renown social talent while in he is in his vigilante identity increases to +8. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the great renown social talent to select this talent.

*Instant Recognition (Ex):* The vigilante is so well known that his name precedes him, even to other communities. It only takes 4 hours of effort to get the word out to transfer his renown benefits to a new community. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and have both the incredible renown and triumphant return social talents to select this talent. 

*Loyal Aid (Ex):* The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level.

In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information about the vigilante and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week.

Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.

*Many Guises (Ex):* The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a [[Hat of Disguise|hat of disguise]]), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.

*Mockingbird (Ex):* The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the *[[Ghost Sound (Spell)|ghost sound]]**,* *[[Ventriloquism (Spell)|ventriloquism]]**,* and *vocal alteration* spells. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to choose this talent.

*Quick Change (Ex):* The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check. A vigilante must be at least 7th level to select this talent.

*Renown (Ex):* The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies.

While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village, if using settlement population ranges on page 203 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person’s initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill description on pages 93–94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information).

While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level.

A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that’s one category worse, rather than one category better.

*Safe House (Ex):* The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn’t have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can’t be located by any effect that is less powerful than a [[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]] spell. At 7th level, this protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house. At 13th level, the entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage’s private sanctum]]**.* 

*Social Grace:* The vigilante selects any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] or [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]]. Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with the selected skill. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.

*Subjective Truth (Ex):* The vigilante’s disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as [[Discern Lies (Spell)|discern lies]], and he can say it in effects such as *[[Zone of Truth (Spell)|zone of truth]]* that force him to speak the truth. A vigilante must be at least 9th level and have the feign innocence social talent to select this talent.

**Triumphant Return (Ex):** The vigilante’s tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.

**Vigilante Specialization (Ex):** At 1st level, a vigilante must choose to be either an avenger or a stalker.

An avenger gains a base attack bonus equal to his vigilante level instead of using those listed on Table 1–1. He adds this value to any other base attack bonus gained from other classes or racial Hit Dice as normal.

A stalker gains an ability called hidden strike, which allows him to deal an extra 1d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks (or ranged attacks from within 30 feet) against foes who are unaware of his presence, who consider him an ally, or who are made [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] by startling appearance (see page 17). This extra damage increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 2 vigilante levels thereafter. A stalker vigilante can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage dice are reduced to d4s. A stalker can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).

Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed. While many vigilante talents are usable by both specializations, some are unique to each specialization. A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent marked with an asterisk (\*) to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante’s presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.

**Vigilante Talent:** Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can’t be changed.

If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check against the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s level + the vigilante’s Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.

*Another Day (Ex, Su):* When the vigilante is dropped [[Unconscious|unconscious]] due to hit point damage, he automatically stabilizes, but he can also appear to be dead, unless an examining creature succeeds at a [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (DC = 20 + the vigilante’s class level) or, if using magic such as *[[Deathwatch (Spell)|deathwatch]]*, a caster level check with the same DC (the ability to affect spells is supernatural; the rest of the ability is extraordinary). The vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the Constitution check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).

*Armor Skin (Ex):* The vigilante’s armor is like a second skin. He doesn’t apply the armor check penalty for light and medium armor on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], or [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks. This penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, he can move at full speed in medium armor.

*Blind Spot (Ex):* The vigilante is so skilled at stealth, he can use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to hide from creatures with unusual senses that normally automatically detect creatures. This includes senses such as [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsense]], [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|blindsight]], [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|lifesense]], [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]], or [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]]. For each such ability that the creature possesses, if the vigilante is not bypassing the sense in another way—such as the *[[Negate Aroma (Spell)|negate aroma]]* spell for [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] or flying for [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]]—the creature gains a stacking +20 circumstance bonus on all [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to notice the vigilante, rather than automatically noticing the vigilante. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 6th level can select this talent.

*Chase Master (Ex):* Whether he is the pursuer or the pursued, few can best a vigilante at a chase. He receives a bonus on all checks during a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) equal to half his vigilante level or +4, whichever is greater.

*Close the Gap (Ex):* Each round, at the start of his turn, the vigilante can designate one foe within 20 feet that isn’t adjacent to him. When he moves, he doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity from that foe as long as he ends his move adjacent to that foe. If he charges that foe, he does not take the –2 penalty to his AC on any attacks made by the designated foe.

*Combat Skill (Ex):* The vigilante gains any one combat feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat, but he is treated as though he had a number of fighter levels equal to half his vigilante level for the purpose of qualifying for this feat. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent, but he can select this talent more than once; each time he must select a different feat.

*Cunning Feint (Ex):* The vigilante can [[Feint|feint]] as a move action or in place of his first attack during a full attack. At 8th level, when the vigilante successfully feints, the opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks until the vigilante’s next turn.

*Environment Weapon (Ex):* When the vigilante gains this talent, he must select one type of terrain from the ranger’s list of favored terrains. While in this terrain, as a swift action the vigilante can find an improvised weapon if there are any loose or moveable objects around (subject to the GM’s discretion). He doesn’t take a penalty for using these improvised weapons. For example, if the vigilante selected the urban environment, he might attack a foe with a chair, an empty bottle, or even a door. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the vigilante can select an additional type of terrain.

*Evasive (Ex):* The vigilante is hard to catch with area attacks. He gains the evasion ability, and at 12th level, he gains the [[Improved Evasion|improved evasion]] ability. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.

*Expose Weakness (Ex):* The vigilante is able to use sneaky tricks to make it easier to damage a foe, whether it is throwing a bit of fine dust of [[Iron, Cold|cold iron]] over a fey creature or melting a glob of silver onto a lycanthrope’s hide. The vigilante can add the ability to reduce a creature’s [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|damage reduction]] or [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|hardness]] by 10 to the list of options when attempting a dirty trick combat maneuver check (Advanced Player’s Guide 320). This does not stack with itself, and it does not work against creatures with DR/—.

*Favored Maneuver (Ex):* The vigilante selects one type of combat maneuver to be a favored maneuver. He gains the Improved feat corresponding to that combat maneuver (if one exists). He gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks with that combat maneuver against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence at the start of his combat maneuver. A vigilante can select this talent more than once. Each time, it applies to a different combat maneuver.

*Fist of the Avenger (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] as a bonus feat, if he doesn’t have this feat already. In addition, whenever he successfully attacks with his fist or a gauntlet, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1, maximum of +5). Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.

*Foe Collision\* (Ex):* The vigilante can shove one of his foes into another. When the vigilante deals hidden strike damage to a corporeal foe with a melee attack, he can also deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to his reduced hidden strike damage to an opponent adjacent to the first (even if the second opponent is out of his reach). The damage is bludgeoning damage, and if the colliding foe has any natural attacks, the damage is also considered magic, evil, or any other type of damage the natural attack deals. Unlike normal vigilante talents that affect hidden strikes, this vigilante talent applies in all cases when the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.

*Heavy Training (Ex):* The vigilante gains Heavy Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat, if he does not have that feat already. The armor skin vigilante talent also applies to heavy armor. At 16th level, if the vigilante has the armor skin vigilante talent, he can move at full speed in heavy armor. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent. 

*Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):* The vigilante can use [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] to hide even when being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of dim light (his own shadow doesn’t count), he can hide without anything to actually hide behind. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 8th level can select this talent.

*Inspired Vigilante (Ex):* The vigilante’s powers of deduction are far beyond the norm. This ability functions similarly to the investigator’s inspiration ability, but the vigilante’s inspiration pool is equal to his class level (do not add his Intelligence modifier), the vigilante can never use this ability without expending a use of inspiration, and it doesn’t count as inspiration for any effects that interact with or require the inspiration class feature.

*Leave an Opening\* (Ex):* The vigilante’s hidden strike leaves an unbalancing opening in a foe’s defenses, setting up the foe to be attacked again. At the beginning of the foe’s next turn, if the vigilante threatens the foe, the foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the vigilante. Multiple attacks against the same foe don’t create multiple attacks of opportunity in the same round (but attacks against several foes can cause each to provoke one attack of opportunity). Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.

*Lethal Grace (Ex):* The vigilante combines strength and speed into incredibly deadly attacks. He gains [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] as a bonus feat, and if he already has the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]]. When using [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] to make a melee attack using his Dexterity bonus on attack rolls and his Strength bonus on damage rolls, he also adds half his vigilante level on damage rolls. This bonus damage is not reduced or increased if the vigilante is wielding a weapon two-handed or in an off-hand.

*Living Shield (Ex):* As an immediate action whenever the vigilante is grappling a creature and is targeted by an attack, he can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target of his [[Grapple|grapple]] (this combat maneuver check doesn’t count as a grapple combat maneuver check). If he succeeds, the creature he is grappling becomes the new target of the attack. If the check fails, the creature escapes the [[Grapple|grapple]] and the vigilante is the target of the attack as normal. This ability must be used after the attack is declared against the vigilante, but before the attack is made and the results revealed.

*Mad Rush (Ex):* Whenever the vigilante charges, he can make a full attack. Whenever he uses this ability, he takes a –4 penalty to his AC until the start of his next turn (in addition to the AC penalty for charging). Only an avenger vigilante of at least 12th level can select this talent.

*Mighty Ambush\* (Ex):* Once per round, when the vigilante succeeds at a hidden strike, he can instantly drop the damaged enemy [[Unconscious|unconscious]] for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s class level + the higher of the vigilante’s Strength and Dexterity modifiers). Whether or not a creature’s saving throw is successful, it can’t be affected by that vigilante’s mighty ambush again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 10th level can select this talent.

*Nothing Can Stop Me (Ex):* Once per round, while the vigilante is moving, he can make one attack as a free action against an unattended object in the way of his path, such as a door or table. If his attack deals enough damage to destroy the object, he can continue to move. If he doesn’t destroy the object, his move ends. This attack is made as part of his move action and doesn’t count against his attacks this round. If his attack inadvertently targets a creature (such as a mimic), it automatically misses and his move ends (although he can still attack the creature as normal at the end of his movement). Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.

*Perfect Fall (Ex):* As long as there is a wall or another surface within arm’s reach, the vigilante never takes falling damage. Even if no surface is available, he takes only half damage from falling and lands on his feet.

*Perfect Vulnerability (Ex):* As a standard action, the vigilante can cleverly strike his foe where that foe is weakest. This attack targets the foe’s touch AC, and the foe is denied her Dexterity bonus against the attack. Once a foe has been the target of perfect vulnerability, she can’t be the target of the same vigilante’s perfect vulnerability for 24 hours. A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.

*Pull into the Shadows (Ex):* As a full-round action, the vigilante can move up to his speed toward an opponent who is unaware of his presence (or who considers him an ally) and make a single attack against that opponent. If the attack hits, he can attempt a drag combat maneuver (Advanced Player’s Guide 321) against that enemy with a +4 bonus and without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the drag succeeds, the vigilante doesn’t need to have enough movement remaining to move with the enemy. The vigilante can’t use this ability on a true ally or a willing target.

*Returning Weapon (Ex):* The vigilante has a signature type of thrown weapon that returns to him. Choose a type of thrown weapon, such as throwing axes. Whenever the vigilante uses that type of weapon, it automatically returns as if it had the [[Returning (MagWpnSpcAb)|returning]] property. At 14th level, if the vigilante chose a type of thrown weapon that is treated as ammunition, such as shuriken, and buys a set of 50 magic ammunition of that type, he automatically replenishes them at no cost and never runs out. If he chose a non-ammunition thrown weapon instead, he can apply the magical properties of the first weapon he throws in a round to any nonmagical thrown weapons of that type he throws that round. This allows him to make a full attack with the benefits of his magical thrown weapon, even though it only returns next round.

*[[Rogue Talent]]** (Ex):* The vigilante gains a single rogue talent (not an advanced talent) of his choice. If he selects a rogue talent marked with an asterisk (\*), that talent applies to his hidden strikes instead of to sneak attacks, and the talent counts as a stalker vigilante talent with an asterisk (\*) for the limitation of only one applying to a given hidden strike. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.

*Rooftop Infiltrator (Ex):* The vigilante gains a climb speed equal to half his base speed, which increases to his full base speed when climbing a rope.

*Shadow’s Sight (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]] and [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]] 60 feet. If he already had [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]], its range increases by 30 feet.

Shadow’s Speed (Ex): The vigilante’s base speed increases by 10 feet. At 10th level, it increases by an additional 10 feet.

*Shield of Blades (Ex):* The vigilante’s wild attacks allow him to block his foes’ counterattacks. He gains [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] as a bonus feat. If he already has the [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]]. When he takes an attack or full attack action, if he uses [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] on every attack to make melee attacks that use his Strength bonus on attack rolls, he gains a shield bonus to his AC until his next turn equal to his penalty on attack rolls from [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]]. This bonus applies only if he actually takes that penalty on at least one of the attack rolls.

*Shield of Fury (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Improved Shield Bash (Feat)|Improved Shield Bash]] as a bonus feat. If he already has the [[Improved Shield Bash (Feat)|Improved Shield Bash]] feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose [[Improved Shield Bash (Feat)|Improved Shield Bash]]. In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he is treated as if he has the [[Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat as long as one of the weapons used is a shield. This allows him to take feats that require [[Two-Weapon Fighting]] as a prerequisite without meeting the [[Two-Weapon Fighting]] or Dexterity prerequisites, but these feats only apply while he is wielding a shield as one of his weapons (unless he takes [[Two-Weapon Fighting]] as normal, in which case this restriction is lifted).

*Signature Weapon (Ex):* The vigilante must select one type of weapon (such as longsword or crossbow) when he gains this talent. He gains [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] as a bonus feat for his selected weapon type. If he already has the [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] feat with the selected weapon, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he chose [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] in the selected weapon. At 8th level, he also gains [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]] as a bonus feat for his selected weapon. He doesn’t have to meet any of the prerequisites for these feats. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.

*Silent Dispatch (Ex):* When the vigilante ambushes an enemy or enemies unaware of his presence, he can attempt a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check at a –5 penalty. The result indicates the DC of [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to hear the vigilante’s attacks until an opponent’s first action, when the DC returns to the normal –10 for hearing battle. Other enemies present can still see the attack; this talent only prevents the sounds of battle from alerting others.

*Sniper (Ex):* The vigilante can deal hidden strike damage with ranged attacks at any distance, rather than within 30 feet. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 6th level can select this talent.

*Stalker Sense (Ex):***** The vigilante has a sense for danger. He always acts on the surprise round. At 6th level, he gains uncanny dodge, and at 12th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge. Only a stalker can select this talent.

*Strike the Unseen (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]] as a bonus feat. He can also deal hidden strike damage against targets with total concealment. At 10th level, he gains Improved Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and can deal all types of precision damage against targets with concealment or total concealment. At 16th level, he gains Greater Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. The vigilante does not have to meet the prerequisites for either Improved Blind-Fight or Greater Blind-Fight to gain these feats with this talent.

*Sucker-Punch (Ex):* Whenever the vigilante attacks a foe that is unaware of his presence (or who views him as an ally), and the attack deals nonlethal damage, the attack deals an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This additional damage increases by 1d6 at each of 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.

*Sure-Footed (Ex):* The vigilante can move at full speed while using the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] and [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skills without penalty. At 8th level, he can move at full speed across difficult terrain.

*Surprise Strike (Ex):* The vigilante gains a greater advantage when his foe is unable to defend herself. Whenever he makes an attack against a foe that is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, he gains a +1 bonus on his attack roll. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level and to +3 at 16th level.

*Throat Jab\* (Ex):* The vigilante’s hidden strike jabs his opponent in the throat, preventing that opponent from speaking until the vigilante’s next turn. (If the vigilante uses this ability on the surprise round, it lasts until the end of his first full turn after the surprise round.) This prevents the target from calling out for help, using spells with verbal components, or doing anything else that requires speaking. The target cannot be affected by that vigilante’s throat jab again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 4th level can select this talent.

*Twisting Fear (Ex):* Whenever the vigilante causes an opponent to gain the [[Shaken|shaken]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or [[Panicked|panicked]] condition, that opponent takes an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the vigilante’s reduced hidden strike damage, as the stress wears upon its body. A creature can’t take damage from twisting fear more than once per round. [[Panicked]] creatures that take damage from twisting fear are too winded even to scream as they flee in terror. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.

*Unexpected Strike (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] as a bonus feat. At 8th level, he can draw hidden weapons as a swift action (instead of a move action).

*Unkillable (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Diehard (Feat)|Diehard]] as a bonus feat, though he does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat. At 6th level, he doesn’t lose hit points when he takes a standard action while [[Disabled|disabled]]. At 12th level, when he would die from hit point damage, he remains alive for 1 round before [[Dying|dying]] (and if his hit points rise above a negative amount equal to his Constitution score before that round is over, he doesn’t die). At 18th level, he is no longer [[Disabled|disabled]] at negative hit points and can take a full round’s worth of actions. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.

*Up Close and Personal (Ex):* When the vigilante attempts an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check to move through an opponent’s space during a move action, he can attempt a single melee attack against that opponent as a swift action. If the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check succeeds, this attack applies the vigilante’s hidden strike damage as if the foe were unaware of the vigilante. Otherwise, the vigilante applies the hidden strike damage he would deal if the target were denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 4th level can select this talent.

*Vital Punishment (Ex):* The vigilante gains [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]] as a bonus feat, though he does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat. Once per round, before he makes an attack of opportunity, he can declare it to be a vital punishment. If the attack hits, the vigilante can apply the [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]] feat. The vigilante can apply the Improved Vital Strike or [[Greater Vital Strike (Feat)|Greater Vital Strike]] feat as his vital punishment instead if he later gains those feats. A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.

**Unshakable (Ex):** Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante adds his class level to the DC of any attempts to [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] him.

**Startling Appearance (Ex):** At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante’s presence (usually due to [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] or [[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]), the foe is treated as [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] for the rest of the vigilante’s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge). The foe also takes a –4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante’s next turn.

**Frightening Appearance (Ex):** At 11th level, whenever a vigilante with this ability makes an attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence (see startling appearance above), the vigilante can, as a free action, attempt an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize the target of his attack and any enemies within 10 feet who can see the attack. This check is attempted before the attack roll against the foe is made and resolved. The vigilante rolls only one [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check and applies the result to all the targets. If the check succeeds against the target of the vigilante’s attack, that foe is also [[Frightened|frightened]] for 1 round, in addition to being [[Shaken|shaken]] as normal, unless the foe succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s class level + his Charisma modifier).

Once a creature has been the target of this ability (either as the target of the attack or as a nearby creature, regardless of whether or not it was successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s frightening appearance for 24 hours. This effect is in addition to the bonuses gained from the startling appearance ability. This is a [[Mind-Affecting Spells|mind-affecting]] fear effect.

**Stunning Appearance (Ex):** At 17th level, a vigilante can leave his foes unable to respond when he appears. Whenever a vigilante with this ability makes a successful attack against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante’s presence (see startling appearance), the foe must make a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante’s class level + his Charisma modifier) or be [[Stunned|stunned]] until the end of the vigilante’s next turn. If the creature has more HD than the vigilante’s class level, it receives a +4 circumstance bonus on this save. This ability is in addition to the effects of startling appearance and frightening appearance. Once a creature has been the target of this ability (regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful), it is immune to that vigilante’s stunning appearance for 24 hours. This is a [[Mind-Affecting Spells|mind-affecting]] fear effect.

**Vengeance Strike (Ex):** At 20th level, a vigilante can study a target to strike more viciously. He can spend up to 5 standard actions, which all must be in consecutive rounds. On the following round, he can make a vengeance strike against the studied creature. The target must remain unaware of the vigilante’s presence (or not see him as a threat) until the attack. For each round spent studying the target, the vigilante grants himself one of the following benefits on his vengeance strike: gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the attack roll, deal an additional 3d6 points of precision damage if he hits, or treat the attack roll as if it were 2 higher for the purposes of determining whether the attack hit or threatens a critical hit (to maximum effective roll of 20). Each round of study can be spent in a different way or the same way (they stack with each other), but each round of study must be allocated before the attack roll is made. If the vigilante is an avenger, he automatically confirms any critical hits threatened by his vengeance strike. If the vigilante is a stalker and would normally be able to add a special effect from a vigilante talent with an asterisk (\*) to this attack, he can instead add two special effects to his vengeance strike.
