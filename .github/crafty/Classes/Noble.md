# Noble
## Overview
*“My words are my weapons, my wit my armor. You may have*

*strength, speed, and talent with that steel bar of yours, but can*

*you face my mind?”*

—Elise Grosette, ex-Councilor

The noble is the king of interaction; he is the social elite, the commander

of soldiers, the master of information, and the handler of political

power, all rolled into one. In many fantasy campaigns, the noble is the

member of the ruling class who, by birthright, has been tasked with

governing the commoners under his influence. Similarly, nobles can be

classified as anyone in a position of leadership who has received special

training to perform in such a capacity. More than wealthy landowners,

there are many heads of organizations, military commanders, and even

natural-born leaders drawn from the lower classes who may function

as nobles even though they lack social class or standing.

Most true nobles are members of a noble house, an organization based

on the noble family that exerts great influence over the politics and

the people around them. Some nobles, such as those who serve in the

military, come from some type of officer-training background that

instills the knowledge they need to be an effective leader. Other nobles,

such as those who lead less regal (and legal) organizations, promote

themselves through their own talents and leadership ability.

Creating a Noble

The noble is an exceptional leader, blessed with natural social abilities.

Whether manipulating others into doing his will or steeling the

resolve of outnumbered troops, the noble is always in control of himself and his followers. A master of subtlety and social interaction,

the noble reads emotions and actions like words on a page and uses

that knowledge as a weapon or lure depending on the situation.

Abilities

Charisma is the most important ability for the noble, as almost all

social skills depend on it. Intelligence and Wisdom can both be of

great benefit to a noble, as they expand his skills and enhance his

perception. Nobles with an emphasis on combat need high physical

skills, as with any martial-oriented character.

Races

Humans are the most common race to choose the noble class as their

political power structures lend themselves best to the leadership-bybirthright

philosophy that the noble relies upon for power. Elves and

dwarves are the second most likely races to be nobles, as each has its

share of commanders and leaders who use their talents at interaction

to succeed. Less likely nobles are half-elves and half-orcs—often

outcast from society, they frequently have an uphill battle when

trying to rise in station. However, members of these races could easily

become mercenary leaders giving them an entry into the noble class.

Halfling nobles are more likely to be mayors and community leaders

than aristocracy, while gnomes follow a similar pattern, being guild

leaders and family leaders.

Alignment

Since a noble prefers to be in control of himself and those around

him, he tends towards law. A noble determines his motivations from the good-evil axis, such that benevolent leaders are typically good

while despots, absorbed with themselves and their achievements,

gravitate toward evil.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the noble class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency

The noble is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and all

armor and shields (except tower shields).

Inspire (Ex)

The noble has the ability to unlock the potential for greatness in those

around him and overwhelm his enemies with feelings of inferiority

and weakness. At 1st level and every three levels thereafter, the

noble may select an inspire ability from any of those described here.

His target must be within 60 feet and she must be able to hear the

noble clearly. For most inspire abilities to take effect, the noble must

succeed on a Leadership check (1d20 + the noble’s Leadership score).

If the check succeeds, the targets gain the benefits or drawbacks of

the effect for a number of rounds equal to one-half the noble’s class

level (minimum 1 round). For each additional target beyond the first

within range and he would affect, increase the DC by 2.

The noble may only have one inspire ability active at a time. If he

activates a second ability, the first immediately ends. Using an inspire

ability requires a standard action that does not provoke an attack of

opportunity. He may use the ability as a swift action, but the DC

increases by 10 and the effects last just 1 round. All inspire abilities

are extraordinary, mind-affecting effects.

The noble may use inspire once per day per class level.

*Awe:* The noble’s mere presence overcomes his target. The noble must

make a Leadership check opposed by his target’s modified level check

(1d20 + its level + its Wisdom modifier + any bonuses against fear).

Against multiple targets, just roll once. If the noble’s check succeeds, the

target is dazed. Each round the effect persists, the target is entitled to

another modified level check to throw off the effects of awe. In addition,

if at any time the noble attacks the target, the effect immediately ends.

*Competence:* The noble helps focus a target’s attention on a particular

task. If he succeeds on a DC 10 Leadership check, his target gains a

+2 competence bonus on all skill checks.

*Complacency:* The noble causes a target to relax and let down his

guard. If he succeeds on a DC 15 Leadership check, his target takes

a –5 competence penalty on Perception checks and a –2 competence

penalty on *sleep* spells and effects.

*Courage:* The noble bolsters his allies against fear. If he succeeds on

a DC 15 Leadership check, his target receives a +1 morale bonus on

saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus

on attack and weapon damage rolls.

*Fear:* The noble’s presence disturbs his foes, filling them with fear. He

must make a Leadership check opposed by his target’s modified level

check (1d20 + its level + its Wisdom modifier + any bonuses against

fear). Against multiple targets, just roll once. If the check succeeds,

the target is shaken. If the noble beats his target’s check by 5 or more,

the target is cowering instead.

*Fury:* The noble incites his target to acts of reckless violence.

When used on a willing target, the noble must succeed on a DC

20 Leadership check. Against an unwilling target, the noble must

make a Leadership check opposed by his target’s modified level

check (1d20 + its level + its Wisdom modifier + any bonuses against

enchantment effects). Against multiple targets, just roll once. If the

noble succeeds on the check, his target enters a screaming rage, as if

under the effects of the *rage* spell.

*Greatness:* The noble may inspire greatness in an ally, encouraging

her to greater fighting ability. If the noble succeeds on a DC 25

Leadership check, his target gains 10 temporary hit points, a +2

competence bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on

Fortitude saves.

*Heroics:* The noble fills his target with tremendous heroism. If he

succeeds on a DC 30 Leadership check, his target gains a +4 morale

bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.

Leadership

At 1st level, the noble gains the Leadership feat, even if he does

not meet the prerequisites. His cohort’s level is still limited to two

less than his character level, so the noble must be at least 3rd level

to gain a 1st-level cohort. In addition to the normal benefits of the

Leadership feat, the noble uses his Leadership score to utilize many

of his other class features.

Material Aid (Ex)

A noble has certain expectations when it comes to dealing with his

own kind and so he can exploit the standing obligations of hospitality

maintained by local rulers and other nobles. As long as the noble

travels in his homeland or a land friendly to his homeland, he need

never pay for food or lodging, as the noble gains these things from

the local aristocracy. This ability may extend to his adventuring party

depending on the noble, his nature, and motivations as determined

by the GM.

Breeding (Ex)

The noble’s station creates more opportunities to learn and study

under a variety of masters, giving him advanced training in a variety

of areas. At 2nd level, he selects one area of expertise. He gains that

expertise’s novice ability. At 5th level and every three levels thereafter,

he may improve an existing area of expertise, gaining the next level

of master (student, master, and finally savant), or select a new area of

expertise, gaining the novice ability of that discipline.

Arcane Training

The noble has spent time under the tutelage of a wizard, sorcerer, or

some other practitioner of arcane magic. To select this type of training,

he must have an Intelligence or Charisma score of 11 or higher.

*Novice:* The noble gains a +4 competence bonus divided as he chooses

between, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (planes), Spellcraft, and

Use Magic Device.

*Student:* The noble may cast *detect magic* and *read magic* each once

per day as spell-like abilities. His caster level equals one-half his class

level. If he also has the Student ability of Religious Training, he may

cast each of these spells twice per day.

*Master:* If the noble has class levels in an arcane spellcasting class, he

increases the caster level in that class by one. Otherwise, he selects one

0-level and one 1st-level sorcerer/wizard spell. He may cast each spell

as a spell-like ability once per day. His caster level equals one-half his

class level. The save DC, if any, is Intelligence- or Charisma-based.

*Savant:* If the noble has class levels in an arcane spellcasting class, he

increases the caster level in that class by one. Otherwise, he selects

one 0-level, one 1st-level, and one 2nd-level sorcerer/wizard spell.

He may cast each spell as a spell-like ability once per day. The noble’s

caster level equals one-half his class level. The save DC, if any, is

Intelligence- or Charisma-based.

Diplomatic Training

The noble has been trained in the arts of diplomacy and negotiation.

He must have a Charisma score of 11 or higher to select this area

of expertise.

*Novice:* The noble gains fluency in an extra three languages (except

secret languages such as Druidic).

*Student:* If the noble makes a DC 25 Sense Motive check as a swift

action, he may add his Intelligence bonus as an insight bonus to a

Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the target of his Sense

Motive check. The noble may only use this ability when interacting

with creatures of his type (humanoid, monstrous humanoid, and

so on).

*Master:* The noble can urge a target to take a particular course of

action. He must make a Leadership check opposed by the target’s

modified level check (1d20 + its level + its Wisdom modifier + any

bonuses against mind-affecting effects). If the check succeeds, the

noble affects his target as if he targeted her with the *suggestion* spell.

This is an extraordinary ability.

*Savant:* The noble gains a +4 circumstance bonus to his Leadership

score for the purpose of determining his cohort’s and followers’

levels.

Illicit Training

The noble gained an unconventional education from criminal

and unsavory people likely far below his station. He must have

Intelligence and Dexterity scores of 11 or higher to select this area

of expertise.

*Novice:* The noble gains a +4 competence bonus divided as he

chooses between Disable Device, Linguistics, Sleight of Hand,

or Stealth.

*Student:* The noble gains sneak attack +1d6. This ability functions

exactly as the rogue ability of the same name and stacks with all other

sources of similar damage. See *Pathfinder Core Rulebook* for details.

*Master:* The noble gains underworld connections. He may extend

material aid to criminal outfits in his home city.

*Savant:* The noble’s sneak attack damage increases by +1d6.

Military Training

The noble received extensive military training, focused largely on

strategy and tactics and leading men in battle.

*Novice:* The noble may use the aid another action in combat to assist

any ally within 30 feet that can clearly see and hear him.

*Student:* The noble gains Mounted Combat as a bonus feat.

*Master:* The noble may issue a command to those beneath his station.

This ability functions exactly like the *command* spell. Unwilling

targets are entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + one-half the noble’s

class level + his Charisma bonus) to resist this effect. A target that

successfully saves is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is an

extraordinary ability.

*Savant:* As the master ability, but the ability functions as the *greater*

*command* spell.

Scholarly Training

The noble received an excellent education and are learned about a

great many subjects. He must have an Intelligence score of 11 or

higher to select this area of expertise.

*Novice:* The noble adds half his class level to all Knowledge skill.

*Student:* The noble gain a +4 competence bonus divided as he chooses

between any Knowledge skills.

*Master:* The noble gains a +2 circumstance bonus to any Knowledge

skill in which he has 5 ranks or more. If he later gains five ranks in a

different Knowledge skill, he gains this bonus at that time.

*Scholar:* All Intelligence-based skills are trained skills for the noble.

Religious Training

The noble received extensive religious training, learning the intricacies

of his faith.

*Novice:* The noble gains a +4 competence bonus divided as he chooses

between Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (religion), and Knowledge

(planes).

*Student:* The noble may cast *detect magic* and *read magic* each once

per day as spell-like abilities. His caster level equals one-half his class

level. If he also has the Student ability of Arcane Training, he may

cast each of these spells twice per day.

*Master:* If the noble has class levels in a divine spellcasting class, he

increases the caster level in that class by one. Otherwise, he selects one

0-level and one 1st-level cleric spell. The noble may cast each spell as

a spell-like ability once per day. His caster level equals one-half his

class level. The save DC, if any, is Intelligence- or Charisma-based.

*Savant:* If the noble has class levels in a divine spellcasting class, he

increases the caster level in that class by one. Otherwise, he selects

one 0-level, one 1st-level, and one 2nd-level cleric spell. The noble

may cast each spell as a spell-like ability once per day. His caster level

equals one-half his class level. The save DC, if any, is Intelligence- or

Charisma-based.

Organize (Ex)

Starting at 2nd level, the noble can help allies complete a task by

offering useful advice and words of encouragement. Whenever a

group of characters uses the aid another action to enhance a skill

check, attack roll, or Armor Class, the noble makes his own aid

another check and then targets a number of characters equal to

one-half his class level. If successful, all affected characters who are

aiding add the indicated bonus to the bonus ordinarily conferred by

the aid another action.

*For example, a 5th-level noble uses organize on three characters who aid a*

*fourth in attacking an ogre. The three characters must hit an Armor Class*

*10 in order to each grant a +2 bonus to the attacker’s attack roll. The noble*

*makes an attack roll against an AC 10 and hits. So, the other characters*

*now add a +4 bonus each to the attacker’s attack roll.*

Influence (Ex)

The noble has a certain sphere of influence and can coax others

to perform tasks that benefit him and his companions. Examples

include calling in favors, bullying a weak-willed thug, blackmailing

another powerful noble, bribing a guard, or convincing an artisan to

make something at a reduced price. Starting at 3rd level, select one

of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal,

Intimidate, or Perform. The noble gains a +1 bonus on all checks

related to this skill. At 6th level and every three levels thereafter, he

may select another skill to which he may apply this bonus. As well,

the bonus to all previously selected skills increase by +1.

*For example, a 3rd level noble selected Bluff and gains a +1 bonus on all*

*Bluff checks. At 6th level, the noble selects Diplomacy. His bonus to Bluff*

*checks increases to +2 and he gains a +1 bonus on all Diplomacy checks.*

Nobles and Aristocrats

The relationship between the noble base class and the

aristocrat NPC class described in the *Pathfinder Core*

*Rulebook* is similar to the one between the fighter and

the warrior. The noble occupies the same social strata as

aristocrats but reflects advanced training, and a special

knack for statecraft and intrigue over that of the common

aristocrat. You can use both of these classes side-by-side,

with NPCs possibly having levels in both aristocrat and

noble, just aristocrat, or maybe all noble, depending on their

skill and importance to the overall campaign.
