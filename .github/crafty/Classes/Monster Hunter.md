# Monster Hunter
## Overview
*“After they sacked my people’s hold, slaughtered our women,*

*enslaved our children, and desecrated our temples, I had no choice.*

*My life would be spent hunting and killing goblins. Sure, along*

*the way, I’ve learned to diversify a bit, but killing goblins is my*

*specialty.*

—Udren Swifthammer, Monster Hunter

It’s a dangerous world, one filled with countless terrors, and horrid

monsters lurking on the fringes of civilization with no goal beyond

slaughter and rapine. Countless raids and endless warfare breed hatred

and resentment in the victims, and on occasion one rises, committing

his life to the ruination of his people’s enemies. The monster hunter is

this individual—a gritty warrior who uses cunning and a focused set

of abilities to defeat these opponents and rid the world of the danger

they present. Whether destroying demons, removing infestations of

monstrous spiders, or hunting down ogres, there’s a monster hunter

for every horror.

A monster hunter develops a set of abilities tied to a particular

inclination and character concept. You can focus your development

to defeat one type of monster or develop a broad set of talents to

take on several different types of monsters. Skilled with a variety of

weapons, you are as capable in combat as other martial characters.

While there are advantages to a focused approach, there are great

benefits to developing skills to combat several different types of

monsters. Being diversely trained lets you know what to look for

and so you are less likely to be surprised when a creature attacks.

However, such diversity prohibits you from developing the best

abilities provided by this class.

Creating a

Monster Hunter

The monster hunter is a specialized warrior, one that develops a set

of unique abilities to better combat the enemies he fights. A monster

hunter has access to a broad range of specialties, letting him pick

his class features to respond to the nature of his adventures and the

character of his foes. Should the monster hunter train his focus on

one type of creature, he develops powerful abilities quickly, but at the

expense of other class features. Or, the monster hunter can diversify,

delaying access to the most powerful abilities, but learning to apply

their knowledge to survive a variety of situations.

Abilities

Intelligence is the key ability for many of the monster hunter’s

class features. As a combat character, monster hunters should never

neglect Strength and Dexterity to improve their capabilities with

weaponry, and Constitution to allow them to stay standing in long

and deadly combats.

Races

Monsters prey on all creatures, even evil ones. Thus monster hunters

can be of any race from elf to troglodyte. Elves tend to crusade

against drow and orcs, while dwarves and gnomes oppose giants and

goblinoids. Humans, being the most ambitious, may take on fiends

or dragons. Among the savage races, the drow are the most likely to

become monster hunters, though not to kill, but rather to enslave.

Alignment

Good monster hunters develop abilities to destroy noteworthy evil

creatures like demons, many dragons, undead, and dangerous magical

beasts. Evil monster hunters focus on good outsiders, humanoids, fey,

and good dragons. Also, laws often interfere with a monster hunter’s

tactics, forcing him to circumvent them. Monster hunters are famous

for discarding custom and laws, breaking into sealed vaults, churches, or

castles to get at their prey. As a result, few monster hunters are lawful.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monster hunter class.

Weapon and Armor

Proficiency

Monster hunters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons,

light and medium armors, and shields (but not tower shields).

Monster Lore

Having studied a number of subjects and creatures, monster

hunters have become well-versed in the special attacks, defenses,

and vulnerabilities of the foes he hunts. The monster hunter may add his class level to his Knowledge skill when making a check to

learn some piece of relevant information, as long as he has at least

one rank in that skill. For information on the Knowledge skill and

the monsters related to particular categories, see the **Knowledge**

**and Monsters** sidebar.

Knowledge & Monsters

**Knowledge Monsters**

Arcana Constructs, dragons, magical beasts

Dungeoneering Aberrations, oozes

Local Humanoids

Nature Animals, fey, giants, monstrous

humanoids, plants, vermin

Religion Undead

The Planes Elementals, outsiders

Expert Tracker (Ex)

A monster hunter possesses great skill at locating his quarry. At first

level, he gains a +2 bonus to Survival checks made to track.

Monster Specialist

The monster hunter’s training gives him a variety of techniques with

which he can overcome just about any kind of monster. However, he

develops specific talents that lend themselves to defeating monsters

of a particular type. As the monster hunter advances, he can further

specialize, increasing his skills against a monster type, or diversify,

developing tools to help defeat several different types of foes.

Starting at 2nd level, the monster hunter selects a specialization from

any of the following: aberration hunter, animal hunter, construct hunter,

dragon hunter, elemental hunter, fey hunter, humanoid hunter, magical

beast hunter, monstrous humanoid hunter, ooze hunter, outsider hunter,

plant hunter, undead hunter, or vermin hunter. He gains the apprentice

ability of the specialization. Every other level thereafter, the monster

hunter may select a new specialization or improve an existing one,

gaining the journeyman ability or master ability. He retains all benefits

of lower levels of specialization. Gaining mastery in a specialty confers

additional benefits to all abilities as presented in each description.

Aberration Hunter

*“Aberrations, well… T hey just shouldn’t exist. And it’s my job*

*to make that so.”*

**Sense Aberrations (Apprentice) (Su):** At will, as a standard action,

the monster hunter can automatically sense the presence or absence

of aberrations within a 30-foot radius. After a second round of

concentration—another standard action—he can detect the number

of aberrations and the strength of the strongest aberration present. If

he concentrates for a third round, the monster hunter can detect the

strength and location of each aberration. If an aberration is outside

his line of sight, the monster hunter discerns its direction, but not

its exact location.

**HD Strength**

1 or less Faint

2–4 Moderate

5–10 Strong

11 or higher Overwhelming

*Mastery:* Once the monster hunter achieves mastery in this specialty,

the range of this ability extends out to 60-feet.

**Smite Aberration (Journeyman) (Su):** Once per day, the monster

hunter may make a special smite attack with a normal attack that

applies only to aberrations. He adds his Intelligence bonus to the

attack roll, and on a successful hit, the monster hunter deals extra

damage equal to his class level.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may make a number of smite attacks

per day equal to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1).

**Thwart Aberration (Master) (Ex):** Whenever targeted by an

aberration’s spell, spell-like, or supernatural ability, the monster

hunter may add his Intelligence bonus (if any) to his saving throw.

Furthermore, if the save has a reduced effect for a successful save,

such as Will partial or Reflex half, and the monster hunter succeeds

on the saving throw, he instead takes no damage and is unaffected

by the ability.

Animal Hunter

*“So there I was, creeping through the tall grasses… Closing on my*

*prey, Kojimbo, a terrible lion of fierce mien. It proved the better*

*of every other hunter who tried to take it down, but then it had*

*never met me before…”*

**Detect Animals (Apprentice) (Sp):** At will, as a standard action, the

monster hunter can cast *detect animals or plants* (animals only) as a

caster equal to his class level.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may use this ability as a swift action.

**Wilderness Lore ( Journeyman) (Ex):** When making Survival

checks to get along in the wild, the monster hunter can move up to

three-quarters of his overland speed while hunting and foraging. In

addition, he can provide food and water for two people for every 2

points by which the check exceeded 10. Finally, the monster hunter

may add his Intelligence bonus to all Perception and Survival checks

when tracking an animal.

*Mastery:* Animals are considered one size smaller when grappling

with the monster hunter.

**Beastmaster (Master) (Sp):** The monster hunter gains the ability to

cast a small number of spells as spell-like abilities. He may cast *calm*

*animals, hide from animals,* and *hold animal*, each once per day. His

caster level equals his class level. The save DCs for these spells are

Intelligence-based.

Construct Hunter

*“T he machine is but a tool. But when given life, or a semblance*

*of life, it is a danger to all.”*

**Agility (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains a +2 dodge

bonus to AC against attacks of opportunities caused when he moves

out of or within a construct’s threatened area. A condition that makes

the monster hunter lose his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any)

also makes him lose his dodge bonus. Like all dodge bonuses, this

ability stacks with the Mobility feat.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter’s dodge bonus increases to +4.

**Tough (Journeyman) (Ex):** The monster hunter need never make

a save against massive damage from attacks made by a construct. In

addition, he gains a +2 insight bonus to saves against a construct’s

special attacks.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter’s insight bonus to saving throws against

a construct’s special attacks increases to +4.

**Rend Dweomer (Master) (Su):** The monster hunter may make a

special touch attack to scramble the magical energy that grants a

construct the semblance of life. On a successful attack, he deals 1d6

points of damage per class level (maximum 10d6). The monster hunter

must wait 5 rounds between each use of this ability.

Dragon Hunter

*“I kill dragons. You might call it foolish… Mebbe brave. I don’t*

*know. But I can tell you this. T here ain’t nothin’ more scary than*

*a ticked-off red blowing fire up your arse.”*

**Grit (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter may add his Intelligence

bonus to all saving throws against fear.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter is immune to all fear effects.

**Evasion (Journeyman) (Ex):** Whenever the monster hunter makes

a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half

damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The

monster hunter can only use this ability when wearing light or no

armor. He cannot use evasion if helpless or somehow prevented

from moving.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains improved evasion. This works like

evasion, except that while the monster hunter still takes no damage

on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth

takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monster hunter

does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

**True Strike (Master) (Sp):** The monster hunter may cast *true strike*

as a spell-like ability. He must wait 5 rounds between each use of this

ability. The monster hunter’s caster level equals his class level.

Elemental Hunter

*“We mortals have the Material Plane and elementals have the*

*Elemental Planes. We don’t belong in their world, and they most*

*certainly do not belong in ours.”*

**Resist Energy (Apprentice) (Sp):** The monster hunter may cast

the *resist energy* spell as an immediate action. This ability functions

exactly as the spell, but he is limited to acid, cold, electricity, or fire,

and the monster hunter may only use this ability when he would take

damage of one of the aforementioned energy types. The benefits last

for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1

round) or until discharged, whichever occurs first, and he must wait

5 rounds in between each use of this ability.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may cast *protection from energy* instead

of *resist energy,* subject to the same limitations as described above.

**Elemental Weapon (Journeyman) (Su):** As a standard action, the

monster hunter can cause a melee weapon he is wielding to become

wreathed with energy. He may select one energy type from any of the

following: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. On a successful hit, the weapon

deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage. This effect lasts

for a number of rounds equal to the monster hunter’s Intelligence

bonus (minimum 1 round). The monster hunter must wait 5 rounds

between each use of this ability.

*Mastery:* An affected weapon deals an additional 3d6 points of damage

of the appropriate type on a confirmed critical hit.

**Anti-elemental Aura (Master) (Su):** The monster hunter emits an

aura uncomfortable to elementals. The aura emanates 10 feet per

point of his Intelligence bonus (minimum 10 feet). All elementals

within the area take a –2 penalty to attack and damage rolls, saves,

and checks. They lose this penalty if they move out of the range of

the monster hunter’s aura.

Fey Hunter

*“Pesky little bastards, I can’t stand their jokes, pranks, and*

*especially that hell-cursed singin’. Kill ‘em all, I say.”*

**Sharp Senses (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains a +2

competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, he gains a +2

bonus to Will saves against illusions.

*Mastery:* The bonus on Perception checks and saves against illusions

increases to +4.

**Spell Resistance (Journeyman) (Su):** The monster hunter gains spell

resistance equal to 5 + his class level (maximum 15).

*Mastery:* The monster hunter’s spell resistance equals 5 + his class

level (no maximum).

***See Invisibility* (Master) (Sp):** The monster hunter is always under

the effect of a *see invisibility* spell. This spell may be dispelled, but he

can reactivate it as a swift action.

Giant Hunter

*“T he bigger they are…”*

**Giant Slayer (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains a +1

bonus on attack rolls made to hit giants. In addition, he gains a +2

dodge bonus to Armor Class against giants. Any time the monster

hunter loses his Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as

when caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus too.

*Mastery:* The bonus to attack rolls increases to +2.

**Diehard (Journeyman):** The monster hunter gains the Diehard feat

as a bonus feat. He need not meet the prerequisites for this feat.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

**Seize Opportunity (Master) (Ex):** Whenever a giant attacks and

misses the monster hunter, he may immediately move up to one-half

his movement as an immediate action. Movement from this ability

does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Humanoid Hunter

*“Orcs. T hey’re no better than rabid dogs, unfit for anything. T hey*

*ravage the countryside, despoil our women, steal our crops, children,*

*and whatever they want to take. It’s time we took a stand. I won’t*

*stop until every last orc is dead.”*

The monster hunter may select this type of hunter multiple times.

The effects do not stack. Each time, select a new humanoid subtype.

**Favored Enemy (Apprentice) (Ex):** Select one subtype of humanoid

from any of the following: aquatic, dwarf, elf, goblinoid, gnoll, gnome,

halfling, human, orc, or reptilian. Against this subtype, the monster

humter gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and

Survival checks. Likewise, the monster hunter gets a +2 bonus on

weapon damage rolls against such creatures. This ability stacks with

a ranger’s favored enemy class feature.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter’s favored enemy bonus increases by +2.

**Smite Humanoid (Journeyman) (Su):** Once per day, the monster

hunter may make a smite attack against a humanoid with a subtype

that he selected for his apprentice ability using one normal melee

attack. The monster hunter adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to his

attack roll and he deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. If the

monster hunter accidentally smites a creature that is not a humanoid

of the appropriate subtype, the smite has no effect, but the ability is

still used up for that day.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may use this ability twice per day.

**Hold Humanoid (Master) (Sp):** For a number of times per day equal

to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1/day), the monster hunter may

cause a single humanoid creature of a subtype that he selected for his

apprentice ability to become immobile unless that creature succeeds

on a Will save (DC 13 + the monster hunter’s Intelligence modifier).

An affected creature functions as if under the effects of a *hold person*

spell and is entitled to a new save each round to break free from the

effect. The monster hunter’s caster level equals his class level.

Magical Beast Hunter

*“Sure, dragons are tough. So are giants, even demons and their*

*ilk. But there’s a slew of critters just as nasty. Ever hear of the*

*dragonne? It flies, sucks the will to fight right out of you, and can*

*rip a grown man into bloody chunks in mere seconds.”*

**Hardy (Apprentice) (Ex):** As an immediate action, the monster

hunter may add his Intelligence bonus (if any) as an insight bonus

to any one saving throw. He must wait 5 rounds between each use

of this ability.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains a +1 insight bonus on all saves.

**Evasion (Journeyman) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains evasion. This

ability functions exactly as described under the journeyman ability

of the dragon hunter. If the monster hunter already has evasion, he

gains improved evasion instead.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains improved evasion. This works like

evasion, except that while the monster hunter still takes no damage

on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth

takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monster hunter

does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

**Dreadful Blow (Master) (Ex):** As a full-round action, the monster

hunter may make a single attack against a magical beast using his

highest base attack bonus. If the attack hits, in addition to normal

damage, the magical beast must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10

+ one-half the monster hunter’s class level + his Intelligence modifier)

or lose access to all supernatural abilities for a number of rounds equal

to the monster hunter’s Intelligence bonus. The monster hunter must

wait 5 rounds between each use of this ability.

Monstrous Humanoid Hunter

*“I slay minotaurs. Abominations, every one, the gods did not intend*

*for such an unholy union of man and beast.”*

**Expert Tracker (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter may add

his Intelligence bonus (if any) as an insight bonus on all Survival

checks. In addition, when fighting monstrous humanoids, he gains

a +2 bonus on damage rolls.

*Mastery:* The damage bonus increases to +4.

**Incredible Toughness (Journeyman) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains

+1 hit point per class level. This bonus is retroactive.

hunter may make a single attack against a monstrous humanoid using

his highest base attack bonus. If the attack hits, in addition to normal

damage, the creature must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + onehalf

the monster hunter’s class level + his Intelligence modifier) or take

Constitution damage equal to 1 + the monster hunter’s Intelligence

bonus (minimum 2 points of damage). The monster hunter must wait

5 rounds between each use of this ability.

Ooze Hunter

*“I call myself a cleaner. When I see a spill, I’ll wipe it up. An*

*ooze is a lot like a spill, but uglier.”*

**Resistance to Acid (Apprentice) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains

*Mastery:* The monster hunter’s resistance to acid increases to 10

and he may add his Intelligence bonus (if any) to all saving throws

against paralysis.

**Turn Ooze (Journeyman) (Su):** For a number of times per day equal

to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1/day), the monster hunter can

turn oozes. This ability otherwise functions exactly as if the monster

hunter were a cleric with the Turn Undead feat.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains 3 additional uses of this ability

per day.

**Expert Grappler (Master) (Ex):** The monster hunter gains Improved

Grapple as a bonus feat. If he already has this feat, he may instead

add his Intelligence bonus on grapple checks.

Outsider Hunter

*“We have our place, they have theirs. Get off my plane, demon!”*

The monster hunter may select this type of hunter multiple times.

The effects do not stack. Each time, select a new outsider subtype.

**Align Weapon (Apprentice) (Sp):** Select one of the following

subtypes: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. As an immediate action, the

monster hunter may add the opposite subtype—good to fight evil,

chaos to fight law—as a damage descriptor to his weapon for the

purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The weapon remains

aligned for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence bonus

(minimum 1).

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may cast the *align weapon* spell as a

spell-like ability for a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence

bonus (minimum 1/day).

**Turn Outsider (Journeyman) (Su):** For a number of times per day

equal to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1/day), the monster hunter

can turn outsiders of the subtype he selected for his apprentice ability.

Thus ability otherwise functions exactly as if the monster hunter were

a cleric with the Turn Undead feat.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains 3 additional uses of this ability

per day.

**Dimensional Interference (Master) (Su):** The monster hunter emits

an aura out to a range of 10 feet per point of his Intelligence bonus

(minimum 10 ft.). Outsiders of his selected type that attempt to cast

conjuration spells or use conjuration spell-like abilities must first

succeed on an opposed level check against him. If the monster hunter

beats the outsider’s check result, their spell or spell-like effect fails.

This ability is always active, though the monster hunter can suppress

it for a round as a standard action.

Plant Hunter

*“I suppose you could call me a gardener. Make no mistake though;*

*plants are nasty. I learned the hard way after cutting myself free*

*out of the gullet of one of these bastards.”*

**Detect Animals or Plants (Apprentice) (Sp):** As a standard action,

the monster hunter can cast *detect animals or plants* (plants only) as

a caster equal to his class level.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter may cast this

spell as a swift action.

**Blight Touch (Journeyman) (Su):**

As a standard action, the monster

hunter may make a single melee

touch attack against a plant

creature. If he hits the creature,

it takes 1d6 points of damage

per point of his Intelligence

bonus (minimum 1d6). The

monster hunter must wait 5

rounds between each use of

this ability.

*Mastery:* Damage dealt by blight touch

increases to 1d8 points of damage per point

of the monster hunter’s Intelligence bonus

(minimum 1d8).

**Repel Plants (Master) (Su):** Plants sense

danger from the monster hunter and will not

willingly approach him. Any plant creature that’s

within the range of the monster hunter’s presence

(10-foot radius per point of his Intelligence bonus,

minimum of 10 feet) takes a –4 penalty to attack and

damage rolls, saves, and checks.

Undead Hunter

*“When I woke, everyone I knew was dead. T hat night, they rose*

*from their shallow graves and tore apart the livestock. When my*

*bloated mother came for me, I knew what I had to do.”*

**Turn Undead (Apprentice) (Su):** For a number of times per day

equal to the monster hunter’s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1/day),

he can turn undead. This ability otherwise functions exactly as if the

monster hunter were a cleric with the Turn Undead feat. If he can

already turn undead, his monster hunter levels stack with his other

levels for the purposes of determining the saving throw DC. The

monster hunter gains no other benefits, such as the ability to channel

energy or convert spells to healing.

*Mastery:* The monster hunter gains 3 additional uses of this ability

per day.

**Ghost Touch Weapon (Journeyman) (Su):** For a number of rounds

per day equal to his Intelligence bonus (minimum 1 round), the

the *ghost touch* property.

**Turn Vulnerability (Master) (Sp):** Undead sense danger from the

monster hunter and will not willingly approach him. Any undead

creature that’s within the range of his influence (10-foot radius per

point of his Intelligence bonus, minimum of 10 feet) counts as having

2 Hit Dice fewer than it actually has for the purposes of resolving

turn or rebuke undead attempts.

Vermin Hunter

*“I’m more than just an exterminator. I have the walnuts to take*

*on the big ones. Problems with giant ants? Beetles? Maggots?*

*Flies? Wasps? I’m the man for the job.”*

**Poison Resistance (Apprentice) (Ex):** The

bonus (minimum +1) to all saves against

vermin creatures.

**Turn Vermin ( Journeyman) (Su):** For

3 more uses of this ability per day.

**Hide from Vermin (Master) (Sp):**

Vermin have a difficult time sensing

the monster hunter’s presence. He gains

concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks

while a monster hunter with five gains a +5 bonus.

Danger Sense (Ex)

At 5th level, the monster hunter gains a +1 bonus to initiative checks

per specialized foe. Thus, a monster hunter with three different

specialized foes (dragons, orcs, and undead for example) gains a +3

bonus to initiative checks.

Hit 'Em Hard (Ex)

At 7th level, the monster hunter gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls made

against any creatures types for which he has the monster specialist

ability. This ability is retroactive, such that if he selects a new creature

type at 8th level, the bonus applies. The bonus increases to +2 at 13th

level and +3 at 19th level.

Cause Pain (Ex)

Beginning at 9th level, the monster hunter learns to inflict great pain

upon his chosen foes. Whenever he inflicts damage with a melee or

ranged weapon, the monster hunter inflicts an additional +1 point

of damage to any creature whose type is one he has selected with

the monster specialist ability. This ability is retroactive, such that if

he selects a new creature type at 10th level, the bonus applies. The

bonus increases to +2 at 15th level.

Strong Defense (Ex)

At 11th level, the monster hunter has a better chance to shake off the

special abilities and spells of his chosen enemies. He adds +1 to all his

saving throws against any effect from a creature whose type he has

selected with the monster specialist ability. This ability is retroactive,

applies. The bonus increases to +2 at 17th level.
