# Ear To The Streets
## Overview
*Ear To The Streets (Ex):* Youâ€™re connected to the streets, and to local information centers. You can use the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill to learn when any party uses that same skill to gather information, and what sorts of information that party sought. Attempting to learn such information requires 2d10 minutes of canvassing local hot spots and contacting your own informants. If the party you are attempting to research made a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill check to gather information in the same settlement within the past week, a DC 30 (for small towns or larger settlements) or 20 (for villages or smaller settlements) check produces a description of both the seeking party and the information they pursued. If that party made more than one attempt to gather information within the past week, the above DCs are reduced by half.
