# Skylord (PrC)
## Overview
An elf crusader, the skylord uses his kinship with creatures of

the sky and the power of the winds to fight evil. His ties with

the elven community are generally loose at best, since he sees

much more urgency in the day-to-day events of the world. This

point of view is often lost on the elven lords who would prefer

to insulate themselves from the affairs of the shorter-lived races.

Elves who become skylords often come from the ranks of barbarians,

fighters, druids, and rangers.

Soaring above the world of men, the skylord observes

all. From such a vantage point, the skylord learns to

appreciate the beauty of the world below, ply the

winds, and use the rage of storms to his advantage. He

can quickly disappear by cloaking himself in clouds to

avoid his foes. During a battle, his presence

inspires confidence in all airborne

allies who fight at his side.

The skylord often serves

as an aerial scout,

watching the movements

of evil armies

and studying areas

not easily reached by land.

He is also a courier, conveying

messages across great distances much more

quickly than would otherwise be possible

without the use of magic. The skylord truly

shines when evil bears its ugly head in the sky,

but when necessary, he is a capable fighter indoors

or underground.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a skylord, a character must fulfill the following

criteria:

Alignment: Any good.

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Feats: Mounted Combat, either Mounted Archery or Ride-

By Attack, one exalted feat.

atop a mountain.

Balance (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge

(all skills taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex),

Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Player’s

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the skylord prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

A skylord is proficient

with all simple and martial

weapons, all types of armor, and

shields.

Spells per Day/Spells Known:

At every second level, a skylord gains

new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He

does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that

class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points

beyond those he receives from the prestige class, and so on),

except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character

had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a

skylord, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for

purposes of determining spells per day.

Call Flying Mount (Su): At 1st level as a full-round action,

the skylord can call a flying mount to serve in his crusade

against evil. This mount can be a celestial giant eagle, celestial giant owl, or celestial pegasus (consult the Skylord’s Mounts

sidebar for details). The mount remains with the skylord until it

is slain or dismissed. It requires food and rest, and the skylord is

responsible for tending to its needs.

Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect. If the mount

dies, the skylord can either have the mount raised from the dead

or call another mount. The skylord may only call a replacement

mount after living and meditating atop a mountain for 1 week.

Eyes of the Eagle (Ex): A skylord has the keen eyesight of an

eagle. While airborne, a skylord receives a +4 insight bonus on

Spot checks.

Ride the Wind (Ex): At 2nd level, a skylord becomes

a master of the winds, guiding his mount through

them with ease. While riding a flying mount, the skylord’s

penalties on ranged attacks in windy conditions

are reduced by 2 (no penalty in strong

winds, –2 penalty in severe winds). The skylord

can make ranged attacks in windstorms,

albeit at a –4 penalty. In hurricanes, the

ranged attack penalty increases to –8. Neither

the skylord nor his mount take penalties

on Listen checks in windstorms and

hurricanes.

Both the skylord and his mount can move

normally in severe winds and windstorms

(instead of being checked), and hurricane

winds reduce the flying speed of the skylord’s

mount by half.

Improved Mounted Combat (Ex):

At 3rd level, a skylord’s skill at mounted

combat improves, enabling him to

better protect his mount. This ability

works as the Mounted Combat feat,

except that the skylord’s Ride check

receives a +2 bonus. The bonus

improves to +4 at 5th level, +6 at 7th

level, and +8 at 9th level.

Deadly Charge (Ex): At 4th

level, a skylord deals an extra 2d6

points of damage on a successful

attack made during a charge. The skylord

must be riding a

flying mount to deal the

extra damage.

Storm Kinship (Su): At 6th level, a skylord is less likely to

lose his bearings in a storm. He retains full visibility during rains

and storms and does not take the usual penalties on Search, Spot,

and Listen checks (see Weather in the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

This ability is not imparted to the skylord’s mount.

Summon Tempest (Sp): At 10th level, once per week, the skylord

can summon a tempest (as described on page 193 of the

Monster Manual II). This ability is otherwise similar to the

summon monster I spell. Use the skylord’s character level to

determine the effect’s range and duration.

SKYLORD’S MOUNTS

A skylord’s mount is superior to a normal creature of its kind

and has special powers, as described below.

Skylord Bonus Natural Str

Level HD Armor Adj. Adj. Special

1st–3rd +2 +4 +1 Empathic link, share

spells, improved

natural attacks

4th–6th +4 +6 +2 Improved fly speed,

deadly charge +2d6

7th–9th +6 +8 +3 Spell resistance,

immunities

10th +8 +10 +4 Bonus feat

Skylord’s Mount Basics: Use the base statistics for a creature

of the mount’s kind (see Sample Skylord’s Mounts sidebar,

below), but make changes to take into account the attributes

and characteristics summarized on the table and

described below.

Bonus HD: Extra 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice, each of which

gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice

improve the mount’s base attack bonus, base save bonuses,

and celestial creature special qualities (damage reduction,

energy resistance, and spell resistance). A mount’s base attack

bonus is equal to that of a fighter of a level equal to the

mount’s Hit Dice. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex

saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the mount’s

HD). The mount doesn’t gain any extra skills or feats for bonus

Hit Dice.

Natural Armor Adj.: The number on the table is an improvement

to the mount’s existing natural armor bonus.

Str Adj.: Add this value to the mount’s Strength score.

Empathic Link (Su): A skylord has an empathic link with his

mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The skylord cannot see

through the mount’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically.

Because of this empathic link, the skylord has the same

connection to an item or place that his mount does, just as

with a master and his familiar (see Familiars in the Player’s

Handbook).

Share Spells: At the skylord’s option, he may have any spell

(but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his

mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting

to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other

than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves

farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again

even if it returns to the skylord before the duration expires.

Additionally, the skylord may cast a spell with a target of “You”

on his mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A

skylord and his mount can share spells even if the spells

normally do not affect magical beasts.

Improved Natural Attacks: The damage dealt by each of the

mount’s natural attacks increases by one step. For example, a

giant eagle mount with this ability would roll 1d8 instead of

1d6 for claw damage and 1d10 instead of 1d8 for bite damage.

Improved Fly Speed (Ex): The mount’s fly speed increases by

10 feet.

Deadly Charge (Ex): The skylord’s mount deals an extra 2d6

points of damage on a successful attack made during a charge.

Spell Resistance (Su): A mount’s spell resistance equals the

skylord’s character level + 5.

Immunities (Su): A skylord’s mount is immune to hold, paralysis,

sleep, charms, and compulsions.

Bonus Feat: The mount gains one of the following feats as a

bonus feat, provided it meets the prerequisites for the feat:

Flyby Attack, Hover, Multiattack, or Wingover.
