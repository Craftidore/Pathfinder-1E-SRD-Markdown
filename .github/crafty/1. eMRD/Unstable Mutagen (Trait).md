# Unstable Mutagen (Trait)
## Overview
**Unstable Mutagen:** You discovered or were given a secret to make your mutagens more unstableâ€”but also more potent. Once per day, you can create an unstable mutagen. It is like a normal mutagen in most ways, but also gains a single benefit or hindrance due to its instability. Roll 1d6 to determine the result of the instability.


| **d6** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1 | The unstable mutagen lasts for 5 minutes per alchemist level. |
| 2 | The unstable mutagen lasts for 20 minutes per alchemist level. |
| 3 | The unstable mutagen does not grant a natural armor bonus. |
| 4 | The natural armor bonus granted by the mutagen increases by 2. |
| 5 | The penalty that the mutagen applies to the corresponding mental ability score increases by 2. |
| 6 | The unstable mutagen does not apply a penalty to the corresponding mental ability score. |
