# Hag's Eye (Hex)
## Overview
*Hagâ€™s Eye (Su)*: A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see through. This functions as per the spell *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]*. If the witch has the [[Coven (Hex)|coven hex]], all other witches within 10 feet who also have the [[Coven (Hex)|coven hex]] can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
