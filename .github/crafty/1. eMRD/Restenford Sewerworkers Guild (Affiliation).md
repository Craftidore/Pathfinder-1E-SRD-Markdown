RESTENFORD

SEWERWORKERS GUILD

Symbol: The symbol of the Sewerworkers Guild is a stylized

image of the guildmaster: a square with a circle in it,

representing Smiling Gordin and the head it contorts into a

grinning rictus when communicating.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Rat runners, ooze

masters, subterranean tinkers, exterminators, conjurors and

abjurers of fi lth—the members of the Sewerworkers Guild

are unnoticed by most and unthanked by all. The guild is

responsible for the operation of the city’s vast subterranean

tunnel network. Repair work and extermination occupy much

of the guild members’ time, but these menial tasks only serve

to mask the guild’s true nature.

The guild’s leader is Smiling Gordin, a miraculously *awakened*

gelatinous cube, originally brought into the sewers because of

its ability to scour a passageway clean simply by oozing through

it. The origin of Gordin’s intelligence is unknown, but the

quality of that intelligence is unquestioned. Communicating

by gelatinous convulsions that manipulate the vocal cords of

various heads absorbed into his body and not yet dissolved

(the city is a violent place, and there is no shortage of heads

for Gordin), Gordin has built the Sewerworkers Guild into

one of the most powerful spy rings in the region.

Enemies and Allies: Utilizing their near-invisible status

and all-city access to the fullest, Gordin and the sewer workers

maintain good relations with the aboveground Guild of Insurers,

Solicitors, and Beggars (thieves guild) and often collaborate

with that guild on missions.

Members: Not surprisingly, most members of the Sewerworkers

are rogues, but a fair number are arcane casters, and

some who appear to be ooze masters are whispered to be

priests of Juiblex.

The Sewerworkers cannot allow anyone to leave their

ranks. The knowledge gained by the spies is valuable, and the

tunnel crawlers are loath to risk letting it get away for free,

but the real threat is one of exposure. Smiling Gordin simply

cannot allow anyone to learn of the spy ring’s existence.

Anyone leaving the ranks soon comes face to face with an

EL 14 strike team lead by an otyugh assassin.

Secrets: By the time you become Guild Boss, you learn that

Smiling Gordin has become fi xated on learning why it was chosen

for intelligence. While it pursues that goal (and toward that end

it might ask you to complete adventures that it cannot), Gordin

is content to become the Guild Grandfather, retaining ultimate

veto power but relinquishing day-to-day control to you.

Type: Spy ring.

Scale: 6 (city).
