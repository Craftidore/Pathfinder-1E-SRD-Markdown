# Delay Sneak Attack
## Overview
*Delay Sneak Attack\* (Ex):* Whenever you would deal sneak attack damage with a light slashing or piercing weapon, you may choose to delay the sneak attack damage for 1 round. After 1 round, the wound ruptures, and the target receives your sneak attack damage normally. If, after 1 round, the damage from your attack has since been healed, your opponent does not receive the delayed sneak attack damage.
