# Sentinel of Bharrai (PrC)
## Overview
Respect for the power of nature, the desire to further

the ends of good, and the resolve to destroy evil are

the core beliefs of the sentinels of Bharrai, strongwilled

spellcasters who venerate “The Great Bear of Elysium.”

Their initiates hail primarily from the ranks of

wizards, although sorcerers, druids, and clerics may also

become sentinels.

Sentinels of Bharrai put the needs of others before their

own, and they value stalwart companionship and loyalty

above all. This is an important aspect of their loose

organization, which sometimes calls members to sacrifice

their lives to ensure the survival

of Bharrai’s ideals. Because of

their loyalty and commitment to

good, sentinels of Bharrai have a good reputation

among adventurers and are highly sought

after as adventuring companions.

The sentinels of Bharrai hold nature

as the ultimate force for good.

Though lightning may kill

trees and hurricanes

may destroy small

v i l l a g e s, t he

lightning ignites

fires that

cleanse the

forest of rotting

foliage

and the hurri -

cane teaches how to

better fortify a shelter.

Sentinels of Bharrai

appreciate nature in all

its forms, from the

tranquil beauty

of an undisturbed

forest to the ferocious

wrath of a tornado. They also harness

the power of nature to cast down evil.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the sentinel of Bharrai

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sentinels of Bharrai gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a sentinel of

Bharrai gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she

belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however,

gain any other benefit a character of that class would have

gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an

increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had

more than one spellcasting class before becoming a sentinel of

Bharrai, she must decide to which class she adds each sentinel

level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Nature-Friendly Spells (Su): Starting at 1st level, a sentinel

of Bharrai can change the composition of any energy-based

spell he casts to something that is not destructive to nature. The

spell must have the acid, cold, electricity, or fire subtype, and the

sentinel of Bharrai may choose to deal nonlethal damage

instead of lethal damage against animals and plants that are

either targeted or otherwise affected by the spell.

Track: A 1st-level sentinel of Bharrai gains the Track feat as a

bonus feat.

Energy Resistance 10 (Ex): A sentinel of Bharrai is resistant

to certain forces of nature and the damage they wreak. At 2nd

level, and again at 4th level, 6th level, and 8th level, a sentinel of

Bharrai chooses a specific type of energy—acid, cold, electricity,

or fire—and gains resistance 10 against the selected energy

type.

Bear Shape (Su): At 3rd level, the sentinel of Bharrai gains

the ability to turn himself into a black bear, brown bear, or polar

bear (and back again). The selected bear form’s Hit Dice cannot

exceed the sentinel of Bharrai’s character level.

This ability functions as the polymorph spell, except as noted

here. Changing form is a standard action and doesn’t provoke

attacks of opportunity. The sentinel of Bharrai may assume bear

form (and change back) at will and may remain in bear form as

long as he wishes.

The sentinel of Bharrai retains the ability to speak while in

bear form and may communicate with other bears.

Quickened Call Lightning (Sp): At 3rd level, a sentinel of Bharrai

can cast a quickened call lightning spell once per day, as

though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bharrai’s

character level to determine the number of lightning bolts

and the spell’s duration.

Nature’s Veil (Su): At 5th level, as a standard action, the sentinel

of Bharrai can attempt to hide in the outdoors. The sentinel

of Bharrai must be standing within 10 feet of natural terrain that

includes features such as trees, sand dunes, mounds of snow,

large rocks, tall grasses, or thickets. The sentinel of Bharrai gains

a +10 insight bonus on his Hide check under these circumstances.

Dire Bear Shape (Su): At 7th level, a sentinel of Bharrai can

turn himself into a dire bear and back again. This ability is otherwise

the same as the bear form ability gained at 3rd level.

Ursinal’s Touch (Su): A sentinel of Bharrai gains great healing

powers at 7th level. This ability works just like the paladin’s

lay on hands ability, except that the sentinel of Bharrai can heal

as much damage per day as his own undamaged hit point total.

Cavalry of Dire Bears (Sp): Once per week beginning at 9th

level, a sentinel of Bharrai may call 1d6 dire bears with maximum

hit points (147 hp each) to aid him in battle. The dire bears

appear instantly and remain until the battle has ended, at which

point they disperse into the wild. If a dire bear falls in battle, the

animal’s corpse remains, and the sentinel of Bharrai is expected

to use whatever parts of the animal he can (such as the meat,

skin, and bones) and commit the rest to the earth. Failing to

properly honor a fallen dire bear results in a 20% cumulative

chance that the animals do not come the next time they are

called.

This ability works only on the Material Plane and on goodaligned

outer planes.

Quickened Lightning Storm (Sp): At 10th level, a sentinel of

Bharrai can cast a quickened lightning stormspell once per day, as

though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bharrai’s

character level to determine the number of lightning bolts

and the spell’s duration.
