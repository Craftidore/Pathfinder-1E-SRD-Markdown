# Pantry of Preservation (WondArch)
## Overview
**Pantry of Preservation:** This stronghold space is enchanted with a permanent version of *[[Gentle Repose (Spell)|gentle repose]]*. This prevents the remains of dead creatures from decaying, making for the ultimate in meat preservation. No fine kitchen goes without it.

When used to store the bodies of deceased humans and humanoids, such a place is called a *morgue of preservation*. While these spaces are sometimes used to keep many bodies in perfect storage, they are just as often used to keep fresh the body of a notable person that is lying in state. Often these bodies are placed in a glass case to prevent other damage, then put out (usually under heavy guard) where people can visit the place to pay their respects to the dead.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Gentle Repose (Spell)|gentle repose]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
