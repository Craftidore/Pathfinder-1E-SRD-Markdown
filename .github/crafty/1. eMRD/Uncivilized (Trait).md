# Uncivilized (Trait)
## Overview
**Uncivilized**

You relate better to animals than you do to people.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] checks and wild empathy checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penahy on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks, [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks, and Gather Information checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait are likely to feel awkward in many social situations; that might be expressed as shyness and quiet behavior, or it might be expressed through an overly exuberant need to participate in conversations.
