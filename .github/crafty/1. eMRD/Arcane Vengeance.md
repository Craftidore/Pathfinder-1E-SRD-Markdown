# Arcane Vengeance
## Overview
**Arcane Vengeance**

**Prerequisite:** [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]]

**Benefit:** When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you may cast and deliver a prepared spell as your attack of opportunity. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and a range of touch. If you miss with your touch attack, the spell is lost. Except for casting the spell as an attack of opportunity, all the normal rules of spellcasting apply. You may use this ability once per day. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day.
