# Force Missile Mage (PrC)
## Overview
The spell *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* is one of the most iconic elements of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, a favored staple of many arcane spellcasters and an example of raw magical force. Thus, it is no wonder that a cabal of arcane spellcasters focuses their studies on this spell, determined to perfect its casting technique above all others. As these spellcasters obsessively explore *magic missile's* secrets and press its boundaries, every rune and magical symbol of the spell becomes inexorably etched upon their minds. The outcome of such focused study results in the ability to warp the magical energies involved in casting *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]**,* which leads to the creation of new abilities that augment the spell's effects. Eventually the most devoted researchers come to a new understanding of how magic works, revealing unplumbed depths of power out of the reach of ordinary spellcasters. These inspired spellcasters are known as force missile mages.

Other spellcasters don't understand the force missile mages' dedication to only one spell and frown upon what they see as misguided research. In their reasoning, force missile mages are a discredit to all spellcasters as they limit their understanding of magic to delve into the secrets of what many see as ultimately an insignificant spell. Due to this disdain, force missile mages avoid their more widely studied peers, either pursuing their studies subtly or in seclusion. This has led many to take up the life of a wanderer, traveling from one school or library to the next, learning more about their spell of choice and exploring the world.

Wizards stand to gain the most from becoming a force missile mage, but some sorcerers and multiclassed clerics also benefit from the class's unique focus. Clerics with access to the Force domain (see *Complete Divine)* often take levels in force missile mage and view their research into one of their faith's most fundamental spells as a religious undertaking.

While many who embark upon the path of the force missile mage claim to do so in order to gain a deeper understanding of magic in general, the majority take on the arduous task in order to become better killers. These arcane snipers hone their skill with *magic missiles* not out of curiosity, but for less scholarly reasons: wealth, revenge, or the power to kill with impunity.

**REQUIREMENTS**

To qualify to become a force missile mage, a character must fulfill the following criteria.

**Skills:** (v3.5 Concentration 9 ranks), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 9 ranks.

**Feat:** [[Combat Casting (Feat)|Combat Casting]].

**Spells:** Ability to cast *magic missile* once per day.

**CLASS SKILLS**

The force missile mage's class skills {and the key ability for each skill) are (v3.5 Concentration (Con), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (Int), and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (Int) (v3.5 Spot (Wis).

**Skill Points at Each Level:** 2 + Int modifier,

**TABLE 3-7: THE FORCE MISSILE MAGE**


| | **Base** |  |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Attack** | **Fort** | **Ref** | **Will** |  |  |
| **Level** | **Bonus** | **Save** | **Save** | **Save** | **Special** | **Spells Per Day** |
| 1st | +0 | +0 | +0 | +2 | Bonus missile, still missile | (v3.5 â€”) +1 level of existing spellcasting class |
| 2nd | +1 | +0 | +0 | +3 | Energy missile, *swift shield* | +1 level of existing spellcasting class |
| 3rd | +1 | +1 | +1 | +3 | Overpowering missile | +1 level of existing spellcasting class |
| 4th | +2 | +1 | +1 | +4 | *Reflective shield* | +1 level of existing spellcasting class |
| 5th | +2 | +1 | +1 | +4 | Bonus missile | +1 level of existing spellcasting class |

**CLASS FEATURES**

All of the following are class features of the force missile mage prestige class.

**Weapons and Armor Proficiency:** Force missile mages gain no new weapon or armor proficiencies.

**Spells:** A force missile mage continues training in magic as he gains levels. At each level after 1st, the force missile mage gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character has levels in more than one spellcasting class before becoming a force missile mage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of force missile mage for the purposes of determining spells per day.

**Bonus Missile:** At 1st level, a force missile mage gains increased mastery over his spell of choice. Every time he casts *magic missile* he creates an addition missile, even if this extra missile exceeds the normal maximum of five missiles that the spell normally allows. Thus, a 1st-level force missile mage/6th-level wizard creates five *magic missiles,* while a 1st-level force missile mage/8thlevel wizard produces six missiles.

At 5th level, the force missile mage benefits from an additional bonus missile. This means that a high-level force missile mage can create up to seven missiles with a single casting of *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]**.*

**Still Missile (Ex):** All of the force missile mage's *magic missile* spells lack a somatic component. He casts *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* feat but without an increase in spell level.

**Energy Missile (Ex):** A force missile mage becomes intimately attuned to the energies that compose the spell *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* and may alter them in significant ways. Starting at 2nd level, a force missile mage may add either the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor to any *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* he casts.

The type of energy added to the spell is chosen at the time of casting, and you can choose a different type of energy each time you cast *magic missile.* This altered descriptor affects all missiles created by a single casting of *magic missile.* Although still a force spell, any *magic missile* altered in this way deals additional damage against vulnerable creatures and less damage against creatures with related resistances and immunities.

**Swift Shield (Sp):** A force missile mage realizes the need to defend himself against the *magic missiles* of other spellcasters. A 2nd-level force missile mage can cast *shield* once per day as an immediate action. (An immediate action is like a free action, but only one can be made per round.) This spell is cast in addition to the force missile mage's usual number of spells per day and at the force missile mage's highest caster level.

**Overpowering Missile:** At 3rd level, the force missile mage's *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* *magic missile.* This benefit only applies to *magic missile* spells he casts. In addition, a force missile mage's *magic missiles* might penetrate *shield* spells and *brooches of shielding.* Against such protections, the force missile mage makes a caster level check with a DC equal to the caster level, in the case of *shield,* or DC 20, in the case of a brooch.

**Reflective Shield (Sp):** At 4th level, a force missile mage can reflect the spell *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]**.* For the purposes of being affected by *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]**,* a force missile mage is constantly treated as being under the effect of the spell *[[Spell Turning (Spell)|spell turning]]**,* thus reflecting offensive *magic missiles* back at their caster. If that caster is protected by the *shield* spell or a *[[Brooch of Shielding|brooch of shielding]]**,* these reflected *magic missiles* are negated as normal. Missiles reflected back against a caster who also has *spell turning* in effect require the force missile mage to roll on the *spell turning* mishap chart *(Player's Handbook,* page 283).

**FAVORED SPELLS OF THE FORCE MISSILE MAGES**

Force missile mages have a long and prolific history of using and creating magic similar to their spell of choice. Provided here are two spells likely to appear in the spellbooks of many force missile mages.
