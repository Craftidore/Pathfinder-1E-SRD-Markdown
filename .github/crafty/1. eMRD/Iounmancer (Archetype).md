# Iounmancer (Archetype)
## Overview
**IOUNMANCER (ARCHETYPE)**

An iounmancer has learned much about the universe’s raw materials and, using mighty arts and strange machines, can easily conjure forth *ioun stones* from beyond the stars. An iounmancer has the following class features. 

**Summon Stone (Su):** As a full-round action, an iounmancer can summon one *ioun stone* from nebulous origins to appear in orbit around his head. The iounmancer can designate the stone’s color and shape, but it has none of the powers associated with a normal *ioun stone*. Instead, it acts as a material component for an iounmancer’s spells. While a summoned stone circles an iounmancer’s head, he can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing any components. Summoning or dismissing a summoned stone requires a standard action. This ability replaces [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|scribe scroll]]. 

**Star Mantle (Su):** An iounmancer can surround himself with a whirling mass of tiny, many-colored stones. These stones fill his square and absorb spells and spell-like effects targeting him. 

Every day, they can absorb a number of spell levels equal to the iounmancer’s wizard level. In all regards save the number of levels absorbed, this ability functions as *[[Spell Turning (Spell)|spell turning]]* except affected spells are not turned back upon their caster. You can suppress and reactivate this protection as a standard action. Similarly, conjuring or dismissing the star mantle is a standard action. This ability replaces the wizard’s arcane bond. 

**Lesser Ioun Bond (Su):** At 5th level, the iounmancer can imbue one of the stones comprising his star mantle to function as an *ioun stone* with a market price of 5,000 gp or lower. Doing so requires the iounmancer to study and master the stone. This takes 8 hrs. to complete. The stone’s powers can be changed whenever the iounmancer performs the ritual. 

The iounmancer can only have one stone at a time affected by lesser ioun bond, and the stone does not function if given to another individual. If the iounmancer dismisses his star field, he loses the abilities afforded by the lesser ioun bond until he again conjures it into existence. This ability replaces the 5th-level wizard bonus feat. 

**Improved Ioun Bond (Su):** At 10th level, the iounmancer can imbue a second stone from his star mantle to function as an *ioun stone* with a market price of 10,000 gp or less. In all other regards, this ability functions as lesser ioun bond. This ability replaces the 10th-level wizard bonus feat. 

**Greater Ioun Bond (Su):** At 15th level, the iounmancer can imbue a third stone from his star mantle to function as an *ioun stone* with a market price of 30,000 gp or less. In all other regards, this ability functions as lesser ioun bond. This ability replaces the 15th-level wizard bonus feat. 

**Greatest Ioun Bond (Su):** At 20th level, the iounmancer can imbue a fourth stone from his star mantle to function as an *ioun stone* with a market price of 40,000 gp or less. In all other regards, this ability functions as lesser ioun bond. This ability replaces the 20th-level wizard bonus feat.
