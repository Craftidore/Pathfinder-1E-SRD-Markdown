# Slipperyxx (Trait)
## Overview
**Slippery**

You are less adept at grappling and wrestling than others of your size and strength, but you are adept at slipping out of another's hold. 

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks to escape a grapple and on grapple checks to escape a grapple or avoid being [[Grappled|grappled]].

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on all other grapple checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might fear close combat, knowing they are less adept grapplers than most opponents. On the other hand, good escape artists with this trait might enjoy baiting larger foes into grappling them, knowing they can easily slip out of the grasp of most foes.
