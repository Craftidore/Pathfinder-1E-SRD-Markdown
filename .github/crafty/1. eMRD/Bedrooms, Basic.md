# Bedrooms, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 700 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This stronghold area contains two smaller bedrooms, possibly with a connecting door. The furnishings in each room are rough, including a straw bed on a low frame, a single chest of drawers, and a mirror hanging on one wall. The bedclothes are made of rough cotton, wool, or even burlap, and the blanket is often a patchwork quilt made of whatever was available. Each room also has a rough bench sitting in front of a small table. This component includes a privy, though it need not be attached or adjacent to the bedroom component itself.
