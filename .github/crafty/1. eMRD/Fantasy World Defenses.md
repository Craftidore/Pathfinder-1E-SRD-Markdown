# Fantasy World Defenses
## Overview
While actual magical components to protect against hostile spells are detailed under Eldritch Defenses (page 68), there are a few tactics any ship can use when endangered by magic and monsters unseen in the real world.

**Counterspell Defense**

**Prerequisite:** A ship’s mage.

If you have a ship’s mage (page 10), he is assumed to be able to cast a variety of minor counterspells. Three times per day he can create a brief ward affecting the ship and all its crew on board, which reduces the damage from an incoming spell or magical attack by 10 points. 

This is an abstraction for ease of play. A spellcasting PC with the right assortment of magic—or an NPC that you want to specifically stat out—can provide even greater protection than this.

**Dinner Plate Defense**

**Prerequisite:** A ship’s mage and a Look-Out.

A look-out and a ship’s mage with *[[Mage Hand (Spell)|mage hand]]* can use levitating dinner plates to protect against magical attacks that have physical projectiles, like *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* and *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*. When a hostile spell comes in, the spotter makes a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check (DC equal to 10 + the hostile caster’s level), and if successful directs the mage to “catch” it on the plate, 25 feet or more away from the deck. Spells like rays or *fireballs* are blocked, though this typically destroys the dinner plate.

**Mundane Defense**

**Prerequisite:** Four crew and a Look-Out.

This poor-man’s defense has the crew can lash together long gaff hooks to create four 20-ft. poles. Then they attach a pole to each corner of a sail. With the aid of a spotter, four men hold the sail out beyond the side of the ship. This defense functions like Dinner Plate Defense, but can block only one attack per naval round.

**Sea Serpent Deterrence**

**Prerequisite:** Allied ship with special hooked anchors.

In a fantasy world, nobody in their right mind would try to fend off predatory sea beasts with just harpoons. When traveling through waters known to be home to sea serpents, kraken, or other giant monsters, ships in a fantasy setting travel in groups, sharpen spare anchors or carry specially-designed barbed metal hooks, and at a sign of a sea monster they attach these giant fishhooks to anchor lines (or, ideally, chains). When the monster attacks one ship, the other ships sail close and trail the hook, hoping to snag the beast. Optimally, two or more vessels can coordinate their movements so they approach from opposite directions and are thus able to pull the beast two ways at once.

In naval combat, the trawling ships approach to short range, drop the lines, and during the Attack phase have a Look-Out make a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check (DC 5, +5 per size category smaller than Gargantuan\* the creature is) to aim the chains. On a success, the creature is hooked. A single hooked line can snag creatures up to Small size. Multiple lines or a single chain can get a Large creature. Multiple chains are required for Huge or Gargantuan creatures. An insufficient tether will snap or tear free with little effect.

*\* Use ship sizes, not normal creature sizes. A 30-ft. whale is the size of a Small ship.*

If only a single ship managed to hook the target, during the Location phase, the creature and the ship that caught it are free to move closer to each other to fight. Whichever side is smaller cannot change stage, whereas the larger side pulls the smaller side along when it moves.

If two ships have hooked a single creature, they must remain in the same stage, unless they coordinate to move to a new stage. During the Attack phase they can pull in opposite directions. First, have each ship involved make a Command check (DC 20). On a failure, the ship messes up the maneuver and applies too much force, so that either the hook tears free of the beast or the line snaps free of the ship.

If at least two ships succeed, make a single attack roll, 1d20 vs. the creature’s Defense, and for each ship add +5 for each size category that ship is larger than Tiny. So two Medium ships would roll 1d20+20. A hit inflicts one strike, plus an additional strike for every 5 points the attack beats the target’s defense by.

This trick can theoretically also work against hostile vessels, but usually the enemy crew can just pull the hook loose.
