# Energy Eruption (Su)
## Overview
*Energy Eruption (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inf licts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save. A barbarian must have the [[Energy Absorption (Su)|energy absorption]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.
