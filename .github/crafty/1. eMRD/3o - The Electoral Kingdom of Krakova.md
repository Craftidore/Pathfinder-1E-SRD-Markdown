# 3o - The Electoral Kingdom of Krakova
## Overview
**The Electoral Kingdom of Krakova**

Caught between the vampire prince Lucan to the south, the diabolist gnomes to the east in Neimheim, and reavers from the Northlands across the Nieder Straits, it might seem that Krakova is surrounded by a sea of troubles. Its people consider matters differently. It is a time for struggle, and a time to seize the wreath of glory.

Krakova is a strange land, since it chooses its kings not by birth, but by their achievements: the king is voted for by all the landholding, married nobles of good character in the kingdom within a season of the death of the prior king. This election might be held frequently (as in times of plague or war) or only once or twice in a lifetime. The nobles making the decision are called the Slahta, and they chose King Eynryk from among their number 20 years ago. The choice was a good one, in most ways.

## Government
**Government**

Krakova is in experienced and capable hands, though experience and skill are still needed. The 60-year-old King Eynryk is a careful general and cunning politician, able to navigate the reefs of the nation’s large nobility and to issue ringing calls for action that get the nobles moving. Queen Urzula is seen as a saintly figure, inspiring women to strive for greatness as archers, priestesses, and wives and mothers. Some believe that the queen’s upbringing in a Perunalian finishing school influences her advocacy for a greater role for female nobles and female scholars in Krakova.

Beyond the royal pair, the children and various aunts and uncles are all well placed to serve the kingdom. The heir apparent serves with the First Hussars, the eldest daughter Zosia is a respected priestess of Wotan, and the king’s brother, Archduke Avgost, commands great loyalty among the Slahta. The family is positioned to have another of its members voted into power when Eynryk dies. Given the threats and burden of the crown, some maneuvering has already begun in a slow and informal way.

Despite the prominence of the royal family, the Slahta are numerous and powerful. About 100,000 esteemed sons and daughters of Krakova are members of the Slahta, and therefore nobles with particular rights and obligations. Their numbers make them in some ways more powerful than the king, since the Slahta make the laws, and the Krakovan king implements them. The most respected Slahta, the High Posol and the Magnates, meet once a year on the Golden Field of Krakova for the Gathering of Envoys, where new laws are promulgated. This judicial power is rather broad and used as a check on royal power, though only Krakovans understand the dozens of factions, maneuvers, and deceptions practiced at the Gathering.

## Krakova, City of the Mermaid
**Krakova, City of the Mermaid**

The city at the mouth of the Yoshtula river connects the Northlands traditions of Wotan and Sif with the chivalry of the Magdar and—to some degree—a hidden core of positively Septime ruthlessness. Krakova is the largest trading hub of the Nieder Strait, and that size and power work for it: attempts by either dwarves or the guilds of Vidim to dominate shipping in the strait have met with fierce reprisals and open piracy. The city is built on dozens of harbor islands connected by bridges. The largest of them is more than a mile long, the Mermaid’s Island, where the first kings and queens of Krakova were crowned and where the Slahta meets to elect new kings. Indeed, the Mermaid’s Island still includes the Golden Fields, where the crimson-booted nobles gather in great numbers during the envoy season.

Krakova’s Winter Ball is likewise well attended and held each year at the royal Breesek Palace. The palace is heavily warded by runes of Wotan and watched by members of the king’s personal guard, since several vampire assassins have tried to kill King Eynryk in the last five years.

Finally, Krakova’s docks are among the finest in the Northlands, with excellent shelter and quays for cargos. Krakova drives trade to Bjornshafen, Courlandia, Tanserhall, and as far west as Bemmea.

## Varshava, City of Horses
**Varshava, City of Horses**

Famous for races and for its tremendous World Tree Temple to Wotan, Varshava is a home of the horse breeders and the grazing grounds for the royal cavalry. The city’s defenses have recently been improved with two additional towers and a thorough refurbishment of the moat. In addition, Varshava is known for its Horse Fair and its council of priests. Most Krakovan clerics of the Northern gods meet here once each year to ordain new members, choose new leaders, and perform the rites of the World Tree. Pilgrimages from here to the World Tree in distant Domovogrod begin in the month of Sowing, though winter pilgrimages are not unknown.

## Gybick, City of Scribes
**Gybick, City of Scribes**

Gybick thrives on its book trade, its excellence in accountancy, and—secretly—its status as the center of the Krakovan “mice,” the members of its secret network of priests of Loki and Wotan who maintain careful watch over the kingdom, looking for signs of diabolism or vampirism. The Krakovan nobles are rightly concerned about the gnome and undead threats on their borders, and have maintained careful records of attempted incursions from both east and south. Beyond this, the mice of Gybick might have other duties, known only to the king’s inner circle.

## Jozht, City of Fish
**Jozht, City of Fish**

Jozht is a somewhat ordinary fishing village with a carefully maintained harbor, earthen city wall and brick towers, and a hardened garrison used to raids from the North or from Donnermark. The city exports a huge volume of salted fish and herring to the inland regions, so much so that it must now import salt from Salzbach to meet demand.

## Lodezig, City of Amber
**Lodezig, City of Amber**

Wealthy and now somewhat isolated from the rest of the kingdom, the nobles and knights of Lodezig control the inland waterway of the River Runnel leading up to the Cloudwall Mountains, and they fear the dragons and undead of that wild range of peaks. The city is built on an island in the river mouth, with a silty and dangerous harbor. Most of Lodezig’s trade is with the gnomes and Morgau, though the city also sella amber to the dwarves and Northlanders.

## Wallenbirg, City of Pines
**Wallenbirg, City of Pines**

Known for its carved and colorful wooden toys, the skill of its crossbowmen, and the dangers of its forests, Wallenbirg is Krakova’s nearest city to the Tomierran forest. Timber and charcoal make up much of its trade, but it is also the seat of the royal hunting lodge and the jumping-off point for expeditions to the ruins of Thorn. For the most part, the creatures of the woods and the people of the city are constantly at war: trees are cut down, people disappear, and the city is sometimes subject to fey revenges, such as when children disappear or swarms of mice strip the granaries bare.

## Other Landmarks
**Other Landmarks**

**Heiderbirg Castle:** This castle built of bricks at the mouth of the Yoshtula River defends the entire river system against human and dwarven reavers from the North, who come primarily in longships and sometimes carracks, both capable of navigating 50 miles or more up the river if unopposed. This is the headquarters of the Order of the Storm in Krakova.

**The Coastal Watch:** The cities and villages have grown despite a frequent attacks by Northlanders, reaver dwarves, trolls, and Khazzak raiders. Beacon towers along the borders warn of attack, and wooden walls are being replaced with stone in the larger cities. The price for such defenses is higher taxes and despotic rulers, especially on the coast and near Morgau.

**Tannenbirg Castle:** The great forest castle of Tannenbirg is built largely of a huge earthern wall topped with stone. It looks for miles out over the forest toward the Grand Duchy of Dornig. It is the quietest posting in the Krakovan lands, but also a place where armies are raised, outfitted, and trained for the push to recover Vallanoria.

**Yarosbirg Castle:** The third great castle of Krakova is Yarosbirg, a combined home of the Order of the Spear (devoted to Sif) and a monastery devoted to light, faith, and the destruction of the undead. Yarosbirg holds the line against Morgau and Doresh.
