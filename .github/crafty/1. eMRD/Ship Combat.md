# Ship Combat
## Overview
**Ship Combat**

When ships themselves become a part of a battle, combat becomes unusual. The following rules are not meant to accurately simulate all of the complexities of ship-to-ship combat, only to provide you with a quick and easy set of rules to resolve such situations when they inevitably arise in a nautical adventure, whether it be a battle between two ships or between a ship and a sea monster. These rules represent an attempt to strike a balance between verisimilitude and ease and speed of play during combat and can be applied to a vessel of any size, from a simple dinghy to a multi-deck man-oâ€™-war. These rules focus only on piloting and fighting with a ship on the water.
