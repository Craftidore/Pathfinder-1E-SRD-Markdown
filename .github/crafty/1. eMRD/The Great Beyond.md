# The Great Beyond
## Overview
**The Great Beyond**

In the cosmology of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the planes are collectively known as the Great Beyond, and form a vast, nesting sphere. At the heart of the sphere lie the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] and its twisted reflection, the Shadow Plane, bridged by the mists of the [[Ethereal Plane]]. The elemental planes of the Inner Sphere surround this heart. Farther out, beyond the void of the [[Astral Plane]], sits the unimaginably vast Outer Sphere, which is itself surrounded and contained by the innumerable layers of the Abyss
