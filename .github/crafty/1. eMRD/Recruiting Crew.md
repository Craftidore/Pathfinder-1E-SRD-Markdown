# Recruiting Crew
## Overview
While your ship’s Locations and equipment have a large say in her capabilities — determining factors such as her speed and maneuverability, her carrying capacity, and her ability in combat — what really brings your ship to life is her crew. A good crew is capable of getting the most (and sometimes, more) out of a ship. Captains inspire crewmembers to new heights; gunnery sergeants provide the perfect trajectory for a cannon shot, the navigator reads the winds and weather and allows your ship to move at an incredible pace, and even the lowly deckhand has a vital role. Alternately, a poor or simply inexperienced crew is, more often than not, a disaster waiting to happen.

For simplicity, we’ve divided the ship’s compliment into two categories: officers and crewmen (used in a gender neutral here, as these can be male or female). For our purposes, officer is a role that has a leadership aspect on a ship, or otherwise has a significant impact on how a ship operates. In most cases, a PC fills or wants to fill one of these roles.

Crewmen aren’t just people on the ship. They have a job to do, and an officer can command them to perform other tasks as well. They’re the folks who take orders from the gunnery sergeant and load the cannons or who take orders from the First Mate and raise and lower sails to best take advantage of the wind. These roles are probably filled by nameless NPCs. However, it is important to note that if a PC really wants to fill the role of oarsman or fireman or deckhand, why not? Actions are available for him during combat, even when not barking out orders.

## Loyalty Score
**Loyalty Score**

A ship has a Loyalty score that determines effects such as whether the crew mutinies, surrenders during combat, and so forth. Loyalty score is discussed further in the “Combat” chapter. A ship’s Loyalty score is computed as follows:

**Loyalty = The Captain’s level + Captain’s Cha modifier + Navigator’s Wis or Int modifier + Chaplain’s Wis or Cha modifier + other bonuses (see below).**

**TABLE 18: Loyalty Modifiers**


| **Item** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Captain | +Cha modifier |
| Chaplain | +Wis or Cha modifier |
| Navigator | + Int or Wis modifier |
| At least 50% of crew are followers gained from [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]] feat | +2 |
| At least 75% of crew are followers gained from [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]] feat | +4 |
| At least 95% of crew are followers gained from [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]] feat | +6 |
| Pay | +2 (double pay) |
| | +4 (quadruple pay) |
| | –2 (half pay) |
| | –6 (no pay) |
| Rations (food and rum) | +2 (double rations) |
| | –2 (half rations) |
| | –6 (no rations) |
| Time at sea | –1 for each month without landfall |
| Charmed | +10 vs. Mutiny |
| Dominated | +15 vs. Mutiny |
| Battles within last month | +2 per victory –2 per defeat |
| Captain is dead or captured and no new leader has stepped forward | –20 |

**Leader Bonuses:** Ship leaders apply bonuses to Loyalty as specified in the Leadership Roles section below, and summarized in the table.

**Pay and Rations:** Well-paid and well-fed crewmen are less likely to mutiny.

**Battles:** A victorious Captain inspires his crew, while the crew of a repeatedly defeated Captain is likely to prefer a different leader.

**Time at Sea:** Long voyages away from loved ones, the comforts of home and the warmth of the brothel have the effect of fraying nerves and shortening a crew’s patience. This isolation grows worse if a ship is becalmed and makes no progress towards its destination.

**Leadership Feat:** A Captain (or other officer) who uses the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat to recruit the crew gains a bonus on Loyalty checks based upon how many crew members are followers. On the contrary, slaves, impressed commoners, and indentured servants turned into crew often attempt to escape or mutiny as soon as they can.

**Magical Control:** A magically compelled crew is unlikely to mutiny, but cannot be inspired to fight heart and soul for their Captain.

**Captain Deceased or Captured:** A leaderless ship is susceptible to mutiny or surrender. If this condition applies, the next in command makes all required Loyalty checks, including this penalty in the roll.

**Making Loyalty Checks**

A ship’s Captain makes Loyalty checks much like she would make a skill check or ability check. She rolls a d20 and adds the ship’s Loyalty score to the die roll, then compares this result to the DC of the effect she wishes to achieve. When making a Loyalty check, the total die roll plus modifiers determines success; that is, a 1 is not an automatic failure and a 20 is not an automatic success. If the Captain is able to get her modifier sufficiently high such that the crew will never surrender, even under the direst of circumstances, she should be rewarded.

If the Captain is unable to make the required check — such as if she is dead or captured by an enemy ship — required checks are made by the next in command or an officer who asserts authority.

**TABLE 19: Loyalty Checks**


| **Check** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Avoid mutiny per week | 10 (can take 10) |
| Fight a monster with a CR five or greater than the highest level possessed by an officer | 25 |
| Saving throw vs. fear or charm effect | 10 + normal DC |
| Prevent rout / surrender at 50% casualties | 35 |
| Prevent rout / surrender at 75% casualties | 40 |
| Inspire courage +1 | 25 |
| Inspire courage +2 | 35 |
| Inspire courage +3 | 45 |

**Mutiny:** Once per week a Captain must make a successful DC 10 Loyalty check to avoid mutiny on board her ship. A Captain may take 10 on this roll, thus it is not required to roll unless the ship’s Loyalty modifier is negative.

If a crew mutinies, 50% of the crew plus 5% per point of negative Loyalty modifier rise up against the Captain. For example, if a ship has a –5 Loyalty modifier, 75% of the crew mutiny. Each NPC leader rolls a d% and if their roll is below this mutiny percentage they join the mutiny. Treat the mutinous crew as hostile towards the Captain.

**Rout:** A crew will normally surrender if reduced to 50% or less of their starting number during a battle. A Captain of a ship with a high Loyalty modifier can exhort her crew to continue the fight despite their losses. A Captain must roll again once casualties reach 75%.

**Improve Saves:** A Captain of a ship with a high Loyalty modifier can assist her crew to shake off fear or charm effects. The Captain makes a Loyalty check against a DC of 10 plus the effect’s original DC. If her Loyalty check is successful all friendly targets within 60 feet that can see and hear the Captain immediately receive a new saving throw with a +10 morale bonus. If the Captain beats the DC of this check by more than 10 points, the effect is ended instead of granting new saves.

**Inspiration:** A Captain may, as a full-round action, make an impassioned speech to inspire her crew. This ability functions as the bard’s inspire courage ability, but the bonus from the Loyalty check does not stack with the bard’s ability. The inspiration bonus lasts as long as the Captain can continue to spend a move action each round; if the Captain cannot — or chooses not to — the effect ends immediately.

## Officer Roles
**Officer Roles**

As mentioned above, in the *FaSB* rules an officer is a sailor who either has a leadership position on the ship or who otherwise fills an important role. Certain officer roles must be filled, either by a PC if he or she is interested or by an NPC if not.

Beyond this list of mandatory roles, though, you and your players are free to add new ones. For example, Head Cook is a role not detailed here but could be a task of grave import on a ship spending months at sea. If a player in your group expresses interest in such a task, work with the player to develop the role. Perhaps the Head Cook is responsible for keeping the marines and sailors well fed and hydrated, perhaps even combining magical potions such as *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* into the food or drink they supply. The key to any new role is to ensure it *has something meaningful to do* on *every* round of that officer’s ship initiative (discussed below under the Captain entry as well as in the Combat chapter).

### Captain
**Captain**

The Captain of a ship is responsible for the crew’s morale, alacrity, and expertise. On board, her word is law and she is responsible for justice (however rough) amongst the crew.

**Benefit:** A Captain adds her Charisma modifier to the ship’s Loyalty score. She can make use of the ship’s Loyalty score to inspire the crew or free them from mind-affecting magic.

**Vacancy Penalty:** A ship without a Captain loses its stomach for the fight. A leaderless crew takes a –4 penalty to attack rolls and Will saving throws. A ship without a Captain surrenders when suffering 25% casualties, unless other extenuating circumstances exist (for example, if the crew knows the opposing ship will execute them).

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Charisma

**Special:** A Captain typically does not directly command crew, relying on her officers to execute her will. The Captain designates the tasks she wants completed and which officer she wants to complete them on a turn-by-turn basis. However, the Captain (if she chooses) can directly command 20 crewmen, just as a Mate. These crewmen directly under her command are in addition to the orders she relays to the ship’s officers.

### Navigator
**Navigator**

The Navigator is responsible for the navigation of a sailing vessel.

**Benefit:** Any [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography) or [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to avoid getting lost are made using the Navigator’s modifier. The Navigator adds her Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is better) to a ship’s Loyalty score. Navigators are responsible for the sails and rigging.

At the start of combat, the Navigator makes a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) or [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check to enable his ship to take advantage of the weather gauge. Rules for the weather gauge are discussed in the Combat chapter.

**Vacancy Penalty:** A ship without a Navigator immediately becomes lost, but may make [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks (DC 15) to escape this condition. In addition, the ship’s maximum Speed is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 1). Finally, a ship without a Navigator cannot take advantage of the weather gauge if it is available, and if there is no Navigator at the start of a naval engagement, the ship cannot claim gauge.

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Intelligence or Wisdom.

**Special:** A Navigator may command up to 20 crewmen, as a Mate does.

### Chaplain
**Chaplain**

The Chaplain is responsible for the spiritual wellbeing of those on board.

**Benefit:** A Chaplain adds his Wisdom or Charisma bonus to the ship’s Loyalty, whichever is higher. In order to gain this benefit, the majority of the crew must share either the Chaplain’s alignment, the Chaplain’s deity, or the alignment of the Chaplain’s deity.

**Vacancy Penalty:** A ship without a Chaplain takes a –2 penalty to Loyalty.

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Wisdom or Charisma

**Special:** A Chaplain may command up to 20 crewmen, as a Mate does. A PC serving the role of Chaplain may also fill one other officer role. However, doing so does not allow him to command extra crew — that is, he still only may issue commands to 20 crewmen during a naval engagement. See Combat for more details.

**Surgeon**

The Surgeon deals with battlefield casualties and the ongoing health of the crew.

**Benefit:** A Surgeon adds his Wisdom or Intelligence bonus to the ship’s Loyalty. In addition, the Surgeon is responsible for keeping injured crewmen alive and — when possible — getting them back into the battle. Oftentimes, Surgeons give their crewmen standing orders to fan out across the ship and treat the injured as necessary.

*Stabilize:* The Surgeon and his crewmen are responsible for stabilizing the injured. At any time during his Naval Action, the Surgeon may make a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check as a free action. If he’s successful, he stabilizes one crewman; this crewman cannot fight again that day (unless later the recipient of magical healing) but will live to fight another day. For every two crewmen under the Surgeon’s command, he can stabilize one more injured crewman. The Surgeon need not be present in order for his [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check to affect an injured crewman, so long as at least two of his crewmen are in the same Location as the injured sailor. In essence, the player of the Surgeon makes one [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check to determine the effectiveness of those under his command, regardless of where they are on the ship. For example, if the Surgeon has 20 crewmen under his command and the ship has just suffered a round of cannonball fire, he and his crewmen can stabilize up to 11 injured crewmen — one by the surgeon himself and 10 more by his crewmen — as long as all the injured crewmen can be treated that round. Crewmen stabilized in this manner are unavailable to the Captain and other officers during the battle, but will recover afterward. If an injured crewman is not treated for five consecutive rounds, he dies and cannot be stabilized or patched up. While officers and PCs can be stabilized in this way, they follow the normal dying rules if left untreated rather than those simplified here for standard crewmen.

*Patch Up:* In addition to stabilizing crewmen, each round on his Naval Action the Surgeon may make a DC 25 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check as a standard action if he or his crewmen are actively treating the injured. If this “patch up” check is successful, one of the injured crewmen who normally would have been stabilized is instead healed sufficiently to immediately return to the battle. If he and his crewmen are spread out across the ship, it’s the Surgeon’s choice where the injured crewman is patched up, so long as he or his crewmen are in that area. For every 5 points by which the Surgeon beats the DC, one more injured crewman is returned to the fray. For example, if the Surgeon rolls a 37 on his [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check, he and his crewmen return 3 injured crewmen back to the battle, providing the Captain and Mates more resources with which to work. This ability does not apply to officers and PCs.

*Assessment:* As a standard action on his Naval Action, the surgeon can assess the crewmen of the enemy ship. To do so, he must have line of sight to the ship. He makes a DC 30 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check and, if successful, gains a basic understanding of the status of the enemy crewmen. He learns information such as percentage of crewmen lost (either through death or being stabilized and therefore unable to fight). In addition, he can say how many officers have become incapacitated or died. The GM tells him a value +/–1 of the correct number in regards to officers. If the Surgeon instead beats a DC of 40, the GM tells him the exact number.

*Post-Battle Recovery:* At the end of the battle, the Surgeon and his crew move about the ship and tend to the injured and dying. The Surgeon makes a special [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check, with the result of the check plus 10 being the percentage of “deceased” crew from the battle that don’t actually die. This check requires one hour from the Surgeon and his crew, and he must have at least 4 crewmembers under his command during this task. For example, if the Surgeon was unable to reach the lower hull to save 15 crewmembers there, those sailors were removed from the battle and marked as deceased (see the “stabilize” action above). With this action, the Surgeon could save some percentage of those crewmembers, as determined by his [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check. The surgeon makes one check for the entire ship, using his result to determine the total percentage recovered after battle.

**Vacancy Penalty:** Without a Surgeon, only 5% of casualties recover at the end of the battle. A ship without a Surgeon is susceptible to disease and illness, causing 1d6 of its crewmen to become incapacitated (treat as 0 hp) per week.

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Intelligence or Wisdom 

**Special:** To perform their duties, Surgeons can designate up to 20 crewmen as interns and send them out to transport wounded and unconscious crewmen back to the Surgeon for treatment. Alternately, Surgeons may lead up to 20 crewmen (interns) around the ship to treat casualties where they lie in the field (Surgeon’s choice).

### Mates
**Mates**

The ship’s Mates command its crewmen in any number of roles. Each commands up to 20 crewmen in whatever tasks are required. On larger ships these tasks can be specialized, but on smaller ships the Mates are expected to lead their crewmen in completing different tasks. There is no limit to the number of Mates on one ship; however, the GM should ensure all PCs have a role before assigning NPCs into these roles, and shouldn’t make an NPC a Mate unless it’s truly necessary.

It’s also possible — and sometimes necessary — for two Mates to fill the same role. For example, on a ship with multiple gun decks, it probably makes sense to have two (or more) gunnery sergeants, each commanding 20 crewmen as necessary to enact the Captain’s wishes in naval combat.

**Benefit:**

*Away Team:* A Mate leading crewmen on a boarding mission grants his crewmen benefits while aboard the enemy ship. All away team crewmen (not officers or PCs) gain a +3 bonus when flanking an enemy, instead of the standard +2. In addition, they all receive a +2 morale bonus to saving throws.

*Combat*: If a Mate commanding crewmen in hand-to-hand combat aboard his own ship has the [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]] feat, all his crewmen gain a +2 feat bonus to initiative. This bonus does not stack with [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]]; that is, if the crewman has [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]] on her own, she does not also gain this +2 bonus. In addition, all his crewmen (not officers or PCs) fighting to repel a boarding party gain a +1 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls.

*Fire Master:* A Mate specializing in dealing with onboard fires gains a +2 bonus to Reflex saves to extinguish these fires. In addition, only a roll of a natural 1 inflicts damage on the crewmen for an unsuccessful check. Normally, crewmen are affected by a failure of more than 5 on the Reflex save to extinguish fires. More information about fires aboard a ship and extinguishing them can be found in the Combat chapter.

*Gunnery*: A Mate applies any of his cannon-specific feats to crewmen (not officers or PCs) under his command. These include [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]], [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]], Naval Gunnery, and Storm-Tossed Gunnery.

*Rowing*: A Mate can increase the maneuverability of a ship under oars manned by his crewmen by one category with a successful DC 20 [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check. For ships that require more than 20 crewmen to row, each mate must successfully make this check to achieve the maneuverability bonus. The bonus lasts for one round, and can only be acquired three times/day.

*Sailing*: A Mate can direct five crewmen to raise or lower sails in 1 round, rather than the standard 2 rounds, with a successful DC 20 [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check.

*Temporary Captain*: Should the Captain fall in battle, a Mate, Navigator, or Chaplain may attempt to step into the leadership void. The Mate must take a ship-based action as well as his own as a full-round action, during which time he makes an impassioned plea to the crew to rally in spite of the loss of their Captain. The Mate then makes a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check opposed by the ship’s Loyalty score. If the Mate is successful, he becomes the ship’s Captain in the eyes of the crew; all crewmen who heard the new Captain’s rallying speech gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks for a number of rounds equal to the new Captain’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

**Vacancy Penalty:** An untrained or leaderless crew is inefficient, and twice as many crewmen are needed to complete crew actions other than firing cannon. This includes bailing water, extinguishing fires, grappling, and managing sails.

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma

**Special:** A Mate must be in the same or an adjacent Location to command his crewmen. However, a Mate can give standing orders for a crewman (or part of a crew); those orders remain in effect until a Mate (the same or different) gives new orders to the crewmen. For example, a Mate can command 10 crewmen of his 20-man crew to go below deck and bail water, and then command the other 10 to follow him to the brig. The partial crew that follows him to the brig can receive new orders at any time, but the 10 who went to bail water will need to continue at their task until told otherwise.

### Engineer
**Engineer**

The Engineer is a specialized Mate who is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the ship’s engine, whether the engine uses a standard fuel source such as coal, an alchemical fuel source, or magic. Typically (but not always), the Engineer of an alchemical or magical ship’s engine room is well versed in that form of energy. See Engineers and Skill Checks for information about how skills interact with different types of engines.

**Benefit:** When first coming aboard a ship, the Engineer must spend 24 hours getting to know the ship and the engine. These hours need not be consecutive. After the attunement process is complete, the Engineer and her crewmen are capable of providing appropriate operational support for the engine. The Captain and Navigator can, at all times, take advantage of the power of the engine.

In addition, the Engineer can attempt the following checks as needed:

*Repair:* Should the engine ever become damaged, the Engineer is responsible for repairs. She attempts a DC 20 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check. If successful, she and her crewmen repair 10 points of damage in one day. For every 5 points by which the Engineer exceeds the DC, she and her crewmen accomplish an additional 1 point of repair. For example, if she rolls a total of 32 on her [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check, she and her crewmen will be able to repair 12 points of damage to the engine. The Engineer can take 10 on this check, but not 20. Up to 4 crewmen may perform an aid another action.

*Overload:* With a DC 25 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check, the Engineer can temporarily overload the engine, enabling it to function at higher-than-normal levels at the expense of damage. A successful check allows the ship to gain a +2 bonus to Base Speed for up to one minute. However, for each round spent overloaded, the engine suffers one-tenth of its normal hit point total in damage that must be later repaired; this damage bypasses the engine’s hardness. The Engineer can cease the increased movement at any time before the full duration expires.

*Naval Tactics:* On a successful DC 20 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check, the Engineer can grant the Navigator a +4 bonus to accomplish any one Naval Tactic by perfectly timing the engine’s power level up or down as needed. If the Engineer fails the check, the engine suffers 5 points of damage and the Navigator receives a –2 penalty on the Naval Tactic check instead.

*Self-Destruct:* The Engineer can set the engine so that it overloads and explodes, scuttling the ship. To accomplish this, the Engineer must succeed on a DC 35 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) check. In addition, three other crewmen (or officers) must aid him in the process and succeed on their own DC 15 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) checks; neither the Engineer nor his crewmen may take 10 or 20 on this check. If the checks are successful, the engine builds pressure without putting output to the propulsion system; the entire system explodes 1d3 minutes later, inflicting 20d6 points of force damage to all objects and creatures within a 100-foot radius of the engine. If the engine was steam-powered, alchemical, or magical it also deals 10d6 points of fire damage. At any time up until it explodes, the Engineer (DC 30) and his assistants (DC 10) can all make checks to reverse the process. If the process is ever started and later reversed, the engine suffers 90% of its maximum hit points as damage and is inoperable until repaired.

**Vacancy Penalty:** A ship that possesses an engine but no Engineer cannot stop, start, or alter the power of the engine.

**Ship Initiative Modifier:** Intelligence or Wisdom 

**Special:** Only a ship with an engine has an Engineer (and the associated crew).

## Recruiting Crew
**Recruiting Crew**

A ship’s crew is its lifeblood, operating the rigging, raising and lowering the sails, pulling the oars, and firing its cannon. While a vicious pressgang can round up unwilling “volunteers” to crew a ship, highly paid and trained specialist crewmen are worth their weight in gold. Potential crewmen congregate at port towns of any size, usually in the taverns or at the waterfront, waiting for the right captain and ship to offer the right wage for service — though smaller towns may not have the exact crew desired by the Captain. As a rule of thumb, no more than one-third of a town’s population can be hired (or forced) to become crewmen without the townsfolk attacking.

In such circumstances, treat most such townsfolk as “Landsman” in the table below; they possess no special skills required for sailing or maintaining a ship, regardless of their class or level.

**TABLE 20: Crew Types**


| | **Pay/** |  | **Average** | **Average** | **Average** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Crewman** | **Day** | **Special** | **HP** | **AC** | **Saves** |
| Landsman | 1 sp | — | 4 | 11 | 0 / 1 / 0 |
| Seaman (Average) | 3 sp | +4 [[Profession (Skill)\|Profession]] (sailor) | 8 | 12 | 1 / 4 / 1 |
| Marine | 3 sp | +1 BAB, 1 useful combat feat | 12 | 14 | 4 / 1 / 0 |
| Able Seaman | 1 gp | +5 [[Profession (Skill)\|Profession]] (sailor) | 20 | 13 | 2 / 5 / 2 |
| Veteran | 1 gp | +3 BAB, 2 useful combat feats | 27 | 15 | 5 / 2 / 1 |
| Corsair or Buccaneer | 2 gp | +7 [[Profession (Skill)\|Profession]] (sailor), 1 useful combat feat | 30 | 17 | 3 / 7 / 2 |

## The Recruitment Roll
**The Recruitment Roll**

While at dock, a Captain can recruit as many crewmen as she likes, up to one-third the town’s population. To actively recruit crew, the Captain makes either a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check to gather information or a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check, whichever is higher. If the Captain has the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this check. If the Captain has earned great renown for his work, he gains a bonus from +1 to +4 (GM’s discretion).

A successful DC 10 check allows the Captain to recruit 11–20% (1d10+10) of the number of crew he seeks. A DC 18 check allows the Captain to recruit 41–50% (1d10+40). A DC 25 check allows the recruiting of 81-90% (1d10+80) of the crew. A check of 30 or higher allows the Captain to find all the crewmen he seeks (up to the maximum allowed for the town).

Note, however, that just because the Captain can find the number of crewmen he seeks doesn’t mean he finds the exact sailor he needs. Normally 31-50% (1d20+30) of potential recruits will be no more skilled than a seaman. Regardless of the number of crewmen recruited, this check represents one day’s work by the Captain and his Mates. 

Should the Captain or his Mates seek to press crewmen (kidnap them) rather than actively recruit, the Captain makes either an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check. The check DCs are the same as above, except pressganging a crew results in 61–80% (1d20+60) of the recruits being no better than landsman.

## Crew on Your Ship
**Crew on Your Ship**

Rigging Locations, cannon, and oars require a minimum level of crew to function and a surplus of crew is usually handy once the battle casualties start rolling in. Remember that, if you plan to capture an enemy ship, you will need enough crew to sail that one as well as your own vessel. For each crew member, a supply of food and equipment is required. Each crew member requires 600 lbs. of weight capacity on board a ship to represent their weight and personal effects, and costs 5 sp per day to feed. Extra or reduced rations affect the crew’s Loyalty.

## Crew Advancement
**Crew Advancement**

Crew who survive a battle gain XP as normal. Determine the encounter levels of all battles, and assign XP to the crew. When a crewmember gains a new level, his or her pay — and rank — should increase accordingly. In addition, a higher level crew is more adroit at accomplishing the tasks needed on a ship. If at least half the crewmen commanded by a Mate possess 3 or more ranks in [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor), the Mate gains a +1 circumstance bonus to all his ship-based actions. If at least half the crewmen commanded by a Mate possess 6 or more ranks in [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor), the bonus increases to +2. If at least half possess 10 or more ranks in [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) — a truly legendary crew — the bonus increases to +4.

## Standard Crew Roles
**Standard Crew Roles**

While the crew, mates, and leaders of a ship have been lumped together as an abstraction in game terms, the following are actual ship positions a crew member may fill:
