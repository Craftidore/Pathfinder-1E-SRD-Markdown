# Quest Feats
## Overview
While most characters earn feats through physical or mental training, others come at a higher difficulty - the result of a long and difficult journey. Unlike most feats, quest feats require unusual requirements, which require roleplay. A quest feat must be earned as part of a story, and the player must announce the intent to pursue a quest feat instead of purchasing a normal one. Once the character has fulfilled the requirements for the quest feat, he immediately gains it. A character that has lost the effects of a quest feat may not purchase it again, and wastes his previous feat expenditure.

There are times a DM may wish to reward exemplary role-playing and effort with a bonus quest feat. But these should be saved for exceptional circumstances.

In any case, No quest feat is available before 9th level.
