# Healing (Hex)
## Overview
*Healing (Su)*: A witch can soothe the wounds of those she touches. This acts as a *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* spell, using the witchâ€™s caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this hex acts like *[[Cure Moderate Wounds (Spell)|cure moderate wounds]]*.
