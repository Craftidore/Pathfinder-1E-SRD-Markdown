# 3e6 - Caravans of the Shadow Road
## Overview
**Caravans of the Shadow Road**

With Tuck’s fortune and Jabber’s brass balls, the pair commissioned a mule train and wagons to drive the shadow road (also called the Niflheim Road). The wagons would travel the impossible route by way of blood and poetry gathered from the poorest and most desperate minstrels of Zobeck.

It shouldn’t have worked, but it did.

Though the first emissaries to the Winter Court returned to the Free City in pieces over a period of six months, the youths-turned-merchants persevered. The pair took on a promising young linguist of the Arcane Collegium named Matthias Yronwood, known for his controversial publications on the intricacies of shadow fey speech. Soon enough, Yronwood’s research on the shadow fey tongue and insights into fey customs gave Jabber’s brashness and Tuck’s money the chance to see returns.

With Yronwood’s guidance, the young factors established trade routes and even spoke to the Winter Court—still ruled by the Goddess of Night and Magic—without offending the nobility in attendance. Yronwood established protocols to ensure negotiations and conversation between human and fey in moderate safety.

Before the year was out, the first glass caravans returned to Zobeck from the far-off Shadow Realm. The profit margin was enormous, given the fey’s belief that haggling for gold—as opposed to the sublime intangibles of mortal memory and human degradation—was beneath them, and the simple fact that the Winter Court has little use for money.

Gold changed hands, but not nearly as much as Jabber and Tuck feared. The alabaster fey happily took gold for the children’s toys and journeymen’s work the caravans seemed so interested in (such as ghostly silver lutes, goblets of spun ice, or essence of blizzard), but the rarest items were sold only for happy memories, years of the human haggler’s life, or sex. Given the beauty of the Winter Court, the last was the most freely traded. When asked why such a premium was placed on congress with mortals, the fey invariably replied, “It warms us.”

For the first decade, Jabber and Tuck controlled the market for Winter Court moonlight steel. To this day, their original caravan—the Chartered Merchants of Scáthesidhe—conveys the most intricate wares direct from the Winter Court’s capital. Other caravans now brave the shadow road each year, returning with riches and wonders never before seen, but for moonlight steel and mirrors, Zobeck has the market cornered.
