# Sharpened Accuracy (Ex)
## Overview
*Sharpened Accuracy (Ex)*: When using her [[Surprise Accuracy (Ex)|surprise accuracy]] rage power, the barbarian ignores the miss chance for concealment and treats total concealment as concealment. She also ignores cover penalties except those from total cover. A barbarian must have the [[Surprise Accuracy (Ex)|surprise accuracy]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
