# Enlightened Fist (PrC)
## Overview
Not all monks pursue metaphysical perfection to the exclusion

of all other study. Some monks combine a rigorous

discipline of academic study with martial arts and development

of the body. For these monks, that study includes the

practice of magic and the implementation of certain arcane

tricks into their unarmed combat styles. These enlightened

fi sts master the use of touch spells, creating new forms of

combat where their fi sts strike with blinding speed, phenomenal

power, and magical energy.

Most enlightened fi sts are monk/sorcerers or monk/wizards.

Some focus heavily on one class or the other, while

others seek to maintain balance between their arcane and

physical training.

Enlightened fi sts are most common in metropolitan

settings, where magical training is available and becomes

an integral component of the monastic life. Enlightened fi st NPCs often live in communities with ordinary monks,

practicing magic primarily as a means of self perfection.

Adaptation: In the world of Eberron, enlightened fi sts can

be found throughout Khorvaire. They are most common in

Aundair, where arcane schools abound.

Some arcane fi sts could rise from divine backgrounds. In

such cases, the requirements for the class would

change from Knowledge (arcana) to Knowledge

(religion) and would require the character

to be capable of casting 2nd-level

divine spells (instead of arcane spells).

However, because divine spells

are generally better at improving

a character in melee, the caster

level progression noted in the

table below cannot go unmodifi

ed. Instead of gaining +1

level in spellcasting ability

at every level except 1st and

6th, the divine enlightened

fi st should gain +1 level of

existing divine spellcasting

class at 2nd, 4th, 6th,

8th, and 10th level only.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the

enlightened fi st.

Weapon and Armor Profi -

ciency: Enlightened fi sts gain

no profi ciency with any weapon

or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells

Known: Except at 1st level

and 6th level, an enlightened

fi st gains new spells

per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as

if she had also gained

a level in an arcane

spellcasting class to

which she belonged

before adding the

prestige class level.

She does not, however,

gain any other

benefi t a character of

that class would have

gained (such as the bonus

feat sometimes gained by

a wizard). If she had more

than one arcane spellcasting

class before becoming an

enlightened fi st, she must

decide to which class to add

each level for the purpose of

determining spells per day

and spells known.

Ki Strike (Su): An enlightened fi st’s unarmed attacks are

empowered with *ki.* Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic

weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with

damage reduction.

Monk Abilities: An enlightened fi st adds her class level

to her monk level to determine her class-based AC bonus,

her unarmed damage, her unarmored speed bonus, and the

number of daily attempts of her Stunning Fist feat. If she has

no monk levels, she gains the AC bonus, unarmed damage,

and unarmored speed bonus of a monk whose level equals

her enlightened fi st level, but she can’t add her Wisdom

bonus to her AC.

An enlightened fi st does not count her class levels for the

purpose of determining when she gains any other monk class

features, such as reduced penalties for fl urry of blows attack

rolls, bonus feats, evasion, or other special abilities.

Fist of Energy (Su): Once per round as a free action,

an enlightened fist of 2nd level or higher can spend one

of her daily stunning attempts to imbue her unarmed

strikes with either electricity or fire. The enlightened

fist chooses the energy type each time she activates. For

1 round, each of her unarmed strike that hits deals an

extra 1d6 points of damage (electricity or fire, depending

on the choice).

At 6th level and higher, an enlightened fist can cause

her energy-imbued unarmed strikes to burst with flame

or lightning on a critical hit. In addition to dealing an

extra 1d6 points of energy damage, her unarmed attacks

deal an extra 1d10 points of energy damage on a successful

critical hit. If the enlightened fist’s unarmed critical

multiplier is ×3, she adds an extra 2d10 points of energy

damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, she adds an

extra 3d10 points of energy damage. An enlightened fist

with monk levels can use this ability to channel energy

through wielded monk weapons just as she can through

her unarmed attacks.

Arcane Fist (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, an enlightened

fi st can spend one of her daily stunning attempts to cast

and deliver a touch spell as part of an unarmed full attack

action. She can choose to deliver the touch spell with

any single unarmed strike attack she makes during the

action.

Arcane Rejuvenation (Su): An enlightened fist of

5th level or higher can channel arcane energy to heal

her own wounds. As a standard action, she can sacrifice

one of her prepared spells or unused spell slots; doing

this heals a number of hit points of damage equal to the

spell’s level.

Hold Ray (Ex): At 7th level or higher, an enlightened

fi st can cast any spell that produces a ray effect as a touch

spell instead. The spell’s range is reduced to touch, and its

Effect entry is replaced with “Target: Creature touched.” She

can deliver the spell with a touch attack or with a normal

attack, and she can hold the charge as with a normal touch

spell. An enlightened fi st can combine this ability with

arcane fi st (see above) to deliver a ray-effect spell as part of

an unarmed full attack action.

Diamond Soul (Ex): At 9th level, an enlightened fi st gains

spell resistance equal to 10 + the total of her monk levels and

enlightened fi st levels .

Multiclassing Note: A monk who becomes an enlightened

fi st can continue advancing as a monk. Furthermore,

the character’s class levels in any classes that grant arcane

spellcasting ability (such as sorcerer or warmage) do not

prevent her from continuing to advance as a monk.
