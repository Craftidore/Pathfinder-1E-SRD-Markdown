# Classically Schooled (Trait)
## Overview
**Classically Schooled:** Your apprenticeship or early education was particularly focused on the direct application of magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks, and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] is always a class skill for you.
