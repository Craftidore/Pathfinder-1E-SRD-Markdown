# Storage, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 250 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This empty room has rough walls and an unfinished (possibly dirt) floor. Due to the need for aisles and sensible stacking, a typical storage component offers about 2,000 cubic feet of usable storage space. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.

You can turn a storage space into a vault with the addition of safeguards such as watchmen, strong walls, traps, locks, and wondrous architecture.
