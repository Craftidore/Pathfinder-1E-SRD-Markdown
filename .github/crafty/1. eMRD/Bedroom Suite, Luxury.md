# Bedroom Suite, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 2 ss

**Cost:** 25,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One valet

No expenses were spared in creating this space. The walk-in closet features rows of shelves for boots and shoes, plus handmade hangers for the finest in clothing. The walk-in garderobe allows two individuals to see to their privy needs in privacy and comfort. 

In the main room, there are two marble-topped bureaus filled with clothes. The four-poster bed is made of the finest wood hung with the wispiest of linens, and the mattress and the blankets are stuffed with feathers. The sheets are silk.

A pair of stuffed chairs sits in one corner. In another, a finely polished and fully stocked writing desk waits to be used.

The walls are adorned with fine art, often of people in positions of repose. Sometimes they feature dreamy scenes filled with pleasant nymphs or other fantastic or heavenly scenes.

The luxuriousness of the room requires a single valet.
