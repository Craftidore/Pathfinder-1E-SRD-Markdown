# Infusion (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Infusion:* When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemistâ€™s daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.
