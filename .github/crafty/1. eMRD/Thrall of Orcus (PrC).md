# Thrall of Orcus (PrC)
## Overview
“Bloated goat prince of undeath, master of vampires and lord of

specters, Orcus, grant me your crushing might and the deadly

power of your skull-headed wand!”

—Quah-Nomag the Skull-King

The thrall of Orcus has devoted herself to the demon

prince of undeath. In his service, she becomes a tool of

misery, murder, and revenge. She revels in the company

of the undead, preferring their decaying

touch to that of living flesh.

Clerics, wizards, and sorcerers make the best

thralls of Orcus, although bards, blackguards,

and various multiclass characters also join

his demonic ranks occasionally.

Thralls of Orcus often work in small

groups. These cabals of necromancers and

necrophiliacs consort with undead creatures

and demons to form small cells of

depraved evil hidden amid bustling cities

and quiet villages. Thralls of Orcus hate

and war against the thralls of Demogorgon

and Graz’zt.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of

Orcus prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall

of Orcus is proficient with all simple and martial

weapons, with all types of armor, and

with shields.

Bonus Feat or Spells: When a thrall of

Orcus attains 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the

character gains new spells per day as if she

had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting

class she belonged to before she added the

prestige class, or else she gains a bonus feat of

her choice. If the thrall chooses +1 spellcasting

level, she does not gain any other benefit a character

of that class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic

or item creation feats, hit points beyond

those received from the prestige class, and so

on), except for an increased effective

level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that she adds the new level to

the level of whatever other spellcasting

class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known,

and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one

spellcasting class before she became

a thrall of Orcus, she must decide

to which class she adds the level for purposes

of determining spells per day.

A thrall of Orcus is free to choose the bonus feat at one

opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the

decision arises, or vice versa. Characters who are not spellcasters

must choose the bonus feat.

Carrion Stench (Ex): A thrall of Orcus, when desired,

emits a terrible smell in a 10-foot radius. Living creatures in

the radius (excluding the thrall) must succeed at a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + thrall’s class level + thrall’s Con modifier) or

take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls,

saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round

per class level of the thrall of Orcus. Furthermore, mindless

undead creatures within the radius of the stench believe the

thrall of Orcus to be undead.

Touch of Fear (Sp): Three times per day, a 2nd-level thrall of

Orcus can produce an effect identical to that of the cause fear

spell cast by a 10th-level caster.

Demon Wings (Su): Once per day, a 3rd-level thrall of

Orcus can bring forth massive black wings from his back.

These wings allow the thrall to fly at his normal land speed

with average maneuverability. The demon wings last for up

to 1 hour and are dismissible with a standard action. At 7th

level, the thrall can use his demon wings at will, and they

last as long as needed.

Massive Girth/Skeletal Visage (Su): At 4th level, a

thrall of Orcus must choose to become obese like her dread

master or gaunt like an undead creature. Depending on the

choice, the thrall gains the Deformity (obese) or Deformity

(gaunt) feat as a bonus feat.

Summon Undead (Sp): Once per day, a 5th-level thrall of

Orcus can summon 1d4 ghouls, 1d3 shadows, 1 wight, or 1

wraith as the summon monster spell cast by a caster of her

class level. At 9th level, the thrall can summon 1d3 mummies,

1 spectre, 1 mohrg, 1 vampire, or 1 ghost instead. If she

chooses a vampire or a ghost, its character level is one less

than the thrall’s class level.

Pallor of Death (Su): A 6th-level thrall of Orcus can

adopt the appearance of a humanoid undead creature of her

choosing as if she had cast the alter self spell. While in this

form, the thrall has an aura of fear (as the fear spell cast by a

6th-level caster) that affects only living nonoutsiders within

25 feet. Pallor of death lasts for 1 minute per class level and

can be used once per day.

Death Touch (Sp): An 8th-level thrall of Orcus can force a

living creature hit with a touch attack to attempt a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + thrall’s class level + thrall’s Cha bonus). If the

target fails its save, it dies.

Summon Nightwing (Sp): A 10th-level thrall of Orcus can

summon 1 nightwing once per week, as the summon monster

spell cast by a 15th-level caster.
