# Platform of Levitation, Greater (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Levitation:** Anyone standing upon this square platform can cause it to levitate up or down at a rate of 20 feet per round. If more than one person attempts to direct the platform of levitation at once, the winner of an opposed Wisdom check gains control for that round. In the case of a tie, the platform stays remains in place for 1 round. When not in use, the platform levitates in place.

The *greater platform of levitation* (10 feet by 10 feet) can lift a full 2000 pounds in addition to itself.

*Greater platforms of levitation* often serve as freight elevators, used to haul heavy things up and down between levels in a stronghold. They can even move large weaponry into place at the top of a tower.

Some stronghold owners use the *greater platform of levitation* to travel between floors. When the platform is in place, it serves as both ceiling and floor, sealing the room from unwanted visitors.

*Caster Level:* 20th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]*; Market Price: 40,000 gp.
