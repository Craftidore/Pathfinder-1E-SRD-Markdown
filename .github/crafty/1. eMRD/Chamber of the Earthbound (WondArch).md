# Chamber of the Earthbound (WondArch)

Characters flying before entering the chamber float to the ground as if the spellâ€™s duration had expired. Upon leaving the chamber, any *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* spells or effects whose duration has not expired returns to normal efficacy.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Spell Immunity (Spell)|spell immunity]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
