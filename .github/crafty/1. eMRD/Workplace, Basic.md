# Workplace, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 500 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Each workplace contains tools and equipment dedicated to a singular purpose, usually the application of a specific [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill. For example, you might build a carpenter’s workshop, a painter’s studio, or a brewer’s distillery. Use this stronghold space for whatever you need, and you can add one or more assistants or servants as needed (see Staff later in this chapter).
