Symbol: The symbol of the Brightmantle Consortium is

a forge over water.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: When the trees were

new, and the earth chafed while the mountains grew in

like baby’s teeth, legend goes that Durgan Brightmantle

soothed the stone with gifts of ore and the sweet taste of

gems. Countless eons later, a dwarf clan devoted to Durgan

Brightmantle and the extraction of the earth’s riches

founded their business based on mining and smithing.

Since then, the small weapons shop in Isher has grown

into one of the most powerful trading enterprises in the

known world, shipping goods across kingdoms and even

overseas, hiring caravan guards and traveling casters and

buying land for forges in a large number of new towns.

Brightmantle has even created entire new towns at particularly

promising sites.

Enemies and Allies: Of necessity, the Brightmantle

Consortium maintains good relations with all the monarchs

in its scope of infl uence. Its relations with fi ghting companies

are often strained, for while the latter are paid to go to war,

business is diffi cult in those times.

Members: Most members of the Consortium are dwarves,

although all the common races are represented.

The Brightmantle Consortium works diligently to retain

its members, not wishing to expend resources on training

new ones. If one chooses to leave, however, the Consortium

does not contest the decision, with one exception. If the

guild member joins another business, and the Consortium

feels that trade secrets have been compromised, then the

Consortium lobbies whatever local law exists in an effort to

have the turncoat’s new business outlawed.

Type: Business.

Scale: 14 (continental/seafaring kingdom).

**Affiliation**

**Score Title: Benefi ts and Duties**

3 or lower No affiliation.

4–10 **Freelancer:** The Consortium occasionally calls on you to help on specific jobs.

11–20 **Associate:** +1 competency bonus on Diplomacy checks when speaking about business matters.

21–29 **Subguild Head:** Placed in charge of one of the many subguilds and commanding the services of fi ve 4th-level experts (allot skill points as you like, for you can choose from the many clerks in the Consortium). Once per month, your experts must each make a DC 20 Appraise check and a DC 15 Gather Information check. If three or more fail the Appraise check, business is bad, and you lose 1 point from your affi liation score. If all five fail the Gather Information check, you fail to anticipate and deter a kidnap and ransom attempt targeting you or your family, and an EL 10 band of rogues arrives to carry out the deed.

30 or higher **Secretary of the Overguild:** Can borrow up to 30,000 gp in cash from guild coffers, but this debt must be repaid within one year.

Executive Powers: Craft, gift, trade.
