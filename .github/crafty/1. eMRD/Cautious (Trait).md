# Cautious (Trait)
## Overview
**Cautious**

You are cautious in combat, even a bit cowatdly, and you take more care to defend yourself than others. However, this caution renders you susceptible to fear effects.

**Benefit:** You gain an additional +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class whenever you :fight defensively or take the total derense action.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on saving throws made to resist fear effects.

**Special:** You cannot select this trait if you have immunity to fear or fear effects. If you later gain immunity to fear, you lose the benefit of this trait.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might consistently urge talking rather than fighting, or they might do little to encourage that their companions avoid combat and simply remain as fat away from foes as possible, using ranged weapons or spells.
