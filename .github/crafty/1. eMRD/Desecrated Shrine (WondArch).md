# Desecrated Shrine (WondArch)
## Overview
**Desecrated Shrine:** The entire stronghold space is desecrated, as per the spell. All Charisma checks to turn undead suffer a –6 penalty. Undead in the space gain a profane +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and saves. Undead cannot be created within nor summoned into this space. Undead summoned or created in this space gain +2 hit points per HD.

The *desecrated shrine* must contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to the creator’s chosen higher power.

A *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]* spell negates the effect of the *desecrated shrine* for the duration of the *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]* spell. After that, the effects of the *desecrated shrine* return.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], fixture dedicated to chosen higher power, *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
