# Argent Savant (PrC)
## Overview
Of all the energies summoned or shaped by magic, force is

perhaps the most pure. No analog for this power exists in the

physical world; it comes into being only through the medium

of spells, and therefore represents a perfection of intent that

contradicts the imperfection of the everchanging world and

its mutable elements. Sometimes referred to as the “force

mage,” the argent savant regards spells that evoke or apply

magical force as the noblest and most fascinating spells at her

disposal, and she seeks to increase her understanding and

control of this mystical power at every opportunity.

Most argent savants are evokers or abjurers, or sorcerers

who choose a number of force spells as they advance in level.

Without some facility at the manipulation of magical force, a

spellcaster cannot embark on the secret studies of the argent

savant.

NPC argent savants sometimes join groups that aim to

take on a powerful wizard or sorcerer who has protected his

domicile with powerful wards of force. Argent savants of

suffi cient ability can dissolve the force effects of others.

Adaptation: One way to make the argent savant different

is to redirect her focus to the manipulation of energy other

than force: acid, cold, electricity, fi re, or sonic. For instance,

a fi ery argent savant would gain a +2 competence bonus on

attack rolls made with fi re spells and a +2 bonus to Armor

Class when casting any defensive spells due to a halo of

protective fl ame. Fire spells with a duration longer than

instantaneous would last longer, she could subtract her class

level from any fi re damage she takes, and she could dispel

other fi re spells.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become an argent savant, a character must fulfi ll

all the following criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Spellcraft 12 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast at least fi ve spells with the force descriptor,

at least one of which must be 5th level or higher.

Class Skills

The argent savant’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

(all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and

Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the argent savant

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Argent savants gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level after 1st,

an argent savant gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane

spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the

prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as

the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming

an argent savant, she must decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Force Specialization: An argent savant gains a +2 competence

bonus on attack rolls made with her force spells. She

also adds a +1 bonus to each die of damage dealt by spells she

casts with the force descriptor. If the force spell doesn’t deal

damage expressed by dice, she adds only a +1 bonus to the

total damage dealt.

For example, a *magic missile* cast by a 9th-level wizard/1stlevel

argent savant deals 1d4+2 points of damage per missile.

A 9th-level wizard/4th-level argent savant deals 4d6+7 points

of force damage with her *Mordenkainen’s*

*sword* spell.

Force Armor (Ex): At 2nd level and

higher, an argent savant gains more benefi

t from defensive force spells than other

characters. If she casts

a force spell that provides

an armor bonus

or a shield bonus to

Armor Class, she increases

the spell’s normal armor

bonus by 2. For example, *mage*

*armor* normally

adds

an armor

bonus of +4

to the caster’s AC,

but an argent savant with

this ability who casts *mage armor*

adds an armor bonus of +6

to her AC.

Enduring Force (Ex): Force

spells cast by an argent savant of

3rd level or higher linger longer than

normal, and they are more diffi cult

to counter or dispel. The duration of a

force spell cast by the savant is doubled,

as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied

to it. However, the spell’s level and casting

time are unchanged. The same restrictions that

apply to extended spells apply to spells affected by enduring

force. In addition, the DC required to counter or

dispel the argent savant’s force spells increases by 4.

Ablate Force (Ex): Due to her improved understanding

of magical force, an argent savant of 4th level or higher can

prevent force damage to herself. She subtracts her class level

from damage dealt by any force spell or effect. A force spell

producing multiple attacks, such as *magic missile,* is considered

a single attack for this purpose; deduct the savant’s level from

the total damage dealt by the spell, not the damage dealt by

each individual missile.

Unbind Force (Su): At 5th level, an argent savant learns

how to unweave a force spell or effect and liberate its magical

energy. As a standard action, she can attempt to dispel a

single force spell or effect within 60 feet (even those normally

immune to *dispel magic,* such as *wall of force*). If she succeeds

on a caster level check (DC 11 + opposing caster’s level), the

force effect is unbound. This immediately dispels the

effect and deals 1d6 points of force damage per level of

the dispelled spell to all creatures and objects within

10 feet of the unbound spell. For example, if an argent

savant unbound another

caster’s *wall of force,* the

liberated spell energy

would deal 5d6 points

of force damage to

anyone within 10 feet

of the wall’s former

location.
