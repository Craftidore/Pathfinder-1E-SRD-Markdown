# Recruitment and Training (variant)
## Overview
Nearly any vessel can eventually be put into motion by a single patient sailor who knows what he’s doing, but at the slightest trouble the ship could be imperiled. A skeleton crew of 5 or 10 men might be able to get a massive ship to its destination, but they won’t be able to keep it at sea for long. And certainly, in combat, they wouldn’t be able to maneuver well enough to avoid an attacker.

A well-trained crew is necessary for maintaining the operational capacity of a vessel, and for dealing with monsters, storms, and hostile ships. Without regular maintenance, ships fall into disrepair, become dangerous to those aboard, and might eventually become unsailable. Scrubbing the deck daily, for instance, helps prevent crew from getting splinters in their feet, and cleans up tar that might leak from between timbers. Sails untended become threadbare and capture less wind, and ropes rigged up too long can snap under stress.

Military vessels often carried marines in addition to the regular crew, filling their berths with as many soldiers as they could for the extra edge in battle. At the height of the Age of Sail, warships might have five hundred men aboard.

## Crew Complement
**Crew Complement**

Every ship has three crew entries. **Full Crew** is the number of crew needed for typical performance. Expertly trained crewmen can provide small benefits, or can fill in when the crew is slightly under full complement.

**Minimum Crew** is how many people are needed to operate the ship with any useful efficiency. A ship with fewer than full crew but at least minimum crew imposes a –5 penalty to its captain’s Command checks. If the ship has fewer than its minimum crew, it has a **skeleton crew**. This might be enough to get it moving at a crawl, but its captain takes a –10 penalty to Command checks.

**Total Complement** is the maximum number of crew who can comfortably live aboard the ship. The specifics of over-crowding are too varied for exact rules, but it slowly degrades morale and depletes supplies.

Most ships want enough crew to have one 8-hour shift of full crew to handle anything challenging, plus two shifts of minimum crew who make sure everything runs smoothly otherwise. A ship with fewer crew can get by, and then call all hands on deck in the case of emergency.

**Crack Crew**

Anyone can learn the basics of operating a ship with a few days training by someone who knows what they’re doing. However, some ships have a **crack crew**. To meet this requirement, the ship must have a full crew, and a quantity of them equal to the minimum crew rating must have the feat Expert Sailor.

A captain with a crack crew gets a +5 bonus to his Command checks, and the ship gains a +2 bonus to its Defense.

## Hiring and Acquiring
**Hiring and Acquiring**

On larger ships the captain is typically the final authority, but often he defers to the quartermaster on matters of acquiring crew and paying their wages. For ease of book-keeping, we give each crew member a cost in gold pieces, a sort of “commission fee.” This commission fee represents the resource outlay necessary to provide for the crewman and keep his services indefinitely, including food, water, and other daily necessities. Even if the crewman dies, the commission fee covers hiring an equally-skilled sailor to replace him at the next suitable port.

We assume most groups don’t care enough about tracking every silver piece, and are willing to handwave some commerce or other means of monetary acquisition happening off screen. You can assume that the party, in the course of their adventures, acquires enough money to pay for crew supplies without digging into the money they would spend on “special purchases” like magic items or new ships. When the party comes across treasure or is paid by an employer, just figure that the money they can add to their character sheets is how much is left after paying the ship’s upkeep.

Unless otherwise noted, crew are all level 1 humanoids with no useful combat skills.

**Standard Crew Commission**


| **Crew Member** | **Cost (gp)** |
|---|---|
| Slave | 15 |
| Sailor | 50 |
| Sage | 200 |
| Ship’s Mage | 500 |
| Soldier | 500 |
| Supernatural | 500 |
| Surgeon | 500 |
| *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)\|Unseen Servant]]* Crew | 50 |
| Expert Sailor | +50 |
| Commissioned Officer | 1,000 |
| Elite Officer | 1,500 |

**Slave**

A slave serves unwillingly, and is more likely to mutiny if he perceives the chance. Slaves are generally not paid; their commission represents the cost of feeding them and keeping them healthy enough to work.

**Sailor**

Sailors know how to handle a ship.

**Sage**

Sages provide useful knowledge, typically with a +10 bonus to two skills.

**Ship’s Mage**

A ship’s mage is a level 3 spellcaster, typically trained with a few spells useful for tending and defending a ship, including minor counterspells. They count as “sorcerous crew” (page 27).

**Soldier**

A soldier is a level 3 warrior. They count as “militant crew” or perhaps “scoundrel” or “resilient,” depending on their equipment and training (page 27).

**Supernatural**

Supernatural crew are somehow magical or monstrous, roughly equal in power to a level 3 NPC, and though not necessarily more deadly than a normal person, are rather hard to kill. They might be lycanthropes, skeletons, or automatons, and count as “resilient crew” (page 27).

**Surgeon**

A ship’s doctor is a level 3 character with some sort of healing abilities. During a given naval combat, up to five times when a crewman would die, instead the crewman is just knocked out commission, and will be back to fighting shape in a couple days. Surgeons seldom get into battle themselves.

**Unseen Servant Crew**

For the same price as a normal crewman you can get the ship enchanted to have a permanent *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* perform the tasks of one crewman. This is a mixed blessing. The servant cannot mutiny or be killed in combat and doesn’t need food, but it also can’t fight, be inspired by a bosun, spot stowaways, or leave the ship.

If more than a quarter of the ship’s crew are unseen servants, halve the benefit a bosun would grant (page 18). If more than three-quarters are unseen servants, the bosun has no effect. This is just a guideline, so if the ship’s gunnery crew are all servants, but the rigging crew are people, the bosun can help with piloting, but not shooting.

For the purpose of dispelling or similar effects, the unseen servants are treated as multiple individual magic items with caster level equal to half the ship’s level, rounded down. They can be suppressed, but usually not outright dispelled.

**Expert Sailor**

A crewman who has the Expert Sailor feat, be he sailor, slave, or sage, can demand more payment or resources for his services. Likewise, a variant *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* specially designed for sailing (in short, one that incorporates the benefits of the feat) costs more.

**Commissioned Officer**

Usually the PCs will serve as officers of the ship—captain, bosun, engineer, gunner, look-out, and navigator. Sometimes the party will want someone else to fill a specific role, and so they can hire an NPC: a commissioned officer.

For each commissioned officer, choose one of the six officer roles. The officer has a 16 in one ability score appropriate to that role, plus skill training in whatever skills are necessary to perform it. Each officer ought to have a distinct personality, and while you might not need exact stats, they will generally be level 3 characters.

**Elite Officer**

As above, plus the officer has the Elite Officer feat.

## Morale
**Morale**

It’s difficult to mechanically track all the possible factors that can affect crew morale. You can just estimate crew morale, or use the following guidelines.

**Morale Spectrum**


| **Rating** | **Demeanor** | **Effect** |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | Devoted | +2 bonus to Command checks and ship defenses, crew resilience |
| 80–99 | Helpful | +2 bonus to Command checks and ship defenses |
| 60–79 | Friendly | +2 bonus to Command checks |
| 40–59 | Indifferent | — |
| 20–39 | Unfriendly | –2 penalty to Command checks |
| 0–19 | Hostile | –5 penalty to Command checks, risk of mutiny |

If the ship has both commissioned and enslaved crew, track their morale ratings separately. If the crew have been well treated and haven’t suffered any casualties lately, commissioned crew’s morale defaults to 80. Enslaved crew’s morale defaults to 40. Then add the captain’s Command score.

A ship with both commissioned and enslaved crew uses the lower morale entry to determine modifiers to Command checks and ship’s defenses. If the commissioned crew has 100 morale, they have resilience (see below), even if the enslaved ones don’t. Likewise, enslaved crew might consider (not to mention plot and prepare for) mutiny while the commissioned crew is still loyal.

Effects can raise or lower morale for a few days or weeks, but generally between adventures Morale will return to its default of 80 (or 40) + the captain’s Command score.

**Minor Positive**

Each of these increase morale by 10; multiples of the same event don’t stack. A battle with no crew dying. The presence of one or more good omens. A feast or celebration. The captain or officers risking their lives to save a crewman. Completing a mission and arriving safely at a port. Having a talented bard on board.

**Special**

If the crew’s commission is paid again, this adds 25 to their morale, to a maximum of 80.

**Minor Negative**

Each of these reduce morale by 10. A battle resulting in more than 10% of the crew perishing. Having to flee battle. The ship being slightly off course. The presence of one or more bad omens. The captain or his officers abuse a crewman (this is highly subject to the crew’s interpretation). Having an untalented bard on board.

**Major Negative**

Each of these reduce morale by 25. Being forced to take limited rations. A battle resulting in more than 25% of the crew perishing. The ship being decidedly off course or actually lost.

**Severe Negative**

Each of these reduce morale by 50. Having no rations. The ship being stranded, crippled, or lost in dangerous waters. A battle resulting in more than half the crew perishing (if multiple battles have occurred, track how many have died in all the battles combined).

## Crew Resilience
**Crew Resilience**

If the crew’s morale is of 100, they’re bolder in battle. They start each combat with 5 temporary hit points. If you’re using the Crew as Terrain option, instead the first time an attack hits a crewman, reduce the damage dealt by the crewman’s level.

## Mutiny
**Mutiny**

If the crew’s morale is under 20, they’ll consider mutiny. Barring no further negative circumstances, the crew will keep serving for about a week, grumbling more and more. Each day thereafter, the captain must succeed a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] or [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check (DC 20) to maintain control over his crew. If another negative event occurs, the captain must make a check immediately to maintain control, and the DC increases by a cumulative +5.

Of course, the crew won’t mutiny if they’re certain they can’t win. Most ships with impressed crew make sure to keep at least as many commissioned crew, and to keep those crew happy, to deter mutiny by the wretches. A captain with supernatural powers need only show off his powers occasionally to make it clear to the crew that they’re better off suffering than dying. Some crew might still try to steal boats or jump ship at the first opportunity.

## NPC Officer Templates
**NPC Officer Templates**

When you set the party against a hostile ship, you can use the Simple Crew option, make the whole cast of NPC captain, officers, and crew, or you can choose one of these quick templates.

**Simple Crew**

Give the captain a Command score of 4 + ½ level of his ship. Don’t bother with tracking the actions of the ship’s other officers. The slightly higher-than-average Command score represents the bundled efforts of all the officers.

**Average Crew**

Command 2 + ½ level of ship. All officers have a 14 in the appropriate ability scores, and are trained enough in the appropriate skills to get a total of +7 to those rolls.

**Merchant Crew**

Command 1 + ½ level of ship. The Navigator and Look-Out have prime stats of 16 and +9 to key skills. The Bosun, Engineer, and Gunner have 12 and +5.

**Naval Crew**

Command 3 + ½ level of ship. All officers have prime stats of 16 and +9 to key skills. The ship has a crack crew, granting the captain an extra +5 bonus to Command checks and +2 to the ship’s Defense until the ship goes under its Full Crew rating.

**Pirate Crew**

Command 2 + ½ level of ship. Bosun, Gunner, and Look-out have prime stats of 16 and +9 to key skills. Engineer and Navigator have 12 and +5.

**Supernatural Crew**

Choose any of the above. Additionally, all the crew are some sort of supernatural entity, making it harder for your crew to harm them.

**Wretched Crew**

Command 0 + ½ level of ship. All officers have prime stats of 12 and +5 to key skills.
