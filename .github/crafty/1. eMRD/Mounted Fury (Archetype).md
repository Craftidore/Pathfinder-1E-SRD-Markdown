# Mounted Fury (Archetype)
## Overview
Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds’ speed and strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class features.

**Fast Rider (Ex)**: The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Bestial Mount (Ex)**: At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid’s animal companion, using the barbarian’s level –4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the mounted fury archetype: ferocious mount, ferocious trample, greater ferocious mount, greater ferocious trample, and spirit steed.
