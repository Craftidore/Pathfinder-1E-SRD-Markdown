# Thief-Acrobat (PrC)
## Overview
A thief-acrobat excels in getting in and getting out. If

every street-level entrance to the Jewelers’ Guildhouse

is locked and well guarded, a thief-acrobat simply jumps

atop the building from the roof of a nearby inn, throws

a grappling hook to the highest minaret, runs up the

attached rope to a shuttered window, and quickly picks

the lock. Should a thief-acrobat’s escape go awry once

she has the goods, her gymnastic combat style keeps her

out of harm’s way.

Most thief-acrobats are rogues who worked their way

up through the ranks of the local thieves guild before

learning the second-story trade from more experienced

burglars. Characters of other classes—particularly barbarians

and illusionists—often fi nd that the acrobatics

and climbing skills of the thief-acrobat prestige class

complement their abilities nicely.

Adventuring parties often encounter an NPC thiefacrobat

in the middle of committing a crime. Sometimes,

however, thief-acrobats hire adventurers to help them

with particularly dangerous capers, or even to create

diversions while they work.

Adaptation: Guilds of thieves large and small could

have an elite cadre of cat burglars and second-story

people. Changing the class’s name slightly can have a

great impact on how the prestige class is perceived in

your game. Despite its name, members of the thief-acrobat

class might have nothing to do with thievery. Labeling

the class “adventuring acrobat” or something similar

gives the class a reason to exist that has little to do with

high-level burglaries.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the thief-acrobat

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Thief-acrobats are

profi cient with all simple weapons.

Fast Acrobatics (Ex): A thief-acrobat can avoid

the normal penalties for accelerated movement while

using her acrobatic talents. She ignores the normal –5

penalty when making a Balance check while moving at

her full normal speed. She can climb at half her speed

as a move action without taking a –5 penalty on her

Climb check. Finally, she can tumble at her full speed

without taking the normal –10 penalty on her Tumble

check.

Kip Up (Ex): A thief-acrobat can stand up from a

prone position as a free action that doesn’t provoke

attacks of opportunity. This ability works only if the

thief-acrobat wears light or no armor and carries no

more than a light load.

Steady Stance (Ex): A thief-acrobat remains stable on

her feet when others have diffi culty standing. She is not

considered fl at-footed while balancing or climbing, and

she adds her class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb

checks to remain balancing or climbing when she takes

damage.

Agile Fighting (Ex): A whirling, spinning thief-acrobat

is a devilishly diffi cult target. Starting at 2nd level,

a thief-acrobat gains a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

When fi ghting defensively or using total defense, this

bonus becomes +2. At 4th level, these bonuses increase

by 1 (to +2 and +3, respectively).

In addition, a thief-acrobat takes no penalty to her

Armor Class or on her melee attack rolls when kneeling,

sitting, or prone.

This ability works only if a thief-acrobat wears light or

no armor and carries no more than a light load.

Slow Fall (Ex): Beginning

at 2nd level, a

thief-acrobat reduces

the effective distance

of falls by 20 feet. At

4th level, this improves

to reduce the effective distance of falls by

30 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.* If a thief-acrobat has this ability from another

class, the distances stack to determine the effective reduction

of the falling distance.

Acrobatic Charge (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a thiefacrobat

can charge in situations where others cannot.

She can charge over diffi cult terrain that normally slows

movement or through allies blocking her path. This

ability enables her to charge across a cluttered battlefi eld,

leap down from a ledge, or swing across a chasm to get

to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may

still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump,

Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over

the terrain.

Defensive Roll (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, once per

day a thief-acrobat can roll with a potentially lethal blow

to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See

the rogue class feature, page 51 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

At 5th level, a thief-acrobat can use this ability twice

per day.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, a thief-acrobat has

become so confi dent in the use of certain skills that she

can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

When making a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check,

she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would

normally prevent her from doing so.

Improved Evasion (Ex): A 5th-level thief-acrobat

can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful

Refl ex

save and

takes only

half damage

on a failed save. See the

monk class feature, page

42 of the *Player’s Handbook.*

*Languages:* Common, Halfl ing; Gnome.

Acrobatic Charge (Ex): Diana can charge over diffi cult

terrain that normally slows movement or through allies

blocking her path.

Agile Fighting (Ex): Diana gains a +2 dodge bonus

to AC. When fi ghting defensively or using total defense,

this bonus becomes +3. In addition, she takes no penalty

to her AC or on her melee attack rolls when kneeling,

sitting, or prone.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Diana deals an extra 3d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against fl at-footed or

fl anked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Diana

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Defensive Roll (Ex): Diana can attempt to roll with

the damage when on the receiving end of an attack from a

weapon that would reduce her to 0 or fewer hit points. On

a successful Refl ex save (DC equal to damage from that

attack), she takes only half damage. Diana can only react

to attacks she is aware of; if she is denied her Dexterity

bonus to AC for any reason, she cannot use this ability.

Evasion does not apply to defensive rolls.

Evasion (Ex): If Diana is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Refl ex saving throw

for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Fast Acrobatics (Ex): Diana ignores the normal –5

penalty when making a Balance check while moving at

her full normal speed. She can climb at half her speed

as a move action without taking a –5 penalty on her

Climb check. Finally, she can tumble at her full speed

without taking the normal –10 penalty on her Tumble

check.

Kip Up (Ex): Diana can stand up from a prone position

as a free action that doesn’t provoke attacks of

opportunity.

Skill Mastery (Ex): Diana has mastered the skills

Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that she

can take 10 with them even under stress. These skills are

designated by SM in the statistics block.

Slow Fall (Ex): A thief-acrobat within arm’s reach of

a wall can use it to slow her descent while falling. Diana

takes damage as if the fall were 30 feet shorter than it

actually is.

Steady Stance (Ex): Diana is not considered fl at-footed

while balancing or climbing, and she adds +4 to Balance

or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when

she takes damage.

Trapfi nding (Ex): Diana can fi nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to fi nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Diana retains her Dexterity

bonus to AC even when fl at-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

*Possessions: +1 studded leather, +1 spear,* light crossbow with

20 bolts, *boots of striding and springing, rope of climbing.*
