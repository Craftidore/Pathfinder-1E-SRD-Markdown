# xxblankbook Copy
## Overview
*This slim book is carefully but amateurishly bound, with leather stretched tight across thin boards. The writing inside is fussy and crammed together, with words that are occasionally illegible. Eight of its pages contain spells; the final 10 pages are blank. A portrait of a plain woman, unsmiling, has been bound into the inside front cover.*

**Opposition Schools** Illusion, transmutation

**Value** 155 gp
