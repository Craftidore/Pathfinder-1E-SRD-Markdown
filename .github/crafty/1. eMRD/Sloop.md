## Description
This modest vessel has two masts, often rigged fore-and-aft.

**Propulsion** wind (two masts, 30 squares of sails, hp 150)

**Driving Check** Profession (sailor) +10 to the DC

**Forward Facing** the ship's forward

**Driving Device** whipstaff

**Driving Space** the four squares around the whipstaff

**Crew** 20 (not including weapons crews)

**Decks** 2

Weapons Up to 20 Large direct-fire siege engines in banks of 10 positioned on the port and starboard sides of the vessel, or up to 5 Huge direct-fire siege engines in banks of 3 positioned on the port and starboard sides of the ship. The siege engines may only fire out the sides of the ship on which they are positioned. They cannot be swiveled to fire out the forward or aft sides of the ship.

1.Sterncastle

The ship's wheel is located on this raised platform at the aft of the vessel; it is generally from here that the captain issues orders while sailing.

2. Main Deck

The main deck is a broad, open space, although usually it is filled at least in part with ropes, the ship's anchor, a lifeboat and that sort of thing. In between the two masts is the hatch providing access to the cargo hold below.

3. Private Cabin

For important passengers or, at least, those who can pay for it, this cabin boasts a bed and perhaps a table or a storage trunk. It can also be used for a first mate, if appropriate.

4. Private Cabin

This cabin is laid out in the same manner as the other one, above.

5. Captain's Cabin

By far the most elaborate quarters on the vessel is this small room. It has a table with four chairs for holding meetings, along with a bed, a wardrobe, a chest and a barrel of liquor.

6. Crew Quarters

Ten hammocks are arrayed in this area, in two tiers. The crew members sleep here, usually in shifts. In addition there can usually be found a number of sea chests, one per crewman, arranged beneath the hammocks.

7. Cargo Hold

This space could contain just about anything, provided it can fit in through the cargo hatch.

8. Crow's Nest (Not pictured)

A small platform high on the ship's foremast provides a place for the lookout to stand.

## Construction Notes
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** —; **Price** 7,200 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

A *folding ship* looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. 

A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 75 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep. The *folding ship* cannot unfold if there isn’t enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the sloop or caravel.

In its smaller form, the skyship appears as a sloop. In its larger form, the skyship takes the form of a caravel.

A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.
