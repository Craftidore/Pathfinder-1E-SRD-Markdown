# Hurricane's Eye (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hurricane’s Eye:** This large (5-foot-wide) crystal orb maintains hurricane-force winds (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) around the outside your stronghold at all times. Properly placed within a stronghold, the eye of the hurricane (the safe, calm part) can encompass up to twelve stronghold spaces clustered around the orb. If your stronghold is larger than this, you can purchase multiple orbs and link them together by overlapping the eyes. Any section surrounded by eyes on all sides automatically becomes a part of the eye, turning the whole region into one massive, continuous eye, leaving the raging winds entirely outside the affected regions.

Any single hurricane’s eye can be calibrated to create an eye in a smaller number of spaces too. The only caveat is that these spaces must all be clustered tightly together.

The winds circle the eye in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion, as you prefer. However, if there are more orbs than one, they must all force the wind to circle in the same direction. If you join this item with a tornado’s eye or a windstorm’s eye, they can each only function at the level of the weakest item.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Control Winds (Spell)|control winds]]**; Market Price:* 75,000 gp.
