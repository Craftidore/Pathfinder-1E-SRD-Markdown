# Unholy Hall (WondArch)
## Overview
**Unholy Hall:** An aura of malevolent darkness surrounds all evil characters in this stronghold space. This grants them a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. They also get spell resistance 25 against good spells and those cast by good creatures. They are also protected from possession and mental influence as per *[[Protection From Good (Spell)|protection from good]]*.

If a good creature hits a protected character in melee, the attacker suffers 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage. A Fortitude save (DC 22) negates this.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Unholy Aura (Spell)|unholy aura]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
