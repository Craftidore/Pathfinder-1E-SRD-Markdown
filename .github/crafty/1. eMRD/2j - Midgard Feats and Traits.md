# 2j - Midgard Feats and Traits
## Overview
**Midgard Feats and Traits**

The heroes and adventurers of Midgard are defined by their homelands, as heroes are everywhere. The seven regions of Midgard are represented here; additional feats can be found in the various regional Player’s Guides.

You are or were someone who hauls barges and all kind of ships upstream the rivers.

## Northlands
**Northlands**

In the Northlands, ties to certain halls and blood links to the gods themselves are not uncommon. Claims of great parentage are little more than boasting, but occasionally the claims are entirely true. Northlands Traits

You grew up in the great smithy-citadel of Stannasgard, surrounded by the greatest artisans of the North.
