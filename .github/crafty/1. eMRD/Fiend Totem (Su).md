# Fiend Totem (Su)
## Overview
*Fiend Totem (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian sprouts dozens of wicked barbs from her body. Anyone striking the barbarian with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A barbarian must have the [[Fiend Totem, Lesser (Su)|lesser fiend totem]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.
