# Courtyard, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 6,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This courtyard features some grass, but the paths are paved with cobblestones or bricks. Wrought-iron benches are placed strategically throughout the place, and a simple fountain sits in the center of the area, surrounded by paving stones as well. A bust or two stand on pedestals in strategic locations.

Purchase this component multiple times if you want a larger courtyard.
