# Mystic Navigator (PrC)
## Overview
*“I make no claims to understand why the world works the way it*

*does—that’s why I’m sure to keep one o’ them ’gators on hand to*

*keep my ship aright.”*

—Shifty MacGee, Pirate and Explorer

Any veteran of the seas can tell you that beyond the sea lanes, the

waters and the heavens behave strangely, and distance and time

are unreliable at best. Some occultists and planar theorists believe

that the strangeness of the deep ocean voyages is the result of the

formation of the known world. According to legend, the World

of Freeport is a patchwork realm of numerous worlds stolen from

other realities and bound together by the will of the ancient and

mysterious god, Yig. While traveling from one reality to the next

requires only a stiff wind and a good sail, it’s easy to become

lost, especially when the stars change and the compass starts to

spin. Whether these theories are correct or not, malfunctioning

instruments and strange heavenly phenomena have proved the end

of many a vessel. To minimize the dangers of extended voyages,

many crews hire on a mystic navigator who has the talents and

expertise to chart a course through the strangest seas.

Becoming a

Mystic Navigator

Most mystic navigators begin their careers as wizards, since that

class provides the earliest entry into this prestige class. Of the

wizards bound for this class, nearly all are diviners, blending their

uncanny powers of perception with the navigators’ talents for peering

through the bounds of reality to bend and reshape the world to serve

their purposes. Bards may also advance in this class, though they

must wait until 7th level before they can qualify for it due to the

spell requirement. Other classes, including multiclass ranger/arcane

spellcasters may enter this class, though they are rare exceptions.

Requirements

• **Alignment:** Neutral

• **Skills:** Knowledge (geography) 5 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks,

Profession (sailor) 2 ranks

an arcane spell.

**Class Skills:** Acrobatics, Climb, Craft, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Knowledge

Class Features

By entering this class, the character gives up a small portion of her arcane

spellcasting abilities in exchange for a suite of powerful tools to help her

allies and ship navigate the perils of the seas. The mystic navigator’s class

features mostly attend to charting courses and altering reality in minor

ways to modify the character’s ship’s pace and to perceive distant threats.

But as she advance in level, the mystic navigator gains the ability to shape

the seafloor, converse with creatures of the depths, and even pierce the

walls of reality to speed up your voyages. At the highest level, she can

even lead her ship beyond her reality to explore the planes.

Spellcasting

At each level indicated, the mystic navigator gains new spells per day

and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if

she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which

she belonged prior to adding the prestige class level. The mystic

navigator does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained. If she had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a mystic navigator, she must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Mystic Navigator (Su)

The mystic navigator is attuned to the mystical pathways through

the scales of Yig and can use her preternatural knowledge to navigate

through uncharted waters. she may add her mystic navigator class

level as an insight bonus on all Knowledge (geography) checks.

Far Sight (Su)

Starting at second level, The mystic navigator’s uncanny senses extends

to her vision, allowing her to see four times farther than an ordinary

human can see. If she has low-light vision, she sees eight times as far

as a human sees in areas of low lighting. Finally, if the mystic navigator

has darkvision, she can see four times as far as normal.

Master of the Winds (Su)

Beginning at 3rd level, the mystic navigator’s connection to the

mystical fabric of reality gives her the ability to shape the winds.

She may perform a special ceremony that requires an hour of intense

concentration and mental focus. At the end of this time, she must

make a DC15 concentration check. If she succeeds, the sails of the

mystic navigator’s vessel fill with a light wind that blows for 1 day.

She can increase the wind’s strength by setting the DC higher. A

moderate wind increases the DC by +5, a strong wind by +10, a severe

wind by +15, a windstorm by +20, and finally a hurricane by +30. See

**Table: Wind Effects** in the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook* for details on

winds. The winds created surround the ship out to a radius of one

mile and follow the ship as it moves.

The mystic navigator takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each time

she uses this ability.

Speak with Sea Creatures (Sp)

At 4th level, the mystic navigator gains the ability to converse with

the creatures of the sea. This ability works just like *speak with animals*

except it only applies to creatures with the aquatic subtype or that

have a swim speed. The mystic navigator’s caster level equals her class

level. She may use this ability once per day.

Master of the Reef (Su)

By 5th level, the mystic navigator’s mastery over navigation and

seamanship improves such that she can reshape the sea floor by

her force of will alone. Using this ability requires an hour-long

ceremony involving intense concentration and mental focus. At the

end of this period, the mystic navigator must make a concentration

check. The check DC depends on the undersea materials: sand

DC15, soft stone DC 20, coral DC 25, hard stone DC 30. If the

check succeeds, she may raise, lower or completely reshape 100

square feet of material per class level. The mystic navigator can

“move” materials by stretching them, but she cannot extend them

more than 10 feet per two class levels from their starting position.

It takes one full minute for the sea floor to respond to the mystic

navigator’s commands, but the effects are permanent.

She takes 1d4 points of Strength damage each time she uses this

ability.

Commune with the Seas (Sp)

Starting at 6th level, the mystic navigat0r may cast out her senses

to accurately perceive the waters around her. This ability functions

similarly to the *commune with nature* spell, except it only applies when

the mystic navigator is on the deck of a ship and at sea. The mystic

navigator’s caster level equals her character level. She may use this

ability once per day.

Master of Tides (Su)

At 7th level, the mystic navigator may seize control over the tides

themselves. Using this ability requires an hour-long ceremony

involving intense concentration and mental focus. At the end of this

period, she must make a DC 15 concentration check to increase her

own ship’s speed by 20% or DC 20 to reduce another ship she can

see by 20%. The effects of this ability last for 1 day and stack. When

used in conjunction with the master of the winds ability, master of

tides applies after the mystic navigator modifies the ship’s base wind

speed.

She take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage each time she use this

ability.

Master of Islands (Su)

Starting at 8th level, the mystic navigator can cause an island to rise

from the watery depths. Using this ability requires a day-long ceremony

wherein the mystic navigator sketches the island on parchment using

her own blood. At the end of this time, she must succeed on a DC 20

concentration check, modified by the island’s features.

**Island Features Modifier**

Less than 1 square mile –2

Between 1 and 5 square miles 0

Between 6 and 10 square miles +2

Has a source of fresh water +2

Has edible plants and animals +2

Has a sheltered bay +2

If the check succeeds, the island appears, shrouded by a thick fog.

Living sentient creatures never inhabit the new island, though

some islands (20% chance) may harbor a number of spirits (GM’s

discretion). Once created, the island is permanent. The mystic

navigator cannot create land within a half mile of other islands or

the mainland.

She takes 1d6 points of Constitution drain each time she uses this

ability.

Master of the Seas (Su)

Beginning at 9th level, the mystic navigator can cover incredible

distances by performing a special ceremony. She may use this ability

just once per week and the ceremony requires an hour of intense

meditation. At the end of the process, the mystic navigator must

succeed on a DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check modified by the

distance she would travel.

**Base Distance Modifier**

1–100 leagues –4

101–200 leagues –2

201–500 leagues 0

501–1,000 leagues +2

1,001–3,000 leagues +4

3,001 or more leagues +8

Should the check succeed, the leagues melt away and the mystic

navigator’s ship covers the desired distance by the end of a single day’s

travel. If, however, she rolls a natural 1 on the check or if she fails the

check by 10 or more, the mystic navigator’s vessel falls through a hole

in reality, appearing in a random location on the Material Plane or

on a random plane (50% chance of either).

Navigate the Planes (Su)

Finally, at 10th level, the mystic navigator gains the ability to open a

hole in reality and send her ship through to other planes. She may use

this ability just once per month and the ceremony requires an hour

of intense meditation. At the end of the process, she must succeed

on a DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check modified by the plane to

which she would travel.

**Base Distance Modifier**

Any location in your Material Plane +0

Ethereal Plane +2

Plane of Shadow +4

Astral Plane +6

Inner Plane +8

Outer Plane +10

Alternate Material Plane +15

Beyond the Outer Planes +20

Essentially, this ability functions as the planar travel feature of the *gate*

spell and is subject to the same limitations (divine intervention for

instance) as described under the spell description. The *gate* remains

open long enough for the mystic navigator’s vessel to move through

it and arrive at her desired destination.

Using Mystic Navigators

Despite their rarity in the World of Freeport, mystic navigators are

an integral addition to any ship’s crew that intends to explore the

uncharted waters far from the sea lanes. Most mystic navigators operate out of a mysterious guild called the Brothers of the Sea

Change, who command citadels in nearly every major port on

the Continent. Interestingly, the mystic navigators have made no

effort to found a citadel in Freeport. People whisper that their

unwillingness may stem from resistance by the Wizards’ Guild, or

perhaps from Freeport’s proximity to sunken Valossa. In any event,

when a mystic navigator hires out to a crew, she commands a steep

price of 200 gp/mystic navigator level for each month of travel.
