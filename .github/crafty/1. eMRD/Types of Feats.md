# Types of Feats
## Overview
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are [[Item Creation Feats|item creation feats]], which allow characters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were of a higher spell level than it actually is.

**[[Combat Feats]]**

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter’s bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet the prerequisites.

**[[Critical Feats]]**

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim of the critical hit. Characters without the [[Critical Mastery (Feat)|Critical Mastery]] feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after the critical hit has been confirmed.

**[[Exalted Feats]]**

A character must have the DM’s permission to take an exalted feat. In many cases, a ritual must be performed; often this simply amounts to a character swearing a sacred vow, for example, in the presence of a celestial being. A character who willingly and willfully commits an evil act loses all benefits from all his exalted feats. She regains these benefits if she atones for her violations (see Sin and Atonement in Chapter 1 of the Book of Exalted Deeds ). 

**Aura of Good:** A character with at least one exalted feat radiates an aura of good with a power equal to her character level (see the *[[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]]* spell), as if she were a paladin or a cleric of a good deity.

**[[Heritage Feats]]**

A heritage feat represents a specific ancestry of the character. The player and the DM are encouraged to devise a background story explaining the character's heritage, though the exact source of the ancestral link isn't crucial to the feat's operation (and might remain a mystery to the character).

(**Source:** Complete Mage, pg. 36)

**[[Item Creation Feats]]**

An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of item each  involves, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.

**[[Metamagic Feats]]**

As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm.

Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.

**[[Panache Feats]]**

Panache feats interact with the swashbuckler’s panache class ability or the panache granted by the [[Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)|Amateur Swashbuckler]] feat. Swashbucklers can take panache feats as bonus feats.

**[[Reserve Feats]]**

These feats are usable only by spellcasters, and they employ an unusual form of prerequisite. Reserve feats draw upon the magic inherent in a caster's body and soul, utilizing (but not consuming) energy from available spells to augment the character's already prodigious magical talents.

(**Source:** Complete Mage, pg. 36-37)

**[[Ship Feats]]**

A feat is a special feature that gives your vessel a new capability or improves one that it already has. A Legendary Vessel gets to choose 1 feat at level 1, one at level 4, one at level 7 and one more at level 10.

Some feats have prerequisites. Your ship must have the indicated statistical score, feat or other quality listed in order to select or use that feat.

Note that although these are called Ship Feats, some of them apply more to the crew than the ship--however since these feats are part of the Legendary Ship, they exist independently of the crew itself, as long as they meet the quality requirement for a Legendary ship. For example, any crew of at least Average quality serving aboard a ship with the Expert Gunner feat would have that feat available, even if they were all newly-hired.

**Story Feats**

A story feat reflects a goal—often an all-consuming one—that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benef it, a goal, and a further benef it for achieving that goal. 

(**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 66)

**[[Style Feats]]**

For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.

(**Sources:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 136; Ultimate Combat, pgs. 78-79)

**[[Tactical Feats]]**

Feats with the tactical descriptor allow characters to perform a number of powerful maneuvers.

(**Source:** Complete Mage, pg. 37)

**[[Teamwork Feats]]**

Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Stunned|stunned]], [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don’t have those feats.
