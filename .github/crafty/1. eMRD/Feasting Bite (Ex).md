# Feasting Bite (Ex)
## Overview
*Feasting Bite (Ex):* When the barbarian confirms a critical hit with her bite attack, she regains a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The barbarian must have the [[Bloody Bite (Ex)|bloody bite]] rage power and either the [[Animal Fury (Ex)|animal fury]] rage power or a natural bite attack before selecting this power. Activating this ability consumes 1 round of rage.
