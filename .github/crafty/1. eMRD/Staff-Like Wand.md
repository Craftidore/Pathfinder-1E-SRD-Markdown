# Staff-Like Wand
## Overview
**Staff-Like Wand**

Your research has unlocked a new power in conjunction with using a wand. Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if itâ€™s higher than the caster level of the wand. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard and must have the [[Craft Staff (Feat)|Craft Staff]] feat to select this discovery.
