## Overview
**Vidim**

The tsar of Vidim and the huginn (tengu)—the elite birdfolk who are Vidim’s best soldiers, traders, and spies—maintain a strange alliance in Vidim, a small but influential state that controls access to the Nieder Strait from the steppe. Vidim serves as a bulwark against the dwarven reavers and giant raiders from the Riphean Mountains, and it gathers much of the wealth of the Rothenian hinterland for shipment west along the Nieder Strait.

Vidim’s people are poor but proud, and they trade generously with the dwarves when they can. The tsar of Vidim is famous for his piety and love of novelty, and just as notorious for his fits of cruelty. The land’s farmers are serfs, not slaves, but they are unable to leave the farms and manors of the boyars, the nobles who rule in the tsar’s name.

## The Tsar of Vidim
**The Tsar of Vidim**

The people want to believe the tsar is good. But Tsar Alexov’s huge black beard hides a weak, feckless creature of frequent enthusiasms and everchanging whims, particularly religious zealotry, but also interest in boats, art, magic, and courtly dances, as the mood strikes him. His advisers rule him, though imperfectly, and his daughters keep him from disaster together with the huginn spymistress Viryesha and the high priest of Perun. Together, they make up the inner circle of Vidim’s government. Without them, business, trade, and politics would fall apart.

The tsar is quick to see conspiracy around him and to launch new projects for the glory of Vidim, but he is slow to forgive and he is constantly abandoning his quests. Indeed, some adventurers have returned from embassies to the Demon Mountain or voyages into the Nieder Strait only to find their venture largely ignored by the tsar.

## The Huginn and the Boyars
**The Huginn and the Boyars**

The tsar depends on two groups to maintain his rule in Vidim: the boyars and the huginn. The boyars are his nobles and vassals, the knights and judges of the realm who hold land and serfs from the tsar. They are famous for their furry hats, enormous beards, and brightly colored, embroidered robes—indeed, a certain level of noble plumage is expected. The boyars fight the gnomes, the reaver dwarves, roving bands of centaurs, giants raiding from the North, and all other threats to the realm.

The huginn are another matter. They are the raven-headed people who inhabit a rookery in Vidim, not far from the tsar’s Scarlet Palace. They are worshipers of Wotan and his messengers, closely associated with the priesthood of the Rune God, and cunning thieves and scoundrels. Their chieftain is Ukwak, a gray-feathered warrior who rides with the Vidim boyars. Their most notorious spy, Viryeshka Krasny, has taken a human name and she sometimes disguises herself as a human, so good is her mimicry.

Most boyars and huginn do not trust each other, and the Perch of the Huginn within the city of Vidim is sometimes the site of duels, murders, and outright assassinations. The tsar seems unable to control both sides strongly enough to bring an end to the heated rivalry.

## The Monks of Aten
**The Monks of Aten**

The monks of Aten are a historical accident, the result of a priest of Aten from the desert wandering north into Vidim. This priest, Kaphiri, preached the glories of the Sun God to the people of the plains and was roundly dismissed—after all, they already had Khors, who needed another sun god? When he reached the ear of the tsar, Kaphiri proposed something slightly different: an order of knights sworn to the god Aten, a knightly order for the realm. The tsar liked the idea, but thought the idea of a duplicate sun god foolish. Still, an order of religious knights was most appealing.

This is how a small order of knights was first founded, second and third sons of the boyars sworn to Perun and his daughter, making war in the tsar’s name. To some wags and historians, they are still called “the Monks of Aten,” and a small branch of the order exists to teach of Khors and the secret arts of fist and fury.

## Vidim, City of Crows
**Vidim, City of Crows**

Vidim is a small city built in the eastern style, with earthen ramparts and a moat rather than a stone city wall. Sections of its wooden wall and hoardings are being replaced by stone as the tsar finds time and money.

Within its walls, Vidim is a tightly packed collection of slate-roofed and thatched houses, filled with artisans from leatherworkers to dyers, spinners, and weavers. It is most famous for the Perch of the Huginn, a somewhat strange set of rafters, poles, roosts, and tilted towers built for the huginn who settled near the temple of Wotan.

Vidim is also famous for its Scarlet Palace of the Tsar, a fine building of carved wood and excellent gilded eaves, which shares space on the main square with two other sights of note: the Giant’s Skull cauldron and the Reaver’s Hall. The Hall was once used by dwarves but they have since abandoned it to the boyars and merchants of the town. The Giant’s Skull is the skull of an enormous Thursir giant chieftain slain by the current tsar’s father. Visitors love it and consider it lucky; the tsar secretly wishes he could do half as well himself.

## Lesser Cities of Vidim
**Lesser Cities of Vidim**

**Bjornshafen:** A small town with a large fishing fleet, Bjornshafen trades its salted catch and leather hides with the Northlands and Krakova. The town offers a tiny gift of salt and herring to every visitor during its Harvest festival.

**Hugigrad:** This town is dominated by a temple to Wotan and a large rookery of huginn, called the Rookery of Hugigrad. Humans are welcome during the day, but they find the noise at roosting time intolerable. Hugigrad is a simple farming town, with large herds of cattle and goats.

**Stalimisto:** This village was once little more than a wandering set of wagons, but its nomadic days ended at the mouth of the River Nupr. Since then Stalimisto has grown into a small city with a wooden wall and a constant centaur problem, because its pear orchards provide pear brandy each fall. It pays a tribute to the nearest centaur tribes to protect those orchards from others.

## Adventures in Vidim
**Adventures in Vidim**

The most frequent adventures are conspiracies and secret missions for the tsar, though fights to defend against black sorcery are also common.

- A huginn warns that someone plots to poison one of Vidim’s wells, killing hundreds. A water spirit? An elemental wizard? Who dares strike at the innocent? The tsar demands answers.
- One of the brothers of Aten is a supernaturally strong and powerful follower of the Black God Chernovog. Find him and kill him, without upsetting the peoples’ view of the faithful Brotherhood.
- A dwarven merchant brings new wares to town, and two of the boyar insist on buying his finest sword. The rivalry turns to violence, with PCs caught in the middle.
- One of Baba Yaga’s daughters has come to court and enthralled the tsar and his advisers. She wishes to see all the huginn cast out of Vidim. Can she be stopped without drawing down Grandmother’s wrath?
