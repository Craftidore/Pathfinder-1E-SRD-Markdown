# Entropomancer (PrC)
## Overview
As spellcasters plumb the depths of divine power, some

of the most advanced gain attunement to the great nothingness

they say lies at the center of the universe. These

students use this connection to develop strange powers,

sacrifi cing some of their normal studies. Doing so retards

their progress as spellcasters, but they see their new abilities

as worth the cost.

Entropomancers can summon and control a small shard

of absolute nothingness similar to a sphere of annihilation,

harnessing its power for a variety of magical effects. Most revel in destruction for its own sake, but some take a more

nuanced approach to their terrifying discoveries, trying to

understand the power of entropy that it might someday be

controlled or even reversed.

Entropomancers generally work in small groups or cabals.

Most have patron deities of death, destruction, or fate. NPC

entropomancers often form cults that kidnap victims to be

sacrifi ced to the Great Nothingness.

Adaptation: Gods of entropy and insensate destruction

(such as Tharizdun, described in Chapter 5) are good

choices if you want to tie the entropomancer to worship of a

specifi c deity. A well-organized group devoted to entropy is

pretty weird, but at least it’s possible in the short term.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the entropomancer

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency:

Entropomancers gain no profi -

ciency with weapons, armor, or

shields of any type.

Shard of Entropy (Su): Twice

per day, for a maximum of 1

round per entropomancer level,

the character can create a

miniature shard of entropy.

The shard is a chunk of absolute

blackness, 2 inches

across, and can be moved up to 30

feet by the entropomancer as a

standard action. Against objects,

the shard deals 3d6

points of damage, bypassing

the object’s hardness.

Against creatures, the entro

po mancer must make a ranged

touch attack to hit, and if successful the

shard deals 3d6 points of damage to the target

(Fortitude half, DC 12 + the entropomancer’s

Wis modifi er). The shard appears in any square adjacent

to the entropomancer when it is created, and it can be

used to attack on the round it is formed.

The shard of entropy lurches, jumps, and bounces around

the square it’s in. Any creature who passes through the

shard’s square takes damage as if the shard struck him (Fortitude

half), as does any creature that’s in the same square as the shard at the beginning of the entropomancer’s turn.

The entropomancer can move the shard into another square

with a move action, or aim it at a specifi c creature (dealing

damage immediately) as a standard action.

At 5th level, the entropomancer can use the shard to

create a deeper connection to absolute nothingness. The

shard of entropy deals 5d6 points of damage (Fortitude half,

DC 14 + entropomancer’s Wis modifi er).

At 9th level, the shard of entropy becomes even stronger,

dealing 7d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 16 +

entropomancer’s Wis modifi er). It also exerts an inexorable

tug on creatures nearby, pulling them toward the shard.

At the end of the entropomancer’s turn, the shard tries to

pull creatures within 15 feet closer to it. This is treated as

a bull rush attempt, for which the shard has a +11 bonus. If

the shard wins the opposed check, it bull rushes creatures

in a direct line toward its square. The entropomancer isn’t

immune to this effect.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Whenever an evennumbered

level in the prestige class is gained, the entropomancer

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class in which he could cast 4th-level divine

spells before she added the prestige class level. She does

not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class

would have gained. If a character had more than one divine

spellcasting class in which she could cast 4th-level spells

before she became an entropomancer, she must decide to

which class she adds each level of entropomancer for the

purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Entropic Field (Su): As a standard action, an entropomancer

can surround herself with a fi eld of invisible, entropic

energy that lasts for 1 round per entropomancer level.

The fi eld extends in a 5-foot per entropomancer level radius,

centered on the entropomancer. All magical healing automatically

fails within the entropic fi eld. It takes the entropomancer

a standard action to dismiss the entropic fi eld.

At 5th level, the entropic fi eld becomes strong enough

to warp the laws of probability. Once per round, as a free

action, the entropomancer can force a character within the

fi eld (including herself) to reroll an attack, save, or check.

The entropomancer demands the reroll after she knows

whether the attack, save, or check succeeded or failed, but

before the exact consequences have been calculated and

applied. The result of the reroll takes precedence, even if it’s

worse than the original roll.

At 7th level, the entropic fi eld causes wounds created

within it to continue bleeding, dealing an additional 1

point of damage per round thereafter (at the end of the

entropomancer’s turn) as long as they remain within the

entropic fi eld. A successful Heal check (DC 15) stops the

bleeding. If multiple wounds are suffered, then the creature

takes 1 point of damage per wound. The entropomancer is

subject to the bleeding effect.

Control Sphere (Su): The entropomancer has the ability

to control a *sphere of annihilation* (described on page

279 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide)* as if he were using a

*talisman of the sphere,* and the entropomancer is personally

unaffected by a *sphere of annihilation*, which passes through

him as if his square was completely empty. High-level

entropomancers are often obsessed with acquiring *spheres*

*of annihilation.*

can surround herself with 15-foot radius fi eld of invisible,

entropic energy that lasts for 3 rounds. All magical healing

automatically fails within the entropic fi eld. It takes a standard

action to dismiss the entropic fi eld. See prestige class

power entry for more details.

Shard of Entropy (Su): Twice per day, for a maximum

of 3 rounds, Xannifer can create a 2-inch diameter shard

of entropy which she can move up to 30 feet as a standard

action. The shard deals 3d6 points of damage to objects,

bypassing the object’s hardness. Xannifer must make a

ranged touch attack to hit a creature, and if successful the

shard deals 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 16).

The shard appears in any square adjacent to Xannifer when

it is created, and it can be used to attack on the round it is

formed. See prestige class power entry for more details.
