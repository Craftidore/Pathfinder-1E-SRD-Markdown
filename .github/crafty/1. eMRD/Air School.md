# Air School
## Overview
**Air School**

The air elementalist uses the forces of the wind, sky, clouds, and lightning to confuse and destroy his foes, all while flying through the air with ease.

*Air Supremacy (Su):* You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Fly skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast *feather fall* on yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast *levitate* on yourself at will. At 10th level, you can cast *fly* on yourself at will. At 20th level, whenever you make a Fly skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Lightning Flash (Su):* As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Cyclone (Su):* At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a Fly skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a Fly check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 Perception skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
