# Armory (Room)
## Overview
**Armory**

**Benefit** provides for 1 [[Bunks (Room)|Bunks]] or [[Guard Post (Room)|Guard Post]], hastens donning armor 

**Create** 9 Goods, 3 Influence, 6 Labor (390 gp); **Time** 16 days 

**Size** 5–15 squares 

An Armory stores a variety of armor and weapons, providing enough equipment to supply one [[Bunks (Room)|Bunks]] or [[Guard Post (Room)|Guard Post]] with common equipment (the guards or soldiers leave their armor and weapons here, and you don’t have to pay for individual equipment for them as long as this room is not [[Broken|broken]]). The room is typically supplied with medium armor and appropriate martial weapons for the guards or soldiers in the building. The Armory contains an array of helpful tools to allow you to don armor in the time it normally takes to don hastily.
