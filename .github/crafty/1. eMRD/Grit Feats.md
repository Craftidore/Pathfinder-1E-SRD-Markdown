# Grit Feats
## Overview
Grit feats interact with the gunslingerâ€™s grit class ability or the grit granted by the Amateur Gunslinger feat, usually by adding to her set of deeds. Sometimes these feats increase the number of grit points a character has or how that character regains grit points. Gunslingers can take grit feats as bonus feats.
