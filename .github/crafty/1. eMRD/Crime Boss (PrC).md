# Crime Boss (PrC)
## Overview
*“I tried to warn you, lad. You just don’t go messin’ with Mister*

*Wednesday. Now see what your revenge bought you. A pair of stone*

*shoes and a trip to the bottom of the sea. Sorry lad, nothing personal.”*

—Masked Enforcer

The crime boss is a criminal mastermind that heads an extensive

organization in a community. Crime bosses are unheard of outside of

small or larger cities since there’s rarely enough wealth to keep their

interest. Instead, crime bosses carve out an underworld empire in the

largest and wealthiest communities, siphoning off the wealth to feed their

illegal enterprise. A great many crime bosses specialize in a particular

brand of crime, such as prostitution, protection rackets, smuggling,

and more, while the most powerful members of this esteemed group

command almost complete control of all crime in their city.

Becoming a Crime Boss

While just about any character who takes the Leadership feat can

enter this prestige class, assassins, fighters, bards, and rogues are the

most likely candidates. Members of each of these classes regularly

treat with guilds and criminal organizations giving them the contacts

and experience needed to forge their own criminal operation.

Interestingly, nobles make for excellent crime bosses since they are

often rooted into their cities and have access to the proper suite of

skills and gain the Leadership feat at 1st level, making them the

strongest candidates for this class.

Class Features

The most important weapon in the crime boss’s arsenal is his

organization. As the character advances in this class, he expands his

criminal empire like a cancer through his city. Since the crime boss is

restricted by his rivals and cannot advance further in this class unless

he rubs out the competition, the crime boss must invest a great deal

of resources into his minions to ensure he survives when his rivals

seek to do the same to him. Crime bosses also improve, albeit at a

slower rate, with the rogue’s sneak attack progression ensuring that

the crime boss remains an effective adversary even though much of

his abilities are tied up in his enterprise.

Small Organization (Ex)

The crime boss is in charge of a small criminal enterprise made up

of his cohort and followers. At 1st level, the organization is quite

small, consisting of only those people in his employ and the crime boss’s influence does not extend further than a single district in his

city of choice. He may select any district so long as it isn’t under the

control of another district. If his chosen city’s districts (quarters or

neighborhoods) are all under the control of other crime lords, he

may not progress further into this prestige class until there is a free

district for him to take over.

Reputation (Ex)

The crime boss develops a reputation for being ruthless in his business

dealings, lending him a great deal of street credibility. At 1st level, he

begins with a reputation modifier of 0. Every five levels he attains in

this class increase his reputation by +1 (so +1 at 5th and +2 at 10th).

The crime boss may apply his reputation modifier on Intimidate and

Diplomacy checks to gather information made in his city. If he has

reputation from another class, his levels in that class stack with those

of crime boss for the purposes of determining his bonus.

Notorious (Ex)

It doesn’t take long for a crime boss to make a name for himself in

his chosen city, and as a result people learn to fear these notorious

criminals. More importantly, his notoriety attracts competent

criminals to join his organization. As indicated on **Table 6–1:**

**The Crime Boss**, he gains a competence bonus to his Leadership

score. In addition, he may apply this bonus as a competence bonus

on all Intimidate checks. This bonus stacks with the bonus gained

from reputation. Finally, the crime boss never takes a penalty to his

Leadership score for aloofness or cruelty.

Sneak Attack (Ex)

Starting at 2nd level, the crime boss deals an extra 1d6 points of

damage whenever he successfully attacks a target he flanks or a

target that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This ability functions

exactly like the rogue ability of the same name (see the *Pathfinder*

*Core Rulebook* for details). At 5th level, this extra damage increases

to +2d6, and it increases again to +3d6 at 8th level.

Interests

Crime bosses are businessmen, entrepreneurs that specialize in

illegal operations. Up until 3rd level, most of his business interests

deal with petty crimes like protection rackets, burglary, and

elementary thievery. However when he attains 3rd level, the crime

boss extends his dealings to earn a more substantive income. Select

a major criminal enterprise from the following: drugs, smuggling,

blackmail, espionage, or prostitution. More may be available at the

GM’s discretion. At the end of every month, make a level check

and multiple the results by 10 to determine how many gold pieces

the crime boss earns from his operation. At 6th level, he may select

a second operation while improving his first operation. The crime

boss multiplies his level check by 50. At 9th level, he may select a

third operation and also improve his other interests. Multiply the

crime boss’s level check by 100.

Medium Organization

When the crime boss attains 4th level, his organization expands into

a second available district in his selected city. If there are no available

districts, he cannot progress further in this prestige class until one

becomes available (usually accomplished by murdering a rival crime

boss and taking over his operation).

Advisor

At 6th level, the crime boss gains the service of a special advisor, an

individual whom he recruits to assist in running his organization.

The advisor is a second cohort, and functions exactly as a normal

cohort. Alternatively, the crime boss may release his current cohort

to add up to two levels to his advisor, up to, but not exceeding, his

character level.

Large Organization

By 7th level, the crime boss’s organization is quite large, extending

over up to four districts in his city. Again, if there are no available

districts in the city of his choice, the crime boss cannot progress

further in this prestige class until once becomes available.

Pressure

So influential is the crime boss in his city that his criminal dealings

have given him political influence in the community such that he

wields as much power as any other politician. The crime boss may

add the bonus gained from notorious as a competence bonus on all

Bluff and Diplomacy checks made within his city.

Above the Law

Starting at 9th level, the crime boss gains immunity to his city’s legal

system. His connections and influence are such that the crime boss

never again needs to fear from the city’s authorities. He can no longer

be arrested in his home city and he may act with impunity, even

murdering someone in cold blood in front of the Sea Lord without

fear of legal consequence. While this class feature does protect the

crime boss from the law, various individuals may seek to remove him

by other means such as assassination.

Huge Organization

Finally, at 10th level, the crime boss extends his influence beyond his

chosen city’s walls, expanding his power to the city closest to his home

city. At this level, the crime boss controls one district, assuming there’s one available, and for every three character levels beyond this one, he

may plant his flag in another city. This allows the crime boss to employ

his class features in any city into which his organization extends.

Using the Crime Boss

The crime boss provides a great way for players to invest their

characters into the setting, but at the expense of freedom and

maneuverability. It offers incredible political and economic power

to one PC, but restricts his ability to undertake adventures outside

of the city. To compensate for the lack of flexibility, the crime boss

PC should consider using his cohort for adventures, thus insulating

the crime boss from unnecessary danger, while allowing the player to

participate in adventures. Even though the crime boss isn’t present

on these expeditions, the character should gain experience points by

dint of the presence of his cohort.

Adapting the Crime Boss

Given the crime boss’s class features, a campaign set in Freeport

immediately puts the crime boss PC at odds with Mister Wednesday

and Finn since these two control large chunks of the city. You might

consider relaxing the advancement restrictions by allowing the PC

crime boss to overlap his influence into areas controlled by the more

powerful crime bosses. This said, any expansion into the Syndicate or

Canting Crew’s turfs could be perceived as an act of war.
