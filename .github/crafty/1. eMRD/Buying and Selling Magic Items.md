# Buying and Selling Magic Items
## Overview
A player points to an item published in this book or the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* and asks, “Can I buy this?” The answer should usually be, “Yes.”

Magic items are an important part of every character’s arsenal of abilities. Most monsters and encounters assume that characters have a certain amount of gear to make the challenge appropriate. Furthermore, at many levels magic items represent a character’s only option for customization; picking up a new magic ring or bag of potions is signifi cantly more fun than allotting skill points.

That’s not to say that you can’t apply occasional constraints to how and when magic items can be purchased, only that the constraints should be reasonable and shouldn’t prevent players from equipping their characters fairly. For instance, a character seeking a magic item should be in a community whose gold piece limit is equal to or greater than the cost of the desired item (see Table 6–10: Community GP Limits). You might also choose to limit particular items for campaign story reasons—maybe the knowledge of how to create certain items is a closely guarded secret of a particular group, or even forgotten to all.

In general, though, you should allow characters with sufficient funds to equip themselves as they desire. Even the most thoughtfully constructed series of treasure hoards almost certainly fails to provide all your players the items they want to maximize their enjoyment as they advance in level.

**WHERE TO BUY**

Large one-stop-shop “magic emporiums” are unrealistic and rare even in metropolis-sized cities. Instead, a community’s total stock of magic items for sale is widely distributed among dusty alchemist’s shops, bookstores, scribers’ boutiques, pawn shops, elixir brewers, the residences of retired adventurers, the old mage on the corner, curio shops, and so on.

Except when you want to advance an adventure or campaign story arc, abstract the purchase of a particular magic item such that, given a few hours of effort asking around and tracking down the sought-for item, a PC finds and purchases the item she seeks if its market price is equal to or less than the town’s gp limit (given in the “PC Purchase Limit” column of Table 6–10: Community GP Limits).

If time is an issue in the purchase of an item (for example, a pair of *[[Goggles of Night|goggles of night]]* check is successful, the PC finds the item within the time constraint. On a failed check, a PC can check again if time permits.

**WHERE TO SELL**

As noted on page 112 of the *Player’s Handbook*, PCs can sell their loot for half its listed price. Just as described above under Where to Buy, PCs automatically find a buyer willing to take their item (for half its market price) within an hour or two of asking around (or less, if they know the local curio shop takes all such oddities). Remember that partially depleted wands or similarly charged items are worth only a percentage of this value (equal to the percent of charges remaining; for example, a wand with 10 charges remaining is worth only 20% of the normal value).

Generally, an item can’t be sold if half its listed price exceeds the community’s total amount of ready cash (noted in the “PC Sale Limit” column of Table 6–10: Community GP Limits), but you can allow the PCs a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (v3.5 Gather Information) check as described above to find a buyer with funds sufficient to take it off the PCs’ hands for one-fourth its market price (or the PC sale limit, whichever is lower).

The rules for buying and especially, selling magic items are modified by such feats as [[Mercantile Background (Feat)|Mercantile Background]] and [[Merchant's Tongue (Feat)|Merchant's Tongue]].

**CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS**

To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of experience points) in an item’s creation. This section reiterates the basics of magic item creation; for more details on creating the different types of magic items, see the information on item creation feats in Chapter 5 of the *Player’s Handbook*, as well as the appropriate sections in Chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*.

All items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of feats and spells that the item’s creator must know, although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed. It’s perfectly acceptable for two or more characters to work together to create a magic item, with each character supplying some of the prerequisites. (In all places where this text refers to the “creator” of a magic item, it includes all characters supplying at least one prerequisite for the item’s creation.) The XP cost must always be paid by the character who supplies the item creation feat required by the item, no matter how many other characters cooperate in its creation.

The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells (see Preparing Wizard Spells) is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day per 1,000 gp in the item’s base price (rounding up), with a minimum of at least one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the beginning of the construction process.

The creator works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day. But the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit. A character who takes a break from item creation to adventure should keep track of how many days of work remain on the item currently being crafted.

A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on the under-construction item are wasted.

Magic supplies for items always cost half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price equals the base price. For example, a *[[Cloak of Elvenkind|cloak of elvenkind]]* has a market price (and base price) of 2,500 gp. Making one costs 1,250 gp in raw materials plus 100 XP. Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not infl uence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost), but it does increase the final market price.

**IMPROVING MAGIC ITEMS**

You can add new magical abilities to a magic item with virtually no restrictions. The cost and prerequisites to do this are the same as if the item was not magical. Thus, a *+1 longsword* can be made into a *+2* *[[Vorpal (MagWpnSpcAb)|vorpal]]* *longsword*, with the cost to create it being equal to that of a *+2* *[[Vorpal (MagWpnSpcAb)|vorpal]]* *longsword* minus the cost of a *+1 longsword* (98,315 – 2,315 = 96,000 gp). The character improving the magic item must meet the same prerequisites as if he were creating the item from scratch.

It’s recommended that you add new magical abilities only to items that occupy the same body slot as the added effect would normally occupy. For example, it’s okay to add the power of *[[Boots of Striding and Springing|boots of striding and springing]]* to *[[Slippers of Spider Climbing|slippers of spider climbing]]*, since both of those items occupy the same body slot. However, adding the power of *[[Boots of Striding and Springing|boots of striding and springing]]* to a *cloak of resistance* doesn’t make much sense. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it’s a reasonable guide that helps maintain some level of fl avor and verisimilitude in the magic item system.

In most cases, if the item is one that occupies a body slot, the cost of adding any additional ability to that item is 1-1/2 times the value of the added power (or the value of the added power plus 1/2 the value of the existing item, if the added power normally costs more than the existing item). For example, if a character adds the power to confer *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* to her *[[Jumping|ring of jumping]]*, the cost of adding this ability is 3,300 gp, the same as for creating a *[[Feather Falling|ring of feather falling]]* × 1-1/2. On the other hand, if she were adding the power of a *[[Force Shield|ring of force shield]]* to that *[[Jumping|ring of jumping]]*, the cost of adding the ability would be 9,750 gp (8,500 gp for the *[[Force Shield|ring of force shield]]* plus half of 2,500 gp, the price of a *[[Jumping|ring of jumping]]*).

This added cost doesn’t necessarily apply when adding some common effects to existing items; see below.

**Adding Common Item Effects to Existing Items**

One of the most frustrating roadblocks to using interesting, unusual magic items is that they take up body slots that you need for an ability-boosting item (such as *gauntlets of ogre power*), a *ring of protection,* or another must-have item. To address this issue, *Magic Item Compendium* presents official rules for adding common item effects to existing magic items.

Table 6–11: Adding/Improving Common Item Effects presents a list of common item effects, from ability score enhancement bonuses to energy resistance, and the price to add that effect to an item.

The table also indicates the appropriate body slot (or slots) for each effect. For example, you can add an enhancement bonus to Charisma only to an item that occupies the head or shoulders body slot (such as a headband or cloak). A DM can choose to deviate from this guideline, but should avoid nonsensical combinations (such as gloves that provide a bonus to Wisdom).

Adding one of these effects to an existing item works much like creating an item from scratch. The crafting character must meet the given prerequisites, must expend gold equal to one-half the price and XP equal to 1/25 the price, and must spend 1 day per 1,000 gp of the price.

Example: Lidda has a pair of *[[Boots of Striding and Springing|boots of striding and springing]]*, and she wants to add a Dexterity bonus (rather than buying *gloves of Dexterity*). Her friend Mialee isn’t around, so Lidda must track down a stranger to do the work. She pays the wizard 4,000 gp, and four days later her boots now also grant her a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. When Lidda later decides to improve the bonus to +4, she manages to talk Mialee (who has the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feat and knows the *[[Cat's Grace (Spell)|cat’s grace]]* spell) into performing the work. After spending eight 8-hour days of work and expending 6,000 gp of components (likely supplied by Lidda) and 480 XP, Mialee succeeds in increasing the +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity to +4.
