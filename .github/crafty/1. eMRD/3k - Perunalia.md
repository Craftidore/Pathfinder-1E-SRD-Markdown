# 3k - Perunalia
## Overview
This nation of beautiful women sits at the mouth of the Argent River. The Duchy of Perun’s Daughter, as outsiders call it, lies several days downriver from the Free City and is a land of some interest to the people of Zobeck for two reasons: The nation controls the River Argent’s connection to land and trade venues on the shores of the Ruby Sea, and its matriarchy and matrilineal country is ruled by the demigod Vasilka Soulay, the daughter of Perun, god of war and thunder and the greatest god of the East.

However, Perun’s child is nothing like her father and takes after her human mother, a woman named Mother Illyena. Vasilka is a woman of wisdom and learning, and a goddess of courage, teaching, and stern mercy. She did inherit an understanding of battle tactics from her father’s bloodline, and this gift has saved the duchy on numerous occasions.

The duchy is small but well ruled: rich in the trade of fish and oysters from the river mouth, in timber, in the crafts fine jewel work, and divine magic. None of these trades will ever raise the land to glory, but they keep its people happy, healthy, and give them time for reflection, trade, and the pursuit of art.

Perunalia is, aside from the Magocracy of Allain, the land most given to education, literacy, and the keeping of lore from ancient times. The duchy’s learning is not focused on the arcane but on mathematics, botany, agronomy, and architecture. The library in the capitol city is a wing of the royal palace; it is open to the public one day each week. The Perunalians accept noble daughters from the Crossroads region into their academies, including those from Magdar and Morgau, but they never take male students. Zobeck’s Consul Azeleanara Perunisis, a retired Perunalian emigrant, sponsors several annual scholarships for worthy girls to attend Sephaya’s schools.

Oddly, worship and theology are relatively neglected. Her Divine Transcendence, the Duchess Vasilka, grants boons and answers prayers to a small priesthood, though most of her people also follow the Green Gods and worship Lada, as well as several of the other greater gods. Vasilka’s power provides a bulwark against the centaurs and bandits of the Ruby Despotate, against the dragonborn legions of the Mharoti Empire, and against the cunning cavalry of the Magdar Kingdom.

With raiding centaurs, dragon legions, and the Ruby Despotate all willing to carry away the “shameless women” of Perun, the people of the duchy feel somewhat besieged because of their female ruler. In times of trouble, though, they have a friend in the Free City of Zobeck; their mutual alliance dates back 80 years and remains firm. Perun’s Daughter is entirely capable of defending her people, though the duchy contracts out centaur cavalry to aid in keeping the Mharoti at bay—and regularly allies with the Magdar against the Dragon Empire, their common foe. The Perunalian warrior tradition is primarily a female one: visitors remark on how strange it is to see only female city guards at the gates and are impressed when they see the duchess’ horse guards riding by—every one of them a woman of skill and daring. The typical Perunalian response is a somewhat wry, “We have no idea why you trust men with swords and fire, given how they act with it.” The most powerful of her defenders are the amazons of Perunalia.

Women who flee the Despotate or the Magdar Kingdom to the duchy’s borders are welcomed and put to work as soldiers, weavers, and farmers. The Perunalian generals and marshals of the Order of the White Lions—a society of female paladins—are canny enough to raise levies from both men and women alike in times of war. The men, it is said, are inspired to greater courage by the bravery of the amazons who lead them.

The duchy is not entirely gloriously enlightened, selfless, and wise; the merchants of Zobeck consider Perunalians an especially sharp set of traders who sometimes take goods by force to feed their troops or negotiate contracts at sword point. The duchy is a realm like no other, and its people would have it no other way.

Within Perunalia, men are treated as the weaker sex, more for their assumed mental abilities rather than their physical ones. The female rulers deem males too driven by emotions like envy, rage, and sexual desire to take up the serious duties of defense, war, government, and business. Men’s roles are therefore reserved for manual labor, in which their physical strength gives them an advantage. Hard work tempers them, gentling their emotions and making them more pliable for mating. Men may not own property or receive formal education. They do apprentice in certain allowable trades, performing jobs like blacksmithing, farming, shipbuilding, lumberjacking, animal husbandry, and the like. Their wives take care of the money gained from such endeavors, and they provide any needed protection.

## Duchess Vasilka Soulay
**Duchess Vasilka Soulay**

Her Divine Transcendence spends much of her time in contemplation and study. She is a fair ruler and patroness of learning and the arts. She has a strong interest in artistic items from the Seven Cities, and collects pottery, sculptures, and paintings from all over Midgard. She believes that all students should be exposed to such works. She holds bards in high esteem, and seeks to entice female bards to visit Sephaya.

Vasilka has yet to marry and provide heirs, since she is too enraptured with her daily studies. She is said to have several eunuch lovers, but she has not found a male interesting enough to warrant her long-term protection and provision, let alone her attention. This does not stop her baronesses and priestesses from urging her to marry and produce an heir.

## Cities of Perunalia
**Cities of Perunalia**

### Sephaya
**Sephaya:** An ancient city of the elves, Sephaya was briefly an elven capital, abandoned in the Great Retreat. Currently the capital city, it is often besieged by the Mharoti. Sephaya is known for beautiful architecture and its elaborate gardens, diligently cared for by 100 gardeners. It is said the Duchess sometimes converses with Lada, Sif, Yarila and Porevit within the gardens.

The Duchess’ palace hosts the Perunalian Palatial Library. Several grandiose academies encircle the palace’s outer gates, forming the educational hub of the capital. Sephaya boasts one of the largest literacy rates in Midgard at 25% of its female population. All girls are welcome to attend the schools, but not all families view book learning as important to their daughters’ futures. Many prefer that they learn the art of war instead, and archery is taught to young women from the age of 14 and sometimes younger.

### Orkasa
**Orkasa:** A human city from the start, and a trade center up to Zobeck and down to Harkesh and the Middle Sea. Orkasa is famous for its bargemen, many of whom are from Kariv families who compete with the local Perunalians for shipping work. The rivalries sometimes turn to bloodshed. For this reason, there is some friction between the Kariv and Perunalians in this part of the duchy.

### Clarsaya
**Clarsaya:** A small town at the confluence of the Argent and the Palesh Rivers, Clarsaya serves as the bulwark against the Magdar Kingdom. Once a small elven settlement, it hosts a huge tower that provides excellent visibility over the horizon. The current Mistress of the Tower is Aglaii Soulay (LG female human white lion paladin 14), a cousin of the Duchess. Aglaii is a high-ranking paladin in the Order of the White Lions, and commander of the northern vanguard garrisoned here. She is well known for her amiable relationships with the centaurs of the region, and her celestial pseudodragon familiar. The White Citadel, the training grounds for the white lion paladins, lies outside the city. High Commander Shihara Poulimas (LG female human white lion paladin 20) rules the citadel.

## Archery in Perunalia
**Archery in Perunalia**

The archery skills of Perun’s Daughters are famed throughout Midgard and are said to rival—if not exceed—those of the Arbonesse elves. The temples recount that Perun himself taught the amazons their skill with bow and arrow, though his ever-cunning daughters have since enhanced their god-taught skills with secrets culled from races like the Rothenian centaurs, the windrunner elves, and any others they deem worthy enough to teach them.

Perunalian women eat, sleep, and breathe archery; to be a woman devoid of such skill in the duchy is to be an outcast. Mothers gift their daughters with small bows and arrows in rites of passage ceremonies when their girls turn 14, and send them to train at the best archery schools throughout the land. Additional rites of passage follow as the girls age and prove certain skills with the bow at the monthly tournaments. Colorful feathers, which outsiders deem as mere decoration, mark an amazon’s archery rank among her peers. An amazon bearing the red feather has mastered her weapon.

The small tournaments offer a proving ground for advancing archers to gain their feathers, but the Duchess’ Fair, the Duchy’s famous summer fair and tournament, offers opportunities for invited archers to vie for the Duchess’ favor in the form of land grants and titles. The annual winner is called the Grand Maiden, and she is showered with gifts from admirers wherever she goes. Grand Maiden Countess Marquerra Zorin has held the title for well over a decade now.
