# Paragnostic Initiate (PrC)
## Overview
*“Magic is only one kind of knowledge.”*

—Auleric the Swift, paragnostic initiate

Not all who follow the precepts of the Paragnostic Assembly

(see page 72) are spellcasters. Melee fi ghters, archers, and

practitioners of mundane skills can also join the eternal hunt

for knowledge. Paragnostic initiates, as the most devoted of

these seekers are known, are no less dedicated to the hunt

for secrets than are the apostles. Initiates, however, tend to

focus less on magic and more on other aspects of the world.

By combining their knowledge with their other abilities, they

learn new ways to apply their skills and can even augment

the benefi cial magics that others cast upon them.

BECOMING A PARAGNOSTIC INITIATE

Rogues, scoutsCAd, and swashbucklersCW are the most common

candidates for the paragnostic initiate prestige class because

of their mobility and access to skills. Fighters and rangers

are far from uncommon, however.

CLASS FEATURES

The abilities you gain from this prestige class are designed

to enhance the spellcasting of others as well as expand your

own combat options.

Assist Casting (Ex): You can assist an ally with spellcasting

if you have a number of ranks in the appropriate Knowledge

skill equal to the level of the spell being cast (minimum 1). The

table below defi nes the required skills for each type of ally.

**Ally Assisted Knowledge Skill**

Arcane caster Knowledge (arcana)

Cleric or paladin Knowledge (religion)

Druid or ranger Knowledge (nature)

The type of assistance you can render varies with your level.

*Penetration:* Once per round as an immediate action, you

can grant an adjacent allied spellcaster a +1 bonus on caster

level checks made to overcome spell resistance.

*Target:* At 2nd level, you automatically aid any allied spellcasters

in targeting a foe with which you are engaged in melee.

Your ally does not take the standard –4 penalty for targeting

that foe with a ranged attack spell, though the penalty remains

in effect normally if other allies are engaged with that foe. In

addition, you do not provide a cover bonus for that foe against

any allied spellcasters. Furthermore, any foe you threaten

takes a –1 penalty on Refl ex saving throws against spells cast

by your allies (but not by you).

*Distraction:* At 3rd level, you gain the ability to protect an

allied spellcaster with whom you are fl anking an opponent.

As long as you maintain the fl anking arrangement, your ally

can cast spells without drawing attacks of opportunity from

the fl anked creature. Other activities that draw attacks of

opportunity do so as normal.

Tactical Combat (Ex): At each level you attain in this

class, you gain an ability to enhance your fi ghting prowess

or to infl uence magical effects cast upon you, based on your

Knowledge skills. Each time you gain this feature,

choose one of the following abilities for which you

meet the skill-based prerequisites. Although

you can choose some of these abilities multiple

times (as indicated in the descriptions),

you may not select the same one twice in

a row, and the minimum required skill

rank increases by 2 for each subsequent

selection of the same ability.

*Avoid Energy:* Choose an energy

type from among acid, cold, electricity,

and fi re. You gain a +2 bonus on all

saving throws made against spells that

deal damage of that energy type. You

can select this ability multiple times,

choosing a different energy type

each time. (Knowledge \[the planes]

4 ranks)

*Break Point:* Each of your melee

attacks deals an extra 2 points of

damage against inanimate objects

and constructs. (Knowledge \[architecture

and engineering] 4 ranks)

*Deadly Strike:* You gain a +2 bonus

on attack rolls made to confi rm

critical hits. (Knowledge \[nature]

4 ranks)

*Discern Weakness:* Choose one

creature type from the ranger’s favored

enemy list (*PH* 47). Provided

that you have at least 5 ranks in the

appropriate Knowledge skill (Knowledge

\[arcana] for dragons, Knowledge

\[nature] for humanoids, and so forth), you

gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against

creatures of that type. You can select this

ability multiple times, choosing a different creature type

each time. (Knowledge \[varies] 5 ranks)

*Mystical Augmentation:* Choose one clerical domain. The

effective caster level of any spell in that domain cast upon

you by someone else increases by 1, if you so choose at the

time of casting. (Knowledge \[religion] 4 ranks)

*Physical Augmentation:* Choose one of your physical ability

scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution). When any spell

that applies a bonus or penalty to this score is cast upon you

by someone else, any bonus granted increases by 2, and any

penalty imposed is reduced by 2 (minimum penalty 1). You

can select this ability multiple times, choosing a different

ability score each time. (Knowledge \[nature] 6 ranks)

*Resist Ethos:* You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against

negative energy-based spells, and against spells with an alignment

subtype opposed to one or both aspects of your own

alignment (law/chaos or good/evil). (Knowledge \[religion or

the planes] 5)

*Spell Disruptor:* Any spellcaster fl anked by you and an ally

cannot cast defensively to avoid attacks of opportunity and

is aware of this limitation. (Knowledge \[arcana] 6)

PLAYING A PARAGNOSTIC INITIATE

You are no less a seeker of knowledge than the paragnostic

apostles are; you simply do not focus on magic

as the central facet of that knowledge. Even

when you adventure for other purposes, you

are constantly alert for new knowledge, be

it ways to augment your own abilities or

simply information that you can bring

back to the Paragnostic Assembly.

You lack the authority of the paragnostic

apostles because you are considered

less of a spiritual leader. However, you

are still a central member of the Paragnostic

Assembly, respected by all who

would delve into the secret past.

Combat

Whether you’re a front-line fi ghter or

a mobile fl anker, you fi nd yourself engaged

in melee far more often than

your apostle counterparts do. Work

out tactical maneuvers in advance

with the others in your party, so that

you can make the best possible use of

your abilities aid allies. If you have a

handful of strategies and procedures

preplanned, you can implement them

far more swiftly and effectively than

you could on the fl y.

Advancement

Though you lacked the skills required

to become a paragnostic apostle, you

were no less anxious to advance your

learning and meld your abilities with

the knowledge you had gained from membership

in the Paragnostic Assembly. Petitioning

to learn the secrets of the paragnostic initiate

was the only logical choice, and the organization

was happy to instruct you.

Now you spend much of your time traveling and adventuring

in search of lost lore. Because you need not research

the arcane to advance your spellcasting ability, you spend less time in the organization’s chapterhouses than many

of the apostles do. Thus, while the apostles are often seen

as the primary fi gures of the Paragnostic Assembly, it falls

on you and your fellows to do at least as much work on the

group’s behalf.

As you advance, focus heavily on your Knowledge skills,

as well as the other class skills that you do not have access

to from other classes. You have only three chances to benefi t

from this skill list, so don’t waste them. You might want to

consider increasing your Intelligence, if the opportunity

arises, for the same reason.

Resources

Like the paragnostic apostle, you have the full library and

resources of the Paragnostic Assembly’s chapterhouses available

to you. While you’re less likely to need access to arcane

spells, you can still benefi t from the organization’s research

libraries, as well as the occasional loan of magic items to help

acquire specifi c lore.

on Reflex saves against spells cast by Auleric’s allies.

**Deadly Strike (Ex)** Auleric has a +2 bonus on attack rolls to

confirm critical hits.

**Mystical Augmentation (Ex)** Spells of the Healing domain

affect Auleric at +1 caster level.
