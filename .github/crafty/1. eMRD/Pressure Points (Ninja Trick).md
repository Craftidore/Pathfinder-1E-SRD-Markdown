# Pressure Points (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
*Pressure Points\* (Su):* A ninja with this trick can strike at an opponent’s vital pressure points, causing weakness and intense pain. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she also deals 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the ninja. Unlike normal [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|ability damage]], this damage can be healed by a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check. Each successful check heals 1 point of damage caused by this trick. A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check.

**Source:** Ultimate Combat, pg. 15

Tricks marked with an asterisk (\*) add effects to a ninja’s sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.
