# Fog Veil, Stinking
## Overview
**Fog Veil, Stinking:** This augmentation works like *[[Fog Veil|fog veil]]*, except that any living creature in the *stinking fog veil* must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) every round or be overcome by nausea, unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, and so on. A [[Nauseated|nauseated]] creature may only make a single move each turn. This effect lasts 1d4+1 rounds after the subject leaves the affected area.

*Caster Level:* 5th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Stinking Cloud (Spell)|stinking cloud]]; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
