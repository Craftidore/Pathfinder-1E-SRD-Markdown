# Force Weaver (PrC)
## Overview
The war-tom battlefield of Kranza ·dun is a

sight not for the faint of heart. The orcs had laid

siege to the last keep of the free kingdoms for

weeks, showing no signs of tiring. As the tide

of battle turned to the favor of the free kingdoms.

orcish war-wizards began an onslaught

of force-based magics. As their arcane energies

ravaged the battlefield. the orcs could only look

on in horror as a small group of wizards passed

unhanned through their barrage. Manifesting

force-based weapons and unleashing powerful

force magics, the group passed through the

siege of orcs without hesitation. For the orcs,

the end had come much sooner than expected.

The force weaver is something of an enigma in

the societies of magic, as she appears to be as

much war-wizard as she is masterful sage.

Wizards and sorcerers take to the studies of the

force weaver, either to serve as elite members

of royal annies, champion the weak, or to act as

private bodyguards for nobles and wealthy

merchants. The mastery of force-based magic

and the freedom of choice with her abi lities

makes each force weaver distinct.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS fEAtURES

All the following are class features of the force

weaver prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: The force

weaver gains no proficiency in any weapon or

armor.

Spells per Day: Whenever a new force weaver

level is gained, the character gains new spells

per day as if she had also gained a level in her

prev1ous arcane spellcasting class. However,

she docs not gain any other benefits that a character

would ha\e gained at that level. If the

character possessed more than one spellcasting

class before she became a force weaver. she

must spcc1fy which class to advance her ne''

spell-. \'.ith each new le\el as a force weaver.

Weapon of For ce: Starting at I st le\ el. the

force weaver learns to channel her spellpower

to create a weapon made of pure force energy.

This ,.,·capon can take the fonn of any melee

weapon with which the force weaver is proficient.

The weapon of force is considered to be

a + I magic weapon with the *ghost touch* special

ability. The weapon lasts for a number of

rounds equal to the class level of the character

and can be summoned three times per day. It is

instantly dispelled if it leaves the character's

hands for any reason.

At 7th level. the character's force weapon now

has an enhancement bonus of-3 and the force

wea,er may choose an additional ability for the

weapon that does not exceed a +2 bonus (see

DMG 185, Melee Weapon Special Abilities).

Force Spell PO\\er : Beginning at 2nd level.

the force weaver's power with force-based

magic grants her a + I bonus to all save DCs of

her force-based spells. In addition, she gains+ I

point of damage per die to any f?rce-based

spells that she casts. These bonuses mcrcase at

4th. 6th. and 8th levels.

Armor of Force: Beginning at 3rd level. the

force \\Ca\cr learns to create an armor of force

once per day that functions exactly like the

*mage armor* spell '' ith the following differences:

• Thi-. armor grants a +5 bonus to AC instead

of the nom1al '1"4 bonus.

• The armor funcuons only for the force

weaver and may not be cast upon another

creature.

• It is a free action to activate the armor.

Force E n e rg\~· Substitution: Starting at 5th

level, the force weaver is able to replace any

spell's elemental descriptor (acid. cold. electricity,

fire. or sonic) with force ene\~·gy. For

example, she may cast spells such as *.force ball* and *forc:e arroll'* instead of *.fireball* and *flame strike.*

Force Thrust: At 9th level, the force weaver

leams to create a thrust of pure force energy

once per day. The thn1st is a cone that extends

25 ft. in the direction indicated by the force

weaver and deals I d6 points of damage per

lc\ el (max. 20d6). A successful Reflex sa' e

(DC 17 - force \\Caver's lnt or Cha modifier)

a\Oids halfofthe force thrust damage. In addition.

those who fail their save are knocked back

to the edge of the thrust and fall prone.

Force Magic Immunity: The force weaver has such a strong connection to the threads that control force magic that she slowly builds an immunity to it over time. At I Oth level, the force weaver is immune to all force-based magic. This immunity allows the force weaver to ignore damaging spells such as *magic missile* and allows the force weaver to pass through effects such as *wall of force* without any restrictions.
