# Extradimensional Spaces
## Overview
A number of spells and magic items utilize extradimensional spaces, such as *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]*, a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding]]*, a *[[Handy Haversack|handy haversack]]*, and a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*. These spells and magic items create a tiny pocket space that does not exist in any dimension. Such items do not function, however, inside another extradimensional space. If placed inside such a space, they cease to function until removed from the extradimensional space. For example, if a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding]]* is brought into a *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]*, the contents of the *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding]]* become inaccessible until the *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding]]* is taken outside the *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]*. The only exception to this is when a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding]]* and a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* interact, forming a rift to the [[Astral Plane]], as noted in their descriptions.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The exception to the above is the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell.

It it important to note that extradimensional spaces DO NOT exist in any dimension. This means that incorporeal creatures can move through the physical substance of the item that incorporates an extradimensional space into it. This also means that ethereal creatures cannot move into an extradimensional space (as it does not exist in any dimension and so would not be coterminus with any dimension).
