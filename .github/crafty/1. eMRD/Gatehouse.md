# Gatehouse
## Overview
**Size:** 0.5 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This space usually serves as a primary entrance into the stronghold (or one of many entrances). As its name suggests, the gatehouse includes a gate (and a drawbridge, if stationed adjacent to a moat). Defense can be enhanced with a portcullis; see Doors, below, for prices and details.

Most gatehouses are fortified with a barbican (see above), guard post (see below), or both.
