# Valet (Archetype)
## Overview
A valet is a consummate personal servant, able to fetch, deliver, and perform for its master's every need.

**Class Skills:** A valet treats [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], and [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] as class skills.

**Able Assistant (Ex):** A valet's master treats the valet as if it possessed the [[Cooperative Crafting (Feat)|Cooperative Crafting]] feat and shared all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills and item creation feats he possesses. This ability replaces [[Alertness (Feat)|Alertness]].

**Prestidigitation (Sp):** A valet can use *[[Prestidigitation (Spell)|prestidigitation]]* once per hour.

**Teammate (Ex):** A valet is considered to have all the teamwork feats its master has.

**Deliver Touch Spells (Su):** At 3rd level, when delivering a harmless touch spell to a willing creature, a valet can move before and after delivering the spell, as long as its total movement does not exceed its speed. This ability modifies deliver touch spells.

**Deliver Aid (Ex):** At 7th level, a valet can move before and after using the aid another action, as long as its total movement does not exceed its speed. This ability replaces speak with animals of its kind.

**Aide to All (Ex):** At 13th level, a valet can choose to use the aid another action as a full-round action, granting up to three adjacent creatures bonuses from this action. Each bonus may be either for the same action or check or for different actions or checks. This ability replaces scry on familiar.
