# Transparent
## Overview
**Transparent:** This augmentation makes the wall transparent (though not actually invisible). Viewers on either side of the wall can see through it as if it were a window. This does not affect any other properties of the wall, nor does it affect anything hanging from the wall or painted, drawn, or scribed onto it.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
