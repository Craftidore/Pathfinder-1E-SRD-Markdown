# Performance Feats
## Overview
Performance feats are used when you make a performance combat check (see page 154 of *Ultimate Combat*), typically granting a special action that occurs when you make that check. Unless you have the Masterful Display feat, you can only apply the effect of one performance feat to each performance combat check you make.
