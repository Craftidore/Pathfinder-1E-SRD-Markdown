**SPECIAL QUALITIES**

**Airborne Sailing** The Feathered Galley of Ataylos is enchanted with the ability to fly for short distances, giving it an edge in evading pirates and sea monsters. The Feathered Galley can fly for a total of 10 nonconsecutive rounds per day, as the *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* spell. This total includes ascent and descent from the surface of the water.  This is considered a magical transmutation effect. If the Feathered Galley is airborne when its flight duration ends, or if an effect causes airborne sailing to fail, the galley floats downward at a rate of 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the surface of the water in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 10d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. While the Feathered Galley is airborne, it's considered to be using magical propulsion, thus all sailing checks to control the vessel automatically succeed.

**History**

Iblydos is a trading nation located on a small archipelago in the Obari Ocean. One of only a few stops by sea between Vudra and Gamnd, the tiny nation is perfectly situated as a mercantile center. It's no surprise, then, that Iblydan traders are renowned throughout the Inner Sea region for facilitating trade between the inhabitants of Garund, Northern Casmaron, Vudra, and Tian Xia. These merchants transport exotic spices, weaponry, textiles, magical beasts, and arcane secrets, making them popular with wealthy consumers across Golarion.

However, the prestige held by Iblydan traders doesn't come without considerable risk. The Obari Ocean is plagued by gargantuan sea dragons, carnivorous islands, demon storms, and a host of other dangers. Of course, piracy is always a threat, since the rare treasures transported by Iblydan traders represent the score of a lifetime for most buccaneers.

In short, Iblydan sailors risk more than most in their transcontinental voyages, thus take precautions accordingly. Chief among these is their choice of vessel. Some Iblydan ships are designed to repel danger with overwhelming firepower, while others are built to evade threats with effortless grace. No ship in the latter category was more widely respected than the Feathered Galley of Ataylos.

Ataylos was one of the most famed Iblydan traders of his day. He was renowned not only for his extraordinary vessel, but also for his uncanny ability to forge new contacts from all around Golarion. Ataylos was a gifted linguist, a shrewd merchant, and a natural charmer, making him welcome in high courts throughout Garund. It was during one of Ataylos's many forays into northern Garund that he first came into contact with Taldan soldiers, who were travelling south with what is now known as the doomed Sixth Army of Exploration. From conversations with the soldiers, Ataylos learned of the rapacious decadence of the Taldan nobility. Sensing a fascinating opportunity, he sailed directly to Oppara.

Predictably, Ataylos's visit was well received by the opulent Taldan courtiers, who traded a huge amount of precious minerals, weaponry, and magical items for the merchant's remaining goods. Laden with the haul of a lifetime, Ataylos turned his Feathered Galley southward once again. Unfortunately, the Iblydan trader's visit made such a stir that all of Taldor learned of his presence... including the Inner Sea's most dangerous pirates. As soon as the Feathered Galley left Taldor's territorial waters, several buccaneer crews gave the magical ship chase. Legend has it that the Feathered Galley eluded raiders for weeks, making for one of the longest open-water chases in pirate lore.

Unfortunately for Ataylos, just as he gained the relative safety of the open ocean, his plumed vessel attracted the attention of a treasure-hungry brine dragon. The dragon's attacks forced the Feathered Galley to veer toward a small island just south of Jalmeray. With the dragon beneath him and the pirates quickly closing in, Ataylos resorted to desperate measures-the magical ship took to the air and floated over the island. The Feathered Galley was last seen slowly descending into the jungle, never to be seen again.

**Legacy**

Many have searched the islands around Jalmeray for the lost Feathered Galley ef Ataylos, to no avail. However, some think that the jungle canopy still holds the famed ship, as well as its invaluable cargo.

**Landing Spot:** Contemporary scholars postulate that the reason multiple expeditions have failed to recover the Feathered Galley is that the treasure hunters may simply have failed to look up. They hypothesize that the ship landed not on the ground, but high in the canopy of an island's dense foliage. The ship could conceivably still be suspended in the embrace of a massive tree, amid a tangle of vines, creepers, and foliage. If this is the case, then anyone who hopes to find and recover the galley will have to scale the trees and figure out a way to get the ship back into the water. It's also likely that damage from the crash landing, compounded by centuries of decay, significantly debilitated the galley. If that's the case, the ship will likely need substantial repairs before it's seaworthy.

**Island Guardians:** Those approaching the island by sea seeking the Feathered Galley must contend with a variety of obstacles-more dangerous things than pirates darken the Obari Ocean. Jalmeray's suspicious naval forces patrol the waters, and Brisaswaithe, the old brine dragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 94) treats the surrounding shoals as its home. Once ashore, explorers encounter the natural threats of the island itself, including deadly mantises (Pat1'!finder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary 30) and viper vines (Bestiary 2 279 ). The locals in Jalmeray's fishing villages also believe that the isle is populated by a small colony of outcast rakshasas (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 224), prompting them to shun the island.

**Precious Cargo:** Ataylos's final haul is rumored to have been the richest of his career. The Feathered Galley was laden with items from Avistan, Vudra, and Tian Xia. The ship's manifest is purported to have included a variety of eastern weaponry, countless jewels, an effeeti bottle (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 294), a pistol of the infinite sky (Ultimate Equipment i58), eyes of the dragon (Ultimate Equipment 225), and a dragon staff (Ultimate Equipment 192), among other treasures.

**ln Your Campaign**

The Feathered Galley ef Ataylos can serve as a memorable and mobile base of operations for a group of adventurers in a campaign that involves a great deal of travel. Adventures that send characters to numerous far-flung destinations can make it difficult for players to feel connected to a campaign. Without a city or stronghold to serve as a home for the characters, there's little opportunity for clerics to establish shrines, fighters to build rooms to hold their trophies, and wizards to set up studies and libraries.

The earliest it makes sense to give PCs access to the Feathered Galley is at 5th or 6th level, when the ability to fly is becoming increasingly common and a group of four PCs could conceivably afford such a ship if they combined their total character wealth. Of course, the PCs need not own the Galley to be able to operate from it. A GM could have PCs find the vessel for a patron, who in return loans them use of it when it's not needed elsewhere. This allows the party to get involved in social encounters with the crew, but still leaves the ultimate use of the ship in the hands of an NPC (and thus the GM). Because the Feathered Galley ef Ataylos's ability to fly is limited, it isn't likely to cause major problems in a typical campaign. Its banks of siege weapons could be problematic-but those are difficult to use outside of naval encounters, where any well-armed ship would have the same options.
