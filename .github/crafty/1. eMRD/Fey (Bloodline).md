# Fey (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Fey**

The capricious nature of the fey runs in your family due to some intermingling of fey blood or magic. You are more emotional than most, prone to bouts of joy and rage.

**Class Skill**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature).

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Entangle (Spell)|entangle]]* (3rd), *[[Hideous Laughter (Spell)|hideous laughter]]* (5th), *[[Deep Slumber (Spell)|deep slumber]]* (7th), *[[Poison|poison]]* (9th), *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]* (11th), *[[Mislead (Spell)|mislead]]* (13th), *[[Phase Door (Spell)|phase door]]* (15th), *[[Irresistible Dance (Spell)|irresistible dance]]* (17th), *[[Shapechange (Spell)|shapechange]]* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]], [[Lightning Reflexes (Feat)|Lightning Reflexes]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], [[Quicken Spell (Feat)|Quicken Spell]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[nature]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the compulsion subschool, increase the spellâ€™s DC by +2.

**Bloodline Powers**: You have always had a tie to the natural world, and as your power increases, so does the inf luence of the fey over your magic.

*Laughing Touch (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Woodland Stride (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.

*Fleeting Glance (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can turn invisible for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This ability functions as *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]**.* These rounds need not be consecutive.

*Fey Magic (Su)*: At 15th level, you may reroll any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance. You must decide to use this ability before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. You can use this ability at will.

*Soul of the Fey (Su)*: At 20th level, your soul becomes one with the world of the fey. You gain immunity to poison and DR 10/cold iron. Creatures of the animal type do not attack you unless compelled to do so through magic. Once per day, you can cast *[[Shadow Walk (Spell)|shadow walk]]* as a spell-like ability using your sorcerer level as your caster level.
