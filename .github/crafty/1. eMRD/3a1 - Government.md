**Government**

The Free City Consul, consisting of the Lord Mayor Karillian Gluck and 11 other consuls, rules Zobeck. The sitting consuls choose the Lord Mayor from among their peers to serve a 10-year term, though most have held the position for life. The Lord Mayor oversees the administration of justice by appointing all of Zobeck’s judges, establishes and provisions the army, appoints all knight-commanders of the Citadel, and commands the Free City’s militant orders—except the paladins of the Order of the Undying Sun. The Order predates the city’s independence, and this chapter of the organization serves only on the condition that their commander answers to no one “not of noble blood.” In practice, the Order of the Undying Sun acts as an independent military force.

Normally descendants of the Great Revolt’s leaders, the remaining consuls serve for life or until they receive a “silent office” (a retirement sinecure). Sitting consuls fill vacancies from among the city’s most prominent civic leaders, typically guildmasters, merchants, or powerful members of the priesthood—but once in a while, the consuls choose an adventurous individual seeking a quieter life.

By tradition, the Free City Council includes the Guildmaster of the Arcane Collegium and the Kobold King of Kings.

Ondli Firedrake, a dwarven priest of Rava (and Volund), has served as First Consul, or Council House Chairman, for 20 years. His consul peers selected him to guide the meetings, recognizing him as the most patient and fair-minded among them.
