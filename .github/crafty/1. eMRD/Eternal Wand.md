*This long, tapered wand ends with a pink crystal containing red swirls.*

An *eternal wand* holds a single arcane spell of 3rd level or lower, determined during creation. Any character who can cast arcane spells can activate the wand to use the spell contained in it, regardless of whether the spell appears on his class spell list.

An *eternal wand* functions two times per day.

**Lore:** During the final years of the last great war, the artificers and wizards of a powerful noble family perfected a new form of wand built around a crystal shard ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 10).

The development of the *eternal wand* allowed lesser arcanists to take the place of war wizards during the fi nal days of the last great war, supplementing their passive spells with more aggressive magic ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 15).

While the artificers have been searching for ways to streamline the process of creation, the technique is still in its infancy. Currently, the wands are rarely seen except in military units, but a few soldiers who served in the war brought their *eternal wands* of *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* home from the front lines ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 20).

*Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], the spell contained in the *eternal wand*.

*Cost to Create:* See table.

**GM Note**

Eeternal wands are priced as if they were wondrous items, with a per-day use using the table on page 285 of the DMG. 

Spell level \* Caster level \* 1800 (command word) \* 2 / 5 ( 2 charges per day) + 100 (for the crystal rod).

Spell level \* Caster level \* 1800 (command word) \* 2 / 5 ( 2 charges per day) + 100 (for the crystal rod).

0.5 \* 1 \* 1800 \* 0.4 + 100 = 460 gp

1 \* 1 \* 1800 \* 0.4 + 100 = 820 gp

2 \* 3 \* 1800 \* 0.4 + 100 = 4420 gp

3 \* 5 \* 1800 \* 0.4 + 100 = 10900 gp.
