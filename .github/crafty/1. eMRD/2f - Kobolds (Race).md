# 2f - Kobolds (Race)
## Overview
Of the smaller races, the kobolds have adapted best to the changing world. Enslaved long ago by reaver dwarves, kobolds quickly carved a niche for themselves as miners, scouts, and tinkerers—small enough to be useful and small enough to be dismissed as a threat. At first they were tolerated, then largely ignored. As a result, the shadows of dwarven society are rife with kobold rogues and entrepreneurs (many of them secret worshipers of Loki), seemingly subservient but busily trading dwarven goods for resources extracted from the dwarves’ own mines and storehouses, right under the nose of their alleged “masters.” Free kobolds defend their mines viciously, but otherwise maintain the ruse of a harmless and subservient little folk—at least until the opportunity to sheathe a knife in someone’s kidneys presents itself. Many other small races have adopted the kobold’s strategy, including the worship of Loki, embracing his cunning ways and the advantages of guile and cunning over brawn and bravado.

More than anything, kobolds are survivors. Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dexterous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with a cowardly speed. They fight on their own terms, small and fierce, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races cannot sustain a settlement. They are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into some trouble. They are merchants to both the Underdark and the surface world, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes and the dwarves, other mining races that seek to overthrow the kobold dominance of dark, rich territories.

The kobold King of Kings rules from Harkesh, the capital of the Dragon Empire.

Kobold society is exceedingly social and built around the clan, matriarchal lines of descent, male kings, and the crucial importance of clutch-mates (those who hatched about the same time, since kobolds are reptilian and hatch from eggs). Relatively few kobolds become adventurers, but those who do generally have either offended a kobold king (and been exiled from the mines as punishment) or have lost many or all of their clutch-mates. An adventuring kobold wishes to leave his or her home to grieve and find new friends. In many cases, a kobold will “adopt” an adventuring party as new clutch-mates.

Kobolds are deeply enamored of their tools, and some kobolds spend a great deal of effort to improve them. Mining picks, a mason’s hammer, jeweler’s loup, and even simple items like a kobold’s spear or dagger are all named and cherished. At the same time, kobolds tend to gnaw on tool handles, forget to oil blades, or even pry out inlays or decorative gems to improve them. As a result, most kobold items are entirely distinctive and unlikely to be mistaken for anyone else’s items. Some believe this decorative urge may be a form of defense against theft.

One category of tool deserves special note: traps. Kobolds create wildly impractical traps and simple, deadly ones as a hobby, and few kobolds leave home without string, springs, or other triggers for their traps. Kobolds are the only race that recognizes “trapsmith” as a profession.

The kobolds are closely allied with and related to the dragonkin, the drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh-so-many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is ever satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire the dragons as the sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.
