# C03 - Items of Legacy
## Overview
This chapter presents forty-nine legacy items,

complete with descriptions, histories, rituals,

adventure seeds, and legacy abilities.

These objects cover a wide range of utility,

from traditional instruments of war to

finely honed tools of stealth. Each one is ready to be

included in a campaign with only a small amount

of work.

**READING THE LEGACY ITEM ENTRIES**

Refer to this section if you have questions about a legacy item’s presentation.

**Name and Description:** The name of the legacy

item is followed by a description of the item’s appearance

and easily observed abilities. Unless you succeed

on the DC 15 Knowledge (history) check concerning

the item, its name isn’t automatically evident.

Nonlegacy Game Statistics: This entry contains

information that can be gleaned by inspection and

with an *identify* spell. The cost listed here is for a normal

magic item of the legacy item’s kind, its true status

remaining unknown. Legacy items are priceless.

History: Every legacy item has a history, which

is often obscured by a gulf of time. Knowing

a piece of an item’s past requires a Knowledge

(history) check, with higher and higher DCs to

learn more and more esoteric or pertinent facts.

These checks do not have to be made by the

prospective wielder of the item. The information

gained by the checks must be accurately

communicated to that person, however, because

making the relevant Knowledge (history) check

also uncovers the ritual associated with part of

the item’s legacy. The skill check DC and the

ritual gleaned from a successful check appear

parenthetically at the end of each relevant

paragraph in an item’s history.

Additional methods of researching a legacy

item’s history are discussed in Alternatives to

Knowledge (history) Checks, page 205.

Legacy Rituals: Every legacy item has

at least one ritual associated with it—a

task that must be successfully completed in

order to unlock a range of abilities for your use.

A legacy item can have least, lesser, and greater

rituals, which grant you access to least, lesser,

and greater abilities, respectively, but only if you

complete the required ritual.

*Cost:* A legacy ritual has an associated cost in gold

pieces, which is listed here.

*Feat Granted:* Successful completion of a legacy

ritual grants you the legacy feat listed here as a

bonus feat, assuming you meet its prerequisites. If

you don’t have all the prerequisites, you still gain the

feat but cannot benefi t from it until the prerequisites

are met.

Wielder Requirements: Legacy items have more

requirements than simply gaining the associated

legacy feats. Such requirements are listed here, much

like the prerequisites for entering a prestige class.

These requirements do not affect your ability to use

the nonlegacy abilities of the item.

Item Table: Every legacy item is described in terms

of a table that lays out conferred abilities according to

the following information.

*Wielder Level:* You must possess this character level

to gain the legacy item abilities in the same row of

the table, assuming you meet any other requirements.

Since a character below 5th level cannot

gain access to legacy abilities, each table starts with

that level.

*Personal Costs:* All legacy items exact some sort

of personal costs. These costs apply once you gain

access to the legacy abilities of that level, and they

apply whether or not you are actively wielding the

item of legacy. If you renounce your legacy (see page

9), these costs are negated. Specifi c types of personal

costs are explained here.

Attack Penalty: This is a permanent penalty on all

your attack rolls. Multiple values

in the same column are not

cumulative, instead representing

the total penalty

applied.

Skill Check Penalty:

This is a permanent penalty

on all your skill

checks. Multiple values

in the same column are

not cumulative, instead

representing the total

penalty applied.

Save Penalty: This is

a permanent penalty on

your saving throws. Unless

the column’s header notes a specifi c save, the

penalty applies on all saves (Fortitude, Refl ex, and

Will). Multiple values in the same column are not

cumulative, instead representing the total penalty

applied.

Caster Level Penalty: This is a permanent reduction

in your caster level for all spells. It has no bearing on

the spells you can cast, only on the level-dependent

variables of those spells. Multiple values in the same

column are not cumulative, instead representing the

total reduction applied.

Manifester Level Penalty: This is a permanent

reduction in your manifester level for all psionic

powers. It affects all level-dependent variables of

psionic powers, as well as the maximum number of

power points you can expend on any one power. Multiple

values in the same column are not cumulative,

instead representing the total reduction applied.

Hit Point Loss: You permanently lose the listed

number of hit points. The values are cumulative.

Skill Point Loss: The listed number of skill points

are deducted from the skill points you gain at the

indicated level. If you cannot pay this personal cost

in full, you must immediately pay as much as you can

and continue to pay toward the cost, before acquiring

any further skill ranks, until it is entirely paid. Only

when the total cost is paid do you gain access to the

legacy abilities of the level exacting the cost. The

values are cumulative.

Spell Slot Loss: You lose the listed spell slot (or slots)

from your daily number of spells. These entries are

not cumulative; each entry on this column replaces

all previous entries.

CHAPTER 3

ITEMS OF

LEGACY

Power Point Loss: You deduct the listed number

of power points from your daily pool. The values are

cumulative.

*Abilities:* If all the requirements are met, including

character level, ritual completion, and personal costs,

the legacy item confers the indicated ability or abilities

upon you.

Legacy Item Abilities: The abilities conferred by

a legacy item are explained here. In general, using

legacy items’ abilities requires you to at least carry

the item on your person. This default rule has some

exceptions, which are clarified in the specific entries

to which they apply.

Unless otherwise noted, activating a legacy ability

is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. The save DC for any legacy ability is equal

to 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier

of the minimum ability score needed to cast that

level of spell, just as normal for magic items (see page

214 of the *Dungeon Master’ s Guide*). You can substitute

your Charisma modifier for the ability modifier used

by the item, if the save DC result would be higher.

Adventure Seed: An encounter is provided, usually

involving discovery of the legacy item.

READING THE

STATISTICS BLOCK

The new statistics block format is divided into four

main sections, which are separated by horizontal

lines. Each section serves a specific purpose, so you

will need to reference different sections at different

times during an encounter. The sections are as follows,

from top to bottom.

Identification and Encounter

The top section identifies the creature and gives the

information you need at the start of an encounter.

Name: This word or phrase identifies the creature.

Sometimes a number is given with the name to indicate

how many creatures appear in the encounter.

CR: This value is the Challenge Rating of an individual

creature of this kind.

Race, Class, and Level: This information is provided

only for characters with class levels.

Alignment: The one- or two-letter abbreviation

that appears here denotes the creature’s alignment.

Size and Type: The creature’s size category and

its type (and subtype or subtypes, if applicable) are

given here.

Init: This value is the creature’s modifier on initiative

checks.

Senses: The Senses entry indicates whether the

creature has darkvision, low-light vision, scent,

tremorsense, blindsense, blindsight, or some

other sensory special quality. This information is

followed by the creature’s modifiers on Listen and

Spot checks (even if the creature has no ranks in

those skills).

Aura: Occasionally, a creature has a special ability

that takes effect anytime another creature comes

within a certain distance of it. Such abilities, such

as a blackguard’s aura of despair or a devil’s fear aura,

are detailed here.

Languages: This entry gives the languages the

creature speaks or understands, as well as any special

abilities relating to communication (such as telepathy

or *tongues*) that it possesses.

Defensive Information

This section provides the information you need when

characters are attacking the creature.

AC: This entry gives the creature’s Armor Class

against most regular attacks, followed by its AC

against touch attacks (which disregard armor) and

its AC when flat-footed (or at any other time when it

is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC). If the creature

has feats or other abilities that modify its Armor

Class under specific circumstances (such as the

Mobility feat), they are noted here as well as in the

Feats entry.

hp: This entry consists of the creature’s full normal

hit point total (usually average rolls on each Hit

Die), followed by the creature’s Hit Dice in parentheses.

If the creature has fast healing, regeneration,

damage reduction (DR), or some other ability that

affects the amount of damage it takes or the rate at

which it regains hit points, that information also

appears here.

Immune: Any immunities the creature has are

indicated here. This includes immunity to specific

types of energy as well as specific immunities (such

as immunity to poison or to *sleep* effects).

Resist and SR: If the creature has resistance to

certain kinds of attacks, that information is given

here. Resistance to energy is shown first, as the

energy type and the number of points resisted per

attack (acid 10, for example). This information is

followed by any other resistances the creature has.

Altered saving throw bonuses for specific circumstances

appear on this line. The creature’s spell

resistance, if any, appears after the other resistances

on the same line.

26

CHAPTER 3

ITEMS OF

LEGACY

Fort, Ref, Will: This entry gives the creature’s

saving throw modifiers.

Weakness: This entry details any weaknesses or

vulnerabilities the creature has, such as light sensitivity

or vulnerability to a type of energy.

Offensive Information

Refer to this section when it’s the creature’s turn to

act in combat. All its combat options—from melee

attacks to spells to potions it might drink—are

detailed in this section, even if they are not strictly

offensive in nature.

Speed: This entry begins with the creature’s base

land speed, in feet and in squares on the battle grid.

Next come speeds for its other modes of movement,

if applicable.

Melee/Ranged: Typically, these entries give all the

physical attacks the creature can make when taking

a full attack action. The first attack described is the

creature’s preferred form of attack, usually a melee

attack of some sort but possibly (as in the example

below) a ranged attack. If the creature can make only

a single attack (for instance, when it is taking an

attack action), use the first indicated attack bonus.

Occasionally, a creature has separate options indicated

for single attacks and for full attacks. For example, a

halfling ranger with the Manyshot and Rapid Shot

feats might have the following entries:

**Ranged** *+1 longbow* +8 (2d6+2/×3) with Manyshot or

**Ranged** *+1 longbow* +10/+10/+5 (1d6+1/×3) with

Rapid Shot or

**Melee** mwk longsword +8/+3 (1d6/19–20)

Each set of attack routines is prefaced by a boldface

word indicating whether the attacks are melee or

ranged. Next comes the weapon used for the attack,

the modified attack bonus, the amount of damage the

attack deals, and information about critical hits. If

the weapon has the “default” critical hit characteristics

(threat on a 20 and 2 damage), this portion of the

entry is omitted.

Space: This entry defines how large a square the

creature takes up on the battle grid. This information

is omitted for any creature that occupies a

5-foot square.

Reach: The Reach entry defines how far the

creature’s natural reach extends, and it also gives

information about any reach weapons it might use.

This information is omitted for any creature that has

a reach of 5 feet.

Base Atk: The Base Atk entry gives the creature’s

base attack bonus without any modifiers.

Grp: This entry gives the creature’s grapple bonus

(base attack + size modifier + Str bonus).

Atk Options: Special abilities that the creature can

employ to modify its normal attacks appear here. Such

abilities might include feats such as Power Attack or

Combat Expertise, or special abilities such as smite

evil or trip.

Special Actions: This entry gives any special

attacks that the creature can use on its turn in place

of making attacks.

Combat Gear: Possessions that the creature can

choose to employ on its turn as an action appear here.

Such items might include scrolls, potions, wands,

staffs, rods, or wondrous items.

Spells Known: This entry appears only for

sorcerers and members of other classes who do not

prepare spells. It begins with the creature’s caster

level for spells. If its rolls to overcome spell resistance

are based on a number other than its caster

level (because the creature has the Spell Penetration

feat, for example), its total modifier is given after the

expression “spell pen.” Spells known are listed from

highest level to 0 level, and each spell includes an

attack bonus and a saving throw DC, if appropriate.

If the character casts some spells at a different caster

level than others, that information is also specified

with the affected spells.

Spells Prepared: This entry appears only for

wizards, clerics, and members of other classes who

prepare spells. It begins with the character’s caster

level for spells. If its rolls to overcome spell resistance

are based on a number other than its caster

level (because the creature has the Spell Penetration

feat, for example), its total modifier is given after the

expression “spell pen.” Spells prepared are listed from

highest level to 0 level, and each spell includes an

attack bonus and a saving throw DC, if appropriate.

If the character casts some spells at a different caster

level than others, that information is also specified

with the affected spells.

A cleric’s statistics block also includes the name

of his deity (if applicable) and the domains to which

he has access. Each domain spell he has prepared is

marked with a superscript D. The granted powers

of his domains might appear as combat options or

resistances, or they might not appear at all, if they only

modify information presented elsewhere. For example,

a domain power that makes certain skills class skills

would not be detailed in the statistics block.

27

CHAPTER 3

ITEMS OF

LEGACY

Spell-Like Abilities: Any spell-like abilities the

creature possesses appear here. The entry begins with

the creature’s caster level for these abilities. As with

spells, this entry includes attack bonuses and saving

throw DCs where appropriate.

Other Information

Most of the information presented in this section

is not relevant during a combat encounter with the

creature. One important exception is explanatory

text for special abilities that appear elsewhere in the

statistics block.

Abilities: The creature’s ability scores appear

here in the customary order (Str, Dex, Con, Int,

Wis, Cha).

SQ: Any special qualities not presented earlier in

the statistics block appear here. These entries are often

class features or other abilities that are not generally

relevant in combat.

Feats: This entry lists all the feats the creature

possesses, including those that appear elsewhere in

the statistics block.

Skills: This entry shows all the skill modifiers

for skills in which the creature has ranks. Modifiers

are also provided for skills to which racial modifiers,

bonuses from synergy, or other modifiers

apply, whether or not the creature has ranks in

those skills.

Possessions: This entry is simply a list of items that

the creature is wearing or carrying. The expression

“combat gear” appears first, when applicable, to

remind you of other possessions that are referenced

above.

Spellbook: This entry gives the spells in the

creature’s spellbook, if it has one. The notation “spells

prepared plus” indicates that the spells the creature

has prepared are part of this list, but are not reiterated

here.

The final portion of the statistics block consists

of paragraphs explaining special abilities noted in

the various entries above, in the order in which

they appear.

Roleplaying Hook

When appropriate, a Hook entry appears at the end

of a statistics block, set off in its own section. This is

a tidbit of information to help you run the creature

in a fl avorful or memorable way. Generally, this

information is present only if the statistics block

describes a unique named character. It might be a

quote or a battle cry, or an indication of the kind of

characters the creature is most likely to attack. If

the descriptive text that accompanies a creature’s or

character’s statistics block includes facts about the

individual’s behavior or outlook that could serve as a

roleplaying hook, the Hook entry is omitted. Such is

the case for the NPCs in the adventure seeds in this

chapter—information that would normally appear

in the Hook section is provided in the descriptive

text of the encounter.
