# Linnorm Death Curse, Tor (Su)
## Overview
*Linnorm Death Curse, Tor (Su)*: The character channels the power of a tor linnorm. The character’s melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of fire damage. If the character is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or spell, the attacker suffers the curse of boiling blood (Will negates). A character must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. *Curse of Boiling Blood*: *save* Will DC 10 + 1/2 character’s level + character’s Charisma bonus; *effect* target gains vulnerability to fire and is permanently [[Staggered|staggered]] from the pain of its boiling blood (this is a pain effect).
