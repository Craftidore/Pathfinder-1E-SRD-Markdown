# Shadowmind (PrC)
## Overview
A specter in the thoughts of the unwary, the shadowmind

moves through the twisting pathways of the mind as

easily as she slides through the dark alleyways of the

city. A shadowmind blends psionic powers and uncanny

stealth into an effective whole. Although they can be

capable spies or thieves, shadowminds view themselves as

much more. Shadowminds see their training and psychic

powers as an extension of a deep self-examination process

that requires the knowledge of the innermost goals and

motivations of others.

While a few shadowminds are trained in secret by

governments, covert cabals, and the like, most train at

a distant monastery. These ascetics forsake many of the

worldly goals they had before joining the shadowmind

monastery, instead devoting themselves to peering inside

the minds and secrets of others. The rigorous training

stresses the need to see the faults and secrets of others

as extensions of the shadowmind’s own experiences. To

a shadowmind, enlightenment and true understanding

come from using the secret motivations of others as a

means of self-awareness.

Most shadowminds begin their careers as psions and

later diversify their skills and abilities by taking a level

of rogue. Psychic warriors also find the class appealing,

although they are more likely to multiclass as a ranger

or ninja than as a rogue. Although wilders can qualify

for the class as easily as psions, few wilders become

shadowminds. (For full information about psionic

classes and psionic powers, see the *Expanded Psionics*

*Handbook.*)

Adaptation: With their excellent skill selection and

steady progression of psionic powers, shadowminds can

be recast easily to fill almost any niche. Simply change the

powers that a shadowmind learns for free to match the

desired flavor of the class. Two examples appear below. The

powers noted in the examples replace the shadowmind’s

1st-level ability *read thoughts*, the 3rd-level ability *cloud*

*mind*, and the 9th-level ability *mass cloud mind*.

Cerebral infiltrator (psionic spy): 1st—*distract*, 3rd—

*forced sense link*, 9th—*mind probe.*

Thought killer (psionic assassin): 1st—*conceal thoughts*,

3rd—*energy stun*, 9th—*personal mind blank.*

Hit Die: d6.

To qualify to become a shadowmind, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the shadowmind

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Shadowminds gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Powers Known: At every level indicated on the

accompanying table, a shadowmind gains additional

power points per day and access to new discovered

powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever

psionic manifesting class she belonged to before she

added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain

any other benefit a character of that class would have

gained. If a character had more than one psionic class

before becoming a shadowmind, she must decide to

which class to add the new level of shadowmind for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers

known, and manifester level.

Read Thoughts (Ps): At 1st level, a shadowmind adds

*read thoughts* to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already

know it). Once per day, she can manifest *read thoughts* at

a reduced power point cost. The cost of *read thoughts* is

reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a minimum

of 1 power point. The effect of this power is still restricted

by the shadowmind’s manifester level.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a shadowmind

deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when

flanking an opponent or any time the target would be

denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies

to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level and 3d6 points

at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the

*Player’s Handbook*. If a shadowmind gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the

bonuses on damage stack.

Cloud Mind (Ps): At 3rd level, a shadowmind adds

*cloud mind* to her repertoire (if she doesn’t already know

it). Once per day, she can manifest *cloud mind* at a

reduced power point cost. The cost of *cloud mind*

is reduced by the shadowmind’s class level, to a

minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this

power is still restricted by the shadowmind’s

manifester level.

Mass Cloud Mind (Ps): At 9th level, a

shadowmind adds *mass cloud mind* to her

repertoire (if she doesn’t already know it).

Once per day, she can manifest *mass cloud mind*

at a reduced power point cost. The cost of *mass*

*cloud mind* is reduced by the shadowmind’s level, to

a minimum of 1 power point. The effect of this power is

still restricted by the shadowmind’s manifester level.

Mind Stab (Su): A 10th-level shadowmind can

combine a precise blow with a burst of mental energy,

removing her presence from the mind and memory of

her victim even as she stabs him. Once per round as

a free action, immediately after successfully dealing

sneak attack damage to an opponent, a shadowmind can

manifest *cloud mind* against that opponent.

Manifesting *cloud mind* in this way uses a reduced

power point expenditure as described under the *cloud*

*mind* ability above.

*Psionic Powers Known* (power points 72; manifester

level 8th): 1st—*conceal thoughts, destiny dissonance, dissipating*

*touch, mind thrust* (DC 15), *precognition*; 2nd—*cloud*

*mind* (DC 16), *concealing amorpha, concussion blast, id*

*insinuation* (DC 16), *object reading, read thoughts* (DC 16);

3rd—*body adjustment, energy burst, mental barrier, mind*

*trap*; 4th—*aura sight, psionic freedom of movement, mindwipe*

(DC 18), *remote viewing* (DC 18).

Sneak Attack (Ex): Mysk deals an extra 2d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against fl at-footed or

fl anked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Mysk

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfi nding (Ex): Mysk can fi nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to fi nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

*Possessions: bracers of armor +2, ring of protection +1,*

*headband of intellect +2, cloak of resistance +1*, 2 *potions of cure*

*moderate wounds*, *potion of cat’s grace*, dagger, 100 gp.
