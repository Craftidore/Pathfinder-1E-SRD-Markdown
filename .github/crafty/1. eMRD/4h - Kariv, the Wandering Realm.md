# 4h - Kariv, the Wandering Realm
## Overview
A tabor is a wagon, and a household. It is the home of every Kariv wanderer, their warmth and shelter in the howling plains and bitter winter. The tabor of the Kariv are ever-moving, pushed forward at least once a season, for fear of the Wandering Curse that all the Kariv suffer.

The Wandering Realm is the wide swath of land where the wagons roll, where sheep and horses graze, and where every matriarch is a queen to her clan. However, a few great Kariv stand out every year at the gatherings of the wagons, and these are hailed as the king and queens of the Kariv (rather than the king or queen of a clan). The holders of these titles change as various leaders grow older and sickly, or die on the road, or choose to step down. A bolder, slyer, or more charismatic contender might unseat the current monarch, but victory over an elder is never assured. Some of the Kariv’s most cherished tales tell of King Jarek, the graybeard who outwits his loud, strutting rival, Prince Isak, a fool who is nevertheless loved in his own way.

## The King and Queens of the Kariv
**The King and Queens of the Kariv**

Do not ask of princes among the Kariv, for there is not a clan leader born who is not the prince, duchess, boyar, or grandee of some title.

### Iqbal Lovari, the Tall King
**Iqbal Lovari, the Tall King**

The king of the Kariv and leader of the Lovari clan is both literally and figuratively larger than life. Iqbal Lovari (CN male human magus 10) is nearly 7 feet tall, reed-thin, and at nearly 70 years of age, is still rumored to have “the strength of three bears.” He is said to have both Northern giant and Southern fey ancestry. A master forger and warrior, he exemplifies all the qualities of his clan: he is cold and steely in his dealings, and fiery in battle.

Besides his lanky outline and laconic nature, he is easily identified by his one green eye and one blue eye, a result of the Second Sight so common to his people. He is a traditionalist, staying true to the ancient Kariv saying: “The Kariv know no home...and acknowledge no masters but themselves.” This makes him a dire enemy of Mama Rye and her clan.

### Sanchari and Innessa, the Twin Queens
**Sanchari and Innessa, the Twin Queens**

The strong-willed twin sisters Sanchari and Innessa (N female human bards 13) are in their mid-40s and have together led their family for 13 years now, protecting their people against the influences of the outsiders while walking among them. Congruent with their different characters and abilities, the sober Innessa serves as Queen of the Road, making all the decisions regarding their family’s travels, while the flamboyant Sanchari rules as Queen of the Tents whenever the Kariv have made camp.

The Kariv have no issue with these divided responsibilities. Nor does any Kariv bat an eyelash at the fact that the two sisters share the same body. They realize outsiders wouldn’t understand and consider the “sisters” insane, but the Kariv know she is not mad. Two minds and two souls reside inside in their queens’ body.

What nobody knows, however, is that there is a third sister—sleeping, waiting...and far less benevolent.

## Great Kariv Families
**Great Kariv Families**

The nation of the Kariv is split on clan and family lines, and only the king and queens of all the Kariv are acknowledged by all the wandering folk. There are many families, but the most important are described here. Most clans consider other clans as equals, but occasionally a clan becomes famous (or infamous). These eight clans are celebrated in song, and are rivals to the smaller or less well-known clans.

### Dakat, Horse Traders
**Dakat, Horse Traders**

A medium-sized rising clan, Dakat currently has little standing, but it looks to increase its position and has had great success of late through hard-won treachery and clever dealings. The Dakats produce merchants and artisans, and Kariv who take to the adventuring life. 

Three aged sisters, Tria, Giessa, and Arina Dakat (all NG female human wizard 6), lead their separate families as the Queen of the Dakat. All three vote on issues concerning the clan, but Tria has as final word. They are found in the Magdar Kingdom and along the shores of the Ruby Sea.

### Galati, Fallen Diviners
**Galati, Fallen Diviners**

The closest thing the Kariv have to royalty, this powerful clan’s women are skilled diviners. The Kariv believe the Galati will produce the leader who unites the clans, breaks the Wander curse, and leads them home. The Galati pact with Zobeck’s Cloven Nine was heartbreaking for the Kariv, who feel their destiny is caged as long as the Galati remain bound to the Nine.

The matriarch Mama Rye (N female human sorcerer 7/expert 4), one of the most famed crab diviners in the land, leads the Galati. They are the most common Kariv in the Ironcrags and Zobeck region.

### Heph, Fallen Diabolists
**Heph, Fallen Diabolists**

This small clan’s bloodline carries a sorcerous taint that makes them skilled in summoning hellfire and bending the will of their enemies. Frequently referred to as the “Black Heph,” the clan is shunned by all other Kariv for its eager entrance into pacts with the Cloven Nine in exchange for power. Unlike other Kariv, the Heph praise men over women and abolished the practice of clan mothers.

Asirai Heph (NE male tiefling sorcerer 10), reputedly more than 140 years old, bound a hundred minor devils to the various gemstones he wears to fuel his infernal powers and retain his hold on the clan. The Heph are allies of the Master of Demon Mountain, and are found there or in the area around Neimheim and Vidim. Some say they sell people to the gnomes.

### Leanti, Brawlers and Singers
**Leanti, Brawlers and Singers**

Famous wrestlers, jugglers, and brawlers, the Leanti are a loud family led by a brash young matriarch, Mother Sage (N female human fighter 6/rogue 3). They are known for making castrati of prisoners, and of praising song above most other arts; many Leanti are composers or bards, and their work is sought after as far away as Friula.

The Leanti stay north and east of the Ruby Sea most summers, and they winter in the Dragon Empire, one of the few Kariv families to spend time among the scaled folk. Many are expert pickpockets.

### Lovari, the Smiths
**Lovari, the Smiths**

The Lovari are the smiths, weaponeers, and tinkers of the Kariv, more welcome than their brethren because of their skills with iron. Many masterwork weapons and tools in Southern Midgard have come from the forge wagons of the Lovari. These are large, armored vardo and common at festivals and markets in the larger cities.

Doe-eyed Lovari maids and heavily muscled Lovari scions stage their famed Ironfire warrior dance with whirling blades, diaphanous skirts, and fiery torches. Lovari say the dance draws customers; rival merchants say it distracts spectators from the cutpurses working the crowds. In truth, it might be both. The Lovari wield the weapons they forge, and small bands of Lovari rakes hire out as bodyguards or mercenaries. They say Lovari need no coal, but their fires burn hot.

### Merceri, the Blessed
**Merceri, the Blessed**

This large clan is known for producing healers and consorting with angels and devas as far south as Ishadia. The Merceri pride themselves on their hospitality and frequently serve as arbiters in Kariv disputes, and they produce more diviners than all other Kariv clans combined. The Heavenly Empress Shirah Merceri (NG female human cleric

10 \[Lada]), a wizened seer who quickly discovers all hidden truths, leads the Merceri. The Queens of the Kariv, Sanchari and Innessa, were formerly leaders of the Merceri, though they now claim a higher title.

### Sergin, the Woodsfolk
**Sergin, the Woodsfolk**

This medium-sized clan is famed for its woodcraft, tracking, and skilled horsemanship. The Sergin clan produces trackers and crossbowmen who are respected by Kariv, dwarf, and centaur alike for their keen eyes and lightning reflexes.

Chief Marab Sergin (CG female human ranger 7), a fiery woman in her mid-60s known for her quick draw and even quicker temper, leads the clan. They are found near the Margreve and in Morgau and Doresh, as well as south, even into Illyria and the edges of the Mharoti Empire.

### The Kalder, the Black Gypsies
**The Kalder, the Black Gypsies**

The tales say they are born from Baba Yaga’s cauldron. They are buried in the fall and left in the frozen earth, in unmarked graves. Their names are removed from the fireside tales, and cursed when mentioned by outsiders. The Kalder are the Kariv family that serves the gnomes of Neimheim, the child-stealers and maiden-catchers who give the rest of the fallen a bad name. They are servants of the Black God Chernovog, protected by his dark angels, and those who spill their blood are stricken with a wasting disease. Their menfolk include ghouls and vampires. Their knives are poisoned with that sticky black resin called Dragon’s Blood, and their smiles are few.

The Kalder might not be as bad as their reputation. Sure, it is true that they travel to Krakova, the dwarfholds, and doing so means passing through Holmgard and the gnome forests. It’s simple geography. But they are no more servants to the gnomes than they are to the Tsar of Vidim or Perun’s Daughter. The Kalder keep to themselves, as masters of black and white magic and queens of seduction. The only gift they lack is that of fortunetelling; some say they traded it to the other families in exchange for a talent for necromancy.

Believe the story you love best—perhaps all are true. The Kalder are led by King Kiril Kalder (NE male human fighter 6/rogue 3), a man with an eye for extortion, blackmail, and secrets. His closest supporters and lieutenants are largely arcanists and priests of dark gods. One or two of them are said to be darakhul or vampires.

## Kariv Taboos and Superstitions
**Kariv Taboos and Superstitions**

As might be expected of such a mystical people, the Kariv believe in numerous superstitions and taboos. Some of these are based in ancient wisdom, while others are born of rampant superstition. Taboos and superstitions differ among clans, but the following are the most common.

**Black Dogs:** Never look a black dog directly in the eye, for to do so means death. When a Kariv wishes ill on another, he drapes the pelt of a black dog near his sleeping target or nails one to his target’s wagon. Kariv believe that wicked people are dragged to hell by Old Gnash, an immense black dog who feasts on souls.

**Bloodsworn Oaths:** Words are meaningless, but when precious Kariv blood is spilled as part of an oath, the oath must never be broken or else that Kariv is forever cast out from the clan. Further, the one who kept the oath is honor-bound to slay the oathbreaker.

**Clan Horses:** Clans treat their horses as valued brothers and sisters and never intentionally place them in harm’s way. Allowing a horse to die or face injury without attempting to intervene or—worse—to save themselves from death or injury subjects the Kariv’s entire family to death or identical injury, as decided by the clan.

**Dead Bodies:** Corpses are unclean and must never be touched with bare flesh.

**Rover’s Burden:** This ancient code requires the Kariv to heal, care for, feed, or take in anyone found on the road who needs help, even if that person is an enemy to the Kariv. Injured enemies found on the road must be tended to until well, and then challenged honorably.

## Curse of the Kariv
**Curse of the Kariv**

The Wander Curse, the bane of the Kariv, is a burden they seem to bear lightly: after all, are they not beautiful dancers? Does not their laughter echo loudly off the walls of lesser, settled folk? Are they not the cleverest of horse-traders, and the boldest of lovers? Surely it is so!

And yet, when the fires die down to embers and the shadows close in, the Kariv show their dark side. They drink and whore and gamble as much as any, the women as much as the men. They take chances that invariably lead to trouble; they cheat and lie to the Gadscho, their term for any who are not Kariv. And before the seasons turn, no matter how sweet the pastures or how warm the feather beds of a friendly hosttown, they move on.

The Kariv travel because they must. Their curse is one from the fey and the Green Gods, some say, the result of a Kariv king’s betrayal of an oath to the gods. Or perhaps it is the result of a bad bargain struck with Baba Yaga—storytellers disagree on the details. What is crystal clear is that Kariv men and women who do not pull up stakes and move at least a few day’s ride every few months grow infertile and their line ends. The fortunetelling families cannot abide the thought. The proud, doting Kariv fathers and strict mothers have no patience for such a fate. And so they live on the road.

It’s unclear whether any Kariv can lift the curse, and whether they would stop wandering if they did. Travel is part of who they are, and many enjoy the yearly round from one hamlet to the next, through the summer trade fairs and horse sales, to the winter lager and the spring foaling at the same place. The oldest Kariv sometimes stop and settle down for a marriage, for a title, or for some other reason. But they never found a lineage once they do, and those whose wagons have stopped are shunned by those who still pull the vardos ever onward.

## Kariv Spells
**Kariv Spells**

Kariv magic comes in many surprising forms. These spells are a part of the inheritance of the Kariv, and rarely shared outside the circle of their wagons.

### Crone's Grasp
**Crone’s Grasp**

Evocation (force)

**Level:** Sorcerer 7, Oracle 7, Witch 7, Wizard 7

**BoXM:** Wizard 14

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Components:** V, S, F (an item once owned by a hag)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One door or chest

**Duration:** Two rounds/level

**Saving Throw:** None and Will negates; see text

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design 92)

Thieves and uninvited guests who try to pick or force the door of a Kariv wagon learn the hard way that you don’t invade the gypsies’ privacy that easily. Whenever a creature makes a Disable Device check or attempts to break a door or container protected by a *crone’s grasp* spell, the ghostly form of an old woman emerges from the panel and tries to seize the culprit.

Once triggered the apparition lasts for 2 rounds per caster level and can go away from the protected object for as far as 50 feet per caster level. The crone appears to be deceptively weak but is in fact strong and fast (40 feet speed) and can try to grapple the miscreant once per round. This attack doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity and the crone cannot be affected by weapons but can be dispelled. The CMB and CMD for the grapple checks use the caster’s level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +5 bonus for the Strength of a hag.

A creature grabbed by the ghostly crone can attempt to escape with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. If the thief or vandal is ever grappled a link is automatically created between the evocation and the spellcaster who created it. This allows Kariv witch to read the subject’s mind as per the *detect thoughts* spell (Will negates). This lasts for as long as the crone holds the subject.

### Ghost-Ash Wagon
**Ghost-Ash Wagon**

Necromancy

**Level:** Cleric 4, Sorcerer 5, Witch 4, Wizard 5

**BoXM:** Cleric 8, Wizard 10

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a wagon burned in a funeral rite)

**Range:** Touch

**Targets:** See text

**Duration:** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw:** Will partial (fear effect)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design 92)

One of the funeral rites of the Kariv requires burning the deceased’s wagon and belongings after the owners’ death (jewelry, china and money go to the family beforehand). Some witches use ashes taken from such pyres to create a ghost-ash wagon, which is placed among the other vehicles of a caravan.

Any non-Kariv approaching within 30 feet of this ghostly wagon is struck by a *fear* spell of the caster’s level. If the characters overcome this initial effect and enter the ghost ash wagon they are confronted by the five burning skeletons that hide inside (see PF Bestiary for skeleton statistics); the spellcaster can command these skeletons as a free action.

A ghost ash wagon can be drawn by a phantom steed or by an undead steed, common horses are too terrified to do so.
