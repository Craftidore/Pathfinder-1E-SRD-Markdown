# Stout (Trait)
## Overview
**Stout**

You are heavy for your race.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Strength checks to avoid being bull rushed or overrun.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Overweight characters are often bullied, so those with this trait might be shy, or they might be very defensive when faced with such situations. Some turn to humor to defuse such situations, while others become bitter.
