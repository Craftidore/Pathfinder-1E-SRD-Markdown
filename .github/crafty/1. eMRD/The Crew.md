# The Crew
## Overview
No ship can cast off from harbor without being well crewed. A good and experienced crew can make all the difference between life and death in combat or when pitted against the most dreadful of storms, regardless of the relative ability of their captain. These may be men who have served their entire life on board a ship in one way or another. However, there are also many green crews, those comprised of men setting sail for the very first time. Often hired or press-ganged by merchants seeking to spend as little as possible to safeguard their profits, or by navies eager to bolster their ranks, such crews can be as much a menace to themselves as anyone else sailing in the high seas. Incompetence and mutiny soon become rife on long voyages – the wise captain will always make sure he has crewmen on his ship that can readily match his own abilities. The crew roster is used to record the details and abilities of the crew onboard every ship. This sheet allows players and Games Masters alike to judge the effectiveness of any shipʼs crew at a glance, and greatly aids combat resolution during the ship-to-ship combat and boarding actions. 

As can be readily seen, the crew roster has much in common with the monster entries of the Bestiary, and you will notice the rules for crew combatare similar in many respects to the normal combat rules in the D20 System.

**Class and Level**

Crew class is determined by simple majority – if a ship has 3 wizards and 27 fighters as its crew, then the crew class is listed as fighter. The level of any crew is formed by the average of every member of that crew, rounded down.

**Crew Size**

This is simply a record of how many members are in a shipʼs crew.

**Crew Wounds**

Crew wounds are used to measure the damage a crew may sustain in combat before being wiped out. This is determined by combining the hit points of every crew member, and then dividing the total by 10. Player characters in a crew do not add to this total—and only those NPCs who take actions as part of the mass of crew should be included. 

**Attacks, Damage, And AC**

These are determined by simple majority. The weapons and armor that the majority of the crew carry are assumed to be carried by all for the purposes of the crew roster. The majority is also used to determine base attack bonus and any modifiers to attack, damage and AC.

Saves

Once again, the saving throws of the majority of the crew are noted down on the Crew Roster.

**Seamanship**

This is the average of [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) skill modifier of the crew. Total the skill modifier of every crew member, then divide it by crew size, and round down. 

This method allows those with greater knowledge of the sea to impart their wisdom to other members far less experienced, even when in the grip of a storm or the heat of battle.

**Feats**

Feats are only ever listed on the crew roster when the majority of the crew possess the same feat or feats. The use of feats in crew combat is detailed in the combat chapter.

**Crew Quality**

This is an overall rating of the crew as a whole, used for morale determination, among other things. The quality of the crew is determined by the Seamanship rating (see above), modified by the abilities of the captain and command crew, as follows: 


| **Circumstance** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Lax Discipline | -1 |
| Firm Discipline | +1 |
| Brutal Discipline | -1 |
| Captain has [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]] feat | +2 |
| Officers have [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]] feat | +1 |
| |  |
| **Adjusted** | **Crew** |
| **Seamanship** | **Quality** |
| 0-2 | Rabble |
| 3-4 | Poor |
| 5-8 | Average |
| 9-12 | Superior |
| 13+ | Expert <br>(Crack Crew) |

The crew roster is used as a matter of convenience throughout these rules, from handling a ship in the middle of a vicious gale to recording casualties in combat. There are many circumstances in a game where a Gamemaster will prefer to use standard rules from the PHB to resolve combat and skill checks – the crew roster is used when large numbers of the crew perform the same task at the same time.
