# Savage Barbarian (Archetype)
## Overview
Some barbarians are truly savage, having little training in modern arms. These savage barbarians learn to avoid blows and toughen up their skin. A savage barbarian has the following class features.

**Naked Courage (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every six levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Natural Toughness (Ex)**: At 7th level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels beyond 7th. This ability replaces damage reduction.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the savage barbarian archetype: f lesh wound, guarded stance\*, increased damage reduction\*, intimidating glare\*, rolling dodge\*, superstition\*, and terrifying howl\*.
