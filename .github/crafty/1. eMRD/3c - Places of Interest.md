## Overview
**Places of Interest**

**The Arcane Collegium**

Composed of two small courtyards and a dozen two-story buildings (with a mix of gray and yellow stucco and red tile rooftops) housing masters, apprentices, alchemists (near the river), and clockwork servants, the Arcane Collegium rarely opens its doors to outsiders.

The most common means of entrance are the Steam Gate that leads into Arcane Square, across from the Hedgehog tavern, and the Water Gate at the docks, which uses a set of stairs down the embankment to a single pier. The stairs are slippery and guards and other traps make them impassable to unwelcome guests.

Even when the Steam Gate does open, those visitors admitted are most often hired help, agents of the Collegium, or someone seeking to offer great treasures in exchange for the Arcane Collegium’s wisdom, rather than townsfolk with a casual interest. The interior includes the two courtyards and buildings, as well as a black tower, the large gray hall of the summoners, underground labs, and sturdy alchemical bunkers. All of the buildings have tarnished silver runes inscribed along the eaves, gates, and windows.

The grounds are protected by clockwork traps, gargoyles, and even undead under the control of the masters of the Collegium. Those masters are Guildmaster Clockwork Mage Orlando (CN male human wizard 14/expert 2); Master Necromancer Konrad von Eberfeld (NE male human wizard 6/fighter 1/eldritch knight 6); Master Illusionist Ariella Scarpetti (N female human illusionist 9); and Master Diviner Rudwin Whitstone (N male dwarf sorcerer 8).

The positions of Master Summoner and Master of Stars and Shadows are currently vacant and were last held by Linnea Thorn and Sariel of Morgau, respectively. Mistress Thorn was recently murdered, and Master Sariel retired to the mountains.

The Collegium has roughly two dozen apprentices studying under the masters, including kobolds, tieflings, dwarves, and humans. The staff numbers about 40 and includes alchemists, scribes, maids, cooks, a chamberlain, language tutors, arcane tutors, clockworkers, a priest of the Gear Goddess, a few clockwork scullions, and even a falconer from Siwal named Kaashif al-Rashid.

**The Old Stross Public Bathhouse**

The Old Stross Public Bathhouse lies at the heart of Zobeck. Located just south of Crown Square and facing the Founders’ Statues at the tip of the Crown Spike, the baths once served only the aristocracy. After the Revolt, access to the spring waters was opened to the general population. This is one of the few places remaining in Zobeck where one can see the lost extravagance of the deposed regime, but the people appreciate it as a reminder and a monument. The Old Stross Public Bathhouse is now a shared social space dedicated to the triumph of the Revolt. Considered both neutral ground and a sanctuary, the baths permit no weapons or armor inside except those carried by the Watch on official business. Given that, it’s not unusual to find trade factors soaking alongside gang lords and chatting up guildmasters in a relaxed and casual environment at any hour of the day or night.

The bathhouse has two floors. The street level houses the entrance, while the bulk of the structure lies below ground, sprawling out beneath the wide street before it. The underground space consists of several chambers containing mineral baths, plunge pools, a massage parlor, several lounging areas, and a gymnasium.

**The Temple of Celestial Dawn**

Sometimes called the Dawn Temple, this edifice to Lada is one of two temples to the goddess in the city. Built from a pink stone that glows in early morning light, this temple is a popular place because its priests use their healing power on any who ask, not only those who pay.

Each morning, the line of petitioners stretches along the street leading to the temple. As soon as dawn breaks, the temple doors open and the sick and injured proceed into the heady aroma of incense and beeswax candles for cures, or at least painkilling medicaments.

The temple’s interior lives up to the goddess’ name, since gold covers all of its statues and most of its pillars. Some stories claim the statues are solid gold, but other rumors hold that most of the golden statues are illusions, and made of nothing more than simple stone or wood.

The temple is considered a holy site in Zobeck, since the goddess’ avatar has appeared here on several occasions, and that is one of the reasons the farmers favor it.

**The Wheatsheaf**

A favorite smuggler’s tavern and a second home to anyone who needs a thug now and again, the Wheatsheaf serves up strong beer and spicy food nightly along with a healthy side of information, especially from the Redcloaks kobold gang or the Cloven Nine’s infernal gangsters (see the *Zobeck Gazetteer*). The collection of rogues, sharpers, cultists, assassins, fences, and cold-eyed hard cases that drinks at the Wheatsheaf is everchanging but always dangerous, alert, and looking for an opening.

Despite its clientele and infernal connections, the Wheatsheaf remains a remarkably nonviolent place most of the time. The tavern provides a secure place to conduct public and private business or simply have a meal, and that security will end if people need to be alert for a knife in the back or the appearance of the Watch. When violence starts at the Wheatsheaf, it’s never a simple brawl—it’s murder. The killer needs to have powerful friends or excellent protection, however, since the most powerful gangsters in Zobeck prefer that the Wheatsheaf continues to operate under a flag of truce, and they look askance on anyone threatening that peace.
