# Divine Feats
## Overview
In keeping with the idea of expanding the options of all classes, the feats in this category share characteristics that make them unavailable to single-class fi ghters. First, they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn or rebuke undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 3rd level or higher, and a member of any prestige class or any creature that has that ability.

Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use of a divine feat costs a character a minimum of one turn or rebuke attempt from her number of attempts each day. If you don’t have any turn or rebuke attempts left, you can’t use a divine feat. Turning or rebuking undead is a standard action (unless you have a special ability that says otherwise). These feats often take a standard action to activate, but may require other types of actions as specifi ed. Regardless, you may activate only one divine feat (or use the ability to turn or rebuke undead once) per round, though overlapping durations may allow you the benefits of more than one divine feat at a time.

Third, turning or rebuking undead is a supernatural ability and a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity and counts as an attack. Activating a divine feat is also a supernatural ability and does not provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise specifi ed in the feat description. Activating a divine feat is not considered an attack unless the feat’s activation could be the direct cause of damage to a target. Improved Smiting, for example, adds 1d6 points of damage to a smite attack, but does not directly deal damage to an opponent upon its activation.

It is not itself an attack. Paladins in particular should consider these feats. Because the paladin’s turning ability remains behind the cleric’s throughout the paladin’s career, a paladin who chooses one or two divine feats has more options than just turning undead.
