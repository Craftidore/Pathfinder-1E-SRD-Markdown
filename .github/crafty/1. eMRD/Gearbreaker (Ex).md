# Gearbreaker (Ex)
## Overview
*Gearbreaker (Ex):* Once per round while raging, whenever the barbarian makes an attack against a construct, she can ignore an amount of that construct’s hardness equal to her barbarian level. This ability must be used before the attack roll is made. A barbarian must have the smasher rage power (Advanced Player’s Guide 76) before selecting this rage power. This power stacks with hard hitter.
