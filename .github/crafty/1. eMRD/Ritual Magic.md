# Ritual Magic
## Overview
Rituals, like spells, are a way of accessing and controlling powerful magic in order to manifest a specific effect. Rituals, however, tend to be more powerful than spells, and also more tricky to cast. Rituals do not come automatically to spellcasters, but rather casting rituals is a specific skill that must be mastered in addition to the basic study in arcane or divine power.

Ritualists may cast as many rituals as they have time and resources for. Unlike spells, there is no specific number of rituals that they can cast per day. Rather, they are limited by time and the availability of material components. Moreover, in order to cast a ritual a ritualist must usually possess the proper ritual scroll. Ritual scrolls are valuable magical items. They provide a detailed list of instructions for casting a specific ritual, and are not consumed in the casting of rituals. The casting of rituals is so complex that it is not ordinarily possible to cast a ritual from memory alone, without the benefit of the ritual scroll (see Memorizing Rituals below).

Rituals further differ from spells in that they are not dependent in any way upon the power of the caster. The caster level has no direct impact on the casting of rituals. This also means that any ritualist may attempt to cast any ritual to which they have access, regardless of power. The ritual casting skill of the ritualist, however, does determine the allimportant probability of success or failure. More powerful rituals tend to be more difficult to complete successfully. Thus, even though a person with minimal ritual casting skill may attempt to cast a powerful ritual, the likelihood of success would be small.

The casting of rituals is limited not only by their difficulty, but also by their cost and the danger that they pose. Unlike spells, the successful casting of rituals is never guaranteed. The more powerful the ritual, the greater the chance of failure, at the cost of lost time and expensive material components. Every ritual also poses a potential risk to both the caster and the subjects. A failed ritual may be a critical failure, in which case the ritual not only fails, but the magical energy is released in an unpredictable and harmful way. It is not uncommon for ritual failures to cost the life of the ritualist, which is why most ritualists are not eager to cast powerful rituals often.

Even successful rituals may have unpredictable results. A ritual that is just barely successful may be flawed, in which case the effect of the ritual will be altered or there will be an unforeseen side effect. Occasionally a ritual will be a critical success, in which case it succeeds beyond expectation. In such cases the power of the ritual is enhanced in some fashion, or the ritualist gains an unforeseen boon of some type.

## Ritual Skills
**Ritual Skills**

Casting rituals is a skill. Below are described the Arcane Ritual and Divine Ritual skills.

**Arcane Ritual (Int; Trained only: Wizard, Sorcerer only)**

Use this skill to cast arcane rituals. In order to cast an arcane ritual you must also possess the ritual scroll for the specific ritual you wish to cast or you must have the ritual memorized. The ritual scroll will contain information on the casting of the ritual, including casting time, effects, and components, etc. All arcane rituals use rare and expensive material components that are consumed in the casting.

**Check:** Arcane rituals are a particularly tricky and difficult form of magic to wield. For this reason there is no guarantee of success when you cast an arcane ritual. The outcome of rituals is also more variable than for most spells. Once the casting of the ritual is complete, you must make a skill check against the DC of the ritual to see if the casting was successful.

**Special:** Wizards that specialize in one school of magic are much better at casting rituals within their chosen school. For them, the DC of rituals within their chosen schools is reduced by 2 and the flaw is reduced by 1 to a minimum of 0. However, they cannot cast rituals from their prohibited schools.

**Divine Ritual** **(Wis; Trained only: Cleric, Druid only)**

Use this skill to cast divine rituals. In order to cast a divine ritual you must also possess the ritual scroll for the specific ritual you wish to cast or you must have the ritual memorized. The ritual scroll will contain information on the casting of the ritual, including casting time, effects, and components, etc. All divine rituals use rare and expensive material components that are consumed in the casting.

A divine ritual may be designated as “Cleric,” in which case it can be attempted by any cleric and is referred to as an open cleric ritual. Alternatively it may be designated with a list of domains, in which case it is referred to as a closed cleric ritual, and can only be cast by clerics of a deity with one of the domains listed. Clerics without a specific deity may only cast closed rituals from domains they possess. A divine ritual may also be designated as “Druid,” in which case it may be cast by any druid.

**Check:** Divine rituals usually draw the attention of the gods, including those who may wish to interfere with its casting or effects. For this reason there is no guarantee of success when you cast a divine ritual. The outcome of rituals is also more variable than for most spells. Once the casting of the ritual is complete, you must make a skill check against the DC of the ritual to see if the casting was successful.

## Casting a Ritual
**Casting a Ritual**

Casting a ritual requires the caster to perform a complex set of incantations and gestures, perhaps requiring moving over a wide area, as well as the use of material components or a focus. The caster must remain conscious during the complete casting of the ritual. For rituals that possess a verbal component the caster must be able to speak, and for those that require a somatic component the caster must be unrestrained and have full use of her limbs. Metamagic feats or other powers which give casters the ability to cast spells silently or without moving do not apply to rituals in any way. Minor interruptions of the ritual do not automatically cause it to fail, however any disturbance that would ordinarily require a Concentration check in order to successfully cast a spell also requires a Concentration check (DC equal to the DC of the ritual) for casting a ritual. Failure of this check does not mean that the ritual has failed, but it does result in a cumulative -2 penalty to the ritual skill check. Interruptions do not delay the casting time of a ritual, which must proceed continuously until completed. The DC of a skill check in Arcane Ritual or Divine Ritual is the DC of the ritual, which is listed in the description of the specific ritual. Individual rituals may also detail specific conditions that will affect the DC of the ritual. Furthermore, there are a number of situational modifiers detailed in tables 1-1 and 1-2 below. Rolling the DC or higher indicates a success. You cannot “take 20” when casting a ritual. Although rolling a natural 1 is always a failure, rolling a natural 20 is not an automatic success.

If a natural 20 is rolled and this results in a success without flaw, then you must make another roll to check for critical success. If this second roll results in a success (flawed or normal) then the ritual is deemed a critical success. Conversely, if the ritual skill check roll is a natural 1 or if the ritual skill check is failed by more than 10, then you must make another roll to check for critical failure. If this second roll results in a failure the ritual is deemed a critical failure. The outcome of a critical success or critical failure is detailed in the description of each ritual, which may give a specific result or may refer to the Arcane or Divine Ritual Critical Success or Failure tables (see below). Some rituals indicate a specific effect for critical success or failure and additionally indicate to roll on the table, in which case both the specified and the random effects take place.

All rituals also have a property known as “Flaw,” which represents the probability that even if successful the ritual will not work quite as planned. If a ritual succeeds by a number which is equal to or less than the flaw rating of the ritual, then the ritual has succeeded but is flawed and the GM should consult the Arcane/Divine Ritual Flaw table. The chance of flawing a ritual never disappears, regardless of the modifier to the skill check. For example, a ritualist with 16 ranks in Arcane Ritual and +8 total modifiers will add 24 to the d20 roll. If casting a DC 20, Flaw 2 ritual he will fail only on a 1 (which is still a critical failure threat). One might think that he has no chance of flawing, since even a roll of 2 succeeds by 6. However, the flaw chance does not disappear. Therefore, the ritual will fail on a 1, flaw on a 2 or 3, and succeed normally on a 4 or greater on the d20 roll.

## Spellcraft Skill and Rituals
**Spellcraft Skill and Rituals**

It is possible to use the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill to discern the nature of a ritual as it is being cast or one that is in place. You must witness a ritual being cast for one full minute before you can make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 25), with no retry. It takes 10 minutes of examination to identify a ritual that is in place (DC 30), again with no retry. Having five or more ranks in the appropriate ritual skill (Divine or Arcane, depending on the ritual being examined) gives a +2 synergy bonus to skill checks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] for examining rituals. Also the Ritual Mastery feats (Arcane or Divine as appropriate) add their +2 bonus to skill checks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] for rituals.

## Ritual Scrolls
**Ritual Scrolls**

Ritual scrolls are magical items containing a detailed set of instructions for casting a specific ritual. They are physically larger than spell scrolls (about 11 inches wide and 17 inches long, or twice as large as a single spell scroll). Although they are made of fine vellum or parchment, they are toughened by the magic they contain. Therefore, unlike spell scrolls, they cannot be destroyed by ordinary means. They will not burn in normal fire, nor can they be torn easily (20 hit points, hardness of 20 and a break DC of 60). They can be disintegrated, and powerful spells of destruction may destroy a ritual scroll. However, ritual scrolls get a saving throw like all magic items. For purposes of saving throws, the caster level of ritual scrolls is always 16. Therefore the saving throw bonus equals +10 (half of the caster level +2).

Ritual scrolls are not consumed in the casting of rituals, and therefore they function as a ritual focus rather than a material component or a spell scroll. They are also difficult and expensive to create (see Scribe Arcane/Divine Ritual Scroll feats). The writing on ritual scrolls is impossible to decipher by anyone except an appropriate ritualist. A *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell will reveal only the name and type of a ritual scroll. Like spell scrolls, ritual scrolls may contain magical symbols which contain magical traps, such as a *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]*.

Ritual scrolls should be treated as rare and powerful magic items. How common they are will vary greatly depending on the availability of powerful magic in general, and rituals in particular, in a campaign. Churches and druid covens will see divine ritual scrolls as a resource of their faith, and will dispense rituals primarily to the faithful. Wizards and sorcerers might desire to keep a ritual scroll as a resource of their guild, or perhaps the kingdom they serve, and would be reluctant to sell them. They may sell ritual castings, in which case selling a ritual scroll would just serve to create competition. Only in campaign settings where magic is very abundant and sold freely does it make sense to have ritual scrolls for sale on a regular basis. There is therefore no standard market value for ritual scrolls. Pricing will tend to be very individual, and driven by the plot of a campaign. As a rule of thumb, however, in most medium to high magic campaigns ritual scrolls should be valued at no less than 1,000 gp per DC of the ritual.

For rituals that have both arcane and divine types, there will be separate arcane and divine ritual scrolls. Therefore, a cleric cannot cast a ritual from an arcane ritual scroll even if the specific ritual is one that is accessible to clerics. For divine rituals that are accessible to both clerics and druids, however, the same divine ritual scroll can be used by both.

## Korba, Soul Gems and Ritual Material Components
**Korba, Soul Gems and other Ritual Material Components**

When including rituals in your campaign, there are three options for how to handle material components. Rituals have the same type of component requirements as do spells. However, in addition they require a special component that is used to both help the ritualist focus the great deal of power that rituals require, and to provide some of the magical power as well. One option is for this special component to be the same for all rituals. In this case, the special component is known as korba. Another option is that all of the material components required are rare and specific to the ritual, and must be assembled together by the caster before the ritual can begin. The third option is a combination of the two, where korba exists as a universal ritual material component that can substitute for some or all other rare and exotic components.

Korba (or its equivalent) is completely consumed in the casting of rituals. The korba is burned at the very beginning of the casting time of a ritual, so if the ritual is stopped or abandoned before it is completed, the korba is still lost.

**Option 1: Korba and Soul Gems**

Korba is a fine silvery powder that allows ritualists to focus the powerful energies necessary to cast a ritual. The more powerful a ritual is, the greater the amount of korba that is needed. Korba is typically stored in small packets, referred to as drams. A dram of korba is a carefully measured amount (2 ounces), and rituals are designed to use a certain number of drams of korba. The base price for korba is typically 2,000 gp per dram, but this will vary greatly depending on availability in your campaign.

In campaigns where korba is the universal component for all rituals, korba becomes a very important commodity. GM’s must carefully consider what the source and distribution of korba is in their campaign world. Nations, churches, guilds, and other powerful entities will go to great lengths to secure their own supply of korba, and will carefully monitor the distribution of korba to their members. In chaotic environments, battles and wars will be frequently fought over supplies of korba, and warlords will value their cache of korba more than even their pile of gold. In lawful environments, the acquisition, possession, and use of korba may be strictly regulated, even taxed.

It is recommended that the source of korba be obscure. Again, except in high magic campaigns where magic flows very freely, it is best if the ultimate source of korba is not generally known. The source could be ancient – meaning that an ancient and wiser race made all of the korba that exists, and therefore the only source of korba is in ancient caches. Korba may also be a gift from the gods, a way of sharing a bit of their power with mortals.

In campaigns where korba is more plentiful it could be a naturally occurring substance, mined out of the earth like gold, or a complicated alchemical mixture that requires months of hard labor to produce, and the secret of which is carefully guarded by the entities that possess it. In high magic campaigns, korba may be an alchemical substance, available at any corner alchemy shop.

Korba can become an exciting plot element in your campaign world. Perhaps all the world’s korba comes from a single meteorite impact. Or perhaps there is one location in the world where korba can be mined, with the forces of the world constantly fighting over access. Or the alchemical recipe for korba can be a well kept secret, owned by a conglomerate of rich and powerful merchants who totally control its sale and distribution – until an adventurous party seeks to steal the recipe.

As a GM, you may decide to restrict korba so that it is very rare if not nearly impossible to acquire. As an alternative, soul gems may be used in the place of korba. Each dram of korba that would be used in a ritual may be replaced by the equivalent of 1,000 xp in soul gems.

**Option 2: Rare Materials**

Alternatively, GM’s may wish to eliminate the concept of korba from their campaign. The tables below list substances that may be found in any campaign world that can be used as a substitute for korba in the powering of rituals. In order to keep rituals balanced, the items that substitute for korba should be either as expensive as korba or rare and difficult to obtain. The tables below are organized by school of magic as only certain materials can be used to power certain rituals. For rituals whose indicated school is “Universal,” components from any school can be used. Each item is given a suggested value of how many drams of korba the material replaces. As all of the rituals listed in this book are given a specific cost in drams of korba, we recommend that GM’s modify this list to reflect the state of their campaign world. Obviously, basalt would be much more common on a volcanic world than on an oceanic planet full of warring island nations, so basalt should not be as valuable in the casting of rituals there. Also, GM’s may wish to add rare or valuable items particular to their campaign world. Finally, upon introducing a specific ritual to your campaign, you may decide to specify certain unique components that work for, or are necessary for, the casting of that ritual in your world.

**Option 3: A Combination**

A GM may like the concept of korba, but not wish to add another mainstream commodity to their world’s economy. They will instead treat it as a valued treasure rather than a necessary resource. In a world such as this, korba is still used but in conjunction with the rare materials listed in the korba substitute tables. GM’s may decide that rituals require at least 1 dram of korba, or half the korba listed, as a minimum and can then supplement that with rare materials. Conversely, the rare materials can be used exclusively but are less potent than listed, requiring twice or even four times the amount listed on the table, making korba highly sought after by ritualists that do not want to transport wagon-loads of exotic and expensive items.

## Ritual Circles
**Ritual Circles**

Ritualists may attempt to enhance their ritual casting by first drawing a ritual circle. The circle is drawn at the spot where the ritual casting is going to be started, and must be large enough to encircle the ritual caster, the ritual assistants or supporters, and all of the components and focuses necessary for the ritual. There are five different types of ritual circles:

- Enhancing Circle: provides a bonus to the ritual casting roll
- Stabilizing Circle: reduces the chance of a flawed ritual
- Empowering Circle: reduces the korba cost by drawing more power from the existing components
- Focusing Circle: reduces the risk of critical failure
- Glorifying Circle: increases the chance of critical success

Each ritual circle is designed to be one of the listed types for a specific ritual. There are two steps to drawing an effective ritual circle. First the ritualist must make a planning roll, which is a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) skill check with a DC equal to half of the DC of the ritual. This represents the ritualist plotting out and conceptualizing the particular circle they are about to draw. This process not only takes into consideration the specific ritual and the type of circle to be drawn, but also the time and location in which the ritual is to be cast. The season, weather, position of the celestial bodies, and other transitory conditions must all be accounted for. The GM should make this roll in secret, as the ritualist does not know how effective the circle is they have planned. The planning process takes ten minutes per DC of the ritual.

Next is the drawing stage, when the ritualist actually draws the circle they planned. First a batch of special inks, powders and pigments are required, which cost 100 gp per DC of the ritual. Second, the ritualist must make their drawing roll, which is a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill check with a DC equal to the DC of the ritual minus the amount the planning roll was succeeded by. For example, a caster drawing a circle for a DC 30 ritual would first make their planning roll at DC 15. If they rolled a 24, succeeding by 9, the DC for the drawing roll would be 30 – 9, or 21. If the planning roll is failed, the drawing roll does not matter, as no degree of success can execute a flawed plan. Regardless of whether the drawing roll is a success or failure, the drawing material components are used up when the drawing is attempted. The time required is ten minutes per DC of the ritual. If the drawing is successful, the circle can then be used for a single casting of that ritual.

Although a ritual circle can only be used once and then must be redrawn, a successful plan may be reused. However, since the plan for a particular ritual circle is time dependent it becomes less useful with the passage of time. The effective degree of success of a planning roll decreases by one for each day that passes since the planning roll was made. Therefore, in the example above, if the same plan was used again three days later its degree of success would be 6 instead of 9. When this number reaches -1, the planning roll is treated as if it were a failure.

The degree of success of the drawing roll determines the effectiveness of the circle. Therefore, the better a ritual circle is planned, and the more precisely it is constructed, the greater the benefit that will be derived from it. Only the ritualist that planned and drew the circle can use it to full effectiveness. Any other ritualist who attempts to use it must first study the plan for a number of minutes equal to the ritual’s DC, and then succeed at a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill check with a DC equal to half of the DC of the ritual. Even then, the ritualist will only get the minimal benefit possible, regardless of the degree of success of the circle’s drawing.

Consult table 1-16 above to derive the ultimate result of the circle.

## Spells and Rituals
**Spells and Rituals**

The guiding principle for how spells interact with rituals is that all rituals are more powerful than all spells. Unless it is specifically detailed below, or in the description of a specific ritual, it is best to assume that rituals cannot be affected by spells, and ritual effects supercede spell effects when they conflict. Many protective spells, however, will defend against the effects of rituals. Ritual effects that can be blocked by spells are usually detailed in the descriptive text of the ritual. Below are detailed some specific spells and how they affect rituals.

***Dispel magic*, and *greater dispel magic*:** Spells that negate magical effects, such as the two listed, do not affect ritual magic (unless specifically indicated in the descriptive text of the ritual).

***Mage’s disjunction*:** Because of the special nature of this spell it is the one spell that has a chance of affecting some ritual magic. It will not affect permanent effects on creatures, such as Epiphany, or effects of rituals that do not require ongoing magic, such as Change Enchanted Form. However, the spell has a chance of dispelling ongoing ritual effects, such as Sanctify Shrine or Barrier.. A dispel check for *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]]* against a ritual is a caster level check (1d20 +1 per caster level) against a DC of 11 + the DC of the ritual (see ritual descriptions).

***Antimagic field:*** Rituals, although very powerful, are still magic in the ordinary sense. Therefore, some of them are suppressed in the same manner as spells by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. However, the suppression is not automatic. A successful caster level check (1d20 + caster level) must be made against a DC of 5 + the DC of the ritual in order for the magic of the ritual to be suppressed. In addition, permanent ritual effects on creatures are not affected by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. Also, rituals that are intended to be permanent barriers are designed to resist the effects of *antimagic fields*, and therefore are not affected by them. It is not possible, however, to cast a ritual within the area of effect of an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*.

***Wish and miracle***: These most powerful of spells have a chance of affecting rituals. Although they cannot be used to duplicate ritual effects, they can be used to counter the effects of a ritual, or to dispel a ritual entirely. The d% chance of success is 100 – 2x the DC of the target ritual. In general, these spells do not affect rituals with a duration of permanent, unless the ritual affects an individual creature. However, they have no chance of affecting rituals on creatures that are not only permanent but last beyond death and through resurrection. When in doubt, it is best to rule that these spells do not affect a given ritual.

## Adding Rituals to your Campaign
**Adding Rituals to your Campaign**

Rituals can be a fun and exciting addition to the d20 rules for any campaign setting. They offer great possibilities for unique and powerful magical effects and resources, both for players and the GM. Korba, ritual scrolls, and ritual casting for hire should play an important role in the economy of any campaign with rituals. They may also represent an important component of the power and influence of the world’s churches and clerics.

As a GM you can use rituals as key plot elements. For example, the local high priest may send the party on a mission to recover a ritual scroll believed to lie within the ruins of an ancient temple. The ritual scroll may contain a powerful divine ritual that would allow the high priest to protect the town from an imminent attack of demonic forces. Meanwhile, the korba necessary to cast the ritual has been stolen by a local band of thieves and it must be recovered before they use the korba themselves to enchant their pirate ship. Once the ritual scroll and the korba have been recovered, you may have to root out the evil infiltrator from within the high priest’s church before she can sabotage the casting of the ritual. Finally, the high priest must be defended from attacking demons long enough to cast the ritual. This is just one example of how rituals can not only be incorporated into your campaign, but actually provide the main plot line for several adventures.

Rituals in the hands of NPC antagonists are also ready-made adventures. The local coven of evil priests may have successfully cast a Rending ritual, plaguing the local towns and villages with summoned monsters until a group can penetrate their temple and cast a ritual of Cleansing to dispel the evil ritual. As a follow-up to this adventure, the town could ask the players to find and destroy the Rending ritual scroll before it can be used again.

NPC ritualists may also be an important resource for players. Players may travel to the great wizard’s tower because they need him to cast a particular ritual, but what price will the old wizard extract? Or the local high priest may be available to cast Cleansing and supportive rituals on the players, especially if they tithe heavily or are on a mission for the church.

GM’s are encouraged to create their own rituals, tailored for the flavor and plotlines of your campaign. Use the existing rituals as guidelines for power balancing and to get an idea about what rituals can do. When creating a dungeon or wizard’s tower, if you wish to include some unique and interesting magical effects, make the effects the result of rituals. That will help balance the effect (can this wizard have cast such a ritual, and how much korba would he have had to use?), and also provides guidelines for how the players may be able to deal with the effect (should a ritual of Magical Dissipation counter this effect?). Rituals allow you to create mysterious, unexplained effects that the players must investigate, thus giving you additional resources to call upon when creating your campaign.

Player ritualists may also create their own rituals (see Researching Rituals below). Rituals provide a unique avenue to epic power and problem solving for players. If an existing ritual does not serve your purpose, then modify one or create and entirely new ritual. Of course, the GM will always be the final arbiter of what rituals exist and work in his campaign world.

## Balancing Rituals in your Campaign
**Balancing Rituals in your Campaign**

Unlike the daily allotment of spells, there is no inherent limit on how many rituals a character may cast. Rather, the availability of korba or other material components and the availability of ritual scrolls limit the casting of rituals. It is important to balance these resources in your campaign. Korba should be a scarce and precious resource, although not impossible to acquire. NPC’s should not be assumed to have limitless supplies and they should jealously guard their stores like anyone else. Korba as treasure should be rare (like powerful magic items), and therefore will be a treasure that players will greatly appreciate when they come upon it. 2,000 gp per dram of korba is a suggested base price, although this should vary greatly based upon supply and demand in your campaign, and also on the availability of wealth to your players. In short, players should be made to work for their korba, and they should value it as a precious resource that they will want to use wisely and judiciously. If your players start casting rituals the moment they encounter any obstacle or problem, then they probably have too easy access to korba. On the other hand, if korba suddenly becomes harder to acquire, perhaps due to the actions of a person or group that is hoarding it, the GM immediately has another adventure hook for players who have grown to depend on it.

Ritual scrolls are even scarcer than korba. They are as valuable as powerful magic items and are carefully guarded by ritualists as one of their most valued resources. Churches make ritual scrolls available to their clerics, but only given adequate justification. Wizards and sorcerers who cast rituals will almost never willingly part with a ritual scroll. They may be inclined to rent the use of their scroll, but would never sell a scroll they could use except in a desperate situation. Powerful merchants are likely to be the only source for purchasing ritual scrolls, and they will extract a dear price for such valuable wares. Think carefully before you place a ritual scroll in the hands of your players, for they will then have access to that power.

Keeping ritual scrolls scarce and precious can make for interesting plot developments. Imagine if an aging wizard announces that she is retiring and will be selling off her legendary collection of arcane ritual scrolls. Perhaps she will be offering her scrolls only to those who are “worthy.” What intrigue and backstabbing would take place among those who would compete for the chance to obtain some of her ritual scrolls?

Korba and rituals should be something that the players are grateful to find as treasure. Even if there are no ritualists amongst the party members, both korba and rituals can be sold to those that can use them for significant amounts of coin and favor.

## Memorizing Rituals
**Memorizing Rituals**

Actual memorization of a ritual requires a tremendous amount of time and effort. Ritualists may memorize an arcane or divine ritual only through the expenditure of XP. It will cost you 100 XP and require one day of study for each DC of the ritual to be memorized (for those with variable DC use the base or minimum DC). A ritual of DC 20, therefore, will cost 2,000 XP and will take 20 consecutive days of effort. You must have access to the appropriate ritual scroll for this entire period of time. If this period of time is interrupted then the XP is not lost, but the ritual is not memorized and the process must be started again from the beginning.

## Researching Original Rituals
**Researching Original Rituals**

Players may wish to research original rituals, which they can do in a way very similar to the researching of new spells (*Core Rulebook II* 42). Ritual research requires access to a well-stocked library with many rare and magical tomes. This research takes a number of weeks equal to the DC of the ritual to be researched minus 10, and costs 1,000 gp per week of research. Thus a DC 25 ritual takes 15 weeks and costs 15,000 gp to research. At the end of this time a skill check is made with the appropriate ritual skill - Arcane Ritual or Divine Ritual with a DC = DC of the ritual being researched (for rituals with variable DC’s use the maximum DC or, if there is no set maximum, the base DC +10). For this skill check situational modifiers for casting rituals do not count (i.e. being in a nexus or shrine), only ranks + ability modifier + any metamagic feats that apply. For this skill check, 5 or more ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] provides a +2 synergy bonus. Also, you may enhance your research by spending more time than the minimum required. For each extra week and 1,000 gp spent you gain a +1 to the skill check roll for researching a ritual, to a maximum of +10.

If the skill check fails, then the character must go through the research again in order to make another skill check roll. If the skill check succeeds then the GM must decide whether or not the ritual is viable. The ritual being viable means that you wish to have the ritual in your campaign, that it is balanced and appropriate to the ritual type, and does not violate any rules of your campaign. If the ritual is not viable then the character will learn this only after successful research. As the GM, you can then decide whether the research yielded a modified ritual – as determined by you, or failed entirely.

If the ritual is viable and the character makes his skill check, then he has successfully researched a new ritual. He must then create a ritual scroll in order to record the ritual (see Scribe Arcane/Divine Ritual Scroll feats). Whether or not he is willing and able to scribe the scroll, he also has the option of memorizing the ritual he has just researched. Memorization will cost the usual 100 XP per DC of the ritual. If he does choose to memorize the ritual he can be assumed to have completed memorization at the completion of successfully researching the ritual. If he wishes to create a scroll, he must begin scroll creation immediately following completion of the research.

**Table 1-1: Situational Modifiers to the Arcane Ritual skill check**


-tx-
| **Condition** | **Bonus/Penalty** |
|---|---|
| Ritual Assistant \* | special |
| Ritual Sabotage \*\* | special |
| Cast in Nexus | +1 |
| Cast in Greater Nexus | +2 |
| Take damage during casting | -2, cumulative \*\*\* |
| \* A ritual assistant is another individual with the arcane ritual skill who aids in the casting of the ritual. If the assistant ceases to participate, for any reason, before the completion of the ritual, then the bonus does not occur and a –2 penalty is incurred instead. The bonus is equal to the number of ranks your assistant has in Arcane Ritual (up to half of your total ranks) divided by two. For example, if you have 12 ranks in Arcane Ritual then an assistant with 6 or more ranks in Arcane Ritual will provide you with a +3 bonus. ||
| \*\* Ritual sabotage occurs when the ritual assistant secretly works against the casting of the ritual. In so doing the saboteur causes a circumstance penalty to the Arcane Ritual skill check equal to the number of ranks the saboteur has in Arcane Ritual. The ritualist is not capable of detecting the sabotage because of the concentration necessary to cast the ritual. If an onlooker, however, has the Arcane Ritual skill and suspects sabotage he may attempt to detect it. The onlooker and the saboteur roll an opposed skill check and compare their rolls, adding their ranks in Arcane Ritual, intelligence bonus, and +2 for Arcane Ritual Mastery. If the onlooker beats the saboteur then he has detected the sabotage. If the saboteur is stopped from participating in the ritual before the completion of the ritual, then the penalty is halved. ||
| \*\*\* Each time an arcane ritualist takes damage during the casting of a ritual, she must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + amount of damage taken) or suffer a -2 cumulative penalty to the Arcane Ritual skill check for that ritual. ||

**Table 1-2: Situational Modifiers to the Divine Ritual skill check**


-tx-
| **Condition** | **Bonus/Penalty** |
|---|---|
| Ritual Support \* | +1, cumulative, max +6 |
| Ritual Resistance \*\* | -3, cumulative |
| Cast in shrine to your god (Cleric) | +1 |
| Cast on hallowed ground or in druid Circle (Druid) | +1 |
| Cast in temple to your god (Cleric) | +2 |
| Cast in greater druid circle (Druid) | +2 |
| Cast in cathedral to your god (Cleric) | +4 |
| Take damage during casting | -2, cumulative \*\*\* |
| \* A ritual supporter is any character that follows the same deity as the ritualist and aids in the casting of the ritual by lending their faith in support. This applies both to the casting of open and closed rituals. For druids, any other druid of the same alignment may act as a ritual supporter. Unlike arcane ritual assistants, more than one supporter can lend their aid to the casting of a single ritual. If a supporter ceases to participate, for any reason, before the completion of the ritual, then the +1 bonus does not occur, but there is no penalty. The GM may also judge that any given supporter’s faith is insufficient to support the ritual. ||
| \*\* Ritual resistance occurs when a ritual supporter secretly works against the casting of the ritual. The ritualist is not capable of detecting the resistance because of the concentration necessary to cast the ritual. There is also no overt action that might give the resister away to an onlooker. If the resister is stopped from participating in the ritual before the completion of the ritual, then the –3 penalty is reduced to a –1 penalty. Like ritual support, ritual resistance is a cumulative effect, therefore if there are three participants secretly resisting the ritual the total penalty is –9. ||
| \*\*\* Each time a divine ritualist takes damage during the casting of a ritual, she must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + amount of damage taken) or suffer a -2 cumulative penalty to the Divine Ritual skill check for that ritual. ||
