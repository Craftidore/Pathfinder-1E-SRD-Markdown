# Heritage Feats
## Overview
**Heritage Feats**

A heritage feat represents a specific ancestry of the character. The player and the DM are encouraged to devise a background story explaining the character's heritage, though the exact source of the ancestral link isn't crucial to the feat's operation (and might remain a mystery to the character).

A character can select a heritage feat at any level. Choosing a heritage feat after 1st level indicates that the ancestral power of the character is only now manifesting itself.

Once a character selects a heritage feat, he can't select another heritage feat unless it has his first heritage feat as a prerequisite. For instance, a character who selects Fey Heritage can't also take Fiendish Heritage, but he could select additional heritage feats that have Fey Heritage as a prerequisite (such as Fey Legacy).
