# Hole of Hiding (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hole of Hiding:** This addition is effectively a permanent *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]* set into the ceiling of a stronghold space. Alternatively, if there is no ceiling, it leads up to 30 feet above the space.

The *hole of hiding* is an extradimensional space with a rope attached to its entry. You climb up the rope ([[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check, DC 15) to enter the space. Up to seven people and the rope can fit in the space, or eight people if you let the rope hang out. Once you pull up the rope, the space is undetectable.

Inside the *hole of hiding* you can see out into the real world as if you are looking out a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. Spells cannot cross this window, nor can area effects work across it.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
