# Path of Watery Solidity (WondArch)
## Overview
**Path of Watery Solidity:** This effect covers up to eight contiguous 5-foot-by-5-foot squares on the surface of a liquid. Any creature that walks on the enchanted area treats the liquid as if it were entirely solid, as per a *[[Water Walk (Spell)|water walk]]* spell. Creatures that wish to avoid this effect must make a Will save (DC 14).

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Water Walk (Spell)|water walk]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 81
