# Twinned Presence (Trait)
## Overview
**Twinned Presence:** Your eidolon—and your connection to it—makes others ill at ease. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks, and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] is always a class skill for you. In addition, if your eidolon is summoned and within 30 feet, and its size exceeds your own, use its size modifier on any [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks you make.
