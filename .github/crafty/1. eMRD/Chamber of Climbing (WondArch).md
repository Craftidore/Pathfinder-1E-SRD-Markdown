# Chamber of Climbing (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of Climbing:** Anyone who enters this stronghold space can suddenly traverse walls and ceilings as if a *[[Spider Climb (Spell)|spider climb]]* spell had been cast on her. This effect only lasts on any particular subject as long as she is actually in the room.

This extra is often added to rooms with trapdoors in the ceiling or secret doors placed high in the wall. The *chamber of climbing* isn’t obvious, so only the stronghold residents will walk up to the trapdoor. Intruders probably won’t think to try walking up a wall.

A subject can make a Will save (DC 13) to prevent being affected by the spell. A creature with a Strength score of 23 or better can pull the subject off the wall.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Spider Climb (Spell)|spider climb]]**; Market Price:* 1,500 gp.
