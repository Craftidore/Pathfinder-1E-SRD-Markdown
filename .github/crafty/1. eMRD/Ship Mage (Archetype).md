# Ship Mage (Archetype)
## Overview
**Ship Mage (Wizard Archetype)**

The ship mage combines his arcane mastery with a supernatural link to ships.

**Class Skills:** A ship mage gains [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] as class skills.

**Ship Bond (Ex)** At 1st level, a ship mage can bond with a single ship within 30 feet and line of sight as a standard action. He can utilize the power of this link to remotely operate the ship as if he was its pilot (as long as he’s within 150 feet). The ship still requires a crew to man the rigging, propulsion, and siege weapons.

If another character is piloting the bonded ship when the bonding takes place, that character may make a Strength or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check to prevent the ship mage’s bond and maintain control (DC = 10 + ½ ship mage’s level + ship mage’s Intelligence modifier). Any creature adjacent to the steering control may attempt this check on subsequent rounds to break the bond as a standard action.

A ship mage can willingly cede control to another character as a free action without breaking his bond. A pilot can cede control of a ship to a bonded mage as a free action.

At 11th level, a ship mage’s control over the ship grows. The bonded ship moves with a life of its own, tying ropes, unfurling sails, and adjusting the rudder. The bonded ship requires 10 fewer crew to operate. Every level thereafter, the ship mage’s power provides a substitute for 10 additional crew, up to 90 at 19th level. These phantom crew members have a Strength score of 10 and a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) score equal to 1/2 the ship mage’s level + ship mage’s Intelligence modifier. They cannot be harmed, destroyed, or otherwise affected.

At 20th level, a bonded ship requires 200 fewer crew to operate, and this phantom crew may also operate siege weapons.

The ship mage can end this bond with a free action. A ship mage can bond with a ship in this manner a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but can only be bonded with one ship at a time.

This ability replaces arcane bond.

**Empower Ship (Su)** As a swift action, a ship mage can sacrifice a prepared spell to empower his bonded ship. This has one of three effects, chosen when the spell is sacrificed.

*Maneuver:* The ship gains a bonus on its next combat maneuver before the ship mage’s next turn equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage (if any) equal to 5 × the level of the spell.

*Repair:* The ship instantly repairs 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell.

*Speed:* The ship’s current speed instantly increases or decreases by 10 ft. per the level of the spell.

This ability replaces [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]].
