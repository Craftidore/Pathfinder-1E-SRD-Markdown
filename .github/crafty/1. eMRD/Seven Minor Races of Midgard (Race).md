# Seven Minor Races of Midgard (Race)
## Overview
**Seven Minor Races**

A number of minor races live in the civilized lands of Midgard, and many more in its wilderness and wastelands. These include the centaurs, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, halflings, tengu, and tieflings.

### Centaurs
**Centaurs**

Centaurs are a scattered race and roam in small clan groups from the Rothenian Plains (where their numbers are great) to the personal guard of the young Emperor in Valera in the Seven Cities. Everywhere they are considered large and dangerous, and they have a reputation for banditry and bullying. Their archery is excellent and their healing arts well advanced, but they are largely a nomadic people without much interest in magic or writing, and other races disregard them as a result. They do so at their peril: Large centaur hordes have occasionally smashed entirely cities and small nations flat.

See page 86 of the Midgard Campaign Setting for their life on the Rothenian Plains.

### Gnolls
**Gnolls**

Most common in the Southlands of Nuria Natal and points south, gnolls are also found in the Mharoti Empire, Khandiria, and even on the Rothenian plain. They range the desert and plains as hunters and scavengers, and they are expert rangers, scouts, and trackers. Their culture is violent and largely unfriendly to outsiders, but some say they have a small kingdom in the distant South.

See page 116 of the Midgard Campaign Setting for more about the gnolls’ strong territories in Nuria Natal.

### Gnomes
**Gnomes**

Found throughout Midgard in small numbers, gnomes have a single primary home, the dark forest of Neimheim and its surrounding territory. They have a terrible reputation as swindlers, kidnappers, diabolists, and charmers. As individuals, the small men in their amusing hats and pointy boots seem silly. However, as a race they have struck one or more diabolical bargains for power with Baba Yaga or archdevils, and this has led them to turn inward. Their only close allies are the shadow fey, though goblins and kobolds and gnolls are not too particular in their choice of friends, either.

See page 84 of the Midgard Campaign Setting for their homeland in the Wormwood of Neimheim.

### Goblins
**Goblins**

Alone among the shorter races, goblins refuse to be conquered or adopt even the pretense of diplomacy, and so are treated as vermin and exterminated wherever dwarves and men encounter them. Driven into the wilderness by larger races, goblins scratch an existence as opportunistic scavengers. Many goblin tribes have fallen under the sway of worgs and nightgarms (see the Midgard Bestiary for Pathfinder RPG), whom they worship as totem beasts. The relationship between goblins and worgs is the reverse of what might be expected: It’s the goblins who are pets and servants of lupine lords, not the other way around.

Some believe goblins are the warped remnants of the gnomes who did not escape to the Wormwood, or perhaps the twisted results of experimentation on halflings or humans during the Great Mage Wars. They are found in large numbers in the Goblin Wastes and the West, though they are hardy travelers and can pop up thousands of miles away from their homeland, from the Northlands to the Dragon Empire. They have a knack for finding ancient artifacts and lost magic, and spend much of their time digging through the dust for such items, then selling them to the mages of Allain.

See page 165 of the Midgard Campaign Setting for their tribes in the Western Wastes.

### Halflings
**Halflings**

Rarely seen and a stay-at-home race, halflings are encountered as bargefolk on the great rivers and as the most discreet of servants to the River Court or in the Domains of the Princes. The race was widely believed to have been indentured to the elves before the Great Retreat, and they show a great deference to elves and the elfmarked when the two races meet. Most halflings are believed to have left Midgard for the Elflands or the River Court during the Great Retreat. Those that remained are slightly more adventurous than those who were loyal to the elven masters.

### Tengu (also called Huginn or Heru)
**Tengu (also called Huginn or Heru)**

The tengu are scoundrels and not entirely welcome everywhere. Their homeland is in Beldestan to the East, or on a branch of Wotan’s tree in the North, or on a high cliff of Horus’ hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire, but none of these are large.

Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers in Midgard, but when the tengu swear an oath they abide by it. They avoid the West and the Seven Cities most of the time, and are most honored in Nuria Natal, where they serve temples of Horus as sworn guardians, assassins, and defenders.

### Tieflings (the Demonmarked, Hellborn)
**Tieflings (the Demonmarked, Hellborn)**

Once widespread in the young kingdoms of the human magocracies, tieflings grew to dominate Caelmarath’s and Vael Turog’s noble classes for a time. Those large and public families of tieflings are a thing of the past; they are an exile people, found in families and pairs but rarely in any larger numbers. Only in Bemmea and Tintager are there significant numbers of the demonmarked, and even there they seem eager to prove themselves as worthy of trust. Many still blame the demonmarked for the destruction of human lands of the West and the retreat of the elves. Shadow elves and gnomes enjoy their company, as do some dragonkin. Elves, humans, and halflings rarely abide them.
