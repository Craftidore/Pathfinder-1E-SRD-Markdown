# Cabinet of Stasis (WondArch)
## Overview
**Cabinet of Stasis:** This cabinet stands 8 feet tall by 3 feet deep by 4 feet wide. Any creature placed fully within it is immediately placed into a state of suspended animation (no save), slowing its life functions to the point where they essentially halt. Once inside, the creature feels the passage of one day for every decade that actually passes, although it spends the time in a dreamless sleep. Creatures inside the cabinet only awaken if pulled from the cabinet by someone outside; it’s possible to starve to death.

A cabinet of stasis can be used to keep a prisoner “on ice.” Sometimes the creators of heavily trapped strongholds retreat into *cabinets of stasis* for centuries rather than face some outer calamity.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Temporal Stasis (Spell)|temporal stasis]]**; Market Price:* 66,000 gp.
