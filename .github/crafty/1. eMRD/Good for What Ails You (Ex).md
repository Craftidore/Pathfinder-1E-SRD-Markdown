# Good for What Ails You (Ex)
## Overview
*Good for What Ails You (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be affecting her: [[Blinded|blinded]], [[Confused|confused]], [[Dazzled|dazzled]], [[Deafened|deafened]], [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], [[Frightened|frightened]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], [[Panicked|panicked]], [[Shaken|shaken]], or [[Sickened|sickened]]. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect.
