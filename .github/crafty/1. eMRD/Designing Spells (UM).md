# Designing Spells (UM)
## Overview
Designing spells for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is

a complex task that is part art, part science. This section

describes what you need to think about when designing

balanced, playable spells for your campaign.

Unlike magic items, spells have predefined power levels

corresponding to the spell levels already in the game. When

you design a spell, you have to take those power levels into

account by comparing the new spell to existing spells in

the *Core Rulebook*—a spell has to fall into the narrow range

of power for one of the nine spell levels (plus cantrips or

orisons). In contrast, prices for magic items are strongly

granular, and are calculated to the gold piece based on

precisely what features the item possesses. In other words,

if you add more power to a magic item, you just increase

its price to compensate, but if you add too much power

to a spell, you have to make it a higher-level spell, which

means you then have to compare it to a different set of

example spells.

**The Golden Rule**

*Compare your spell to similar spells, and to other spells of its*

*intended level.*

Unlike when pricing magic items, there are no formulae

for how to correctly “price” a spell. The entire process is a

matter of comparing the new spell you’re creating to other

spells and evaluating whether your spell is weaker, stronger,

or about the same as that spell or group of spells. Designing

a spell requires a firm understanding of all the game’s rules,

not just those related to spells. Furthermore, it requires an

understanding of some unwritten game assumptions, most

of which are discussed throughout this section.

**Example**: If you look at the spell list in the *Core Rulebook*,

you’ll notice that there isn’t a 1st-level wizard spell that deals

sonic damage. You may decide to design a spell to fill that

niche, modeling it after *burning hands*, except dealing sonic

damage instead of fire—perhaps you’d call it *sonic screech*.

However, there’s a reason there aren’t as many sonic spells

in the game: “sonic” as an energy type is a late addition

to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance

to sonic damage because most monsters existed before

“sonic” was defined as an energy type. Because there are

fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with

fire resistance, *sonic screech* will almost always be a better

spell than *burning hands*. That means if you introduce *sonic*

*screech* into your game, you’ll see savvy players selecting it

instead of *burning hands*. If a new spell displaces an existing

spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means

it’s better than the other available choices—and if it’s so

good that it’s obviously the best spell choice, it’s probably

overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules

can help you avoid mistakes like this.

**Spell Terminology**

It is essential for you to understand the terminology used in

the game to describe spells and the effects they can create.

Before designing a new spell, familiarize yourself with

“Chapter 9: Magic” in the *Core Rulebook*. In particular, be sure

you understand the various schools and subschools on pages

209–212 and the spell stat block categories (components,

range, and so on) on pages 212–218 of the *Core Rulebook*.

The following sections address aspects of spell design

in order of their importance and relevance to making a

balanced spell. For example, the components of a spell have

very little to do with its power level unless an expensive

focus or material component is involved, so components

are discussed well after damage, range, duration, and

saving throws.

**Intended Level**

Before you start, you typically need an idea of the general

power level of the new spell—probably because you have a

specific PC or NPC in mind who’d like to use it, and making

the level too low to be significant or too high for that

character to cast defeats the purpose of designing the spell.

Once you know the general level of the spell—a two-level

range is close enough at this point—you can progress to the

next issue.

**Function**

The intended function is the most important consideration

when designing a spell. Specifically, function refers to the

tangible game effects of the spell, such as dealing damage,

applying a condition such as sickened, or giving a bonus

on saves or attack rolls. Everything else is cosmetic at this

point—it doesn’t matter if it’s slashing damage or fire

damage, makes a target sickened or confused, grants an

insight bonus on saves or an enhancement bonus on attack

rolls, or looks like unicorns or fire demons. Some sample

functions include:

• Deal damage to one opponent

• Deal damage to multiple opponents

• Apply a condition or effect to one opponent

• Apply a condition or effect to multiple opponents

• Give a defensive bonus to one ally

• Give a defensive bonus to multiple allies

• Give an offensive bonus to one ally

• Give an offensive bonus to multiple allies

• Heal one ally

• Heal multiple allies

A spell can do several of these things at once, or give the

caster a choice between several options, but such spells

should always be less powerful than a single-purpose

spell of the same spell level, so keep that in mind when

designing the spell. Note that “condition or effect” is the

broadest category in the above list, which includes actual

conditions like sickened and panicked, as well as effects

like teleportation.

**Spell Damage**

One of the easiest ways to measure an offensive spell’s

power is to look at how much damage it does. Offensive

spells are the easiest spells to design in the game, and

there are dozens of examples of them in the *Core Rulebook*.

A typical damage spell deals 1 die of damage (typically

a d6) per caster level for an arcane spell (for example,

*shocking grasp* or *fireball*), or 1 die of damage (typically a d6,

but sometimes a d8) per two caster levels for a divine spell

(for example, *searing light*).

**Target**

The simplest spells only affect one target, whether that

target is a creature, an object, or just the caster. Technically,

a spell that only affects the caster (with a range of “personal”

and target of “you”) is slightly weaker than one with a

target of “one creature,” because being able to cast the spell

on anyone makes it more versatile and thus more powerful.

However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell

“caster-only” should not be used to justify designing the

spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells

are designed that way either because they’ve always worked

that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique

and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of

hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by

casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these

spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine

their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.

**Example**: *Shield* and *true strike* are both 1st-level spells

that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells

on others, they’d still be at the right power level for 1stlevel

spells—they aren’t 2nd-level spells that you knocked

down a level because you designed them as caster-only.

*Shield* has always been a spell that only affects the caster,

and there’s a game-balance reason to keep it that way:

because *shield* grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee

character means the fighter could drop his actual shield

and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra

damage. *True strike* was deliberately designed as a casteronly

spell so a sorcerer couldn’t just cast it every round on

the fighter, who’d be guaranteed a hit against a difficult

monster even if he used Combat Expertise (for extra AC)

and Power Attack (for extra damage). Making those spells

caster-only doesn’t really weaken the spells, but it does

prevent players from exploiting certain combinations

that would make encounters too easy.

A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful

than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature

spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres

(like *fireball*), or allow the caster to select multiple targets

as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart

(like *slow*). A burst effect like *fireball* can potentially affect

many more enemies than a pick-your-targets spell like

*slow*, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use

*slow*. Select which type is most appropriate for the spell,

but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally

more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where

a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst

which can affect many).

**Damage Caps**

Low-level damage spells are not as good as medium- or

high-level damage spells—the game is designed so lowerlevel

spells eventually reach a maximum amount of damage

they can deal. This is because if low-level spells continued

to increase in damage without hitting a maximum amount,

they’d rival some higher-level spells for effectiveness, and

the game isn’t as interesting if casters are using the same

spells at 20th level as they were at 1st.

The maximum damage depends on the level of the spell

and whether the spell is arcane or divine. This is because

arcane magic is deliberately designed to be better at dealing

damage to balance the fact that divine magic is better at

healing. A “single target” spell only damages one creature

(like *shocking grasp*), or divides its damage among several

creatures (like *burning hands* or *magic missile*). A “multiple

Spell Research

The game rules for what a caster must do to create a new

spell are very vague (see Independent Research on page

219 of the *Core Rulebook*). This is because, like the details of

creating magic items, the nitty-gritty of what the caster is

doing for this research isn’t important for the progress of

the campaign. Just as it’s not necessary to know whether

a wizard is using squid ink or ink from a rare plant when

crafting a *scroll of burning hands*, it’s not necessary to know

whether he’s modifying gestures described in *Irulark’s*

*Incunabulum* or altering the pronunciation of words detailed

in *Murlost’s Great Grimoire* to create a new 1st-level attack

spell. While it’s fine to include these elements for flavor,

particularly in a high-narrative campaign, they don’t affect

the outcome of the item crafting or spell research, both of

which largely take place outside of game time. Therefore,

this chapter is about the game mechanics of a player or GM

designing a new spell, not the in-world requirements of a

character researching a new spell.

target” spell applies its full damage to several creatures

(like *fireball*).

For example, a 1st-level single-target wizard spell like

*shocking grasp* can deal a maximum of 5 dice of damage

(specifically 5d6). *Magic missile* can be used against a single

target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect

multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage

among them. *Burning hands* initially looks like it doesn’t

obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice

of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by

the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an

extremely close and limited area of effect.

When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also

keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage

and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume

d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells,

count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, *searing light* is a 3rd-level singletarget

cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage;

treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on

target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level

and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are

still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher

damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the

reduced damage against constructs).

**Tip**: If your spell does more damage than the amount

defined on the table, you should reduce the damage or

increase the spell’s level.

**Tip**: If your spell does less damage than the amount

defined on the table, you should increase the damage or

add another effect to the spell. An example of this is *sound*

*burst*, which only deals 1d8 points of damage (this amount

never increases), but can stun creatures in the area.

**Range**

Spell range plays a significant part in the power of a

spell. Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile

spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat,

and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of

opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while

close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing

room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a

single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and

attack the caster—even at caster level 14, a close-range spell

only reaches 60 feet.

In indoor situations, most medium-range combat spells

may as well have an infinite range, because at the level the

caster gains access to the spell, the caster can reach 150 feet

or more, and few encounters deal with ranges that far—the

caster can hit anything he can see. Even outdoors, a spell

with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical

game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by

30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise allencompassing,

with a 400-foot minimum range translating

to almost 7 feet on a game mat—longer than many tables

used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in

abstract situations like launching a *fireball* at enemies across

a large prairie, using *dimension door* to return to an earlier

(and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.

Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of

spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and

medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for

most purposes. Given that the Enlarge Spell feat doubles a

spell’s range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the Reach Spell

feat from the *Advanced Player’s Guide* increases the range by

one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium

to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it’s reasonable to balance

a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to

increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell

that works like *cure light wounds* (normally 1st level) at close

range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell.

**Duration**

There are no hard-and-fast rules for determining how long

a spell should last at a particular level; a weak spell may

last hours, while a powerful one may only last a few rounds

or be spent in one action. Your best bet is to compare your

spell’s effect and duration to those of similar spells of its

intended level and spells one level below and above that.

Make sure you are fully aware of the differences between

“instantaneous” spells and “permanent” spells (see

Duration on pages 216–217 of the *Core Rulebook*).

**Saving Throw**

Most spells that directly affect creatures with a magical

effect should allow a saving throw. Spells that create

nonmagical materials that then strike or impede creatures

(such as *ice storm* and *sleet storm*) do not normally require a

saving throw.

Spells that require the caster to make an attack roll to hit

(even if it’s a ranged touch attack) may or may not require a

saving throw (*enervation* and *searing light* do not, *disintegrate*

does). Attack effects that do not require rolling damage

should always allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the

effect; otherwise, the spell becomes an obvious choice for

anyone of the level to cast it.

**Tip**: When deciding whether or not the spell should have

a saving throw, consider how you’d feel if someone used the

spell on your favorite PC. If your PC didn’t get any chance

to resist the effect with a save or to dodge it entirely because

of a failed attack roll, would you be annoyed, embarrassed,

or angry? If so, you should give the spell some kind of save

or attack roll, just so it’s not an always-effective option.

**Fortitude Saves**: Spells with Fortitude saves usually

physically transform the target, apply an effect you’d

normally resist with a Fortitude save (such as disease or

poison), or are a form of attack that sheer physical toughness

is enough to resist. In general, making a successful

Fortitude save means the effect hits, but the target toughs

it out, like a bear shrugging off the stinky musk sprayed by

a skunk. Note that if your spell only affects creatures—not

objects—then nonliving creatures such as constructs and

undead are immune to the spell. For example, this makes

them immune to creature-oriented polymorphing spells,

but not spells such as *disintegrate*, which can attack objects.

**Ref lex Save**: Spells with Ref lex saves usually create a

physical burst or spread in an area, like an explosion, which

the target is able to dodge with a successful saving throw.

In general, making a successful Ref lex save means the

target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around

the target with a lesser effect. Note that you shouldn’t build

a spell where the caster makes an attack roll and the target

also makes a Ref lex saving throw; doing so brings Dexterity

into play twice for the same spell (once for the target’s AC,

once for the target’s Ref lex save modifier).

**Will Saves**: Spells with Will saves are mental, mindaffecting

attacks; the target resists with pure mental power,

by using evasive thoughts or noticing f laws in the spell’s

assault that can negate its effectiveness. A Will save is

like a mental version of a Fortitude save; the effect “hits”

the target, and whether or not it succeeds depends on the

target’s willpower. Most direct-attack Will-save spells

(such as *sleep* and *phantasmal killer*) are mind-affecting

effects (see Descriptors, below).

Some spells can be cast on objects, and the object only

gets a saving throw if it is a magic item or is held by a

creature; these spells should have “(object)” listed after the

type of saving throw (see *shrink item*).

Helpful spells and spells that do not harm the target

in any way either should have no saving throw, or should

allow a saving throw but have “(harmless)” listed after the

type of saving throw (see *f ly*).

Spells that only affect the caster never require a saving

throw (you’d never try to resist a beneficial spell you’re

casting on yourself ), so you don’t list a saving throw for

those spells at all (see *true strike*).

**Spell Resistance**

Whether or not spell resistance applies to a spell depends

mostly on whether or not it is an instantaneous or ongoing

magical effect. Spell resistance applies to instantaneous

magical effects (such as *fireball*) and ongoing magical

effects (such as *wall of fire*), but not to nonmagical

effects or spells that create nonmagical effects, whether

instantaneous or ongoing. For example, *wall of stone*

conjures an instantaneous wall of stone that cannot be

dispelled; spell resistance doesn’t help you walk through

the spell’s wall any more than it would if you tried to walk

through a mortared stone wall in a castle—neither wall is

magical, and both walls remain there even if you use *dispel*

*magic* or *antimagic field* on them.

The general rule is that most spells allow spell resistance.

Only when you’re deliberately designing a spell that creates

a nonmagical object or nonmagical effect is spell resistance

likely to be irrelevant. You can use *move earth* (instantaneous

duration) to create a hill, and spell resistance won’t help

you get over or through the hill because the spell moves

the earth and thereafter stops being magical; likewise,

you can use *move earth* to create a pit, and spell resistance

won’t help you ignore the pit because it’s a nonmagical

pit, just as if you had created it with a shovel. *Magic stone*

adds magical power to stones, but spell resistance doesn’t

help protect against being hit by the stones any more than

spell resistance helps protect against a *+1 arrow* because the

magic is focused on the stones, not on the creature with

spell resistance.

It’s a common trick to design a spell that doesn’t allow

spell resistance so the caster can use it against creatures

who have spell resistance. In many cases, the idea behind

the design is just silly, like a spell that creates a sphere

of burning oil and hurls it at the intended area, where it

bursts in an explosion of f lame; clearly the intent is to

create a nonmagical *fireball* that bypasses spell resistance.

Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these

spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes

them completely immune to any effect that allows spell

resistance. You should avoid letting these sorts of trick

spells into your campaign, as they meddle with the balance

of encounters (some monsters are designed to be harder for

melee characters to fight, some are designed to be harder

for spellcasters to fight, and some are just supposed to be

difficult all around).

Whether or not a spell allows spell resistance is not an

indicator of the spell’s power; for most encounters, spell

resistance isn’t a factor.

If a spell’s saving throw entry is marked as “(harmless)” or

“(object),” the spell resistance entry should say that as well.

**Casting Time**

Almost all spells meant to be cast in combat should have a

casting time of “1 standard action.” Avoid the temptation

to invent spells with a casting time of “1 move action,” “1

swift action,” or “1 immediate action,” as that’s just a cheesy

way for spellcasters to be able to cast two spells in 1 round,

and there’s already a mechanism for that: the Quicken

Spell feat. Making combat spells with faster casting times

devalues the Quicken Spell feat; even if you design the

spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4

level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that

feat, and your spell would become a common combo for

high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level.

For example, if you create a 5th-level quickened *magic*

*missile* spell that acts just like a *magic missile* spell with

the Quicken Spell feat, any 14th-level wizard (who has at

least three 5th-level spells available) is going to be tempted

to learn this spell just because it allows him to add 5d4+5

extra points of damage to any high-level combat spell he

casts, which is a way to get around the spell-damage cap.

Furthermore, allowing spellcasters to routinely cast two

spells per round means they tend to use up their spells

more quickly and push their allies to camp and rest rather

than continue exploring.

Spells that summon creatures to help in combat should

have a casting time of “1 round.” This is to give a reasonable

action cost for a character casting the spell. If the caster

could summon a monster using a standard action and have

it act that same round, it’s like the spell didn’t cost him any

actions at all.

Spells that call an outsider to serve for more than a few

rounds (such as *planar ally* and *planar binding*) should have

a casting time of 10 minutes; more powerful spells may

have even longer casting times. Note that *gate* can be used

to call creatures and only has a casting time of 1 standard

action, but when used this way, it requires a 10,000 gp

material component, so that faster casting time doesn’t

come cheaply.

**Components**

For the most part, a spell’s components have very little to

do with its overall power level unless it requires a costly

focus or material component or has no component at all.

Most spells in the *Core Rulebook* have verbal and somatic

components, and new spells should follow this trend.

The advantage of spells that don’t require verbal

components is they can be cast in an area of *silence*, and thus

there is the temptation to create silent versions of common

combat spells. However, doing so devalues the Silent Spell

feat, just like making swift-action spells devalues Quicken

Spell, though not to such a great extent (casting two spells per

round is a more serious problem than having a backup spell

to counteract an unexpected *silence*). If casters decide they’d

rather prepare a silent *magic missile* instead of *acid arrow*,

or a silent *acid arrow* instead of *fireball*, they’ve deliberately

chosen weaker options, and that’s fine.

The advantage of spells that don’t require somatic

components is they can be cast when bound, grappled, or

when both hands are full or occupied, and arcane spell

failure doesn’t apply. Just as creating silent versions of

spells devalues Silent Spell, making non-somatic spells

devalues the Still Spell feat. The premise of the game is

that most spells require words and gestures, and new

spells should stick with that unless the theme of the spell

suggests it wouldn’t require a somatic component, or it was

specifically designed to escape bindings or grapples.

The advantage of spells that don’t require material

components is they don’t require a spell component pouch

(and in the rare circumstance in which if you’re grappled,

you needn’t already have your material components in

hand to cast the spell). Most material components are

part of a spell for f lavor rather than to satisfy rules. The

guano and sulfur material components of *fireball* are

there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made

from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material

components of *lightning bolt* come from the ability to create

a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass

rod. The game could present those spells without material

components at all, and it would have a negligible effect

on how the game plays (as proven by the “it has whatever

I need” spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class

getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat)—they’re just in

the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no

material components or free material components, and

then add them in if the f lavor seems appropriate.

Costly material components should be used to prevent

overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they

want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy

if everyone in the party has it (such as *stoneskin*), allows the

PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring

and investigating (such as *augury*, *divination*, and *commune*),

or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as *raise*

*dead* and *restoration*). Balance a spell without costly material

components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if

it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power

level of a spell is on target (like *augury*, as it makes sense to

have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell

is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it’s free,

so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the

PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as *glyph of*

*warding* also fit into this category; if they were free, every

spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per

day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has

before the PCs arrive. By giving *glyph of warding* a gp cost, it

allows for more traditional adventuring—otherwise every

square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to

a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search

every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5thlevel

rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph,

meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).

Focus components are governed by the same rules as

material components—in most cases they’re just there

for f lavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is

like a costly material component, except it’s a one-time

expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to

entry that you can ignore once you’ve crossed the threshold.

A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to

the spell, but once they have the materials, it’s essentially just

like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material

components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems

like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help

moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component.

**School**

In terms of balancing the power of a spell, its school isn’t

very important—a 6th-level conjuration attack spell should

be about as powerful as a 6th-level evocation attack spell.

Deciding on the spell’s school is really about choosing

what best fits the theme and effect of the spell. Spells that

deal energy damage to an area are usually conjuration

or evocation spells. Spells that call, summon, or create

physical objects or creatures are usually conjuration spells,

while those that create things made of energy or force

are usually evocation spells. Spells that affect minds are

usually enchantment spells, unless they cause fear or affect

undead, in which case they’re necromancy spells.

**Bonus Types**

There are many types of bonuses in the game. It’s tempting

to look at that list of bonuses, find “holes” in the spell list

that don’t have spells for certain bonus types, and create

a new spell that adds one of those unused bonus types to

your favorite statistic or roll. Resist this temptation. Not all

bonus types are equal within the game, and many bonus

types are only meant for certain things. See Table 2–7:

Bonus Types and Effects.

A dash entry (—) in the table indicates there are no

common examples of items or spells that grant that kind

of bonus. If you’re designing an item or spell and want to

include a certain type of bonus to a particular ability or

statistic, check Table 2–7 first; if the bonus type doesn’t

say it can affect that ability or statistic, use one that does

instead. One reason for this table is that some bonuses

are better than others (def lection bonuses work against

incorporeal creatures and when you are f lat-footed, natural

armor bonuses do not). A second reason is that allowing

any kind of bonus on any roll or statistic makes it really

easy to stack many small bonuses more cheaply than a

larger bonus, which makes powerful magic items like a

*ring of protection +5* much less interesting. A third reason

is that some of these combinations just don’t make sense,

like a def lection bonus to Strength or a shield bonus on

Knowledge checks.

**Description**

The description is the meat of the spell, and what you put

here is the most important information of all.

Make sure the spell description is clear and concise.

Remember that players are going to refer to the spell

description in a hurry during their turn of combat, and if they

have to fight their way through f lowery language to figure

out the details, the resulting delay will annoy other players

and the GM. If the spell has several complex effects, put each

effect into its own paragraph. If the spell allows the caster to

choose from several options, put each option on its own line

with an italicized name (see *binding* for an example).

Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn’t need

to appear again in the spell description—it’s redundant.

For example, the *fireball* description doesn’t say, “The

spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.”

Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player

to sift through when looking up the spell’s effects in the

middle of combat.

Avoid using language that implies something that the

game mechanics of the spell don’t back up. For example, a

spell’s description shouldn’t say “using the foul powers of

necromancy” if the spell doesn’t actually have some sort

of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake

is most common with necromancy spells, which include

not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of

helpful ones as well (such as *astral projection*, *gentle repose*,

and *undeath to death*). People who read your spell description

may not know your intent, and using f lavorful language can

trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional

effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.

Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a

particular character or class in mind, most spells are going

to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell

in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a

character who is very different than the one for whom it is

designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal

with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn

many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer,

who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell

that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a

sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day.

Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the

spell in potion or scroll form—you may intend for the spell

to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time,

but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save

them for just the right opportunity.

When you finish writing a spell description, have others

look it over. They’ll notice things you missed, come up with

questions your spell needs to address, and find ways your

spell can be abused. Use that feedback to revise the spell.

**Hierarchy of Attack Effects**

When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy

of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are

the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming

all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets

affected, and so on) are equal.

**Control**: A control spell puts an opponent under your

control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him

from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind

of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent

(the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also

creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other

opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells

are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend

to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it’s completely

unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are

*charm monster*, *charm person*, *confusion*, *dominate monster*, and

*dominate person*.

**Kill**: A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright,

bypassing the target’s depletable statistics (see sidebar),

typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are

better than incapacitate spells because they don’t wear off

and there’s no chance another enemy can easily reverse

the spell (such as with *dispel magic*). The best of the kill

spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the

caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are

*disintegrate*, *finger of death*, *phantasmal killer*, *power word kill*,

*slay living*, and *wail of the banshee*.

**Incapacitate**: An incapacitate spell makes the target

unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him

from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but

at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated

target’s condition. Spells that cause an enemy to f lee count

as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than

damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass

a target’s depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an

opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate

spells are *fear*, *f lesh to stone*, *hold monster*, *hold person*, *power*

*word stun*, and *sleep*.

**Damage**: A damage spell reduces the target’s depletable

statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that

damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells

because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort

and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable

statistics (which means that the caster’s fighter and rogue

Depletable Statistics

Depletable statistics are any values in a creature or object’s

stat block that can be reduced by some form of attack and

that can neutralize, kill, or destroy the creature or object

when they reach a low value (typically 0). Hit points, ability

scores, and levels are all depletable statistics—a creature

falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies;

objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit

points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an

ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels

equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most

nonmagical attacks reduce a target’s depletable statistics

in some way, eventually defeating the target.

However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor

Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers,

and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics

because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected

creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a

spell that gives a target a –10 attack penalty has little effect

on a sorcerer casting *fireball*, as would a spell that gave her a

–10 penalty on her Wisdom saving throw; despite her poor

attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable

of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties

are –10 or –100. Similarly, a fighter with a –10 penalty on

Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one

with a –10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable

despite these penalties.

“Depletable statistic” isn’t an official game term, but

it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of

spells—attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition

that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding

penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect

at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them

to ignore those penalties.

or balanced, even just by a little bit, it’s easy to push the

boundaries a little more with your new spell, which means

that over time, new spells end up more and more powerful

compared to those in the *Core Rulebook*. The *Core Rulebook*

spells are the most playtested, optimal versions of spells

in the game—new spells shouldn’t be significantly better

than them (see also the Benchmarks section on pages

138–139).

Remember that it’s acceptable to make a spell that isn’t

as powerful as an existing spell. Just because it’s not the

best spell of its level doesn’t mean it won’t get used by

adventurers. In fact, that’s why easily crafted scrolls are

a significant part of the game—to allow parties access to

spells they wouldn’t normally prepare or learn, but may

find useful in some circumstances.

**Multipurpose Spells**

A spell that gives the caster a choice of multiple options

should be weaker overall than a spell that only does one

thing. First, a spell that is good at two things is much better

than a spell that is good at one thing, so you should reduce

the power of the former spell so the two spells remain

about equal. Second, because bards, oracles, and sorcerers

can only learn a limited number of spells, a spell that can

do multiple things is often a better choice for them because

it’s almost like learning multiple spells.

Examples of poorly designed spells with multiple,

dissimilar options are:

• A general “emotions” spell that lets the caster project

one of several emotions, each of which has a different

effect on targets.

• A fire spell that lets the caster hurl a blast of fire, ignite

multiple arrowheads to add fire damage, or make a

protective shield of fire.

• A spell that works like *bull’s strength*, but lets the caster

choose which ability score it affects.

• A spell that either teleports the caster or can be used to

send away an unwilling target.

• A spell that deals energy damage of a type chosen by the

caster to an area.

Rather than create a multipurpose spell that gives a

“shopping list” of effects the caster can choose from, keep

the spell focused on one or perhaps two similar options.

Note that there is a difference between a spell with multiple

similar options and one with radically different options.

Good examples of appropriate multipurpose spells are

*alarm* (audible and mental alarms are still alarms), *beast*

*shape I* (Small or Medium animals, specific benefits from

a short list), *fire shield* (two options with basically the same

mechanical effect, on par for a spell of its level), the *summon*

*monster* spells (very versatile but of limited duration, with

monsters of a lower power level than other spells of the

same level).

allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells

are better than penalize spells because damage always

stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal

enough damage, they’ll eventually disable an opponent,

whereas it’s possible to add penalties almost indefinitely

and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of

damage spells are *cone of cold*, *fireball*, *lightning bolt*, *magic*

*missile*, *poison*, and *sound burst*.

**Penalize**: A penalize spell gives the target some penalty

not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack

penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds

of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the

weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can’t

kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don’t

stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have

to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way

(typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks).

Examples of penalize spells are *bane*, *blindness/deafness*, *ray*

*of enfeeblement*, and *slow*.

There are exceptions to the above categories. For

example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit

points and deals substantial damage but only has a

moderate chance of harming the caster’s allies, the caster

may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack

penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting)

than trying to wear down its hit points (because during

that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage

to the caster’s allies). In this case, a penalize spell that

reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell.

As another example, the PCs may need to question a

defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is

a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some

really good magic that lets them question the dead more

effectively than *speak with dead*).

Spells with variable effects may be more than one type

of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results—a

*confusion* spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently

is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack

one of its allies, it’s a control spell. Likewise, a *summon*

*monster III* spell that summons a fiendish constrictor

snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an

enemy, but it’s just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish

boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks.

Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider

their optimal usage.

**Core is King**

When designing a new spell, you should always compare it

to the spells in the *Core Rulebook* to get a sense of whether

the spell is strong or weak for its level. You can compare it

to spells in other books as well, but you should use the *Core*

*Rulebook* as a baseline. This is because if a spell in another

sourcebook pushes the boundaries of what’s acceptable

**Choosing Descriptors**

While spell descriptors are frequently overlooked, they play

an important role in the mechanics of a spell. Assigning

the correct descriptors is key to finishing the spell. The

follows is a list of all the descriptors in the Pathfinder

Roleplaying Game, including several new ones introduced

in this book.

**Acid**: Acid effects deal damage with chemical reactions

rather than cold, electricity, heat, or vibration. This descriptor

includes both actual acids and their chemical opposites,

called bases or alkalines (such as ammonia and lye).

**Air**: Spells that create air, manipulate air, or conjure

creatures from air-dominant planes or with the air subtype

should have the air descriptor.

**Chaotic**: Spells that draw upon the power of true chaos

or conjure creatures from chaos-aligned planes or with the

chaotic subtype should have the chaos descriptor.

**Cold**: Cold effects deal damage by making the target

colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled

matter or energy. Cold effects also include those that create

ice, sleet, or snow out of nothing. They can cause frostbite,

numbness, coordination problems, slowed movement and

reactions, stupor, and death.

**Curse**: Curse is a new spell descriptor created for this book.

Curses are often permanent effects, and usually cannot be

dispelled, but can be removed with a *break enchantment*,

*limited wish*, *miracle*, *remove curse*, or *wish*. For a list of curse

spells in the *Core Rulebook* and *Advanced Player’s Guide*, see

“Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Darkness**: Spells that create darkness or reduce the

amount of light should have the darkness descriptor. Giving

a spell the darkness descriptor indicates whether a spell like

*daylight* is high enough level to counter or dispel it.

**Death**: Spells with the death descriptor directly

attack a creature’s life force to cause immediate

death, or to draw on the power of a dead or dying

creature. The *death ward* spell protects against

death effects, and some creature types are immune to

death effects.

**Disease**: This is a new spell descriptor created for this

book. Disease effects give the target a disease, which may

be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an

abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental

disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of

the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease

apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of

disease spells. For a list of disease spells in the *Core Rulebook*

and *Advanced Player’s Guide*, see “Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Earth**: Spells that manipulate earth or conjure

creatures from earth-dominant planes or with the

earth subtype should have the earth descriptor.

**Electricity**: Electricity effects involve the presence

and f low of electrical charge, whether expressed

in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures

by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to

objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes

through, and thus technically many electricity spells could

also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity,

it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity

damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.

**Emotion**: This is a new spell descriptor created for

this book. Spells with this descriptor create emotions or

manipulate the target’s existing emotions. Most emotion

spells are enchantments, except for fear spells, which are

usually necromancy. For a list of

emotion spells in the *Core Rulebook*

and *Advanced Player’s Guide*, see

“Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Evil**: Spells that draw upon

evil powers or conjure creatures

from evil-aligned planes or

with the evil subtype should

have the evil descriptor.

**Fear:** Spells with the fear descriptor create, enhance, or

manipulate fear. Most fear spells are necromancy spells,

though some are enchantment spells.

**Fire**: Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire,

directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava,

steam, and boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects

can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue,

nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate

fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or

with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.

**Force**: Spells with the force descriptor create or

manipulate magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal

creatures normally (as if they were corporeal creatures).

**Good**: Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness

or conjure creatures from good-aligned planes or with the

good subtype should have the good descriptor.

**Language-Dependent**: A language-dependent spell uses

intelligible language as a medium for communication. If

the target cannot understand or hear what the caster of a

language-dependent spell says, the spell has no effect, even

if the target fails its saving throw.

**Lawful**: Spells that draw upon the power of true law

or conjure creatures from law-aligned planes or with the

lawful subtype should have the law descriptor.

**Light**: Spells that create significant amounts of light or

attack darkness effects should have the light descriptor.

Giving a spell the light descriptor indicates whether a spell

like *darkness* is high enough level counter or dispel it.

**Mind-Affecting**: Mindless creatures (those with an

Intelligence score of “—”) and undead are immune to

mind-affecting effects.

**Pain**: Pain is a new spell descriptor created for this

book. Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without

any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target

may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to

pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a

Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to

pain effects. For a list of pain spells in the *Core Rulebook*

and *Advanced Player’s Guide*, see “Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Poison**: Poison is a new spell descriptor created for this

book. Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar

toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures

through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and

poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of

the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as

different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and

poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding,

confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing,

suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with

resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance

to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells.

Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects

of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell

(for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison

could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature). For

a list of poison spells in the *Core Rulebook* and *Advanced*

*Player’s Guide*, see “Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Shadow**: Shadow is a new spell descriptor created for this

book. Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the

Shadow Plane, or allow transport to or from that plane. For

a list of shadow spells in the *Core Rulebook* and *Advanced*

*Player’s Guide*, see “Chapter 5: Spells.”

**Sonic**: Sonic effects transmit energy to the target

through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air,

water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the

humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy

to cause harm, which means that these effects can even

affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point

damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of

breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures

using batlike echolocation.

**Water**: Spells that manipulate water or conjure creatures

from water-dominant planes or with the water subtype

should have the water descriptor.

**Benchmarks**

Some spells in the *Core Rulebook* are clearly the best of their

spell level. Other spells are perfect examples of what a spell

of that level or purpose should be able to do. These are

“benchmark” spells, and when designing a new spell you

should always compare your spell to the benchmark spells.

If your spell is better than the benchmark spell, you should

reduce its power or increase its spell level. The following

is a list of benchmark spells by sorcerer/wizard spell level,

with explanations of why they are benchmarks. If you

create a spell and it’s better than a comparable benchmark

spell, your spell is too powerful.

1st Level

*Burning Hands*: This is the benchmark for 1st-level area

attack spells. It is even better than *sleep* because it can

affect up to six squares (sleep only affects 4 Hit Dice, which

means up to 4 creatures) and affects mindless creatures

and undead.

*Magic Missile*: Perhaps the best 1st-level spell in the game,

*magic missile* may not do a lot of damage, but it requires no

attack roll, has a medium range, needs no saving throw,

and harms incorporeal creatures. Even if *magic missile* were

2nd-level, smart casters would still learn it.

2nd Level

*Invisibility*: This is one of the best spells in the game,

and is only improved on by *greater invisibility* getting rid

of the breaks-on-attack aspect. This spell is great for

scouting, great in combat to set up attacks, and great for

healers (as healing doesn’t end the spell).

*Resist Energy*: This defensive spell works exactly like

monster energy resistances, so it’s a perfect example of the

power level of this sort of spell. It also scales at higher caster

levels, keeping it a viable spell even later in the game.

*Web*: This is a powerful, nonlethal spell that remains

viable even at higher levels (even a lich who makes his save

against a web has to deal with the difficult terrain and

risks becoming stuck if he moves). It even provides cover,

and can be set on fire to damage targets in the area.

3rd Level

*Dispel Magic*: This spell sets the standard for negating

other magic without a specific counter.

*Displacement*: This short-duration combat spell makes

attackers miss 50% of the time, setting the standard for

one-target defensive spells.

*Fireball*: This is the definitive low-level area attack spell.

Gaining this spell changes the paradigm of the game,

allowing spellcasters to deal a large amount of damage to

multiple targets anywhere they can see.

*Fly*: This is the most important movement spell, usable

in combat to great effect and allowing easy maneuverability

around the battlefield.

*Lightning Bolt*: This spell establishes that a line of this

range is about the same power level as a 20-foot burst.

*Stinking Cloud*: Capable of neutralizing many foes at

a good range, *stinking cloud* is the best multiple-target

nonlethal spell of its level.

*Suggestion*: This is the lowest-level spell in which the

caster is able to compel the target to act, yet the spell’s

control is still limited to “reasonable actions.”

4th Level

*Dimension Door*: This is the lowest-level spell that lets

you teleport; it has a limited range and disorients you

until your next turn.

*Enervation*: This is the lowest-level spell that gives the

target negative levels.

*Phantasmal Killer*: This is the lowest-level spell that can

directly kill a creature, but allows two saves to resist it.

5th Level

*Cloudkill*: This spell is key because it automatically

kills weak creatures, deals poison damage each round to

stronger creatures in the area, persists for several rounds,

and moves.

*Cone of Cold*: This spell is an interesting benchmark

because it’s actually a weak spell for its level; at the level

you gain it, *fireball* does just as much damage and at a

longer range, and *cone of cold*’s damage cap is only 5 dice

higher than *fireball*. If your 5th-level attack spell is weaker

than this spell, you should increase its power or consider

making it a 4th-level spell.

*Dominate Person*: This is the lowest-level spell that

allows you to utterly control a hostile intelligent creature

(with the exception of self-destructive orders).

*Wall of Stone*: This is the lowest-level spell that creates

a large-scale, permanent (instantaneous) object out of

nothing (compare as well to *fabricate*, which permanently

reshapes raw materials into finished goods).

6th Level

*Contingency*: This spell lets the caster set up conditions to

trigger another spell effect, whether something direct such

as a protective spell or something paranoid like an escapeteleport.

In many ways it models what an immediate-action

Quicken Spell feat would be like. Because it lasts 1 day per

level, the caster can prepare the contingency on one day

and adventure the next day with a full allotment of spells.

*Guards and Wards*: Although not often used by PCs

because they usually don’t have permanent residences,

this spell is important because it establishes that a largearea

defensive spell can use multiple effects to protect a

home and befuddle invaders.

7th Level

*Limited Wish*: This powerful spell lets the caster pick

effects from countless available lower-levels spells at the

time of casting, even those from different class lists.

*Mind Blank*: This spell is an example of a very narrowly

focused defensive spell that is able to block even higherlevel

spells from affecting the target.

8th Level

*Clone*: This spell is the key to arcane immortality—it

acts like *contingency* plus *raise dead* but costs fewer gp, and it

can save characters even if all of them die unexpectedly.

*Irresistible Dance*: While this spell can’t kill its target

outright, it does prevent the target from taking actions

and give the target huge penalties, and (in a way) it does

so without allowing a saving throw (while the spell does

technically allow a save, even a successful save applies these

effects for 1 round).

9th Level

*Gate*: This powerful spell combines all of the *planar ally*/

*planar binding* effects and can be used to transport many

creatures between planes.

*Miracle/Wish*: The pinnacle of spellcasting, these spells

can duplicate almost any weaker spell, obliterate most

harmful effects, revive the dead, or even turn back time.

If your spell is better than *wish*, you’re trying to play god.

*Time Stop:* This is the only spell in the game that lets

the caster take multiple rounds’ worth of actions and

simultaneously prevents anyone else from doing anything

about it.
