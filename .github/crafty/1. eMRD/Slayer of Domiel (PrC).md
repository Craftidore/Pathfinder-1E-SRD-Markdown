# Slayer of Domiel (PrC)
## Overview
Assassins, of course, are evil by their nature and the

nature of what they do: committing murder for money

is a completely evil act. However, sometimes the skill

set of an assassin is required for more noble purposes.

Claiming the power of the paragon archon

Domiel, the slayers of Domiel are a disciplined,

secretive order of stealthy spies and—when

the need arises—assassins who serve the

cause of law and good. Rather than relying

entirely on stealth and poison, the

slayers of Domiel use supernatural

means to dispatch evil foes.

Rogues most commonly become

slayers of Domiel. On very

rare occasions, the order accepts

former assassins who

have repented and atoned

for their past evil deeds

and wish to become slayers.

Some slayers also

have monk, fighter,

or even paladin

levels. Sorcerer/

rogues and cleric/

rogues are also

found among their numbers.

Slayers of Domiel often work closely

with other lawful good characters, but

not often with other slayers. Every

slayer has a superior in the order

responsible for mentoring,

training, and supervising her progress, but some slayers go for months between meetings

with their superiors. Few slayers know of more than one or two

other slayers besides their mentors.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the slayer of Domiel

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Slayers of Domiel gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: A slayer of Domiel has the

ability to cast a small number of

divine spells. To cast a slayer of

Domiel spell, the slayer

must have a Wisdom

score of at least 10 +

the spell’s level, so a

slayer of Domiel

with a Wisdom of

10 or lower cannot

cast these

spells. Slayer of

Domiel bonus

spells are based

on Wisdom, and

saving throws

against these

spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level

+ the slayer’s

Wisdom modifier.

When the slayer of

Domiel gets 0 spells

of a given spell level

(for instance, 1st-level

spells for a 1st level

slayer of Domiel), she

gets only the bonus spells

she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that

spell level.

The slayer of Domiel’s spell list appears below. A slayer of

Domiel prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

slayer cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Death Touch (Su): A slayer of Domiel can slay living evil

opponents with a single touch. She must succeed on a melee

touch attack against the target. When she touches, she rolls 1d6

per slayer level. If the total at least equals the target’s current hit

points, it dies. This is a death effect, and it has no effect on nonevil

creatures.

A slayer of Domiel can use this ability more often as she

increases in levels, as shown on Table 5–17.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If a slayer of Domiel can catch an opponent

when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her

attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a

slayer’s target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC

(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the

slayer’s attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level

and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd,

5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit

with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

within 30 feet.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make

a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal

damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual

–4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in

order to execute the sneak attack.

A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with

discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and

incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that

is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The

slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a

vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer of

Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment

or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are

beyond reach.

If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

Divine Grace (Su): A 2nd-level slayer of Domiel applies her

Charisma bonus as a bonus on all saving throws.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 6th level, a slayer of Domiel’s

evasion ability improves. When subjected to an attack that normally

allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the slayer

takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw and half

damage if the saving throw fails.
