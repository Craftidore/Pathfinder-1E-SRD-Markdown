# Unpredictable (Trait)
## Overview
**Unpredictable**: Your actions often seem random and chaotic to others, but there is a method to your madness. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks, and [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] is always a class skill for you. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 61
