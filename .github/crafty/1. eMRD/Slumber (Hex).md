# Slumber (Hex)
## Overview
*Slumber (Su):* A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to fall into a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*. The creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to the witchâ€™s level. This hex can affect a creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise or light, but others can rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends immediately if the creature takes damage. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
