# Speaking Stones (WondArch)
## Overview
**Speaking Stones:** Any character that enters this stronghold space can understand and communicate with the stone and rock in the space, whether natural or worked. This functions like a *stone tell* spell.

While this bit of wondrous architecture is most often created as part of an open courtyard lined with rocks or floored with stones, you can just as easily work it into an any other place in which you might wish to speak with rocks. Some stronghold owners place this upon a vault or other important room, allowing them to question the walls themselves about intruders.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Stone Tell (Spell)|stone tell]]**; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
