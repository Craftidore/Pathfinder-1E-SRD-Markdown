# Breathtaker (Ex)
## Overview
*Breathtaker (Ex):* The barbarian’s blows take the air from her foes’ lungs. While raging, whenever the barbarian makes a successful melee attack against an opponent that is holding its breath, in addition to any other effects caused by that attack, the opponent loses a number of rounds of breath equal to the barbarian’s Strength modifier.
