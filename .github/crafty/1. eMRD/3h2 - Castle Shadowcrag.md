# 3h2 - Castle Shadowcrag
## Overview
**Castle Shadowcrag**

Once the home of House Stross (and called Castle Stross at that time), this black stone ruin lies in the Margreve forest and is sparsely inhabited by dour dwarves and a few human holdouts. The village below burned the same night that Zobeck’s rebels hung the men, women, and children of House Stross from the battlements. Ever since, the place has had an evil reputation. The castle sits a day’s ride north of the Oros Bridge. The Free Army maintained a presence here for some years, but abandoned it as unexplained casualties mounted. Most consider the ruin haunted by fey and dark memories.
