# Unseen But Not Undone (Trait)
## Overview
**Unseen But Not Undone:** Without a single gesture, you can unleash a bloodline spell. Once per day, you can cast a bloodline spell as if you had the [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]] feat. Using this trait does not modify the spell's level.

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 58
