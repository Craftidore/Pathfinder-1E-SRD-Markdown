# Magical Lineage (Trait)
## Overview
**Magical Lineage:** One of your parents was a gifted spellcaster who not only used metamagic often, but also developed many magical items and perhaps even a new spell or twoâ€”and you have inherited a fragment of this greatness. Pick one spell when you choose this trait. When you apply metamagic feats to this spell that add at least 1 level to the spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for determining the spell's final adjusted level.
