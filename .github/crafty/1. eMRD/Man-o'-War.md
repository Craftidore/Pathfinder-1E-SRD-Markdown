# Man-o'-War
## Overview
**Man-o’-War:** These sailing behemoths are the height of military naval engineering. Generally fleet flagships commanded by admirals, men-o’-war rarely leave port with fewer than a dozen other warships accompanying them. With up to 50 ballistae on three or four decks, half a dozen heavy catapults, and hundreds of fighting sailors, marines, clerics, and wizards, these intimidating ships are virtually unstoppable.
