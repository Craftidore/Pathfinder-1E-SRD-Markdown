# Trophy Hall, Fancy (Museum)
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 6,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One guard per shift

More like a museum than a storage area, this polished wood- or stone-floored chamber holds its trophies in glass cases. Engravings detail each piece and its history. A guard stands watch over the valuables here at all times.

If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
