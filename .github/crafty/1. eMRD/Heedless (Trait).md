# Heedless (Trait)
## Overview
**Heedless**

You naturally sacrifice accuracy to put more power behind your blows.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls after successful melee attacks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be loudly passionate about entering combat and overcoming roes through strength of arms, or they might be quiet and so desperate to avoid confrontation that they put extra effort into every blow in an attempt to end the encounter more quickly.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Named changed from *reckless* to *heedless* to avoid duplication.
