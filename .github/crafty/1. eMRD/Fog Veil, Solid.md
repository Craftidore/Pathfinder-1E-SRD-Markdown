# Fog Veil, Solid
## Overview
**Fog Veil, Solid:** This augmentation works like *[[Fog Veil|fog veil]],* but the thick fog reduces movement through it to 10% of normal. Also, all melee attack and melee damage rolls suffer a â€“2 penalty. Except for magic rays and the like, ranged attacks are not permitted through the *solid fog veil*.

A creature falling or leaping into the *solid fog veil* takes 1d6 less falling damage for each 10 feet of the fog he passes through before hitting the ground. Only a severe wind (31+ mph) can disperse this fog, and it does so in 1 round. Once the winds die down, however, the fog returns within 1d4 rounds.

*Caster Level:* 7th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Solid Fog (Spell)|solid fog]]; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
