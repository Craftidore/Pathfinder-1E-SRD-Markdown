# Observant Illusion
## Overview
**Observant Illusion (Su)**

You can project your senses into any ongoing figment or shadow illusion you create with a spell of at least 3rd level. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift or move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Deafened|deafened]]. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to choose this discovery.
