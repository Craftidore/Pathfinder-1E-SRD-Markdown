# Platform of Levitation, Lesser (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Levitation, Lesser:** Anyone standing upon this square platform can cause it to levitate up or down at a rate of 20 feet per round. If more than one person attempts to direct the *platform of levitation* at once, the winner of an opposed Wisdom check gains control for that round. In the case of a tie, the platform stays remains in place for 1 round. When not in use, the platform levitates in place.

The* lesser platform of levitation* measures 5 feet on a side and can lift up to 250 pounds of material in addition to the platform itself.

A *lesser platform of levitation* usually serves used as a magic elevator, bringing beings and light goods from one level of a stronghold to another.

Some stronghold owners use the *platform of levitation* to travel between floors. When the platform is in place, it serves as both ceiling and floor, sealing the room from unwanted visitors.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]*; Market Price: 6,000 gp.
