# Suel Lich (Template)
## Overview
Suel liches are ancient undead spellcasters who managed to survive the Rain of Colorless Fire that destroyed their homeland.

Something of a cross between a lich and a malevolent ghost, a Suel lich is a creature of negative energy that must possess a living creature’s body in order to continue its existence. A Suel lich burns out its host body quickly and must take a new host on a regular basis. Because of this they cannot isolate themselves for long periods like other liches. Some still roam the world in search of knowledge and power, while others hole themselves up with a ready supply of minions so they can continue their research. As little knowledge survived the Rain of Colorless Fire, only a handful of sages and loremasters have even heard of such creatures.

Outside of a host body, a Suel lich looks like an [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] being made of fiery black energy. When possessing a body, its eyes glow with black flames and its skin becomes coarse and leathery; its condition worsens the longer it holds that body, until eventually it is little more than a wrinkled husk whose head is surrounded by black fire.

**Creating A Suel Lich**

“Suel lich” is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid arcane spellcaster of at least 15th level (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A Suel lich has all the base creatures’ statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Size and Type:** The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged. When not possessing a body, a Suel lich is [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] and has the [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] subtype.

**Speed:** A Suel lich in [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] form has a fly speed of 40 (perfect).

**Hit Dice:** Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s. When possessing a body, the body uses its original hit points (tracked separately from the lich’s own hit points).

**Armor Class:** When possessing a body, a Suel lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature’s natural armor bonus, whichever is better. In its [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] form, a Suel lich has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (minimum +1).

**Attack:** A Suel lich possessing a body has a touch attack that it can use once per round (when not possessing a body, this is an [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] touch attack). If the base creature can use weapons, the Suel lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A Suel lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any).

**Full Attack:** A Suel lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).

**Damage:** A Suel lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that deals 1d8+5 points of damage, half of which is fire and half of which is negative energy. A Suel lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage (half fire, half negative energy) on one natural weapon attack. The Suel lich’s touch attack also causes paralysis (see below).

**Special Attacks:** A Suel lich retains all the base creature’s special attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 Suel lich’s HD + Suel lich’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.

**Deadly Fear Aura (Su):** Suel liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 3 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or die of fright; those that save are [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1d10 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same Suel lich’s aura for 24 hours.

**Malevolence (Su):** Once per round, an [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] Suel lich can attempt to possess a living humanoid creature. This ability is similar to a *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* spell. Creatures slain in this way can only be brought back with a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*.

A possessed body ages at three times the normal rate. If the host dies due to age, is reduced to 0 hit points, or the Suel lich gains a level, the suel lich is forced out of the host (which causes the body to combust) and must possess a new body within 1 hour or be destroyed. Any other circumstances that force the Suel lich out of its host render the host useless and force the Suel lich to seek out a new one.

**Paralyzing Touch (Su):** Any living creature a Suel lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1d10 minutes. *[[Remove Paralysis (Spell)|Remove paralysis]]* or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the *[[Bestow Curse (Spell)|bestow curse]]* spell description). The effect cannot be dispelled.

**Spells:** A Suel lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive. It no longer needs material components for its spells unless they have a gp cost. If the base creature has levels in an arcane class that prepares spells, part of the process for becoming a Suel lich imprints its prepared spells on its mind, allowing it to prepare those spells without a spellbook (similar to the [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] feat); other spells it learns later must be prepared through the normal methods.

**Special Qualities:** A Suel lich retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described below.

**Damage Reduction (Su):** A Suel lich possessing a body has damage reduction 15/magic. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Immunities (Su):** Liches have immunity to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks.

**Spell Resistance:** A Suel lich has spell resistance equal to 10 + its Hit Dice.

**Turn Resistance (Ex):** A Suel lich has +4 turn resistance. If turned while possessing a body, it is forced out of its host.

**Vulnerability (Ex):** A Suel lich in its [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] form is vulnerable to *[[Dispel Evil (Spell)|dispel evil]]*; instead of driving the creature back to its home plane (its native plane is the Material Plane), a Suel lich that fails its spell resistance check and saving throw against the caster’s touch attack is immediately destroyed.

**Abilities:** Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being an [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] undead, a lich has no Strength or Constitution score (although when possessing a body it uses the body’s Strength score).

**Skills:** Suel liches have a +8 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.

**Organization:** Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2–4 vampires and 5–8 vampire spawn).

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature + 2.

**Treasure:** Standard coins; double goods; double items.

**Alignment:** Any evil.

**Advancement:** By character class. Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +5.

**Sample Suel Lich**

Dressed in raiment of an adventurer, leaning on a burnt staff, this menace cackles with a throat choked with ash. His flesh is coarse and leathery, and his eyes glow with black flame.

This example uses a 15th-level human wizard as the base creature. It is possessing the body of a male human with Str 12, Dex 14, Con 10, and 100 hit points. If the body is killed, the Suel lich is forced to leave it and assume its [[Incorporeal|incorporeal]] form which has Str —, Dex 12, Con —, and 103 hp.
