# Easy Way or the Hard Way (Trait)
## Overview
**Easy Way or the Hard Way:** You are skilled at subduing your enemies. Whenever you attack one of your favored enemies with a weapon that deals lethal damage and choose to deal nonlethal damage, you take only a –2 penalty on the attack roll instead of the normal –4.
