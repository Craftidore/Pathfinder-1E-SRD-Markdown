# Wooden Plating
## Overview
**Wooden Plating**

For protection during naval combat, this ship has received additional wooden planks nailed to its hull.

**Benefit:** The hull’s hit points are increased by 5% and its hardness is increased by 2. However, this reduces cargo capacity by 10% as extra room must be made inside for beams to support the reinforcements. The ship’s tactical speed in shipto- ship combat is not affected, but its waterborne speed is reduced by 10%.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 25; Cost: 20% of base ship cost
