# Missing Chamber (WondArch)
## Overview
**Missing Chamber:** This stronghold space—and everyone and everything inside it—is difficult to detect by divination spells, *detect* spells, and magic items that mimic these effects. For such a spell or item to work, the caster or item must succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 16.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 80
