# Temple Raider (PrC)
## Overview
Olidammara’s worshipers don’t have many temples

of their own, but some of them spend

a great deal of time in the temples

of other deities—robbing them

of every valuable that’s even

remotely portable. The temple

raiders are an elite cadre of

thieves who worship the Laughing

Rogue and specialize in stealing

valuables and secret lore from

the temples of other deities. Few

enterprises are as dangerous as

breaking into a temple, so Olidammara

grants limited spellcasting

abilities to temple raiders in his service.

Temple raiders are always listening for

news of great riches or dark secrets at the temples of

other deities, and they eagerly chase down rumors of

hidden shrines and half-buried temples from bygone ages.

However, they typically have plenty of time between raids

for normal adventuring, which they undertake frequently

with their deity’s blessing. After all, dungeon adventuring

hones the skills that the temple raider needs for special

missions—such as liberating the war-booty that the

clerics of St. Cuthbert’s temple are now bringing home for

safekeeping.

Rogues and bards usually have the skills a temple raider

needs, whereas only a few rare clerics—even those of

Olidammara—can pick a lock

or sabotage a trap well enough

to meet the temple raiders’ standards.

Some rangers also fi nd the

life of a temple raider to their liking.

NPC temple raiders usually work in

small teams, using stealth, disguise, or

magic to infi ltrate a rival temple secretly.

Once inside, they plunder the treasury,

steal religious relics, and abscond with

any secrets the clerics of the rival

temple cared to write down. If all

goes well, they slip out unnoticed, but

they’re not above fi ghting their way to

freedom. They know that the penalty

for stealing from a temple is

usually death, so they’re quick to draw

blades when capture seems imminent.

Clerics who venerate other deities consider

temple raiders a menace, so most of

the latter pose as rogues, bards, or even

clerics of Olidammara instead. Player

characters may encounter NPC temple

raiders fl eeing from town with their latest

victims on their heels, or in the midst of

planning a raid.

Adaptation: Any deity of rogues,

thieves, or secret knowledge could be a

patron for a temple raider. Other campaigns

may feature specifi c items or treasures that

are kept by churches which would tempt a

temple raider into stealing.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the temple raider

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Temple raiders gain

profi ciency with all simple weapons and with the rapier. In

addition, they gain profi ciency with light and medium armor.

Spells per Day: A temple raider has the ability to cast a

small number of divine spells. To cast a temple raider spell,

a temple raider must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 +

the spell’s level, so a temple raider with a Wisdom of 10 or

lower cannot cast these spells. Temple raider bonus spells

are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells

have a DC of 10 + spell level + the temple raider’s Wisdom

modifi er. When the temple raider gets 0 spells per day of a

given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level temple

raider), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled

to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The temple

raider’s spell list appears below. A temple raider has access to

any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare,

just as a cleric. A temple raider prepares and casts spells just

as a cleric does (though a temple raider cannot spontaneously

cast *cure* or *infl ict* spells).

A temple raider must spend 1 hour each night in quiet

contemplation and supplication to Olidammara to regain

his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no

effect on whether he can prepare spells.

Trapfi nding (Ex): Like rogues, temple raiders can use

the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Diffi culty

Class higher than 20. They can also use the Disable Device

skill to disarm magic traps.

A temple raider who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more with

a Disable Device check can study a trap, fi gure out how it

works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.

Trap Sense (Ex): A temple raider has an intuitive sense

that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus

on Refl ex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to

AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by an

additional +1 every three levels above 1st (to +2 at 4th level,

+3 at 7th, and +4 at 10th).

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 2nd level, a temple raider gains the

ability to sneak attack opponents. This functions identically

to the rogue’s sneak attack ability (see the Rogue section in

Chapter 3 of the *Player’s Handbook*). At 2nd level, the temple

raider’s extra damage on a successful sneak attack is +1d6,

and this rises by +1d6 per three temple raider levels thereafter.

If he already has the sneak attack ability from a previous

class, the damage bonuses stack.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, a temple raider gains

the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally

allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity modifi er

to AC (if any) even if he is caught fl at-footed or struck by

an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity

modifi er to AC if immobilized.

If a temple raider already has uncanny dodge from a

different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny

dodge (see below) instead.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A temple raider of

6th level or higher can no longer be fl anked; he can react to

opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react

to a single attacker. This defense denies an enemy the ability

to sneak attack the temple raider by fl anking him, unless the

attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target

has temple raider levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second

class, the levels from the class(es) that grant uncanny dodge

stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to

fl ank the temple raider. For example, only a rogue of 17th

level or higher could fl ank a 7th-level rogue/6th-level

temple raider.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 9th level, a temple raider becomes

so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them

reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this

ability, he selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence

modifi er. When making a skill check with one of

these skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distraction

would normally prevent him from doing so.

Luck Domain: At 10th-level, the luck of Olidammara

rubs off on a temple raider, granting the character access to

the Luck domain. He may use the domain’s granted power

and adds the domain’s spells to his temple raider spell list

(but not any other spell lists he might have). If he already

has the Luck domain, he can use its granted power one

additional time per day.

Temple Raider Spell List

Temple raiders choose their spells from the following list.

1st Level: *detect law, detect secret doors, disguise self, invisibility*

*to undead, obscuring mist, protection from law*.

2nd Level: *augury, cat’s grace, darkvision, delay poison, invisibility,*

*lesser restoration, undetectable alignment.*

3rd Level: *locate object, magic circle against law, nondetection,*

*obscure object, remove curse, resist energy, see invisibility*.

4th Level: *air walk, confusion, death ward, freedom of movement,*

*neutralize poison, restoration, spell immunity*.

In addition, 10th-level temple raiders add the 1st- through

4th-level spells from the Luck domain to their spell list.
