# C01 - The Legacy
## Overview
After thousands of years of epic history over an infinite and expanding stage of worlds and planes, certain stories still resound with mythical significance. Of those, tales of mighty weapons, relics of exceptional power, and artifacts of previous civilizations are especially potent. Who doesn’t thrill to the tale of *Excalibur*, the sword that can be drawn from the stone only by one worthy to rule? All shudder to think on the soul-drinking blade *Stormbringer*, and the price that its wielder must pay. So, too, do we read in awe of the *One Ring*, with its ability to confer on the wearer powers so vast that only those of already exceptional ability can unlock the ring’s potential.

These are weapons of legacy. Many are items crafted in a long-ago age when legends walked the mortal world. These mighty tools have since been lost, secreted away, or destroyed, so that now they are no longer within the reach of mortals.

Perhaps they are still among us, but unrecognized as the mighty relics once hailed throughout the lands.

The world also holds new heroes, who are creating new legends and forging new items of legacy in their telling.

## What is a Weapon of Legacy
“Weapon of legacy” describes all the items created using the rules in this book, even those that wouldn’t normally be described as weapons (such as rings or shields). Usually, this book uses the more general term “item of legacy” or “legacy item.”

An item of legacy has the capacity to grow in power as its wielder advances in level. In addition, it confers increasingly powerful special abilities on its wielder. That character might carry and treasure the same item over her entire career as a hero (or villain). Why not? As her own talents and abilities progress, so too do those of the legacy item, assuming the wielder takes the time to learn its complete history and awaken its quiescent power with the appropriate rituals.

As a player character, you could discover or inherit an item of legacy. Initially, it might seem like nothing more than a standard magic item. Only when you learn something of its past do you begin to understand that this object has untapped potential. By uncovering the item’s full history, you can discover the keys that unlock the item’s full power.

You might even found your own item of legacy. After all, the player characters are the epic heroes of a campaign, from which arise myths, relics, and weapons of legend. By founding an item of legacy, you gain some degree of control over its abilities, although how you wield it is in the hands of fate (and the Dungeon Master). See Chapter 4: Founding Legacies for more about this option.

Every item of legacy is distinct from the next, and each has its own unique story. Unearthing that story (or creating it, when founding an item of legacy) allows you to gain the full benefits of the item. For example, the story of *Caladbolg,* which appears only when a great hero has need of it, contrasts sharply with that of *Stormchaser’s Cudgel*, whose heritage involves the murder of the weapon’s original owner, Suldan Kabrel the giant slayer.

No matter what items of legacy you eventually discover or create, using such items entails a steep personal cost. The specifics are different for each item, but the costs are always substantial. You must consider the consequences before taking up a legacy item.

For most characters, these costs are well worth paying.

**WHY USE ITEMS OF LEGACY?**

If you’re a DM, items of legacy provide exciting rewards for players whose characters are willing to devote time and energy to learning about your campaign world. To unlock the powers of a legacy item, a player character must learn fabled legends of ancient history and complete rituals of mythic significance. Not only does this require the player to study the “backstory” of your world but also provides any number of ready-made adventure hooks for the campaign.

If you’re a player, a legacy item presents a way of personalizing your character while simultaneously building up her might. By tying her development to one of the great tales of history, your character takes on heroic proportions. Who knows? She might even become more famous than the first owner of the legacy item, unlocking powers of even greater potential.

## Artifact or Legacy Item?
At first blush, artifacts and legacy items look similar, and they do share many traits. However, they are distinct from each other and should remain separate entities. Both are extremely powerful, and neither should be considered just another piece of equipment. But an artifact’s power can be the hub upon which campaigns spin, while legacy items shake the world less—if only because their abilities are not free to all comers. Of course, the search to discover an item of legacy (or reforge a destroyed one) can still produce exciting and memorable storylines.

Artifacts are generally constructed in a distant age using spells and rites that are beyond the ken of present-day knowledge. They survive to this day, but the knowledge necessary to duplicate their creation does not. Their abilities are also always available to any would-be wielder, regardless of how much or little knowledge he has of the artifact’s history, and do not require costly rituals to unlock.

Legacy items are not always lost wonders—even today, a new legacy might be founded. If one is located, only a dedicated researcher can discover and use its powers, and then only after undergoing one or more legacy rituals. Such items might be more plentiful than artifacts, but because of their hidden nature and forgotten lineage, their true numbers are unknown.

## Items of Legacy in Your Game
As a DM, you might hesitate to introduce these potentially powerful items into your campaign. In this section you will find helpful points, background information, and expanded rules to help you deal with the challenges of legacy items.

**INTRODUCING LEGACY ITEMS**

As with any new addition to your campaign, you must determine how items of legacy fit in. What role (if any) did they play in the history of the campaign world? Why haven’t the player characters heard of them before now? Are there any active items of legacy in the world today? Most important, do the PCs—knowingly or unknowingly—possess any legacy items already?

**Revisionist History**

Retroactively changing your campaign’s history is the easiest way to incorporate legacy items into your game: They have always been a part of the world. Up to now, though, the PCs either hadn’t encountered a legacy item, or they never realized that the undistinguished *+1 longsword* wielded by the fighter actually has a long and storied history.

Another way to accomplish this goal is to reintroduce formerly encountered NPCs and monsters. They reappear, wielding the same signature items or weapons—this time, these items are far more powerful in the foes’ hands. For example, the half-orc assassin Terl tries once again to fulfill his contract on one of the PCs after having failed in an earlier attempt. Terl still wields his signature ebony-black bow, but this time around, it looses a shaft of utter darkness, death wrapped in a shadow. This bow is the same weapon, but Terl has unlocked an ability it once conferred upon a previous wielder. Alternatively, Terl was involved in some momentous event (one that the PCs perhaps have heard of ) that allowed him to imbue his favorite weapon of assassination with legacy abilities. Either way, the PCs’ ongoing interaction with Terl and his bow can be a vehicle for introducing legacy items to your campaign.

**First Founding**

Maybe your PCs haven’t heard of legacy items before because they are among the first to found such mighty creations. The following are some possibilities for explaining why this is so.

- Your world is young. The PCs are its earliest heroes, who will form the basis of legends, and of legendary items, in future ages.
- An invasion, revolution, or other upheaval changes the world forever. The appearance of legacy items is just one of many momentous events at this time. The PCs themselves might be responsible for setting the change in motion (perhaps on concluding a great quest or fulfilling a long-term story arc), or they might have nothing to do with it but suddenly discover or found legacy items.
- Since legacy items are not easy to come by, a PC founds one instead. Founding a legacy requires a specific impetus. This could be sponsorship by an NPC with a different legacy item (to get the PC wielder on the right track), or completion of a grand quest (to discover the item or learn a piece of history necessary to perform a least ritual to unlock an existing item’s legacy).

The first characters to wield items of legacy have new abilities to explore, but they must first figure out how to unlock those abilities. They have to research the history of their legacy items, or discover a trove of relevant information from a time when larger-than-life heroes walked the world wielding mythical weapons.

### Designing Legacy Adventures
**DESIGNING LEGACY ADVENTURES**

Once you’ve decided to include legacy items in your campaign, you aren’t required to make all adventures contain some seed of legacy influence from that point on. For the most part, you need not change your game style at all.

You don’t even have to decide ahead of time if a particular magic item found in the course of adventuring is really a legacy item. Legacy abilities become available only after an item’s wielder discovers its history and further performs a ritual to unlock them. Thus, you enjoy the luxury of deciding when to reveal the item (say, the fighter’s magic battleaxe) as something more. For instance, you could have the party discover an old book containing an illustration of some important personage of yore carrying an identical-looking axe that blazes with power. Dropping this clue should make the fighter curious enough to try finding out more about his axe, possibly discovering that it once had great powers. Further clues garnered in the course of his investigation suggest that he could reawaken those powers with the proper ritual.

**Discovering a Legacy Item**

A blunt, if simplistic, assessment of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that it’s “all about the stuff.” Whatever other challenges it might offer or what skills the PCs must draw on to succeed, every adventure includes treasure. It’s the all-important reward that coaxes every would-be adventurer from the docile life of the commoner to one of exploration and glory.

From time to time, an item of magical power is unearthed from an age-old tomb or pried from the bloody hand of a finally vanquished nemesis. These are climactic moments, and the adventurers distribute such items among themselves with excitement and wonder.

Yet in almost every case, that beloved item is eventually eclipsed by some greater need or more potent magic. The possession once so cherished becomes obsolete, to be passed on to a cohort or even sold to finance the purchase of even more powerful items.

What if that item, seemingly possessed of only minor power, was more than it seemed? What if it had a legendary history, a pageant of great deeds and wondrous abilities far outstripping anything it seems capable of now?

**Legacy Items As Treasure**

Because legacy items initially look like standard magic items, you’re free to sometimes add one to the treasure normally gained for defeating a particular threat at a given Encounter Level. (Until its legacy powers have been unlocked, the item has no more apparent value than any other of its kind.) The party members may or may not discover the true lineage of the item, but if they do not, you can always introduce more legacy items in the guise of “ordinary” treasure later in the game.

The party might wrest an item of legacy from an NPC foe who wields it against them. Depending on whether it has unlocked any of the item’s legacy abilities, that opponent can present a greater challenge than usual.

If the foe has not yet unlocked the item, treat it as a normal part of that foe’s equipment. If it has completed one or more legacy rituals, do not reduce the value of its equipment, even though these rituals represent additional costs (this would be the equivalent of taking treasure away from the PCs). Instead, adjust the NPC’s Challenge Rating based on the number of legacy abilities to which it has access. These increases do not stack.


| **Legacy Abilities Unlocked** | **CR Increase** |
|---|---|
| Two or more least | +1 |
| Two or more lesser | +2 |
| Two or more greater | +3 |

**History**

If a magic item is found to possess a long and distinguished history, there is a good chance that it is an item of legacy. A partial record provides the historical thread that the item’s new wielder must follow to figure out how to awaken it to full power.

A legacy item’s history is an account of specific important events in its past that qualify it for legacy status. Spectacular defeats of horrific enemies, sudden reversals, and tragic losses: All play some part in the original empowerment of a legacy item. Before the latest owner can uncover and perform the rituals necessary to unlock its wondrous abilities, he or she must learn this history. In game terms, every item of legacy requires increasingly difficult [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) checks to piece together the fragments of legend associated with it. (Alternative methods of researching a legacy are discussed on page 205.)

**Legacy Rituals**

Every legacy item’s history contains a seed of opportunity that a new wielder can exploit. Through research, the wielder can learn what specific rites, procedures, or ceremonies are necessary to bond with the item.

With each ritual completed, a new range of legacy abilities become available. For instance, a wielder of *Stormchaser’s Cudgel* (see page 163) who learns some of the enormous club’s history can also learn the ritual of the Traceless Path. On completing the ritual and paying all associated costs, the wielder learns to use the weapon’s dazing strike ability. In addition to any tasks required as part of the ritual, every legacy ritual has a substantial gold piece cost for materials (such as unguents, fine robes, or other expensive items) expended during its performance.

A legacy item has up to three rituals associated with it, each one tied to a yet-more-obscure piece of its past. An item of particularly great importance has a more extensive history, and thus more associated rituals, than one with less influence on history. As a wielder discovers each piece of an item’s story, he or she learns each of its legacy rituals.

A legacy item’s wielder who completes a given ritual immediately gains a bonus legacy feat: Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, or Greater Legacy. For more information, see Legacy Feats on page 13. Each legacy feat is specific to the particular item whose connected ritual the wielder performs. For instance, if Aedwar completes the ritual of Sanctification of Darkness associated with his legacy weapon, *Exordius,* he gains the Least Legacy (*Exordius*) feat. From now on, he can use the weapon’s least abilities (assuming he has attained a high enough level), but only when wielding *Exordius.* If he were to wield another item of legacy, the Least Legacy (*Exordius*) feat wouldn’t allow him to use that item’s least abilities—he’d first have to research the new weapon’s history and perform its specific legacy rituals.

**SUMMARY: DISCOVERING A LEGACY WEAPON**

1. Discover an interesting item.

2. Determine whether the item has a special history.

3. Research history and determine if it is an item of legacy.

4. Learn the legacy ritual to unlock the item’s abilities.

5. Perform the ritual, pay required costs, and gain bonus legacy feat.

### Wielding an Item of Legacy
**WIELDING AN ITEM OF LEGACY**

After having completed at least one of the legacy rituals of your item, you are entitled to use the abilities of that item available to a character of your level.

That’s right—you don’t get them all at once. If you are 5th level and you have just earned the Least Legacy (*Bloodcrier’s Hammer*) feat, you do not have access to abilities of the weapon keyed to characters of 6th level and higher. However, as soon as you attain another level in any class, bringing your character level to 6th, you can use the earthseeker ability of *Bloodcrier’s Hammer* (see the weapon’s description on page 29).

Unless otherwise specified, an item of legacy confers a given ability as long as you are wearing or carrying it on your person; some abilities, however, require that you wield, gesture with, or in some way actively use the item. Such abilities’ descriptions state this specifically. Losing possession of the item immediately removes all legacy benefits.

**Personal Costs**

In addition to performing a ritual and paying its gp cost, you must pay personal costs to use a legacy item’s ability. All items of legacy exact substantial personal costs, which represent the item’s tapping into your vital energy to unlock its full potential. You must make this sacrifice willingly to forge the bond between wielder and item.

Personal costs are permanent and can range from hit point loss to forfeiting spell slots. You must pay a personal cost immediately upon reaching the level at which it is assessed, after all other level-related adjustments. For example, if you are the wielder of *Bloodcrier’s Hammer,* on reaching 6th level you immediately lose 4 hit points after determining your new hit point total. If you are unable to pay the cost (for example, because you do not have access to a required spell level), you do not gain that level’s legacy ability or abilities until you can pay.

Unlike legacy abilities, personal costs are assessed permanently, whether or not you have the item in your possession. The only way to recover a personal cost is to destroy or renounce the legacy item (see below).

**Renouncing a Legacy**

Perhaps the cost of wielding your legacy item is too high, or you have discovered a different item and no longer wish to wield the original one. If you wish, you can renounce your connection with a legacy item. This requires performing a 24-hour ritual that expends materials costing 1,000 gp. On concluding the ritual, you lose all bonus legacy feats (Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, Greater Legacy) you had previously gained for that item. For you the item now has only its nonlegacy properties, and you lose all legacy abilities you previously had access to. You recover any personal costs you previously paid (such as lost hit points or penalties), but not any gp costs paid for legacy rituals. If you regain lost skill points, you must allocate them immediately. Treat this as if you were purchasing skill ranks for the last class in which you advanced a level.

**Damaging Items of Legacy**

Items of legacy are more resistant to damage than standard magic items, but they can be damaged and even destroyed. Even so, it’s often possible to repair a broken legacy item (see Reforging Legacy Items, below).

As with any magic item, a legacy item doesn’t need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by an effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw against a damaging effect. Legacy items always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them—even attacks against which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Legacy items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). A legacy item’s saving throw bonus is +20.

Even if a legacy item is damaged (whether because of a failed save or through direct physical attack), it is tougher than a standard magic item of the same sort. A legacy item’s hardness is increased by 10, and its hit points are 50 or the total from materials and enhancements, whichever is higher. For instance, a legacy longsword with a +5 enhancement bonus has hardness 30 (10 for steel, +10 for the weapon’s enhancement, and +10 for being an item of legacy); its hit points total 55 (5 for the steel blade, +50 for the weapon’s enhancement). A damaged legacy item continues to function, but once it is destroyed, its legacy abilities are lost. However, a destroyed legacy item always leaves a tangible remnant—the shards of a sword’s blade, the metalshod heels of a staff, and so on. Even a legacy item destroyed by a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell leaves a remnant (this is an exception to the spell’s printed effect).

**Legacy Item against Legacy Item:** When a legacy item is used to attack another legacy item, it ignores the additional 10 hardness that the attacked item has by virtue of its legacy status. In other words, it treats the opposing item as a standard magic item of the same sort for the purpose of dealing damage, though both items retain their +20 bonus on saving throws.

**Repairing Legacy Items:** A legacy item that is damaged (but not destroyed) can be repaired using the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill, or with the *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]* spell, just as if it were a nonmagical item of the same sort. Destroyed legacy items must be reforged from their remnants, which requires much more effort (see below).

If a legacy item is destroyed, you lose your connection to it, just as if you had renounced the item. For you it has only its nonlegacy properties, and you lose all legacy abilities you previously had access to. You recover any personal costs you previously paid (such as lost hit points or penalties), but not any gp costs paid for legacy rituals.

**Reforging Legacy Items**

Though wondrously tough, sometimes legacy items are destroyed through physical damage or magical means. But, as noted above, they always leave behind remnants. Be they shards of a blade, a ring’s gemstone, or a few plates of loose armor, those remnants retain a residue of power that links them to the original item. Characters with the proper skill and knowledge can attempt to reforge the item from its remnants. Such an undertaking is often associated with an important quest, a great need, or some other compelling, campaign-related impetus.

If scanned using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]],* the remnants of a destroyed legacy item have a faint aura of no particular school. Obviously, the original wielder already knows what the remnants represent. Someone who doesn’t realize their true nature could learn the remnants’ history from clues found over the course of the campaign. This information is also available through the *[[Legend Lore (Spell)|legend lore]]* spell, as well as [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) or bardic knowledge checks. The check DC is equal to that required to learn the item’s least legacy ritual.

Once the remnants are recognized for what they are, a determined owner can attempt to restore the original legacy item from its fragments.

**Reforging by Previous Wielder:** If you are a previous wielder of a now-destroyed legacy item and wish to reforge it, you must repeat the highest legacy ritual (least, lesser, or greater) that you had previously completed for that item. You must again pay the gp cost of raw materials. Not more than one week before or after completing the ritual, you (or someone working on your behalf) must successfully repair the item as described above. Once the legacy item is reforged, it has the same connection to you as it did before it was destroyed; you regain lost legacy feats, and you immediately are again assessed any personal costs.

**Reforging by New Wielder:** If you discover the remnants of a legacy item and have identified them, you must make another [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) check to learn the least legacy ritual associated with the item. Next, you must perform the least legacy ritual, paying all associated costs. Not more than one week before or after completing the ritual, you (or someone working on your behalf) must successfully repair the item as described above. Once the legacy item is reforged, you gain the Least Legacy feat associated with the item and have access to its least abilities, assuming you are of the requisite level and meet any other prerequisites.

**Permanent Destruction**

A legacy item is not easily destroyed, but if you are determined to erase it permanently, a method does exist. (An example is the great quest required to destroy the *One Ring*.) You must possess the item’s remnants (which might require first destroying it). You then must perform the item’s least legacy ritual, paying all associated costs, as though reforging it. However, at the end of this procedure, the remnants are permanently destroyed beyond recall.

## Enhancing an Item of Legacy
**ENHANCING AN ITEM OF LEGACY**

The power of a legacy item cannot be further enhanced using any regular process (such as magic or psionic item creation feats). However, spells or effects that temporarily alter a weapon (such as *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]* or *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]*) work normally on weapons of legacy.

The only way to permanently change a legacy item’s abilities is through a new founding. For instance, the dagger *Devious* (see page 67) offers only least abilities, and historical research reveals no further lineage that might unlock additional abilities. If you want to give this weapon further legacy powers, use the rules in Chapter 4: Founding Legacies to found your own legacy and further empower the item with lesser abilities of your own design. As you progress in power, you might later choose to imbue it with greater legacy abilities or even epic legacy abilities.

## Legacy Against Legacy
It’s the climax of the campaign. The hero and the archvillain face each other in mortal combat, and each wields an item of legacy. Special rules come into play during and after such momentous events.

**A LEGACY DEFEATED**

If you wield a legacy item and defeat the wielder of another legacy item in personal conflict, you gain an immediate “gift” from releasing some of that item’s power. A flash of legacy power discharges from the defeated wielder’s item and into your own.

You are considered to have defeated the opposing wielder if you kill or render that wielder unconscious through a direct use of your legacy item (a blow from a weapon, a blast from a staff, and so on). Destroying the other wielder’s legacy item is not in itself sufficient.

Once you have defeated a legacy item wielder in this way, you can’t fight and defeat that wielder to gain another gift until one full year has passed. 

**Legacy against Artifact:** The wielder of a legacy item who defeats the wielder of an artifact gains the same flash of power that normally results from a legacy item defeating another legacy item. The reverse is also true.

**Legacy Gifts**

As soon as you defeat a legacy wielder, you gain your choice of one of the following gifts. Discover New Legacy: You unlock a new tier of legacy abilities in your item. Effectively, you have completed a founding event (see page 180) for the item. You must still design and perform the necessary legacy rituals and pay the associated costs if you wish to use these newfound abilities.

**Learn Legacy:** You instantly gain the knowledge of the next legacy ritual required to continue unlocking your item’s abilities, as if you had succeeded on the required [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) check. In addition, when performing that ritual, you do not pay the gp cost of raw materials (although you must complete any other required tasks). After thirty days, the knowledge is lost; you must make the requisite [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check and spend the normal gp cost to learn and perform the ritual as normal.

**Legacy Bonus:** You are granted an inspiration, which takes the form of a “floating” +10 bonus available for the next 1 minute (10 rounds). At any point during this time as an immediate action (see the sidebar on page 15), you can apply this bonus to a single attack roll, saving throw, skill or ability check, or caster level check.

**Legacy Healing:** You regain hit points equal to five times the character level of the defeated foe. You also recover all ability damage, whether temporary or permanent. You can’t gain more hit points than your normal maximum.

**Master Legacy:** You are treated as one level higher for the purpose of accessing your item’s legacy abilities, as if you had the Master Legacy feat (see page 15). The effect of this gift stacks with that of the feat but lasts for only 24 hours.

**Psionic Energy:** You gain temporary power points equal to the level of the defeated foe. These extra power points last until used or until 24 hours elapse, whichever occurs first.

**Spell Energy:** You recall one spell that you have cast during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The recalled spell is stored in your mind as though prepared in the normal fashion. If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. If you do not prepare spells to cast them, you instead regain one spell slot. The maximum level of spell restored is equal to half the character level of the defeated foe (maximum 9th).
