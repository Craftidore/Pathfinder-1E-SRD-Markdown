# Magic Is Life (Trait)
## Overview
**Magic Is Life (Nethys):** Your faith in magic allows you to reflexively use the energy of any spell effect currently on you to save you from death. As long as you are under the effects of a spell, you gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against death effects. If you are reduced to negative hit points while you are under the effects of any spell, you automatically confirm stabilization checks to stop bleeding.
