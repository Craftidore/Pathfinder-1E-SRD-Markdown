# Armor Runes
## Overview
**Armor Runes**

You can attune armor to not interfere, with your spellcasting.

**Prerequisite:** [[Arcane Armor Training (Feat)|Arcane Armor Training]]

**Benefit:** When you prepare your spells for the day, you can also place armor runes on one suit of armor. Placing an armor rune on a suit of armor requires you to sacrifice one spell slot for every level of spell you can cast. (Thus a 5th level wizard wishing to place armor runes on a suit of armor must sacrifice four total spell slots -- one 0-level, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level slot.) You do not suffer arcane spell failure for casting your wizard spells while wearing armor on which you have placed armor runes. This has no effect on spells you gain from other classes, or any armor on which you yourself did not place armor runes. Armor runes last until you next prepare spells, at which point they must be renewed.

Note that placing armor runes on armor does not give you any special proficiency with the armor.
