# Creation School
## Overview
**Creation School**

**Associated School**: Conjuration.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the acid dart power and the dimensional steps power of the conjuration school.

**Create Gear (Su)**: At 1st level, you can create any object that weighs no more than 1 pound per wizard level you possess. Creating an object in this way is a standard action. The item remains for 1 minute before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves your possession. Creating an item to an exact specification might require a Craft skill check, subject to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts. You could use this ability to create a dagger, but not a vial of alchemist’s fire. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Creator’s Will (Sp)**: At 8th level, you can cast *minor creation* as a spell-like ability. You can have no more than one *minor creation* active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately ends. At 12th level, this ability improves to *major creation*. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.
