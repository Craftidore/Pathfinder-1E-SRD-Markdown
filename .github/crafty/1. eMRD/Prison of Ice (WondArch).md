# Prison of Ice (WondArch)
## Overview
**Prison of Ice:** A permanent 7-inch-thick *[[Wall of Ice (Spell)|wall of ice]]* lines every inch of this stronghold spaceâ€™s outer walls, ceiling, and floor. Each 10-foot-square section of the bulwark has 21 hit points, and requires a Strength check (DC 17) to breach with a single attack. If a section of the *prison of ice* is breached, it repairs itself in 1d4 minutes.

Fire deals full damage to the *prison of ice,* instead of the normal half damage for objects. Suddenly melting a portion of the prison creates a cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes, after which the ice reforms instantly.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wall of Ice (Spell)|wall of ice]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
