# Chamber of Safety, Greater (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of Safety, Greater:** This wondrous architecture is identical to the standard *[[Chamber of Safety (WondArch)|chamber of safety]]*, except that ranged ammunition that misses a target within this stronghold space is reversed in midair. It then flies back to the original attacker, making a ranged attack with an attack bonus of +0 as if someone standing in the location of the original target had fired it.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Protection from Arrows (Spell)|protection from arrows]]**,* *[[Repel Wood (Spell)|repel wood]]**; Market Price:* 50,000 gp.
