# Nightsong Infiltrator (PrC)
## Overview
An expert at breaking into “secure” areas, a nightsong

infi ltrator is the perfect thief and the perfect spy. Whether

she is there to steal gold, information, jewels, or secrets,

an infi ltrator of the Nightsong Guild (see page 177) is

trained to do her job quickly and effi ciently. She practices

extensively with locks and traps, focusing on doing her job

under pressure and in unfavorable conditions. For example,

nightsong infi ltrators train extensively in climbing, since

they often have to scale walls and reach high windows.

They have little time to work on combat training and

relegate such concerns to their companions, the nightsong

enforcers (see the previous prestige class description).

Rogues most frequently and most easily become nightsong

infi ltrators. Bards, urban rangers, and intelligent

fi ghters can make good members of the class as well.

Rarer, but possible, are spellcasting nightsong infi ltrators

who use spells to get in and out of places. Woe to those

wishing to protect their valuables from a Nightsong Guild

member who can become invisible, walk through walls,

or teleport.

Members of the Nightsong Guild rarely work alone.

Usually they operate in teams, often in pairings of a

nightsong infi ltrator and a nightsong enforcer. (For a

PC nightsong infi ltrator, the other team member can be

an adventuring ally.) When working as part of a team, a

nightsong infi ltrator works best as the advance scout and

point person, while the other team members take care of

threats that she is unable to deal with (guards, mostly).

Adaptation: Like their companions the nightsong

enforcers, nightsong infi ltrators can easily be used to

represent a different group. Because its members are especially

effective in small groups, the nightsong infi ltrator

prestige class makes an excellent choice for any organization

that might form elite teams. Mercenary groups,

intelligence organizations (private or governmental), or criminal groups can be represented by this prestige class

with simple changes in the fl avor.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the nightsong

infi ltrator prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Nightsong infiltrators

gain no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Teamwork Trap Sense (Ex): A nightsong infi ltrator

has an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps,

giving her a +1 bonus on Refl ex saves made to avoid traps

and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks made

by traps. All allies within 30 feet of the infi ltrator also

gain these bonuses (even if they already have trap sense

from another class feature).

These bonuses increase to +2 at 4th level, to +3 at 7th

level, and to +4 at 10th level.

Trapfi nding (Ex): A nightsong infi ltrator can fi nd,

disarm, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She

can use the Search skill to fi nd, and the Disable Device

skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell

used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the

trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the

trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Steady Stance (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a nightsong

infiltrator remains stable on her feet when others

have difficulty standing. She is not considered flat-footed

while balancing or climbing, and she adds her class level

as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing

or climbing when she takes damage.

Teamwork Infiltration (Ex): Starting at 2nd level,

a nightsong infiltrator can study a small area (typically

up to 10 feet square, such as a doorway or guard post) in

order to prepare for infiltrating that area. If the infiltrator

spends 1 hour studying the area from a distance of

no more than 60 feet, she gains a +2 competence bonus

on Balance, Climb, Disable Device, Hide, Move Silently,

Open Lock, Search, and Tumble checks attempted in

that area for the next 24 hours. All allies within 30 feet

of the infiltrator gain the same bonus in that area. (The

allies need not be present while the infiltrator studies

the area.)

At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Break Away (Ex): Skilled as she is, a nightsong

infiltrator knows the sensibility of falling back from an

unwinnable fight. Starting at 3rd level, she gains a +4

dodge bonus to Armor Class in any round during which

she does nothing but move.

A nightsong infiltrator can grant this ability to an ally

within 30 feet as a swift action (see Swift Actions and

Immediate Actions, page 137). It lasts for 1 round.

Trackless Step (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a

nightsong infiltrator cannot be tracked in natural surroundings.

See the druid class feature, page 36 of the

*Player’s Handbook.*

At 7th level and higher, a nightsong infiltrator can

share this ability with up to one additional ally per class

level. Designating an ally for trackless step requires a

standard action and lasts for 24 hours or until the infiltrator

dismisses the effect (a standard action).

Detect Magic (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a nightsong

infiltrator can use *detect magic* at will. See the spell, page

219 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Teamwork Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 4th level,

a nightsong infiltrator deals an extra 1d6 points of damage

when flanking an opponent or any time the target would

be denied its Dexterity bonus. Any ally of the infiltrator

who is also flanking the infiltrator’s opponent deals this

extra damage as well. This extra damage applies to ranged

attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to

2d6 points at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page

50 of the *Player’s Handbook*. If a nightsong infiltrator or

her ally gets a sneak attack bonus from another source

(such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.

Defensive Roll (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a nightsong

infiltrator can attempt to roll with a potentially lethal

blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise

would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*.

Grant Move Action (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a

nightsong infiltrator can direct and motivate her allies to

act immediately. Once per day, as a standard action, she

can grant an extra move action to any or all of her allies

within 30 feet (but not herself). Each of the affected allies

takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their

current initiative order. This extra action does not affect

the allies’ initiative count; the round continues normally

after the infiltrator’s turn is over.

Starting at 9th level, a nightsong infiltrator can use

this ability twice per day.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If a nightsong infiltrator of

6th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally

allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half

damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 6th level, a nightsong infiltrator

has become so confident in the use of certain

skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse

conditions. When making a Climb, Disable Device,

Open Lock, or Search check, she can take 10 even if

stress and distractions would normally prevent her

from doing so.

Specialized Tools (Ex): After studying an area (see

teamwork infiltration, above), a nightsong infiltrator of

6th level or higher can prepare a special tool for a job.

Doing this requires 1 hour, a DC 15 Craft check (the

specific type of Craft specialty required is up to the

DM; blacksmithing, leatherworking, or woodworking

are all likely candidates), and a set of artisan’s tools for

the Craft skill in question.

The tool prepared by the infiltrator grants a +4

circumstance bonus on all checks made with one of

the following skills: Climb, Disable Device, Disguise,

Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Search,

or Sleight of Hand. This bonus doesn’t stack with the

circumstance bonus granted by any other set of tools

(such as a disguise kit or masterwork thieves’ tools). The

tool works only in the studied area, and it works only

for 24 hours (though the infiltrator can rebuild the tool

by following the same process).

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): A 10th-level nightsong

infiltrator can can use the Hide skill in natural terrain

even while being observed. See the ranger class feature,

page 48 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Raelia deals an extra 4d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Raelia

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Break Away (Ex): Raelia gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC

on any round in which she does nothing but move. She

can grant this ability to an ally within 30 feet as a swift

action. It lasts for 1 round.

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic sleep effects.

An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or

concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it

as if she where actively looking for it.

Evasion (Ex): If Raelia is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Steady Stance (Ex): Raelia is not considered flat-footed

while balancing or climbing, and she adds +3 to Balance

or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when

she takes damage.

Teamwork Infiltration (Ex): Raelia can study a small

area (typically up to 10 feet square, such as a doorway or

guard post) in order to prepare for infiltrating that area.

If she spends 1 hour studying the area from a distance of

no more than 60 feet, she gains a +2 competence bonus

on Balance, Climb, Disable Device, Hide, Move Silently,

Open Lock, Search, and Tumble checks attempted in

that area for the next 24 hours. All allies within 30 feet

of Raelia gain the same bonus in that area. (The allies

need not be present while she studies the area.)

Teamwork Trap Sense (Ex): Raelia has a +1 bonus on

Reflex saves made to avoid traps, and she adds a +1 dodge

bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. All allies within

30 feet of Raelia also gain these same bonuses (even if they

already have trap sense from another class feature).

Trackless Step (Ex): Raelia leaves no trail in natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Trapfinding (Ex): Raelia can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Raelia retains her Dexterity

bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

*Possessions: +2 studded leather, ring of protection +1, buckler*

*+2, +1 dagger, +1 silver dagger, cloak of resistance +1.*
