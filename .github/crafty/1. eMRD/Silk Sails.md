# Silk Sails
## Overview
**Silk Sails**

Few ship improvements are as beautiful as the addition of silk sails. These sails can be designed in whatever color the player desires; they are often embroidered with striking images of the sea. Such sails are usually imported from faraway lands. Silk sails give the ship superior rates of movement, as they capture and displace the wind more efficiently.

**Benefit:** A ship with silk sails gains a +1 bonus on opposed sailing checks to gain the upper hand. The shipâ€™s tactical speed in ship-to-ship combat is not affected, but its waterborne speed is increased by 10%.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (sails) DC 16; Cost: 15% of base ship cost
