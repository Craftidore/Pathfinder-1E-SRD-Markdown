# Blessed Scamp (Archetype)
## Overview
**Blessed Scamp (Rogue)**

These rogues live a charmed life; they have a habit of escaping every trap laid for them, and through seeming luck and incredible moxie they gain the upper hand in nearly all of their endeavors.

Blessed scamps have the following class features.

**Mischievous Strike (Ex):** At 1st level, a blessed scamp gains the ability to apply a debilitating condition on those she attacks while the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target has one or not). At higher level these attacks also deal more damage to the target. This ability acts as sneak attack, except that the bonus dice to damage start at +1d6 at 5th level, and reaches a maximum of +8d6 at 19th level.

When the blessed scamp hits a target denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, she can apply one of the following mischiefs to the target. The blessed scamp must choose the mischief that affects the target when she first deals damage, and, once chosen, she cannot change it. The DC for all mischiefs is 10 + blessed scamp level + Dexterity bonus.

*Befuddle*: The blessed scamp can confuse her opponent with her strikes. The target must succeed on a Will saving throw or suffer a 20% miss chance to all attacks made before the start of its next turn, and the target cannot make attacks of opportunity until the start of its next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.

*Low Blow*: The blessed scamp is able to strike where it really hurts. The target must succeed a Fortitude save or become [[Dazed|dazed]] until the start of its next turn.

*Shove*: The blessed scamp is able to push herself into the attack and knock her opponent backward. The target must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or be knocked 5 ft. away from the blessed scamp (scamp’s choice of square as long as the target ends in an open space that is at least 5 ft. away from the scamp).

*Trip*: The blessed scamp uses misdirection and some element of the terrain or the field of battle to knock her opponent off its feat. The target must succeed a Reflex saving throw or fall [[Prone|prone]]. Until the start of the blessed scamp’s next turn, if the target gets up, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity from her. This ability replaces sneak attack.

**Scamp’s Favor (Su):** At 1st level, if the blessed scamp has the favored racial trait of the jinnborn, she gains the Truly Favored feat as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the blessed scamp does not have that racial trait, she gains it as a supernatural ability. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Rogue Talents:** At 2nd level, a blessed scamp can take any of the standard rogue talents, as well as the following talents. This expands rather than replaces or alters the blessed scamp’s class features. All of the following talents affect the mischief in the mischievous strike class feature.

**Improved Shove (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the shove mischief, she can choose to move the target 10 ft. instead of 5 ft.

**Improved Trip (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the trip mischief, if the target gets up at any time, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you.

**Scamp’s Luck (Su):** At 3rd level, once per day as an immediate action after rolling a saving throw, the blessed scamp can add her Dexterity bonus to the saving throw. At 9th level she can do this twice per day. At 15th level she can do it three times per day. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Advanced Talents:** At 10th level, a blessed scamp can take any of the standard advanced rogue talents, as well as the following advanced talents. This expands rather than replaces or alters the blessed scamp’s class features. All of the following talents affect the mischief in the mischievous strike class feature.

**Improved Befuddle (Ex):** The blessed scamp can use the befuddle mischief even on mindless creatures and those immune to mind-affecting effects. When she does, the saving throw is a Reflex saving throw instead of a Will saving throw.

**Improved Low Blow (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the low blow mischief, and the target fails its saving throw, she can choose to stun the victim instead.
