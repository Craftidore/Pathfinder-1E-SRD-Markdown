# Zealous (Drawback)
## Overview
**Zealous:** You are fanatical in your beliefs, ruled by emotion over reason. When you attack a creature that you know worships a different religion than you do, you take a â€”5 penalty on the attack roll and a +2 trait bonus on the damage roll with your first attack.

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 65
