# Windstorm's Eye (WondArch)
## Overview
**Windstorm’s Eye:** This large (4-foot-wide) crystal orb maintains tornado-force winds (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) around the outside your stronghold at all times. See the description of the *[[Hurricane's Eye (WondArch)|hurricane’s eye]]* for details.

If you use this item in conjunction with a *[[Hurricane's Eye (WondArch)|hurricane’s eye]]* or a *[[Tornado's Eye (WondArch)|tornado’s eye]]*, they can each only function at the level of the weakest item.

*Caster Level:* 12th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Control Winds (Spell)|control winds]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
