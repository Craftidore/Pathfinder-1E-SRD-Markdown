# Room of Reading (WondArch)
## Overview
**Room of Reading:** Any literate creature in this stronghold space can automatically read magical inscriptions, as per a *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell. This effect is most often found in libraries, particularly those owned by spellcasters. It saves them the trouble of having to cast the *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell every time they want to puzzle out a bit of magical writing.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]**; Market Price:* 750 gp.
