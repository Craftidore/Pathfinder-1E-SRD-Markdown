# Control Breathing (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
**Control Breathing (Ex):** When the ninja fails a save against a spell or effect with the [[Emotion Spells|emotion]]\* descriptor, as an immediate action the ninja may make a second saving throw with a +1d6 morale bonus. If the second save is successful, the ninja is treated as having saved against the effect. On the ninjaâ€™s next turn the ninja is [[Staggered|staggered]] (as part of her action has been used to focus on and control her breathing to overcome the emotional effect). The ninja must have at least 1 ki point to use this trick.

\*This includes all [[Fear Spells|fear]] effects. For more information on the [[Emotion Spells|emotion]] descriptor, see Ultimate Magic.
