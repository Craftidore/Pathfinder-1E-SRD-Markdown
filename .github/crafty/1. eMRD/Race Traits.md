# Race Traits
## Overview
Race traits are tied to specific races. Your character must be of the specified race to select a race trait. However, the background generator draws from all lists, letting you ignore these restrictions. If using the background generator, you can take any trait you gain access to through it.

**Elf Race Traits**

Only elves can select these traits.

**Forlorn:** Having lived outside of traditional elf society for much or all of your life, you know the world can be cruel, dangerous, and unforgiving of the weak. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws.

**Warrior of Old:** As a child, you put in long hours on combat drills, and though time has made this training a dim memory, you still have a knack for quickly responding to trouble. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks.

**Gnome Race Traits**

Only gnomes can select these traits.

**Animal Friend:** You've long been a friend to animals, and feel safer when animals are nearby. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws as long as an animal (Tiny or larger, must be at least indifferent toward you) is within 30 feet, and [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] is always a class skill for you.

**Rapscallion:** You've spent your entire life thumbing your nose at the establishment and take pride in your run-ins with the law. Somehow, despite all your mischievous behavior, you've never been caught. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks and a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks.

**Half-Elf Race Traits**

Only half-elves can select these traits.

**Elven Reflexes:** One of your parents was a member of a wild elven tribe, and you've inherited a portion of your elven parent's quick reflexes. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks.

**Failed Apprentice:** As a child, your parents sent you to a distant wizard's tower as an apprentice so that you could learn the arcane arts. Unfortunately, you had no arcane talent whatsoever, though you did learn a great deal about the workings of spells and how to resist them. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saves against arcane spells.

**Halfling Race Traits**

Only halflings can select these traits.

**Freedom Fighter:** Your parents allowed escaping slaves to hide in your home, and the stories you've heard from them instilled into you a deep loathing of slavery. You gain a +1 trait bonus on any skill check or attack roll made during the process of escaping capture or in helping a slave escape bondage, and [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] is always a class skill for you.

**Well-Informed:** You make it a point to know everyone and to be connected to everything around you. You frequent the best taverns, attend all of the right events, and graciously help anyone who needs it. Because of this, you gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.

**Half-Orc Race Traits**

Only half-orcs can select these traits.

**Almost Human:** You have enough human features that it's easy for you to pass for a pureblooded human. You gain a +4 trait bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks to pass as human, and [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] is always a class skill for you.

**Brute:** You have worked for a crime lord, either as a low-level enforcer or as a guard, and are adept at frightening away people. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks, and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] is always a class skill for you.

**Outcast:** Driven from town after town because of your heritage, you have become adept at living apart from others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill checks, and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] is always a class skill for you.

**Scrapper:** A childhood spent scrabbling for every possession and scrap of food has made you fierce and wary. You receive a +1 trait bonus on all [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks made to demoralize opponents and a +1 trait bonus on all [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to avoid being surprised.

**Human Race Traits**

Only humans can select these traits.

**Scholar of Ruins:** From the moment you could walk and talk, the ruins of ancient civilizations have fascinated you. Because of this, you have special insight into geography as well as expertise in exploring lost places. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.

**World Traveler:** Your family has taken the love of travel to an extreme, roaming the world extensively. You've seen dozens of cultures and have learned to appreciate the diversity of what the world has to offer. Select one of the following skills: [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local), or [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]]. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.

**Bloodline Race Traits**

Members of any race can select one of these traits, as they represent distant bloodlines intermixed with or corrupting those your race.

**Blood of Dragons:** Long ago, your ancestors' blood mixed with that of dragons. Choose one of the following: gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks, gain low-light vision, or gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against effects that cause sleep or paralysis.

**Deathtouched:** At some point you were tainted with the corruption of the undead, and you have gained some of their defenses. You gain either a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws or a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects (your choice).

**Fiend Blood:** The blood of fiends taints your line, manifesting physically, though it may be barely noticeable. Choose one of the following skills: [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes). You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.
