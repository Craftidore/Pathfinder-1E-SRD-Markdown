# Mortal Hunter (PrC)
## Overview
Although fiends prize the souls of mortals tempted to evil,

sometimes a mortal must simply be slain. Such a mortal,

often an obstacle to a powerful fiend’s evil schemes, finds

herself the target of a mortal hunter.

Mortal hunters are fiends that specialize in killing mortals.

For purposes of this prestige class, “mortal” is a term

meaning any creature not of the outsider, undead, construct,

or fey types. To practice their hunting skills, fiends

capture mortals and drag them to their infernal realms

where they are freed, then tracked and killed. A mortal

hunters is not only good at tracking and killing mortals, but

it learns to use mortal skins to form disguises so that it can

infiltrate mortal societies and trick individuals, drawing

them into traps.

If a mortal hunter has a character class, it is often ranger

or fighter. Mortal hunters usually work alone, but sometimes

have lesser fiends to use as shock troops or to help

spring ambushes and traps. They occasionally use hounds—

howlers, displacer beasts, hell hounds, or similar creatures—

in their hunts.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the mortal hunter prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Mortal hunters are

proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: A mortal hunter gains the ability to cast a small

number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the mortal hunter

must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s level,

so a mortal hunter with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot

cast these spells. Mortal hunter bonus spells are based on

Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + Cha modifier. When Table 5–10 shows 0

spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level,

the mortal hunter gets only bonus spells. A mortal hunter

without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of

that level. The mortal hunter’s spell list appears below; it has

access to any spell on the list and need not prepare those

spells ahead of time, just as a sorcerer. A mortal hunter casts

spells just as a sorcerer does.

Mortal Hunting (Ex): A mortal hunter gains a bonus

against mortals due to its extensive study of them and training

in the proper combat techniques. The mortal hunter

gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against mortals

and the same bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills against

mortals. The damage bonus applies to ranged weapons only

against targets within 30 feet (the mortal hunter cannot

strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus

does not apply to damage against creatures that are immune

to critical hits. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the mortal hunter’s

bonus associated with mortals goes up by +1. This bonus

stacks with a ranger’s favored enemy bonus.

Mortal Skin (Su): By magically grafting bits of mortal

flesh to its own body, a mortal hunter gains the ability at 1st

level to transform (as the polymorph self spell) into any

humanoid mortal form. At 5th level, a mortal hunter can

polymorph into any mortal form except that of a dragon. At

8th level, any mortal form can be adopted. If the flesh used is

from the exact individual being imitated, the duration is permanent.

If the flesh is from a being of the same type as the

form adopted, the duration is 1 hour. If the flesh is not the

same type as the form adopted, the duration is 10 minutes. In

all cases, the mortal hunter can dismiss the ability as a standard

action. Otherwise, this ability works as the polymorph self

spell, and the mortal hunter can call upon it once per day.

Detect Mortals (Su): A 2nd-level mortal hunter can use

detect mortals at will. This ability duplicates the effect of

detect undead cast by a 15th-level caster, except that mortals

are detected.

Boost Spell-Like Ability: At 2nd level, a mortal hunter

gains this feat as a bonus feat.

Smite Mortals (Su): Once per day, a mortal hunter of

4th level or higher may attempt to smite mortals with one

normal melee attack. It adds its Wisdom modifier (if positive)

to its attack roll and deals 2 extra points of damage per

class level; for example, an 8th-level mortal hunter armed

with a longsword would deal 1d8+16 points of damage,

plus 3 points of damage for its mortal hunting ability, plus

any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical

effects. If the mortal hunter accidentally smites a creature

that is not a mortal, the smite has no effect but is still used

up for that day.

Spurn Mortal Magic (Su): A 5th-level mortal hunter

applies its Wisdom modifier (if positive) as an additional

bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities

used by mortals. Will saving throws thus add double

the normal Wisdom modifier.

Claws of the Overfiend (Ex): At 7th level, the damage

dealt by all of the mortal hunter’s natural attacks increases

by one step. Use the table in the Size Increases section in the

introduction of the Monster Manual to determine the proper

die increase. For example, a bite that deals 1d6+2 points of

damage now deals 1d8+2 points of damage.

Mortalbane Shout (Su): An 8th-level mortal hunter can,

once per day, give a shout that stuns for 1 round all mortals

within 50 feet who fail a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma

bonus + class levels).

Slay Mortal (Su): A 10th-level mortal hunter can attempt

to slay a mortal with its touch once per day. If the mortal

hunter succeeds at a melee touch attack, the mortal must

make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + class level + mortal

hunter’s Cha modifier) or die instantly.

Mortal Hunter Spell List

Mortal hunters choose their spells from the following list.

1st Level: cause fear, charm person, detect good, heartache, protection

from good, sleep, unnerving gaze.

2nd Level: detect thoughts, evil eye, hold person, magic circle

against good, see invisibility, web, wither limb.

3rd Level: flesh ripper, mirror sending, nondetection, scrying,

suggestion, vile lance, wrack.

4th Level: arcane eye, call dretch horde, locate creature, morality

undone, phantasmal killer, resonating resistance.
