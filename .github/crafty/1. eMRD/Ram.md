# Ram
## Overview
**Ram**

The ship bears a standard ram, usually sheathed in bronze or iron, mounted on its bow.

**Benefit:** A ship equipped with a ram deals an additional 2d8 points of damage with a ramming maneuver and ignores the damage for the first square it enters of a solid object, and all damage from ramming creatures or other objects (such as other ships).

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 10; Cost: 50 gp (Large ship), 100 gp (Huge ship), 300 gp (Gargantuan ship), or 1,000 gp (Colossal ship)
