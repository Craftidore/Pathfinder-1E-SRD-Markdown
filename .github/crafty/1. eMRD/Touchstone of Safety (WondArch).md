# Touchstone of Safety (WondArch)
## Overview
**Touchstone of Safety:** The 5-foot-square touchstone grants damage reduction against ranged weapons (as the *[[Protection from Arrows (Spell)|protection from arrows]]* spell) to any single creature standing upon it. Stronghold builders often add this to key guard posts or other areas important to the defense of a stronghold.

If more than one creature attempts to use this simultaneously (for instance, if two grappling creatures stand atop it), the item grants no damage reduction.

The *touchstone of safety* comes in five varieties: Type I grants DR 10/+1, type II DR 10/+2, type III DR 10/+3, type IV DR 10/+4, and type V DR 10/+5.

*Caster Level:* 3rd (I), 5th (II), 10th (III), 15th (IV), 20th (V); Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Protection from Arrows (Spell)|protection from arrows]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp (I); 5,000 gp (II), 10,000 gp (III), 15,000 gp (IV), 20,000 gp (V).
