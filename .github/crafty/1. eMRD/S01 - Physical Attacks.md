# S01 - Physical Attacks
## Overview
**Physical Attacks**

One of the most immediately noticeable differences when [[S04 - Fighting Underwater|fighting underwater]] is that slashing and bludgeoning attacks are made with a –2 penalty and deal half damage, making piercing weapons the best bet for an underwater adventure. If you’re off-balance (see Off-Balance and Prone Underwater on page 45), your attacks with piercing weapons also take a –2 penalty and deal half damage. *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|Freedom of movement]]* can negate these penalties entirely and has a variety of other effects (see *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|Freedom of Movement]]* on page 45). Additionally, Aquadynamic Focus (page 57) can specifically assist with this situation. Creatures with a natural swim speed from the aquatic or [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|water subtype]] don’t take these penalties with their inherent natural attacks. For instance, a [[Kraken (Bestiary PF1)|kraken]]’s bludgeoning tentacle attacks don’t take penalties, but if it took the ectoplasmatist [[Spiritualist|spiritualist]] archetype from *Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures* and gained two slashing ectoplasmic lash attacks, those would still take the penalties. Attacks that deal bludgeoning damage by pushing water, such as a [[Kineticist|kineticist]]’s water blast, also take no penalty and deal full damage underwater.

**Ranged Attacks:** Traditional physical ranged weapon attacks underwater are much more challenging due to the increased drag from the water compared to air. Ranged attacks normally take a –2 penalty for every 5 feet of water, in addition to the normal penalty for range increments. The exceptions are the underwater light crossbow and underwater heavy crossbow from *Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide*, which ignore the penalty for ranged attacks underwater but have a significantly reduced range increment underwater. Thrown attacks don’t usually work underwater at all, but if you can move directly above your opponent, you can throw a properly prepared piercing weapon (one made of stone, metal, or another particularly dense material) straight down, counting on its sinking buoyancy to propel it to its target. Hypothetically, you could do the reverse with a weapon of extremely low density, but achieving such a low density while still having a shape that allows for throwing and enough mass to damage would generally require an unusual material or magical assistance. At the end of a downward-thrown object’s maximum range, it continues to sink, but its trajectory is far too unpredictable to hit anything with its dangerous end.

**Combat Maneuvers:** Most [[Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuvers]] work underwater, although you take a –2 penalty on [[Grapple|grapple]] combat maneuver checks if you don’t have a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] speed (a successful damage action taken as part of a maintained [[Grapple|grapple]] deals full damage, even if your unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage). Even tripping is possible underwater with special rules (see Tripping Underwater below). 

**Cover from the Surface:** Due to water’s surface tension, creatures attempting to attack through water’s surface count its surface as total cover (if a creature is partially submerged, it gains proportionally less cover); this applies even to spells that require attack rolls. The exception to this rule is attacks that deal piercing damage—these can penetrate the water’s surface but take a –2 penalty to do so. This is a change from the rule on cover from the water’s surface in the Core Rulebook, but it allows actions like spearfishing and firing harpoons from whaling ships.
