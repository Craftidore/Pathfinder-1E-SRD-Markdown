# Kin Guardian (Trait)
## Overview
**Kin Guardian:** You are dedicated to defending members of your family. When you use the aid another action to give a member of your family a bonus to AC, increase the bonus by 2. This increase is a trait bonus (and therefore doesn’t stack with increases granted by other family members using this trait). This trait has no effect when using the aid another action to increase a family member’s next attack roll. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 53
