# Highland Stalker (PrC)
## Overview
The mountains are unforgiving, and the ability to find

food at high altitude often means the difference between

survival and starvation. For those who live in such climes,

hunters provide not only food but also clothing, shelter,

and tools when they bring back animal skins and bones.

The best high-altitude hunters—highland stalkers—are

consummate trackers with an instinctive knowledge of

their mountainous territories.

Scouts (see page 10) are the most likely candidates to

become highland stalkers, but rogues are well represented,

and the prestige class attracts a fair number of

multiclass barbarians and rangers who qualify.

NPC highland stalkers are found leading teams of four

to six other hunters (typically scouts or rangers), often

far from the tribe’s base camp. Depending on how the

game they’re tracking is moving, they might stay away

from camp for several days at a time.

Adaptation: This prestige class models a mountain

warrior who favors stalking enemies and attacking from

ambush—similar to the ranger, but with fewer skills

and no spellcasting. Thus, it’s easy to adapt for hunters

beyond a mountain setting. A fighter’s base attack bonus

and the ability to make skirmish attacks is a compelling

combination, so you don’t need to load the prestige class

with many other class features.

Hit Die: d8.

fulfill all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the highland

stalker prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Highland stalkers

are proficient with light armor. They gain no proficiency

with any weapon.

Mountain Stride (Ex): A highland stalker can move

through scree and dense rubble at her normal speed. She

can also move up steep slopes and stairs at her normal

speed. See pages 89–92 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* for

descriptions of terrain types.

Skirmish (Ex): A highland stalker relies on mobility

to deal extra damage and improve her defense. Starting

at 2nd level, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on

all attacks during any round in which she moves at least

10 feet. This extra damage applies only to attacks taken

during her turn. It increases by an additional 1d6 for

every four levels gained above 2nd (2d6 at 6th and 3d6

at 10th).

This extra damage only applies against living creatures

that have a discernible anatomy. Undead,

constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal

creatures, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are

not vulnerable to this extra damage. A

highland stalker must be able to see the

target well enough to pick out a vital

spot and must be able to reach such

a spot. Highland stalkers can apply

this extra damage to ranged attacks

made while skirmishing, but only

if the target is within 30 feet.

At 4th level, a highland

stalker gains a +1 competence

bonus to Armor Class during

any round in which she

moves at least 10 feet.

The bonus applies

as soon as she

has moved 10

feet, and lasts until the start

of her next turn. It improves to +2

at 8th level.

A highland stalker loses this ability

when wearing medium or heavy

armor or when carrying a medium

or heavy load. If she gains the

skirmish ability from another

class, the bonuses stack.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Beginning

at 3rd level, a highland stalker can move at her

normal speed while following tracks. See the ranger class

feature, page 48 of the *Player’s Handbook.*

Surefooted (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a highland

stalker is well acquainted with the dangers of mountainous

terrain. She can ignore DC modifiers on Balance,

Move Silently, and Tumble checks derived from scree,

light rubble, dense rubble, steep slopes, or stairs (see

page 89 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*). She also does not

need to make a DC 10 Balance check when running or

charging down a steep slope.

Camouflage (Ex): Beginning at 7th level, a highland

stalker can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain.

Favored Enemy (Ex): Egeth gains a +2 bonus on her

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks

when using these skills against animals. She gains the

same bonus on weapon damage rolls.

Against magical beasts, she gains a +4 bonus on these

skill checks and on weapon damage rolls.

Skirmish (Ex): Egeth deals an extra 1d6 points of

damage on all attacks during any round in which she

moves at least 10 feet. This extra damage applies only to

attacks taken during her turn. It also applies to ranged

attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with

concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits

are all immune to additional extra damage. Egeth loses

this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or

when carrying a medium or heavy load.

Animal Companion (Ex): Egeth has a wolf named

Swiftrunner as an animal companion (see *Monster*

*Manual*, page 283). Its bonus trick is attack.

Animal Companion Benefi ts: Egeth and Swiftrunner

enjoy the link and share spells special qualities.

*Link (Ex):* Egeth can handle Swiftrunner as a free

action. She also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all

wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made

regarding her wolf.

*Share Spells (Ex):* Egeth can have any spell she casts on

herself also affect her animal companion if the latter is

within 5 feet at the time. She can also cast a spell with a

target of “You” on her animal companion.

Goliath Traits (Ex): Egeth’s physical stature lets her

function in many ways as if she were one size category

larger, including using weapons designed for a creature one

size larger. Egeth can make standing long and high jumps

as if they were running long and high jumps. She also can

engage in accelerated climbing without taking a –5 penalty

on the Climb check. Egeth is automatically acclimated to

life at high altitudes and does not take the penalties for

altitude described on page 90 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*.

(The goliath race is detailed in *Races of Stone*.)

Mountain Stride (Ex): Egeth can move through scree

and dense rubble at her normal speed. She can also move

up steep slopes and stairs at her normal speed.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Egeth can track at normal speed

without taking the usual –5 penalty, or can track at double

speed at only a –10 penalty.

*Ranger Spell Prepared* (caster level 5th): 1st—*longstrider.*

*Possessions: +1 chain shirt, amulet of natural armor +1, ring*

*of protection +1,* Large masterwork composite longbow (+2

Str bonus), 50 Large arrows, Large masterwork longspear,

*gloves of Dexterity +2, cloak of resistance +1, wand of cure light*

*wounds* (50 charges), 10 pp.
