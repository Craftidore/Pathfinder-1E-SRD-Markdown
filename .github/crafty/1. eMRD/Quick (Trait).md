# Quick (Trait)
## Overview
**Quick**

You are fast, but less sturdy than average members of your race.

**Benefit:** Your base land speed increases by 10 feet (if you don't have a land speed, apply the benefit to whichever of your speeds is highest).

**Drawback:** Subtract 1 from your hit points gained at each level, including 1st (a result of 0 is possible).

**Special:** You must have a Constitution of 4 or higher to select this trait.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait typically try to stay away from physical combat, but a rare few might relish it, striving to see if their superior speed is enough to best hardier warriors.
