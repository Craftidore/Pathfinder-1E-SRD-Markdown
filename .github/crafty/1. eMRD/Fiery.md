# Fiery
## Overview
**Fiery:** A blazing curtain of magic fire covers one side of the wall, emanating heat in that direction. This augmentation deals damage to those nearby or touching it as a *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]]*.

Any 5-foot-by-5-foot section of wall that takes 20 or more points of cold damage in 1 round is extinguished for 24 hours (do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects).

*Caster Level:* 7th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]]; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
