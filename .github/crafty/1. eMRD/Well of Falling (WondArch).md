# Well of Falling (WondArch)
## Overview
**Well of Falling:** This fixture is not actually a well so much as a sneaky way to get from one part of a multilevel stronghold to another. It looks like an open well at the top, but at the bottom, the well opens out into another room. Anyone passing through the stone rim of the well (up to 10 feet in diameter) falls slowly to the bottom, as if under the effect of a *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* spell. This makes the fall the equivalent to jumping off a table, no matter how long the fall. You can make the *well of falling* up to 100 feet deep (pay for multiple wells if you need a deeper one).

Most stronghold builders use a well of falling as a way to get from one part of a stronghold to another safely and quickly. Many builders choose to conceal the door into the bottom of the well (treat as a secret door).

**Caster Level:** 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]**; Market Price:* 1,500 gp.
