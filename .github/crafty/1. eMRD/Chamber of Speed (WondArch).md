# Chamber of Speed (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of Speed:** Any creature entering this room acts as if under the influence of a *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* spell. The main reason for having a room such as this is so that you can get things done more quickly. Those extra partial actions add up after a while. Most tasks can be completed in about half the normal time.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]**; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.
