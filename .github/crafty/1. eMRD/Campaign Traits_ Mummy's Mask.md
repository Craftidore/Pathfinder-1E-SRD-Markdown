# Campaign Traits: Mummy's Mask
## Overview
These campaign traits tie characters to the Mummy’s Mask Adventure Path, which begins in the city of Wati in the nation of Osirion. Characters designed for this campaign should have some connection to this ancient land—whether as natives or as recently arrived foreigners eager to explore the history and mysteries of Ancient Osirion. These traits provide a reason for characters to be in Wati, and are designed to help players create characters perfectly suited to adventuring through this campaign.

**Blood of Pharaohs**: Long ago, one of your ancestors ruled over the lands of Osirion. Although you are many generations removed and the line of descent is hard to prove, his or her blood still runs in your veins. Perhaps you may find some proof of your lineage in the tombs of Wati’s necropolis. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nobility) checks and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you may choose Ancient Osiriani as one of your bonus languages.

**Devotee of the Old Gods**: Osirion has a history stretching back over 8,000 years, and the deities worshiped today in modern Osirion are not the same ones revered in Ancient Osirion’s heyday—deities with names like [[Anubis (Deity)|Anubis]], Osiris, Ra, and Set, among others. Your family never lost the faith of your ancestors, however, and your devotion to one of the deities of Ancient Osirion has helped keep the memory of Osirion’s past alive—a past that still lingers on in the untouched necropolis of Wati. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks, and one of those skills is always a class skill for you. In addition, your faith in the old gods of Osirion grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divine magic. For more information on the deities of Ancient Osirion, see *Pathfinder Adventure Path #80: Empty Graves*.

**Foreign Opportunist**: You’re not a native Osirian, but the opportunity to explore the tombs of Ancient Osirion—and “liberate” the treasures they hold—is too good to pass up. Whether or not you’re interested in the history of this land, you’re def initely interested in the wealth that’s lain hidden in dusty crypts for millennia—such as the tombs in the newly opened necropolis of Wati. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, your contacts in the antiquities markets allow you to sell relics of Ancient Osirion for 60% of their listed price, rather than the normal 50% value. What is considered a relic of Ancient Osirion is left to the GM’s discretion.

**Inquisitive Archaeologist**: You have studied the architectural styles of nations throughout the Inner Sea region, but none have fascinated you like the architecture of Ancient Osirion. Hearing that the famed necropolis of Wati has finally been opened for exploration, you’ve come to that city to get firsthand experience with the lost secrets of Ancient Osirion’s master builders. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to find concealed or secret doors in structures built in the style of Ancient Osirion.

**Mummy-Cursed**: One of your ancestors ran afoul of a mummy’s curse while exploring an ancient tomb. This curse was passed down to later generations of your family, but over time, your line has become more resistant to curses. You’ve come to Wati to explore its untouched necropolis, and while you hope you won’t have to face a real undead mummy, at least you have some defense if you do. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against curses and curse effects (including mummy rot and spells with the curse descriptor) and a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against a mummy’s aura of despair.

**Resurrected**: At some time in the recent past you died, but you were brought back to life—whether because of magic, a blessing of the gods, a destiny you have to fulf ill, or perhaps it just wasn’t your time to die yet. Whatever the nature of your resurrection, your experience gave you a fascination with death, and you hope to find some insight into the nature of mortality by exploring the tombs of Wati’s famous necropolis. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against death effects. In addition, you do not die until your hit points drop to a negative amount equal to or lower than your Constitution score + 4.

**Sphinx Riddler**: You’ve always been fascinated with the ancient race of sphinxes, and are inspired by them to love puzzles and riddles and enjoy solving difficult dilemmas. Like so many others, you’ve come to Wati to explore its ancient necropolis, but you’ve also heard that sphinxes occasionally visit a sphinx-shaped ruin called Ubet’s Folly in the city—perhaps you’ll have the chance to meet and talk with a sphinx yourself! You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks against sphinxes, and a +1 trait bonus on any skill check to decipher a puzzle or riddle. In addition, you may choose Sphinx as one of your bonus languages.

**Trap Finder**: Forgotten dungeons and ancient tombs have always held an appeal for you, and you’ve never been able to resist the urge to delve into these lost sites in search of knowledge, treasure, or both. You may not have received any formal training in the roguish arts, but you’ve nonetheless become skilled at spotting and disabling hidden traps. The tombs of Wati’s necropolis, just opened for exploration, seem like the perfect place to put your skills to the test. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you can use [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to disarm magic traps, like a rogue.

**Undead Crusader**: You have dedicated your life to eradicating the scourge of the undead from Golarion. You have spent countless hours studying the different types of undead and have trained endlessly to learn the best ways to defeat them. If any undead creatures come out of the tombs of Wati’s necropolis, you’ll be ready for them! You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against undead creatures. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you.

**Wati Native**: You were born and raised in the city of Wati, and you know its streets and secrets well. Although it’s frowned upon by the city’s authorities, you have sneaked into the necropolis on multiple occasions to wander its dusty, abandoned streets. Out of respect for the deceased, you’ve never actually entered one of the necropolis’s silent tombs, but you have no fear of what might lie inside. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saves against fear effects. In addition, your knowledge of the city grants you a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you.
