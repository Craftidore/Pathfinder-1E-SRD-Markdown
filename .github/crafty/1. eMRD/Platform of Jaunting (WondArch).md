# Platform of Jaunting (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Jaunting:** By stepping on this 10-foot-round platform—which is affixed to the floor—the user is immediately transported to any other locale within 680 feet, as per the spell *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*. You always arrive at exactly the right spot, whether you’re able to actually visualize the area or simply give relative coordinates by stating a direction and a distance from your current position.

As with *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*, you can risk the chance of reappearing inside of something solid. If that happens, you remain stuck in the [[Astral Plane]] until you make a Will save (DC 25), which you can try each round. A successful save allows you to move up to 100 feet into an open spot. If no open spot exists within that range, you can make a similar Will save (DC 25) once each minute to move up to 1,000 feet to an open area. If no such space exists, you remain trapped in the [[Astral Plane]] unless you can escape in some other manner.

When using the platform of jaunting, you can bring up to 350 pounds of material you touch.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
