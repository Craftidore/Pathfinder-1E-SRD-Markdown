ELVES OF THE HIGH FOREST

Symbol: A cluster of acorns is the symbol of the Elves

of the High Forest. Their jewelry often uses this motif, and

they use the real thing—actual clusters of acorns—as subtle

trail markers within the High Forest.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Elves of the

High Forest live in a typical elf community: a series of

treetop villages and small towns that together form

a network to keep their forest safe and thriving.

Type: Tribe (racial).

Scale: 6 (city).

Affi liation Score Criteria: To gain affi liation

with the Elves of the High Forest, you need only be

an elf or half-elf. The elves have many non-elf friends

in the forest, but only those with elf blood can partake

in the privileged Hunt of the Full Moon. You don’t

need to grow up among the Elves of the High Forest;

you can be from a far-off elf community, and you’ll

still gain affi liation with these elves normally.

The Elves of the High Forest have a semi communal lifestyle,

so they favor characters with skills or class abilites that

make a woodland lifestyle easier. The fastest way to gain status

within the Elves of the High Forest is to perform missions

on their behalf. The elves particularly favor missions that

protect the forest as a whole from interlopers—from human

woodcutters to drow raiders.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Character level +1/2 PC’s level

Druid or ranger +1

10 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature) or

Profession (herbalist) +2

Each successful mission +2

Each successful forest defense mission\* +4

\* Overlaps (does not stack with) the “each successful

mission” bonus.

Titles, Benefits, and Duties: The Elves of the High

Forest offer specialized training in woodcraft for those

they favor.

Those who reach a new level of status within the Elves

of the High Forest attain the new benefi ts after attending

the Hunt of the Full Moon—a combination night-hunt and

ritual. The greatest hunters among the elves take you on an

all-night hunt for elusive game. The target is traditionally

a half-fey white stag, but sometimes the elves hunt more

dangerous quarry by necessity or for variety. During the

night, they teach you specialized techniques in perception,

stealth, and moving through the wilderness. Some say the

hunters leave the Material Plane entirely and wind up hunting

mystical game among the fey of Arborea. You’ll return

in the morning exhausted, but with the sharper perceptions

and peerless camoufl age of the greatest elf hunters.
