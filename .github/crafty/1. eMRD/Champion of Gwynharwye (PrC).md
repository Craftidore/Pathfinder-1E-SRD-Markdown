# Champion of Gwynharwye (PrC)
## Overview
Gwynharwyf is the celestial patron of barbarians, the model for

how rage and righteousness can coexist in a single being. Her

champions are mortal barbarians who strive to emulate her sublime

balance of fury and reserve, using their rage to smite

implacably evil foes while retaining their focus on good, with its

demands for mercy and respect for life. They are among the

fiercest warriors for the cause of good on the Material Plane,

armed with spells they can actually cast while raging, ironwilled

resistance to compulsions, and eladrinlike resistance to

attacks in addition to their fearsome rage.

Champions of Gwynharwyf must have at least one level of

barbarian in order to meet the requirements to enter the class,

and most champions are single-classed barbarians. Sometimes,

a fighter/barbarian or ranger/barbarian becomes a champion of

Gwynharwyf, but members of other classes do not usually

pursue this course.

Most champions of Gwynharwyf are wandering adventurers

of some sort. Some are guerilla fighters in evil kingdoms, working

to overthrow tyrants and liberate oppressed peoples. Others

are dungeon delvers, seeking to exterminate monstrous aberrations

and vile creations from the face of the earth. Still others

stalk city streets, sniffing out diabolical cults and their evil masters.

Hit Die: d12.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the champion of Gwynharwyf

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Champions of Gwynharwyf

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: A champion of Gwynharwyf has the ability to cast a

small number of divine spells. To cast a champion of Gwynharwyf

spell, the champion must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a champion of Gwynharwyf

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these

spells. Champion of Gwynharwyf bonus spells

are based on Wisdom, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell

level + the champion’s Wisdom modifier.

When the champion gets 0 spells of a

given spell level (for instance, 1st-level

spells for a 1st level champion of

Gwynharwyf), she gets only the

bonus spells she would be

entitled to based on her

Wisdom score for that

spell level.

The champion of

Gwynharwyf’s spell

list appears below. A

champion of Gwynharwyf

prepares and casts spells just

as a cleric does (though a

champion cannot spontaneously

cast cure spells).

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a

champion of Gwynharwyf can use

detect evil, as the spell. She can use this

ability even while raging.

Rage (Ex): A champion of Gwynharwyf adds her

class levels to her barbarian levels to determine

how often she can rage and when she gains the

greater rage, tireless rage, and mighty rage barbarian

class abilities. She does not gain or

improve any other barbarian class abilities.

Smite Evil (Su):

Once per day, a champion

of Gwynharwyf

may attempt to smite

evil with one normal

melee attack. She adds her

Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of

damage per champion of Gwynharwyf level. If she accidentally

smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but the

ability is still used up for that day.

A 5th-level champion of Gwynharwyf can smite evil twice

per day. At 9th level, she can use this ability three times per day.

Divine Grace (Su): A 2nd-level champion of Gwynharwyf

gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on all saving throws.

Furious Casting (Ex): Starting

at 2nd level, a champion of Gwynharwyf

can cast her champion spells

even while raging. If she has another

spellcasting class, she cannot cast spells

from that class while raging, only the spells

that she gains from her champion levels.

Damage Reduction (Ex): Starting

at 3rd level, a champion of Gwynharwyf

gains the ability to shrug off some amount

of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 2

from the damage the champion takes each time

she is dealt damage from a weapon or natural

attack. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter,

this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage

reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

Resist Enchantment (Su): At 3rd level, a champion of

Gwynharwyf gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving

throws against Enchantment spells or effects.

Fearsome Fury (Su): At 4th level, a champion of

Gwynharwyf can strike terror into the hearts of her

foes while she rages. When she enters a rage, she

makes an Intimidate check. Any enemy that comes

within 30 feet of her while she is raging must make a Will

save against a DC equal to her Intimidate check result. Those

who fail become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds or the duration of

the rage, whichever is longer.

Energy Resistance (Su): At 5th level, a champion of

Gwynharwyf grows closer to her eladrin patrons, gaining

acid, cold, and electricity resistance 5. This resistance

increases to 10 at 10th level.

Immune to Charm and Compulsion

(Ex): A 7th-level champion of

Gwynharwyf is completely immune to charm and

compulsion spells.
