# Ordained Champion (PrC)
## Overview
*“You will yield to the might of Hextor—or you will yield to*

*mine.”*

—Salan Roka, ordained champion of Hextor

Steeped in a tradition older than most religions, the ordained

champions stride through the chaotic fog of violence and

bloodshed. Driven by a zealous devotion to Herald of

Hell, and to war itself—these harbingers of death and

destruction are schooled in techniques of divine magic

that enhance their combat capabilities far beyond those

of mere soldiers.

The ordained champion is an ancient creation of Hextor,

so old that it predates the fi nal schism between the Herald

of Hell and his half-brother, Heironeous the Invincible.

Although ordained champions are known primarily as

servants of Hextor, some tiny fraction do indeed serve the

Invincible One instead. Heironeous’s ordained champions

are treated and act much like his paladins; thus, the details

presented here for organization and attitude apply primarily

to Hextor’s champions.

BECOMING AN ORDAINED CHAMPION

Clerics make the best and most effective ordained champions.

Paladins and paladins of tyrannyUA, as well as favored soulsCD

and shugenjasCD, occasionally follow this path as well. None

but the cleric can receive the full benefi t of the prestige

class, however.

**Entry Requirements**

**Alignment:** Any lawful, neutral good, or neutral evil.

**Skill:** Knowledge (religion) 7 ranks.

**Feat:** Weapon Focus with deity’s favored weapon.

**Spellcasting:** Able to cast *magic weapon* as a divine spell.

**Special:** Must worship Hextor or Heironeous.

**Hit Die: d8**

**Class Skills (2 + Int modifier per level):** Concentration, Craft, Heal, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nobility and

royalty), Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (the planes), Profession, Ride, Spellcraft.

CLASS FEATURES

Your entire being is devoted to war—war in the name of

your deity, war in the name of your favored cause, even war

in the name of war itself. Your focus on warfare has slowed

your spellcasting advancement, but the wide variety of

martial powers you have gained has more than made up for

that lack.

Spellcasting: At 2nd, 3rd, and 5th level, you gain new

spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a

divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an

ordained champion, you must decide to which class to add

each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Bonus Domain: If you are a cleric, you gain the War

domain as a third domain. If you already have the War domain,

you can instead choose any other domain granted by your

deity as your third domain. If you have no cleric levels, you

can add the War domain spells to your class spell list, but

you do not gain its domain ability or any extra spell slots for

domain spells.

Combat Feats: You can permanently sacrifi ce one or two

of your domain granted powers to acquire an equal number of

feats from the list of fi ghter bonus feats, as long as you meet

the prerequisites for them. You may not sacrifi ce your War

domain ability for this purpose. You must choose whether or

not to make this exchange when you fi rst become an ordained

champion, and you cannot later change your mind.

Continued Advancement: Levels in ordained champion

stack with levels of other appropriate classes for the purpose

of turning or rebuking undead, and for all level-dependent

domain granted powers.

Modifi ed Spontaneous Casting (Ex): If you have cleric

levels, you lose the ability to spontaneously cast *cure* or *infl ict*

spells. Instead, you can swap out previously prepared cleric

spells for any spells of equal or lower level from the War

domain. This alteration applies even to levels you gain as a

cleric after becoming an ordained champion.

If you are not a cleric, modifi ed spontaneous casting does

not apply to you, even if you can spontaneously cast some

other kind of spell, such as *summon nature’s ally.*

Diehard: At 2nd level, you gain Diehard as a bonus feat,

even if you lack the prerequisites. If you already have Diehard,

you can select any other feat for which you meet the

prerequisites as your bonus feat.

Smite (Su): At 2nd level, you can spend one daily use

of your turn/rebuke undead ability as a swift action to

turn your next melee attack into a smite. You gain a bonus

equal to your Charisma modifier on attack rolls, and you

deal extra damage equal to your total effective turning or

rebuking level. Your smite attack is not limited by alignment or race; you can attempt to smite any foe. Except as noted

here, this ability functions like the paladin’s smite evil

ability (*PH* 44).

Channel Spell (Sp): At 3rd level, you can channel any

spell you have available to cast into your melee weapon.

Doing so requires a move action and uses up a prepared spell

or spell slot just as if you had cast the spell. The channeled

spell affects the next target you successfully attack with that

weapon, though saving throws and spell resistance still apply

normally. Even if the spell normally affects an area or is a

ray, it still affects only the target in this case. On a successful

hit, the spell is discharged from the weapon, which can then

hold another spell. You can channel your spells into only one

weapon at a time. A spell channeled into a weapon is lost if

not used within 8 hours.

Divine Bulwark (Sp): At 3rd level, you can sacrifice a

prepared spell or spell slot as a swift action to gain damage

reduction. The value of the damage reduction equals 1 +

spell level sacrificed, and it can be overcome by a chaoticaligned

strike. Thus, a 3rd-level ordained champion who

sacrificed a *flame strike* spell would gain damage reduction

6/chaotic for 3 rounds. The damage reduction gained from

multiple uses of this ability does not stack. This protection

lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ordained

champion level.

Fist of the Gods (Sp): At 4th level, you can sacrifice a

prepared spell or spell slot as a swift action to deal extra

damage. Doing so grants you a bonus equal to 1 + spell

level sacrifi ced on your damage rolls for melee attacks. This

benefi t lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ordained

champion level.

Rapid Spontaneous Casting (Ex): When you attain 4th

level, any spell from the War domain that you spontaneously

cast requires only a swift action if its normal casting time

is no more than 1 standard action, or a standard action if its

normal casting time is 1 full-round action. A spontaneous

spell that you modify with a metamagic feat requires only its

normal casting time rather than the extra time such a spell

normally requires.

Holy Warrior (Sp): At 5th level, you can spend one daily

use of your turn/rebuke undead ability as a swift action to

bring your Wisdom into play in combat. For 5 rounds after

you activate this ability, you can use your Wisdom modifi

er in place of your Strength modifi er on attack rolls and

damage rolls.

War Caster (Ex): At 5th level, you gain a +2 bonus to your

effective caster level when casting spells that appear on the

War domain spell list.

PLAYING AN ORDAINED CHAMPION

You are fanatically devoted to your deity, but of equal

importance is your devotion to war itself, because only in the

chaos of combat can your skill and faith truly shine. Only

on the fi eld of battle is your commitment truly tested, and

only there can you prove your true worth to your church

and deity. You need not be mindlessly or randomly violent

(though some of Hextor’s neutral evil champions fi t that

description quite well), nor do you necessarily believe in

fi ghting without just cause. You do fi rmly believe, however,

that hesitation or regret in the face of necessary war is

weakness, and that certain enemies are unworthy of either

negotiation or compromise.

While you are considered a champion of the church of

Hextor, you do not necessarily fi ght only on its behalf—in

fact, you might be totally opposed to Hextor’s ways. Many

ordained champions, particularly those of lawful neutral

alignment, fi ght for various nations and factions, or even

hire themselves out as mercenaries to causes of which they

approve. As long as you wage war—any war—you honor

your deity.

Combat

Although you might be a potent spellcaster, you see yourself

fi rst and foremost as a melee combatant. If you have suffi

cient time to prepare, you are the equal of any fi ghter or

barbarian on the battlefi eld. Between your class abilities and

the spells to which you have access, you can even exceed

the combat prowess of those martial classes for a short time.

You are far less potent if caught unawares, however, so be

sure you have contingency plans in place. Your ability to

cast spontaneously from the War domain means you can fi ll

your spell slots with utilitarian magic without sacrifi cing

your martial abilities.

Advancement

You were a follower of Hextor (or Heironeous) before becoming

an ordained champion. While you pursued your former

career, the upper echelons of the church took note of your

martial aptitude and approached you for special training

and assignment.

You have now become one of the greatest of your deity’s

warriors. You have been relieved of many of your duties as

a cleric (or other holy servant) because as a champion, your

entire responsibility consists of standing victorious on the

fi eld of battle. You might be a mercenary, an adventurer, or a

crusader for your deity, but regardless, your life now consists

only of war and training for war.

Now that you’re an ordained champion, you have some

tough choices to make. Your spellcasting is based on

Wisdom, and at high levels you can temporarily use your

Wisdom modifi er to gain melee bonuses, but you shouldn’t

ignore Strength. And since you lack the hit points of other

martial characters, keeping your Constitution high is vital.

Because of the bonus feats you gained from the prestige

class, you can devote your other feat slots to improving

spellcasting or increasing the number of turn/rebuke

attempts you can make per day, all of which enhance your

battlefi eld effectiveness.

Resources

The church of Hextor expects you to acquire what you need

on your own. You might purchase equipment from the

church, or from your employer if you serve as a mercenary,

but you are highly unlikely to gain it for free. If you are an

ordained champion of Heironeous, you can expect the same

sort of resources that his paladins have.

ORDAINED CHAMPIONS

IN THE WORLD

*“Ordained champions are as disciplined and faithful as any cleric,*

*and as potent as any paladin. If only their choice of patrons made*

*them worthy of respect, rather than hatred and fear!”*

—Jozan, cleric of Pelor

The ordained champions serve as both lone adventurers

and military leaders, so you can introduce them to your

campaign in almost any martial capacity. While the most

obvious choice is to introduce an ordained champion as

an active member of Hextor’s church, remember that such

characters often participate in conflicts that have no direct

bearing on their faith. An ordained champion serving as

a mercenary captain, for example, need not even be an

adversary for the PCs. Alternatively, you could introduce

an ordained champion of Heironeous first, though doing

so can dilute the notion that such champions are incredibly

rare.

Organization

Ordained champions have no organization of their own.

Most serve in the church of Hextor to some extent, but

their positions vary greatly based on the needs and hierarchies

of the individual sects. They usually serve as offi cers,

though Hextor’s high priests still outrank them. In more

secular groups, such as mercenary or adventuring companies,

ordained champions normally seek positions of high

authority or status, but again, their success in such endeavors

depends on the circumstances.

The ordained champions of Heironeous are much more

tightly tied to his church than the champions of Hextor

are to theirs. Because of their low numbers, Heironeous’s

champions cannot afford to be without staunch allies.

AFFILIATION SPECIFICS

The following affi liation details are designed for ordained

champions of Hextor. If you are instead playing one of the

rare ordained champions of Heironeous, use what follows as

a model, but change the specifi cs where appropriate.

ORDAINED CHAMPION BENEFITS

Typically, an ordained champion represents a specifi c branch

of Hextor’s church. As a member of that church, he has certain

duties to perform in exchange for benefi ts. Higher-ranked

ordained champions are granted more leeway to choose their

own tasks and trusted to ensure that their actions advance the

cause of war; those of lower rank must spend much more of

their time on quests or in battles assigned by the church.

Soldier of Hextor: At this rank, you might choose to dwell

in the barracks of Hextor’s various institutions. The accommodations

are truly spartan and not especially comfortable,

but they are secure and free to members. You also have access

to trainers and practice grounds, and Hextor’s priests are

willing to heal any injuries you incur in the service of the

Herald of Hell.

Master of War: By the time you attain this rank, you have

begun to gain the trust of your superiors. You have access

to the church’s network of information, which helps you to

choose military targets and enemies ripe for conquest. This benefi t manifests as a +4 circumstance bonus on all Gather

Information and Knowledge checks made to determine the

relative military strength of a faction, group, or nation, as

well as its martial interests and any particular weaknesses

in its defenses.

Blooded Offi cer: While Hextor expects his soldiers to

be self-suffi cient, you have access to a certain amount of aid

upon attaining this level of prestige in the church. You can

buy military equipment—including magic weapons

and mundane but rare items such as siege

engines—for 75% of the list price. In addition,

the circumstance bonus on Gather Information

and Knowledge checks that you gained

at the previous rank increases to +8.

General of Hell: Once per year, you

can gather other soldiers of Hextor

under your command for any military

operation or activity. You

gain the benefi ts of the Leadership

feat (*DMG* 106), except

that the followers you acquire are all

soldiers in Hextor’s church, and

they remain with you only

for the duration of a single

endeavor (up to 2 months at

most). These soldiers are

in addition to any followers

you might have from

the Leadership feat and

are tracked separately in

all ways. In addition, the

circumstance bonus on

Gather Information and

Knowledge checks that

you gained as a master of

war increases to +12.

NPC Reactions

Most people don’t see

an “ordained champion”

when they look at one;

they simply see a holy

warrior of Hextor or

Heironeous. Their reactions

vary accordingly,

based on how they view those

deities and their churches. In most

civilized lands, an NPC’s attitude is one step

nearer helpful for followers of Heironeous and one step nearer

hostile for followers of Hextor, but individual alignment

and religious beliefs can alter this reaction.

ORDAINED CHAMPION LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (religion) can

research the ordained champions to learn more about them.

When a character succeeds on a skill check, the following lore

is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Ordained champions are unholy warriors of Hextor,

combining the features of clerics and blackguards.

DC 15: These warriors seem fi lled with divine energy.

They can cast spells of war or fi ll their attacks with unholy

strength and power the way clerics can heal the injured or

banish undead.

DC 20: Their ability to imbue their attacks with divine

energy allows them to smite like a paladin, but with a much

wider range of targets, or to ensure that every blow they land

infl icts maximum injury. They’re rarer than hen’s teeth, and

supposedly not all of them worship Hextor. Heironeous has

a few among his fl ock as well.

The ordained champions are well known among Hextor’s

clergy. Simply asking around in a church of the Herald of

Hell produces directions to the nearest known member

of the prestige class—assuming that the priests are convinced

the character has good reason for looking.

ORDAINED CHAMPIONS

IN THE GAME

As noted above, ordained champions can be

potent adversaries, but they need not be enemies

of the PCs. A member of this prestige

class could serve as an offi cer or mercenary

on the same side of a confl ict as the PCs. A

lawful neutral ordained champion might

even share some goals with non-evil

PCs, though he may have to fi ght an

uphill battle to gain their trust.

In most instances, PC ordained

champions should either be lawful

neutral in alignment, or devoted

to Heironeous rather than Hextor.

The prestige class should appeal

to players who like combining divine

and martial skills but want

an alternative to the paladin

with out as much emphasis on

spellcasting as the cleric.

Adaptation

Although the ordained champion

is designed primarily as

a follower of Hextor, it can

easily be altered to fi t into

the church of any martial deity

of any alignment. Simply

adjust some of the fl avor

text and the alignment

requirements accordingly.

In the *FORGOTTEN REALMS* campaign setting,

the Red Knight, Tempus, and Tyr are appropriate

deities for the class; while Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and

the Mockery serve the purpose well in the EBERRON campaign

setting.

Sample Encounter

Whatever the specifi c circumstances, encounters with an

ordained champion should be martial in nature, or at least

related to combat. The PCs might fi rst encounter one of

these holy warriors during a war council or similar planning

session, but the prestige class is designed for battle and

battle only. Whether fi ghting an actual war or exploring the

corridors of a forgotten ruin, the ordained champion can

always be found wielding weapon and spell against some foe or another. In most cases, as a follower of Hextor,

the ordained champion stands in opposition to the PCs,

but in some instances (particularly when the ordained

champion is not evil), cooperation to obtain a shared goal

is certainly possible.

EL 14: Salan Roka is one of Hextor’s greatest non-evil

champions. As a professional soldier, he gathers strength

from the militant discipline that Hextor provides, rather than

from conquest and destruction of the weak. Still, as a Hextorworshiper

and mercenary, he is likely to be encountered

either on the fi eld of battle or in the depths of a magic-fi lled

ruin, likely as a rival of the PCs rather than an ally.

to 1 + spell level, overcome by chaotic-aligned weapons,

for 5 rounds.

**Fist of the Gods (Sp)** As a swift action, Roka can lose a prepared

spell to gain a bonus on melee damage rolls equal

purpose of attack rolls and damage rolls for 5 rounds.

**Modified Spontaneous Casting** Roka spontaneously casts

spells from the War domain, rather than *cure* or *inflict*

spells as normal for clerics.

**Rapid Spontaneous Casting** Spontaneously casting any spell

from the War domain requires 1 swift action if its normal

casting time is no more than 1 standard action, or a

standard action if its normal casting time is 1 full-round

action. A spontaneous spell that Roka modifies with a

metamagic feat requires only its normal casting time

rather than the extra time such a spell normally requires.

**Smite (Su)** As a swift action, Roka can spend a daily use of

rebuke undead to turn his next melee attack into a smite

attack.
