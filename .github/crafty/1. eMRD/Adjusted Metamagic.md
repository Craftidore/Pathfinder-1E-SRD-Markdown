# Adjusted Metamagic
## Overview
Metamagic Feats

by Jim Butler

October. 11th, 2004

**A Cautionary Remark...**

Even though we're all using the same d20 magic system, the changes detailed below can have wildly different impacts across various campaign worlds. The system makes metamagic use more common (primarily because it makes using them easy), and at higher levels, the heroes will have greater and greater access to metamagic. As a DM, make sure to plan encounters accordingly and have the villains make the best use of the metamagic rules as well.

In addition, the feats listed below are certainly not all the metamagic feats that exist in the wide world of d20ville. After looking at a few base feats, you shouldn't have any trouble extrapolating them to this new system.

**The World of Metamagic**

Metamagic represents the ability of some spellcasters to augment their spells, making them strike for more damage, impact a larger area of effect, harder to resist, or some other enhancement. There is no preparation required to use metamagic feats with spells, so spellcasters of all persuasions can energize their spells to suit their own tastes.

**How it Works:** When a metamagic feat is selected by a spellcaster, the creature gains the ability to use that feat with any known spell. A few feats apply to just a single spell; these are detailed below. Casting a spell with metamagic qualities works just like regular casting (so casting an Empowered *magic missile* causes a wizard to lose a first-level *magic missile* spell from memory). Keeping track of which spells have metamagic qualities is no longer required.

**Uses per Day:** A spellcaster gets to use metamagic feats a number of times per day equal to their modified ability score modifier that governs their spellcasting (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or Charisma for sorcerers and bards). In addition to this number, he also gains one extra use each day for every metamagic feat he knows. For every 5 known metamagic feats, the number of uses per day increases by an additional +1 per feat. Each metamagic feat applied to a spell counts as a single use (so an empowered/maximized/quickened *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell counts as three uses).

**Example:** Thanatos is a 9th-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 21 (19 base, +2 headband of intellect) knows the Empower, Maximize, and Quicken feats. As a score of 21 grants a +5 ability modifier and he knows 3 metamagic feats, he can use his metamagic feats 8 times each day.

Later in his career, Thanatos achieves 15th level with an Intelligence score of 26 (+8 ability modifier). He's learned the Widen and Persistent spell feats, so his feat bonus now doubles (to +10). He now gets 18 uses per day.

**Spell Level Adjustment:** Each metamagic feat has a Spell Level Adjustment (SLA) associated with it, and a caster can’t add metamagic qualities to a spell until they’ve reached a level where they could cast the higher-level magic.

**Example:** Thanatos is a 9th-level wizard who has just purchased the Quicken metamagic feat, which has a SLA of +4. He can cast up to fifth-level spells at this point in his career, so he can choose to Quicken any first-level spell he has memorized that day. At 11th level, he’ll be able to Quicken any first- or second-level spell.

**Multiple Metamagic Feats:** You can purchase the same metamagic feat multiple times, each time applying that feat to a new spell. Feats that apply to all known spells can’t be purchased a second time.

**Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:** A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell during the casting. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

**Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:** The application of metamagic can’t be applied to magic items, though artifacts have been known to possess metamagic qualities.

**Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:** Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.

| Coaxing Spell | X |  | +2 | [[Spell Focus (Feat)\|Spell Focus]] (enchantment), [[Knowledge (Skill)\|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) 6 ranks | A mind-affecting spell modified by this feat affects mindless oozes and vermin as if they weren't mindless. | Dungeoneer's Handbook, pg. |

| |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Disguise Spell | X |  | +1 |  | Spells cast by you are virtually impossible to discern, unless there is some obvious visible effect from its casting. This ability only works when you’re engaged in a performance, show, or other activity that other creatures wouldn’t find threatening. |  |

| Last Blast |  | X | +2 | Concentration 10 ranks, [[Spellcraft (Skill)\|Spellcraft]] 6 ranks; [[Combat Casting (Feat)\|Combat Casting]]. | If you are brought to less than 0 hit points (but not killed outright), you can cast a single spell before lapsing into unconsciousness. This spell must be a damage-causing spell (and not a healing spell). Its effects go off at the time you drop below zero hit points. It can be used once per day. |  |

**Applies to All:** This indicates that the given feat applies to all known spells of the caster.

**Applies to Single:** This indicates that the given feat applies only to the single spell selected.

**Spell Level Adjustment:** Add this number to the spell level. A spell with an effective level of 10 or higher requires an available spell slot (refer to the Epic Level Handbook for information on how to obtain spell levels beyond 9th).

**Energy Substitution \[Metamagic]**

**Prerequisite:** Must know any other metamagic feat; 5 ranks of [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana).

**Benefit:** You can alter the type of magical energy for a given spell to that of any other type of magical energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). You’re free to change this energy type on the fly for your selected spells. The primary damage and effect of these spells now inflicts the new energy type. Your decision might affect the way spells behave (such as *[[Flaming Sphere (Spell)|flaming sphere]]* no longer setting items ablaze if it’s now based on sonic energy).

**Split Ray \[Metamagic]**

**Benefit:** You can split spells that specify a single target and make a ranged touch attack. Only damage-dealing spells can be affected. Each target of the split ray attack get a standard saving throw versus the given spell and suffer only half normal damage.

**Superior Summoning \[Metamagic]**

**Benefit:** Spells such as *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]* do not keep summoned creatures that you control at bay, allowing their natural weaponry attacks to strike as normal.
