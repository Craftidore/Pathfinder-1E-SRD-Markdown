# Training Area, Combat
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This open area allows guards and soldiers to train in the art of war. It has a rack of wooden weapons and padded armor, archery targets, and practice dummies.

If you use the rules for training upon advancement and [[Retraining|retraining]], this chamber can take the place of a professional trainer (though the time to train is doubled without a trainer, and you can only learn and advance skills here, not learn new feats). With a trainer, training times here are half of normal.

Up to eight people can train in such a place at once. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
