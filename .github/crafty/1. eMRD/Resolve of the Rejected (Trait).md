# Resolve of the Rejected (Trait)
## Overview
**Resolve of the Rejected:** Some disagree with your choice to wield a firearm, and their scorn has only hardened your resolve in battle. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects. Also, once per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you regain 1 grit point.
