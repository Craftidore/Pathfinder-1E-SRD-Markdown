# 3e8 - Trade Fairs
## Overview
**Trade Fairs**

Each summer and until harvest time, the various free cities and larger merchant towns gather at great market fairs, many of them specialized in particular goods: cloth and dyes, leathers, livestock, ironwork, scrolls and religious icons, or various special foodstuff such as ale, wine, cheeses, or fish. The most famous of these include the following.

**TABLE 3-3: Trade Fairs**

**Bemmea, the Gathering of Thoth-Hermes:** The Bemmean midwinter fair of arcanists and bookbinders. Caters to mages, wizards, and other arcanists, with a smattering of priests of Thoth-Hermes.

**Birch Fairgrounds, the Birch Queen’s Fair:** Deep in the Elflands or somewhere along the Neurabon River, the Birch Queen’s Fair buys and sells everything from cantrips and cloaks of elvenkind to memories, skills, and luck. A dangerous fair for those who are not wary. The shadow fey are often in attendance.

**Bourgund, the Rose Knight’s Emporium:** A mixture of the ephemeral and the magically-infused, this is perhaps the most volatile and fleeting event of this kind. Perfumery, fey magic, dueling, the honor of the Houses of Dornig, and the swaggering strength of the alchemists of Maillon are a heady mixture. Banditry is common just outside Bourgund’s borders before and after the event.

**Capleon, the Baron’s Trade Fair:** Spices, salt, tea, and more trade hands in Goldflower. The fair is also notorious for espionage, intrigue, and assassinations.

**Cronepisht, the Magdar Horse Trade:** Livestock of all kinds are sold at the fair in Cronepisht, including monsters and even some familiars. The most exotic animal market outside Harkesh.

**Friula, Scribe’s Fair of Friula:** In spring, the Friulans play good hosts (for once) and invite the world to buy their pearls, dyes, books, and scrolls. Visitors can bring books or scrolls to sell; it’s an easy way to make some money in Friula.

**Krakova, Krakovan Farmer’s Fair:** The fair deals in fish and horses, amber and birchbark, linen, honey, and much more from the Krakovan villages. A rival to the Zobeck Midsummer Fair, but catering to the Northlands.

**Kubourg Cantonal, the Cantonal Dwarfmoot:** Much more than a trade fair, the Kubourg Cantonal fair is loaded with dwarven ironwork, mercenary hiring and equipping, cheeses, woolens, and blades galore. It also provides court rulings on matters of cantonal law, the election of hall chieftains, an occasion for bride-prices and wergild to be paid, and several raucous masses to Ninkash (which outsiders might consider drunken beer hall fights).

**Maillon, Alchemist’s Gatherum:** The strange folk of Maillon wait until the harvest is in and then sell all the potions they have left before winter sets in. Some remarkable concoctions are available, as well as many frauds.

**Melana, Armoring Fair:** The smiths of Melana sell a great deal of iron and weapons to their cantonal cousins each year, and equally as much to the mercenaries of the Seven Cities. The whole city reeks of oil and iron for days.

**Triolo, the Fleet Fair:** The original purpose of the Fleet Fair was equipping all ships of Triolo as well as merchants of the Middle Sea with sailcloth and rope. Now the Triolans sell a great deal of spice and glass as well. Traditionally held on the Sphinx island at the harbor entrance.

**Trombei, Golden Ceres Fair:** If you don’t care about ale and horse, you have no reason to visit Trombei for this fair. If these topics hold your interest, nowhere else offers as much horseflesh and as many nights of drunken revelry.

**Salzbach, Salt Fair:** The salt of Salzbach is sold to the highest bidders in the autumn of each year, and taken on the roads before winter sets in. A quiet, mercantile fair with little carousing and a lot of money changing hands.

**Zigistad, Zigistand Wine Week:** Vintners sell barrels of wine, dwarves sell ingots of ore, and everyone goes home happy. A rather rowdy festival in a devout city, sometimes leading to brawls and arrests. Centaurs are explicitly not welcome.

**Zobeck, Zobeck Midsummer Fair:** Featuring the finest weaving, the most outrageous jewelry and clockworks, and sometimes a flying city visiting from Sikkim. The Zobeck Fair is a spectacle like no other.
