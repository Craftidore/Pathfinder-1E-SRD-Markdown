# 5d - Despotate of the Ruby Sea
## Overview
**Despotate of the Ruby Sea**

The Despotate of the Ruby Sea is a curse among the free wandering folk of the Rothenian Plains and a peculiar neighbor to the Dragon Empire. The Rubeshi are slavers and aggressive, malevolent folk, always seeking their own gain, and all other nations be damned. Their hair is black as their hearts, and Rubeshi eyes are green and pitiless. They sell to anyone: to the gnomes, the tsar, the priests of Baal. The Rubeshi do not play favorites.

Founded by a single man, Veltrin the First, the Despotate holds the peninsula in the sea that gives the nation its name, standing against infrequent attacks by centaur and Khazzaki hordes. Small in numbers, rich in gemstones and in vices, the Despotate is reviled by all its neighbors. Only the Mharoti Empire has the power to crush it, but so far, the Rubeshi have avoided that fate.

The Rubeshi care nothing for the disdain of their neighbors. Each summer, the people of the Despotate ride forth with their wagons, nets, and branding irons, to capture new slaves and workers for their fields, mines, and—worst of all—for the chained banks of oars that power the Despotate’s war galleys, the engines that keep the Mharoti Empire at bay. The Rubeshi call them all bondservants, but to anyone with eyes to see, they are slaves and thralls and nothing more.

## Slaves and the Army of Madness
**Slaves and the Army of Madness**

Despot Veltrin is cruel, but he offers small mercies and false hope to the slaves who serve him. When seriously threatened, though—which has happened twice, once by the Mharoti dragonkin and once by an alliance of elves and Khazzaki horse tribes—he can create an army of fearsome proportions. By offering blood sacrifices and propitiation to the White Goddess, the despot turns his slaves into strong, hulking, bloodthirsty warriors. They grow fangs, their skin turns a hideous pallid green, and their strength rivals that of a full-grown centaur. In a matter of days, the Despotate can raise an army of slavering soldiers who obey and fight like demons.

Fortunately, the Ritual of Ravening strengthens the subjects only for a time, less than a month or two at most. After this period they grow listless, and the horde-soldiers die in droves. As long as they have destroyed the invading army before then, the despot counts it worth the cost, but the loss of valuable slaves prevents him from conquering all nations around him in this way.

## Captains and their Ships
**Captains and their Ships**

The Despotate is full of horrors, most of them hidden within palace walls and kept off the street (the public floggings and executions are tame by comparison). Veltrin’s favorites—the nobles called the captains—have lands and villages of their own. Each captain commands one or more of the red-sailed fleet of the Rubeshi, their ships perhaps not as famous as the king’s ship Golden Bird but justly feared. The more experienced captains are all rich and powerful, and their soldiers share in the wealth. It is an oppressive system built on human misery, and the rulers enjoy themselves.

For their ships, on the other hand, no expense is spared. The Red Griffon has a bound troll at its prow, and the creature is fed the weakest or most disobedient rower before setting out, to encourage the others. The Moaning Monk has a dragonkin elementalist bound to its mast, who must summon moaning winds to carry the ship forward through the night, when the slaves rest.

The most famous ships are all bound magically to their owners, and only the captains know how to control them with blood, demonic commands, or arcane spells. Among the slaves, it is said a ship dies with its captain. The Rubeshi are oddly proud of this loyalty by their nightmare ships, bound to hellish pacts with their masters. The Khazzaki consider the custom akin to slaughtering a favorite war horse at a khan’s grave. In the case of the black ships of the Rubeshi, demons tear free from the blood-stained prows, howling as the ship sinks.

The smarter captains hand out rewards for their most loyal and useful thralls, typically better food, decent clothes, and authority over lesser slaves. The tools of obedience can also be more subtle and more powerful: a spell of magical healing, a night of simple entertainments, release from the galley oars for a time, lessons for a slave’s children, a chance to pray at a temple—even simple rest and sleep can be powerful rewards. Slaves who row day after day can be bought for a crust of fresh bread and a cup of wine. The despot knows this and depends on it. Veltrin’s kindnesses can be cruelties of a kind, preserving the land’s best slaves for the next fight.

## Government: the Despot
**Government: the Despot**

Veltrin the Glittering King (NE male human magus 15) rules from his jeweled palace. Reth-Saal’s lord is steeped in luxury and wine, a drunkard with a great temper, deep paranoia, and tremendous power over his terrified nobles. He mastered the brassy demonic figurehead of his flagship, the Golden Bird, about 25 years ago and murdered his wife during the ship’s launch.

Veltrin frequently hosts gnoll mercenaries and even the children or simulacra of the Master of Demon Mountain in his court, and he speaks highly of Eldara, one of Baba Yaga’s daughters. He grows increasingly stubborn and rapacious, raiding the shores of the sea and the city of Orkasa and Sephaya with increasing regularity. Those nobles who dared to oppose him have been transformed into his flesh golem bodyguards, and Veltrin’s complete control over the Despotate grows daily, even as its debauchery grows wilder.

In recent years, Veltrin has taken to wearing a mithral mask studded with sapphires, rubies, and chalcedony. Some say that below it, his flesh has been sculpted and renewed through arcane regeneration so often that it now resembles the wrinkled green hide of a troll. Those who spread these lies within hearing of the captains or Veltrin’s gnolls lose their tongues.

## The Elect
**The Elect**

One of the early victories that cemented Veltrin’s rule was the Boyar’s Rebellion. During this revolt, a dozen of his ship captains and one of his generals plotted an assassination, intending to share Reth-Saal’s growing riches among themselves. Warned by the Master of Demon Mountain, Veltrin knew of the plot and called his ship’s demon ashore. It summoned a dozen more to defend him against the assassins.

When the plot fell apart, Veltrin first executed the plotters, then stitched their bodies into the first of the Elect: flesh golems who serve as his bodyguards with unshakeable loyalty. Creating them took years and a fortune, but seeing former generals and powerful galley commanders jump at his every word amuses Veltrin still, and the golems terrify his enemies. Over the years, his most powerful rivals and enemies have been “promoted” to join the Elect. Reliable sources claim that more than 30 of them serve the Despot, and perhaps as many as 50. All wear rich but functional armor and are armed with various magical weapons and devices. No coup has been attempted in 12 years.

## Zaganos, the Bloody Hand of the King
**Zaganos, the Bloody Hand of the King**

Fear is a powerful tool, and no one wields this tool better than Zaganos the Red (LE male tiefling fighter 1/sorcerer 13), Grand Marshall of the Ruby Sea and Kadtan-i Derya (First Captain of the Ruby Sea). Those who have seen him on the deck of the Morning Star wonder what is the most fearsome: the ship, the demon bound to her, or her captain, whose infernal bloodline takes on a new dimension in this terrible place. Many believe Zaganos revealed his fellow captains’ plot against Veltrin during the Boyar’s Rebellion, though none dare level that accusation.

Those who spot this tall, emaciated man brandishing his infamous black bardiche, at the end of a monstrous arm befitting a mongrelman, with his cape of human skin flapping in the wind.... Well, many cower below decks and pray to the gods they love best. Zaganos serves Veltrin loyally, though some say he merely bides his time until he can find a way to dispose of the Glittering King’s bodyguards.

## Reth-Saal, the City of Jewels
**Reth-Saal, the City of Jewels**

Known for its slave market that provides elf and human flesh for the Mharoti Empire’s nobility, the city of Reth-Saal is one of pillars and whitewashed walls, a relatively warm and hospitable city surrounded by well-tended fields and boasting an excellent sheltered harbor and lighthouse. The walls of the Carnidine Palace glitter with cut glass (though the despot claims them to be gemstones) and the streets are patrolled by the Keepers of Order, a militia that has grown into a full-fledged set of watchmen, informers, and spies. Dissent is not tolerated, and the sycophancy and wild declarations of loyalty to King Veltrin and to Zaganos and the other lords can be excessive. Hearing the endless toasts to the king is the price of doing business in Reth-Saal; failure to toast frequently enough is noted.

The city is small by most standards, contained in a stout wall of earth and timber with tall stone towers. It is surrounded by marshy ground unsuitable for a siege. It commands a fine harbor and has a single lighthouse, called Veltrin’s Eye. The ships that dock include fast raiders as well as friendly or neutral vessels from around the Ruby Sea. The waterfront is notorious for its open sale of opium and brandy, as well as for the callous manner in which new slaves are broken to their newfound misery: branding, lashing, and even the amputation of toes and tongues are public spectacles in Reth-Saal.

## The Demon Ship Golden Bird
**The Demon Ship *Golden Bird***

The slaving fleet of the Rubeshi is widely feared: its black and red sails are a sign of doom to small fishing villages around the Ruby Sea, and even larger towns have been raided by the despot’s fleet. The secret of its success is its demonic flagship, the Golden Bird. This ship is more than a vessel; the figurehead at its prow is a bound demon named Yarochort, a horrific figure draped in rusty chains. Veltrin the Elder found this figurehead in a wreck washed ashore and realized its power. He had no idea how to command it, but he knew how to find out: ask Baba Yaga. And so he did, and learned the art of commanding demons, and his fate was sealed. The despot went to the Master of Demon Mountain for a demon of his own and paid yet another price, in blood and flesh for 100 years. In return, the Master gave him a bottle of dark demonic wine. Once the figurehead was anointed with its purple stain, the demon was transferred into the ship.

With a compass of brass that could find other ships at sea, and a demon to lead the boarding parties, things went well indeed. Soon Veltrin’s single pirate ship became the terror of the sea, and he was taking slaves by the score, using them to pay his debt to the Master of Demon Mountain, selling them to Vidim as serfs or to dragons as food or to gnomes as sacrifices, and putting them to work laying the foundation stones of Reth-Saal. The city’s harbor, fortress, and streets were all mortared with blood and sweat from captured slaves, and the despot was never known for mercy. Those who could not work were fed to demons.

Rumors say that the demon’s contract expired when Veltrin the Elder died, and Veltrin the Younger made a pilgrimage to Demon Mountain to renew it. The terms have not been disclosed, but one of the Master’s daughters is the Mistress of Coin in Reth-Saal, and some chests of gold are shipped north every spring.

What does the demon, a hideous sickly birdlike creature, think of all this? It hates the despot, hates the Master of Demon Mountain, and takes out its rage on the ships and dragons of the Mharoti every chance it gets. The captains of the fleet believe that a single magical word by Veltrin releases the demon, letting it off the chain and into havoc. This mayhem rarely leaves survivors, and it might be that Veltrin spreads the rumor of the word to stoke fear among his captains and galley slaves alike.

The fleet captains are less sure whether a word exists that recalls the demon Yarochort to its chains—it might be freed once it no longer fights on the flagship. Losing their demons would spell the end of the despot’s maritime dominance, which might explain his coziness with sorcery and the creation of ever-more of the Elect.

## Adventures in the Despotate
**Adventures in the Despotate**

Adventures in the Despotate typically involve slavery, huge treasures, and black magic.

- Rescue a recently enslaved character.
- Prevent the Ritual of Ravening.
- Destroy a zombie horde.
- Stop a slaver’s raid on more civilized lands.
- Rob one of the wealthy, decadent nobles.

## Toasts to the King
**Toasts to the King**

Three of the most common and most fawning toasts to the king include the following:

- “To our glorious shining king, master of men, binder of demon, may his hand never falter and his whip always rise!”
- “To King Veltrin, may he live a thousand years and a thousand more!”
- “Drink to slaves, for they make us rich and the king happy! Happiness, glory, and riches to King Veltrin, now and forever!”
- It is impossible to be excessive in such a toast. A Diplomacy check is required if the toast is made in public or in front of members of the Rubeshi nobility. The DC varies but should be no less than 15.
