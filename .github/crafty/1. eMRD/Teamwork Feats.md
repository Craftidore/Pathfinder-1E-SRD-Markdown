# Teamwork Feats
## Overview
**Teamwork Feats**

Teamwork feats grant significant bonuses, but they function only under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no benefits if the given conditions are not met. Allies who are [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Stunned|stunned]], [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Cavaliers, hunters, and inquisitors have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even if their allies don’t have those feats.
