# Dishonest Chamber (WondArch)
## Overview
**Dishonest Chamber:** Whenever anyone uses a *[[Divination (Spell)|divination]]* spell to detect an aura within this chamber, the spell instead randomly indicates that some other person or object radiates the aura searched for. If nothing in the chamber radiates the aura detected for, the chamber has no effect.

If the caster of the *[[Divination (Spell)|divination]]* spell makes a Will save (DC 13), his spell works normally.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Misdirection (Spell)|misdirection]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
