# Lifedrinker (PrC)
## Overview
Amid the ranks of the undead, the vampires are some of the

most feared creatures that stalk the night. Yet even those

cursed with vampirism have those that they respect and

fear. One such secretive group has many names, but most

often they are called lifedrinkers.

Lifedrinkers are vampires who have been undead for a

very long time, honing their evil abilities to the fullest. They

focus on their inherent ability to feed upon the living. Vampire

wizards, sorcerers, and clerics make the best

lifedrinkers, for the primary ability of the lifedrinker is to

turn life energy and blood stolen from another into magical

power.

Like most vampires, lifedrinkers are likely to have a host

of charmed guardians, vampire spawn, and other servants.

They often keep a small number of living beings to feed

upon, referring to the captives as their “cattle.”

Hit Die: d12.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the lifedrinker prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A lifedrinker is proficient

with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Lifewell (Ex): A lifedrinker stores the life energy that it

steals in a reservoir within itself called a lifewell. From this

lifewell, the lifedrinker draws the power needed to use

their its abilities. A lifedrinker gains lifewell points by

bestowing negative levels and by dealing Constitution

drain. Each negative level bestowed by the vampire’s

energy drain ability grants 2 lifewell points. Each point of

Constitution drained grants 1 lifewell point. The lifewell of

a lifedrinker can hold a maximum of 3 points per

lifedrinker level. Lifewell points gained when the lifewell

is already full are wasted.

A lifedrinker with 0 lifewell points must succeed at a Will

saving throw (DC 20) or go temporarily insane, attacking

any living creature within sight until the lifewell has at least

1 point per lifedrinker level. A successful saving throw

means that the lifedrinker need not make a saving throw

against this temporary insanity until one week has passed—

and even then only if the lifewell has remained at 0 points

throughout the week.

Invigorate (Ex): A lifedrinker can spend 1 lifewell point to

gain 1d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last 24 hours,

and while they do not stack with those granted by other

sources of temporary hit points, they do stack with more hit

points gained from the invigorate ability, so a lifedrinker may

spend multiple lifewell points to gain more temporary hit

points. No more lifewell points may be spent on this ability in

any given day than the lifedrinker has levels.

Spell Boost (Empower) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 2nd level

or higher casts spells, it may spend 4 lifewell points to

empower a spell as if using the Empower Spell feat. The

spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Spell Boost (Heighten) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 3rd level

or higher casts spells, it may spend a variable number of

lifewell points to heighten a spell as if using the Heighten

Spell feat. For every 2 lifewell points devoted to the spell

boost, the spell’s effective level is treated as one higher for

purposes of save DC and other effects. For example, if a

lifedrinker spends 4 lifewell points to boost a fireball spell,

the spell is treated as a 5th-level spell when calculating the Reflex save DC, and the boosted fireball can penetrate a

minor globe of invulnerability, which a 3rd-level fireball cannot.

The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Special Attack Boost (Empower) (Ex): A 4th-level

lifedrinker can spend 4 lifewell points to empower a special

attack, increasing its variable, numeric effects by a factor of

1.5. The special attack is empowered for one use only. For

example, a lifedrinker empowering its blood drain ability

would drain 1d3 points of Constitution, multiplied by 1.5. A

lifedrinker could also use this ability to summon more creatures

using the children of the night ability it gains as a vampire.

Some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities

that they can use with this ability; a sea hag vampire

lifedrinker, for example, could use this to empower her horrific

appearance.

Blood Servant (Ex): By spending 10 lifewell points, a

5th-level lifedrinker can call forth a lesser planar ally (evil

only), as per the spell of the same name. The ally automatically

serves the lifedrinker for 24 hours.

Boost Defenses (Ex): At 5th level, a lifedrinker can

spend 8 lifewell points to add +2 to its natural armor bonus

and turn resistance, add +10 to its cold resistance and electricity

resistance, and increase its damage reduction to

20/+2. The effects last for 24 hours.

Spell Boost (Maximize) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 6th level

or higher casts spells, it can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize

a spell as if using the Maximize Spell feat. The spell slot

and level of the spell do not change.

Greater Blood Drain (Ex): At 7th level, a lifedrinker’s

blood drain ability now deals 1d6 points of Constitution

drain.

Special Attack Boost (Maximize) (Ex): A lifedrinker of

7th level or higher can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize

all variable, numeric effects of a special attack. The special

attack is maximized for one use only. A lifedrinker using this

ability to maximize its greater blood drain ability, for example,

would deal 6 points of Constitution drain. A lifedrinker

could also use this ability to summon the maximum number

of creatures using the children of the night ability it gains as

a vampire. Some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities

that they can boost in a similar fashion.

Spell Boost (Quicken) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 8th level

or higher casts spells, it can spend 8 lifewell points to

quicken one of its spells, as if using the Quicken Spell feat.

The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Greater Invigorate (Ex): Whenever a 9th-level lifedrinker

uses its invigorate ability, it gains a +1 enhancement

bonus to Strength for each lifewell point spent. If multiple

lifewell points are spent at the same time, the bonus is correspondingly

larger. A lifedrinker that spends 10 lifewell

points all at once on invigorate gains 10d6 temporary hit

points and a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength. But if the

lifedrinker spends 5 lifewell points in one round and 5 more

points in the next, it has 10d6 temporary hit points but only

a +5 enhancement bonus to Strength. The bonus to Strength

lasts for 24 hours.

Blood Revel (Ex): Once a 10th-level lifedrinker drains

any blood from a victim, it can choose to enter a state called

a blood revel as a free action at the beginning of its next turn

and remain in that state for 10 rounds. In this state, the

lifedrinker gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength, its damage

reduction increases to 25/+3, its fast healing increases to 10

points per round, and it may ignore its weakness toward

garlic, mirrors, holy symbols, and running water, as well as

its vulnerability to sunlight.

However, during the blood revel, the lifedrinker cannot

flee from a living foe, and must attack physically every

round. A hasted lifedrinker in a blood revel could use its

extra partial action to cast a spell as long as it also made a

melee attack that round. A blood revel ends when the

lifedrinker chooses it to end, when 10 rounds are over, or

when no living foes can be reached by a full attack, a move

and an attack, or a charge. When the blood revel ends, the

lifedrinker must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be

utterly destroyed, as if it were reduced to 0 hit points. It

must remain in its coffin for as long as it was in its revel, plus

the amount of time it took to reach its coffin.
