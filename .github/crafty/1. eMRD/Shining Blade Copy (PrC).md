# Shining Blade Copy (PrC)
## Overview
Heironeous’s teachings focus on promoting good through

the use of armed force. Those among Heironeous’s servants,

both clerics and paladins, who aspire to become weapons

in their deity’s unending war against evil hope one day to

enter the shining blades. The shining blades of Heironeous

is an order of knights dedicated to prowess in melee

combat, which is achieved through prayer, devotion, and

asceticism. Members of the shining blades have an austere

and simple lifestyle, forsaking all worldly wealth and many

earthly pleasures in their quest to become but a blade in the

hand of Heironeous.

Most shining blades of Heironeous are clerics or paladins.

Some members of the order believe that a minimum of

training as a cleric, combined with the intense martial discipline

of the fi ghter is ideal to achieve the goal the shining

blades seek, while others follow a single class exclusively.

Very few multiclass arcane spellcasters, rogues, or monks

feel drawn to the shining blades.

NPC members of the shining blades are probably the

most devout, single-minded, and driven crusaders in

the world. Consumed with passion for the path

they have chosen, they have little patience

for those who are “blinded” by desire for

material goods or personal power. All

that matters, they believe and preach,

is the fi ght against evil; as long as evil

remains strong, there is important

work to be done.

Adaptation: This prestige class

could just as easily be called the shining

blade of Apollo, the shining blade of Ra,

or any other deity that fi ghts evil and has

paladins. If you change the deity, however,

make sure you change the weapon

to match. Moradin’s equivalent to this

class would be the shining axes, while

Corellon Larethian’s might be the

“shining arrows” (and it’d have a different

9th-level power).

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the shining blade of

Heironeous prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: The shining blades

of Heironeous are profi cient with all simple and martial

weapons, with all armor, and with shields.

Shock Blade (Su): Twice per day as a standard action, a

shining blade of Heironeous can cause a slashing or piercing

weapon he is holding to become a shock weapon, dealing

an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful

hit. The weapon is enhanced this way for up to a number of

rounds equal to the shining blade’s level plus his Charisma

modifi er (if any), but only so long as the shining blade is

holding the weapon. If he is disarmed or gives the weapon

to another character, the magical effect ends.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When an even-numbered

level is gained, the shining blade of Heironeous gains

new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if

he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class in

which he could cast divine spells before he added the prestige

class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefi t

a character of that class would have gained. If a character

had more than one divine spellcasting class in which he

could cast 1st-level spells before he became a shining blade,

he must decide to which class he adds each level of shining

blade for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Holy Blade (Su): At 5th level, the shining blade of

Heironeous can bestow two magical enhancements upon

his weapon. This supernatural ability replaces the shock

blade ability and can be used three times per day. With

each use of this ability, he can choose to make the weapon

a shock weapon dealing +1d6 points of damage or a holy

weapon dealing +2d6 points of bonus damage against evil

creatures. The weapon is enhanced this way for up to a

number of rounds equal to the shining blade’s level plus

his Charisma modifi er (if any), but only so long as the

shining blade is holding the weapon. If he is disarmed or

gives the weapon to another character, the magical effect

ends. The two uses of this ability can overlap, so in a given

combat a shining blade can spend one standard action

to make his blade holy and another to make it a shock

weapon. The weapon cannot be made to be doubly holy or

doubly shocking.

Brilliant Blade (Su): At 9th level, a shining blade can

bestow three magical enhancements upon his weapon.

This supernatural ability replaces the holy blade ability

and can be used six times per day. With each use of this

ability, he can choose to make the weapon a shock weapon

dealing an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage, a holy

weapon dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage against evil

creatures, or a brilliant energy weapon, which sheds light

as a torch and ignores nonliving matter (including armor,

undead, constructs, and objects). The weapon is enhanced

this way for up to a number of rounds equal to the shining

blade’s level plus his Charisma modifi er (if any), but

only so long as the shining blade is holding the weapon. If

he is disarmed or gives the weapon to another character,

the magical effect ends. The three uses of this ability can

overlap, so in a given combat a shining blade can spend one

standard action to make his blade holy, another to make it

a shock weapon, and another to make it a brilliant energy

weapon. The weapon cannot be made to be doubly holy,

doubly shocking, or doubly brilliant.

Aura of Courage (Su): Dekelor is immune to fear (magical

+4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This

ability functions while Dekelor is conscious, but not if he is

unconscious or dead.

Aura of Good (Ex): The power of Dekelor’s aura of good

(see the *detect good* spell) is equal to his paladin level, just like

the aura of a cleric of a good deity.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, Dekelor can use *detect evil*, as

the spell.

Divine Grace (Su): Dekelor gains a bonus equal to his

Charisma bonus (+2) on all saving throws.

Divine Health (Ex): Dekelor is immune to all diseases,

including supernatural and magical diseases (such as

mummy rot and lycanthropy).

Lay on Hands (Su): Dekelor can heal wounds (his own

or those of others) by touch. Each day he can heal 8 hit

points of damage. Dekelor may choose to divide his healing

among multiple recipients, and he doesn’t have to use it all

at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.

Shock Blade (Su): Twice per day as a standard action,

Dekelor can cause a slashing or piercing weapon he is

holding to become a shock

weapon, dealing an extra 1d6

points of electricity damage on

a successful hit. The weapon

is enhanced this way for up to

5 rounds, but only so long as

Dekelor is holding the weapon.

If he is disarmed or gives the

weapon to another character,

the magical effect ends.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per

day, Dekelor may attempt to

smite evil with one normal

melee attack. He adds 2 to his

attack roll and deals an extra

4 points of damage. If Dekelor

accidentally smites a creature

that is not evil, the smite has

no effect, but the ability is still

used up for that day.
