# Werewolf Shape
## Overview
**Werewolf Shape**

When you cast *[[Beast Shape IV (Spell)|beast shape IV]]* or *[[Shapechange (Spell)|shapechange]]*, you can choose to take the shape of a werewolf in addition to the other shapes available. While in werewolf shape, you gain all the effects of the werewolf template instead of the spell’s normal benefits. You act in all respects as a natural lycanthrope for the duration of the spell, including the ability to inflict the curse of lycanthropy using the spell’s save DC. You must be at least a 15th-level wizard to select this arcane discovery.
