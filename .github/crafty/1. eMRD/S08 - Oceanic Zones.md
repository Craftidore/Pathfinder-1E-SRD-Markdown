# S08 - Oceanic Zones
## Overview
**Oceanic Zones**

The ocean is divided into four zones: the sunlight zone (from the surface to 600 feet below), the twilight zone (from 600 feet down to 3,300 feet), the midnight zone (from 3,300 feet down to 13,000 feet—which often reaches the bottom), and the Abyssal zone (from 13,000 feet to the bottom in depths greater than 13,000 feet). Some oceanographers on Golarion add a fifth zone, the Abaddonian zone, which describes areas 20,000 feet and below in the deepest ocean trenches.

**Pressure:** Most aquatic creatures have adapted to depths corresponding roughly to one or more of these zones in particular, and ignore pressure damage while within their native depth range unless they instantaneously transport from one depth to another, as with *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*. Pressure damage rules appear on page 445 of the Core Rulebook. Surface creatures, on the other hand, treat depths of 0 to 100 feet as their native zone. For every minute spent below their native zone, a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every additional 100 feet beyond the first. The DC is initially 15, and it increases by 1 for every minute after the first. After five successful Fortitude saves (consecutive or not), the creature adapts to the pressure. If a creature is within its native depth range but experiencing pressure dangers due to instantaneous travel, this adaptation to the new pressure happens all at once, as per page 214 of the *Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide*. If the creature is outside its native range, this adaptation adjusts its native range down or up by 100 feet, as appropriate. A surface dweller swimming downward may adapt to the new depth, but will then experience pressure hazards when it ascends back to the surface.

For instance, if Valeros swims down 220 feet, he is 120 feet outside his native range of 0 to 100 feet, so he needs to attempt a Fortitude save every minute to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage. If he succeeds at five Fortitude saves, his native range shifts to 100–200 feet, and he must attempt Fortitude saves to avoid taking 1d6 points of damage each minute. After five more successful Fortitude saves, his native range is now 200–300 feet, and he takes no further damage from pressure, but if he ascends back to the surface, he must resume attempting Fortitude saves to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage from the reversing pressure. Because of the dangers of changing pressure, aquatic explorers find it safest to adjust their depth gradually unless they have special means of avoiding pressure hazards. Spells like *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|freedom of movement]]* and *[[Life Bubble (Spell)|life bubble]]* prevent pressure damage. *Pressure adaptation* and *stabilize pressure* on page 61 are more focused and lower-level options.

**Temperature:** Immersion in water can cause hypothermia in land-dwelling creatures at temperatures that would normally be perfectly safe on land. Generally, creatures in water that is 80° F or higher are safe from hypothermia. Water from 60° to 80° F is equivalent to cold weather (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage; see page 442 of the Core Rulebook for information on determining the DC). Water from 40° to 60° F functions like severe cold (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage). Water from 32° to 40° F acts as extreme cold (dealing an automatic 1d6 points of lethal cold damage each minute). Water below 32° F (which is generally possible only in areas with high levels of salt) deals an automatic 2d6 points of lethal cold damage per minute. Sea creatures are adapted to the water temperature in their native zones. The *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]]* spell protects its target from water as cold as 32° F (rather than –50° F in air), which is generally enough to cover temperature extremes in the ocean. By contrast, water rarely becomes warm enough to provide [[Heat Dangers (Environment Rules)|heat dangers]] except in the presence of a hazard like a hydrothermal vent, as even the most extreme temperatures in the sunlight zone tend to cap at around 104° F.

**Sunlight Zone:** The sunlight zone contains all aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis, so it’s home to both phytoplankton and seaweed. It’s also the home of most marine mammals, many sharks, some jellyfish, and most of the fish familiar to fisherfolk. The visibility estimates in the Perception section on page 46 assume sufficient light levels (or a means of seeing in the dark), which are typically present only in the sunlight zone. The water temperature in the sunlight zone varies based on the surface conditions, anywhere from over 100° F to below 30° F.

**Twilight Zone:** In the twilight zone, only about 1% of the light from the surface remains—not enough for photosynthesis. This also isn’t enough light for a creature with normal vision to see, but creatures with [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Low-Light Vision]] can still see to a distance of around 60 feet as though in dim light. Many creatures living in this zone either have [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]] or rely on precise senses other than sight to guide them, while others are bioluminescent. Roughly 90% of Golarion’s fish live in this zone. The temperature in the twilight zone ranges from about 68° F at the top to around 39° F at the bottom, with very few variations at any given depth.

**Midnight Zone:** The midnight zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, requiring [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]] or nonvisual senses for any creature that doesn’t have its own source of light. Fueled by the detritus that sinks from above, many types of squids and octopuses and some krakens live in this zone, along with some large whales and other creatures of the deep, but it’s harder for fish to survive here. The temperature in the midnight zone is generally 39° F throughout. The midnight zone usually extends to the bottom.

**Abyssal Zone:** In regions where the ocean floor is more than 13,000 feet below the surface, the Abyssal zone lurks beneath the midnight zone, a region that’s dark and cold even compared to the midnight zone, and devoid of even the falling detritus scavenged by midnight zone denizens. Named for the Abyss, this zone contains unnatural and horrific creatures mixed in with other fauna. [[Squid, Giant (Bestiary PF1)|Giant squids]], krakens, and other tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, despite the 35° to 39° F temperature. Other creatures congregate around the warmth of the zone’s hydrothermal vents, gaining nourishment from the vents’ expulsions.

**Abaddonian Zone:** Some scholars, particularly among deep-sea races, utter dark whispers of a fifth and final zone that exists only in the depths of the deepest ocean trenches, over 20,000 feet below the water’s surface. Supposedly, pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface world, combined with low temperatures and ambient magic, create within these trenches a nightmarish tableau that hardly seems it could exist on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]]. Amorphous creatures like jellyfish, sea cucumbers, and tube worms cling to life in this inhospitable environment, eking out a life amidst beings of unfathomable malevolence. While scholars have funded expeditions to gather information on the Abaddonian zone, there are few, if any, survivors to give their accounts of those expeditions, and certainly none who remained sane.
