# Fog Veil, Killing
## Overview
**Fog Veil, Killing:** This augmentation works like *[[Fog Veil|fog veil]]*, except that the fog is sickly green and poisonous. Any living creature in the *killing fog veil* with 3 or less HD dies instantly (no save). Creatures of 4â€“6 HD must make Fortitude saves (DC 17) or die. Those that survive (including all creatures above 6 HD) take 1d10 points of poison damage each round, whether they breathe or not.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Cloudkill (Spell)|cloudkill]]; Market Price:* 22,500 gp.
