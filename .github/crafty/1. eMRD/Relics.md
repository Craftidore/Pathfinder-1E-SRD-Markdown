# Relics
## Overview
This article introduces relics: magic items that grow in power the more they are used in the pursuit of a specific cause. Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. Relics occupy a space somewhere between normal magic items and artifacts. Unlike most magic items, relics can’t be crafted. Unlike artifacts, however, they can be destroyed normally. Eventually, these extra-powerful items are misplaced, forgotten, or ignored, and their power wanes as a result—though it is not entirely lost.

When PCs find a relic, it has only the first set of base abilities listed in its stat block; to unlock a relic’s full powers, its bearer must reawaken its latent energy.

PCs playing in the War for the Crown Adventure Path have the opportunity to discover two relics in each of the first four adventures (each of which is detailed in the following pages), and they can gradually increase the power of their relics by using them to perform bold deeds that help return Taldor to the resplendence of its heyday.

**TRIUMPHS**

As she adventures, the wielder of a relic might achieve great deeds, called triumphs, tied to the item’s associated cause, which she can apply to the relic to increase its power. Each volume of the War for the Crown Adventure Path indicates which deeds qualify as a triumph for the relics of old Taldor. Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.

An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding Koriana’s Blade (see page 79), the sword wouldn’t gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs’ third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a bag of holding, for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic’s enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item’s base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.

**Increasing DCs:** Some effects have DCs that increase as the relic attains more triumphs; these are indicated by a note such as “DC = 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained.” An effect with such a DC counts neither the triumph that the effect came from nor any previous triumphs. For example, if a relic’s first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.

**Fading Glory:** When the PCs discover a relic, the power of the item has faded significantly since it has gone many years without being used for its cause. In most campaigns, it’s unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic’s power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there. This can vary by item and is ultimately determined by the GM, but a good benchmark is one triumph entry lost per 1d4 years.

**RELICS IN YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN**

To implement relics in your own game, you can use the Taldan items presented here, adjusting their themes and details as necessary. Alternatively, you can adapt scaling items from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained (as described in the sidebar on page 76 in that book) or create your own items to suit your needs.

You’ll also need to set up potential triumphs the PCs can achieve to unlock the relics’ abilities. These triumphs should happen every 2 to 3 character levels. A triumph should always be linked to the achievement of a major goal within the campaign’s storyline. Include less frequent triumph events if the PCs are highly likely to succeed at all of them. If there’s a high chance the PCs will fail to achieve a particular triumph, you might include another triumph event fairly soon after. You can always alter future triumph events if items are looking like they’ll outpace the rate of one triumph every 2 levels. The theme of the relics you include should match the themes of the campaign. This doesn’t mean their mechanics and powers need to correspond exactly, but the more history and flavor, the better.

Relics work best in a campaign that has clear goals and major events. These might be goals that you’ve built into the game, but it’s also highly satisfying for players to define their own goals. If you make relics that are designed for a purpose that matches the purposes of one of the characters, you’ll set up a stronger bond and unity of purpose for that character-relic pair.

## Adapting Scaling Items
**Adapting Scaling Items**

Relics work much like the scaling items introduced in *Pathfinder Unchained*, with the exceptions that they don’t cost a share of your treasure and they scale up due to story events rather than at certain levels. This makes it easy to adapt the scaling items from that book to use as relics, either to replace ones listed here that don’t suit your group in War for the Crown or to use in a different campaign. Doing so requires the following adjustments, in addition to adding thematic background elements to the items to tie them to the triumphs of your game. 

**Remove Cost, Price, and Scaling Category:** Because relics can’t be crafted and aren’t typically bought or sold, they don’t have cost or price entries. Similarly, the scaling progression (bauble, prize, or wonder) is not usually relevant for relics. However, you might want to restrict yourself to only prizes and wonders when converting scaling items, since baubles aren’t as impressive as relics should be. 

**Determine Minimum PC Level:** Since the abilities of a relic aren’t explicitly tied to character levels, it’s important to limit PCs’ access to relics that would be too powerful for their level. In general, PCs should not gain access to a relic until their character level is at most 2 levels lower than the lowest-level ability of the scaling item on which that relic is based. 

**Combine Lower-Level Scaling Abilities:** Determine what level the PCs will likely be when they attain the relic. If this is higher than one or more of the item’s scaling levels, combine all those levels’ abilities into the base abilities of the item. 

**Turn Unlockable Abilities into Triumph Abilities:** Any remaining unlockable abilities can be unlocked by attaining triumphs rather than reaching a certain level. Look at your plans for what events will count as triumphs, because you might need to combine multiple unlockable abilities into one. This can happen if there’s a long level gap between triumphs and you need to make each one stronger to catch up with the PCs’ expected level.

## Alternate Relic System
A relic is a magic item—often, but not always, a wondrous item—that functions only when worn or held by a character who believes in the deity to whom the relic is dedicated. That character must devote a measure of spiritual energy to keep open a divine connection between the relic he wields and his deity’s power.

The wielder of a relic can establish the divine connection in two ways. Any divine spellcaster such as a cleric, druid, or paladin of the relevant deity can temporarily sacrifice a spell slot of the level specified in the relic’s description; the divine spellcaster can’t use the spell slot anymore, but he can use the relic. Whenever the cleric or druid prepares spells (or each morning in the case of a spontaneous divine caster such as the favored soul), he decides whether or not he wants to keep the divine connection to the relic active.

Whether they’re clerics or not, believers can wield relics if they have the True Believer feat and are high enough character level that if they were a cleric, they would have a spell slot high enough to sacrifice, activating the divine connection to the relic.

For example, Jozan is a 9th-level cleric who finds himself in possession of a *dawnstar* relic. At dawn he can sacrifice a 4th-level spell slot to use the *dawnstar* for the day instead. Or he can prepare a 4th-level spell instead, choosing not to use the magic of the *dawnstar.*

If Alhandra the paladin has the True Believer feat and worships Pelor, she can use the *dawnstar* as long as she’s 7th level or higher, because that’s the level she’d first have a 4th-level spell slot if she were a cleric or druid. If Jozan had the True Believer feat, he could likewise use the *dawnstar* at 7th level or higher, and he wouldn’t have to give up a spell slot to do so.

**BUYING AND SELLING RELICS**

Relics are generally not available for purchase, nor will PCs trying to sell them automatically find a buyer. They are much more rare than other magic items; usually less than a half-dozen copies of each relic exist. Secondly, they’re tied so tightly to worship of a particular deity, so only a very few characters can use them.

The descriptions below list market prices for each relic, but those prices are listed to help the DM design appropriate treasure for the NPCs in the campaign—you’ll never find a price tag on a relic. Some churches might offer a finder’s fee or other gifts equivalent to half the market price if the PCs return a lost relic to them. But such a situation could be role-played, because the deal depends greatly on the relationship between the church and the specific PCs who’ve acquired the relic.

**RELICS IN YOUR CAMPAIGN**

The relics in the section below are based on the deities of the core D&D pantheon, but they don’t have to be. Moradin’s *axe of ancestral virtue* works just as well for a deity of the dwarves you’ve created yourself—or any warlike but good deity, for that matter.

If you create your own relic, price them like you would any other magic item, but give them a discount based on the spell slot a cleric must sacrifice to use them. A discount worth 400 × spell slot level × minimum cleric level is a good starting place. Relics tend to be somewhat more complex than standard magic items. Many have magical effects that no spell duplicates exactly, giving them the feel of “artifacts on the cheap.”
