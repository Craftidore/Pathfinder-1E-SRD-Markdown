# Just Like New (Trait)
## Overview
**Just Like New:** Broken firearms are not problems—they are challenges. Your first attempt to remove the broken condition from your starting firearm and to upgrade it to a masterwork weapon costs 150 gp instead of 300 gp. In addition, when wielding a firearm that has the broken condition or is treated as if it had the broken condition, you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with it instead of the normal –2.
