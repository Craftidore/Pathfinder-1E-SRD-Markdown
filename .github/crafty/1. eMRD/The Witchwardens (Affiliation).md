Symbol: A round disk bearing a circle of runes with eight daggers pointing toward the center. Each dagger represents one school of magic, each contributing to the greater cause. Members of the guild typically wear the symbol as a badge on their robes.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Originally founded 600 years ago as a religious group dedicated to Wee Jas, the goddess of magic, death, and beauty, this guild has become much more secular over the years. Based in the Noble District, the Witchwarden Tower is the primary home of the guild. The 80-foot-tall tower houses numerous libraries, workshops, and meeting halls, all freely available to members, provided that they share their findings and knowledge with the guild. The Witchwardens prefer to keep an air of secrecy about them, requiring visitors to the tower to first make an appointment and restricting their access to the well-appointed meeting rooms on the first floor.

The first goal of the Witchwardens is the pursuit of arcane magic and members spend a great deal of their time researching new spells and recovering lost lore. The guild is also charged with the defense of the city against any magical threat. The current mistress of the guild, High Warden Lux Seoni (LN female human wizard 11) takes these responsibilities very seriously; constantly pushing guild members to strike out in new directions with passionate lectures and rallying them to the defense of the city in times of need.

Members: The Witchwardens are open to anyone who can cast arcane magic, including bards, sorcerers, and wizards. While some today still venerate the Witch Goddess, members may be of any faith. Many of the most powerful wizards and sorcerers in the city are members, giving this guild important ties to the powerful and wealthy.

Type: College.

Scale: 7 (city and outliers).

Affiliation Score Criteria: To join the Witchwardens, you must present yourself for review, where you are required to display your arcane talents in front of a panel of guild leaders. Prospective members must also pay a fee of 20 gp for the review. If you do not pursue arcane magic as your primary focus, you won’t derive much benefit from membership.

Titles, Benefits, and Duties: Members of the Witchwardens are required to pay a monthly due of 10 gp to cover simple expenses. Members who attain a new title are promoted at the end of the monthly arcane symposium, where they receive their new dagger (a badge of office).

Executive Powers: Craft, Gift, Research.
