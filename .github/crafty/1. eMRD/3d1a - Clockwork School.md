# 3d1a - Clockwork School
## Overview
**Clockwork School**

The clockworker focuses on the study of combining magic with machines.

*Clockworker’s Charm (Su):* Whenever you cast an animate construct spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to one-half your wizard level (minimum 1). At 20th level, you can change the duration of all animate construct spells to permanent. You can have no more than one animate construct spell made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another animate construct spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.

*Repairing Touch (Sp):* As a standard action, you can touch a metal object or construct, sealing up rents and bending steel back into place, repairing it for 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You may repair up to 1 lb. of metal per wizard level. You can do this a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Clockwork Body (Sp):* At 8th level, you can change your body for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level into a construct body, gaining +2 natural armor, 1d4+1 temporary hp per wizard level, darkvision 60 ft., and temporarily gaining construct traits for the duration of the effect. The metal body adds 60 lbs. to the wizard’s existing weight, reducing movement as per full plate (30-ft. movement rate becomes 20 ft.; 20-ft. movement rate becomes 15 ft.) and adds a −6 Armor Check Penalty to Dexterity- and Strength-based skills. The metal does not, however, affect arcane casting. At 12th level, the AC bonus increases to +3 and the temporary hit points increase to d6+1 per wizard level.
