# Rainbow Servant (PrC)
## Overview
Deep in the jungles lie magically hidden

ziggurats where the winged

serpents known as couatls

teach their secrets to

arcane spell casters

eager to gain a measure

of divine power.

Those who have

learned what the

couatl temples

have to offer are

known as rainbow

servants,

because they

agree to further

the couatl’s agenda

of virtue and hope no

matter how far they stray

from the jungle in exchange

for the knowledge they’ve received.

Most rainbow servants are sorcerers and wizards,

with the occasional bard making the jungle trek.

More sorcerers than wizards take on the

mantle of the rainbow servant,

because access to cleric

domains is a compelling

goal when spells known

are otherwise so limited.

Rainbow servants spend

much of their time traveling

on quests to make right some

wrong. The couatls have a potent

information network, so when they appear to direct a

rainbow servant, they often have information the forces

of evil thought they kept secret. But rainbow servants

don’t spend every moment at the beck and call of their

serpentine masters; the couatls recognize that their servants

have agendas of their own. A rainbow servant needs

only be mindful that at any time, a couatl could suddenly

appear in her life, describing a terrible evil that must be

thwarted.

NPC rainbow servants travel the world—not to mention

most of the Outer Planes—fi ghting evildoers and inspiring

hope and mercy wherever they go. Unless they’re traveling

incognito, rainbow servants identify themselves with

a prominent feathered plume on their headgear. Rainbow

servants who’ve completed several quests for their couatl

benefactors receive a *feathered cape of the couatls* as a mark of

distinction.

Adaptation: The couatl aspect of this prestige class

is inextricable from the rest of it, but you could develop

similar prestige classes with other good outsiders such

as lammasus, eladrins, or archons. It’s also easy to reverse

the class’s alignment and come up with a similar “striped

servant” class connected to the rakshasa, for example. And

the couatl’s jungle temples are rich with possibilities for

creating your own organization—anything from secretive

monks to weird spellcasters to friendly barbarian tribes

could be living in the temples or nearby.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the rainbow servant

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Rainbow servants

gain no profi ciency in weapons or armor.

*Detect Evil* (Sp): At will, a rainbow servant can use *detect*

*evil,* as the spell.

Extra Domain: A rainbow servant gains the granted

power and spell access of the Good domain at 1st level, the

Air domain at 4th level, and the Law domain at 7th level.

The rainbow servant generally uses a multicolored feather

of a couatl as her divine focus. For an explanation of how

nonclerics receive domain spells, see the Extra Domains

section at the beginning of this chapter.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new rainbow

servant level is gained, the character gains new spells per

day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting

class in which she could cast 3rd-level arcane spells before

she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that class would have gained

(improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild

shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that she

adds the level of rainbow servant to the level of whatever

other spellcasting class the character has, then determines

spells per day accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class in

which she could cast 3rd-level arcane spells before she

became a rainbow servant, the player must decide which

class to assign each level of rainbow servant for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Grow Wings (Su): Starting at 4th level, a rainbow

servant can grow multicolored, feathered wings like that

of a couatl. The wings, which allow fl ight at a speed of 60

feet with good maneuverability, have a daily duration of 1

minute per rainbow servant level, divided up however the

rainbow servant wishes. It takes a standard action to grow

or eliminate the feathered wings. Restrictive clothing and

armor of any kind prevents the wings from growing, and a

rainbow servant can’t grow wings while grappling.

*Detect Chaos* (Sp): At will, a rainbow servant of 7th level

or higher can use *detect chaos,* as the spell.

Cleric Spell Access: A 10th-level rainbow servant

can learn and cast spells from the cleric list, even if they

don’t appear on the lists of any spellcasting class he has.

Such spells are cast as divine spells if they don’t appear on

the sorcerer/wizard or bard spell lists. This class feature

grants access to the spells, but not extra spells per day.

The 10th-level rainbow servant can likewise read scrolls with cleric spells on them and use wands and staffs that

contain cleric spells.

*Detect Thoughts* (Sp): At will, a 10th-level rainbow servant

can use *detect thoughts,* as the spell. The save DC is Charismabased.
