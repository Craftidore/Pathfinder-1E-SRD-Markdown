# Unchained Classes
## Overview
Since the release of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*, countless game sessions have revealed that certain classes have been pushing against their constraints, yearning to break free into something at once familiar and new. This chapter includes unchained versions of the barbarian, monk, rogue, and summoner, as well as subsystems that alter character advancement. These classes can be used alongside their original counterparts (although individual characters must use one version or the other exclusively). Some feats, rage powers, rogue talents, and other rules might not work with the unchained classes, and such rules should be reviewed before being used with the new versions. Finally, with the exception of the monk, these classes should work with any of the archetypes from previous books as long as the classes still have the appropriate class features to replace. 

**Barbarian**: From a game balance perspective, the original barbarian serves her role admirably, but her mechanics require the player to recalculate numerous values once she enters a rage and keep track of a bevy of once-per-rage abilities. She can easily die in a fight due to the way that ending a rage lowers her hit points. The unchained barbarian significantly simplifies the rage bonus calculations, and she gains temporary hit points instead of raising and later decreasing her current and maximum hit points. Finally, she gains stronger versions of some of the weakest rage powers. 

**Monk**: The original monk has many disparate abilities, which donâ€™t always work together and are inflexible. The unchained monk loosens up, gaining ki powers that allow greater customization. The unchained monk also has a full base attack bonus and an all-new flurry of blows.

**Rogue**: The original rogue has a niche thanks to her sneak attack and high number of skill ranks, but she is still somewhat underpowered. The unchained rogue can debilitate her enemies to dramatically alter her ability to hit or dodge them, gains a unique edge when using her favorite skills, and enjoys a significant boost to her rogue talents. 

**Summoner**: The original summoner has plenty of innovative features, but he also lacks focus and theme. The unchained summoner gains an eidolon that fits among existing outsiders, gaining additional abilities and plenty of thematic flavor. Additionally, he has a revised spell list more in line with similar casters. 

**Fractional Advancement**: Every class has a mathematical progression for its base attack bonus and saving throws. Sometimes, multiclassing leads to unusual results, and this system allows you to calculate in detail without rounding. 

**Staggered Advancement**: It can feel a bit strange when a character picks up 10 new skills and a variety of other abilities all in one night. This system allows you to spread out advancement over the course of a level.
