# S05 - Perception and Survival
## Overview
**Perception and Survival**

While most skills work the same underwater, [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] work somewhat differently.

**Perception:** Even in clear water, the way light travels underwater makes it harder to see underwater than on land, and water sometimes contains particulates that further obscure vision. [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to see something are always made at a minimum –2 penalty underwater, and often a greater penalty when the water is murky (flowing water, such as in a current or river, is always at least somewhat murky). The maximum distance most creatures can see underwater varies from 40 to 320 feet in clear water (4d8 × 10) and from 10 to 80 feet in murky water (1d8 × 10). Generally the only way to gain the concealment necessary to use [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] in open water is to swim at least that distance away from an opponent.

Most naturally aquatic creatures either have eyes that are evolved to be exposed to water or have protective transparent eyelids, as do beavers. Surface creatures can use goggles to protect their eyes from water and its particulates; otherwise, they take a –4 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to see underwater and risk eye damage or blinding, depending on the water source.

Many undersea denizens, particularly those in deep areas, use [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] or [[S3.1T-Z - Universal Monster Rules T-Z (Bestiary 6 Apx)|tremorsense]] instead of sight. [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Scent]] usually works normally underwater for aquatic creatures (though terrestrial creatures that rely on [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] can’t follow a trail in the water), but water is more conducive to carrying scents from afar, allowing creatures like sharks to detect blood up to a mile away with their keen scent ability. Aquatic tremorsense detects disturbances in the water nearby, even without touching the same solid surface.

Sound travels farther and faster underwater, but that benefit is usually mitigated by the ambient noise of moving water. In situations with particularly little ambient noise (for instance, an area where all wildlife has been killed by a necromantic blight, or a flooded chamber or tank), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to hear something underwater are made with a +2 bonus.

**Survival:** Creatures with keen scent, like sharks, can track blood trails from an incredible distance, making it easier to track wounded targets in tandem with such a creature. Otherwise, it’s much harder to track a creature underwater with [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] unless the target is moving along the bottom or through something that might leave signs, like a coral reef or sargassum. Even then, the water quickly washes away signs of passage. The [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] DC to track in such a situation starts at 10, and increases by 1 for every 10 minutes after the target has passed through (or by 1 for every minute in areas with a current).
