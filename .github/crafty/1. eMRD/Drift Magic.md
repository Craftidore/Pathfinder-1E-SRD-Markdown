# Drift Magic
## Overview
Drift magic is the process of tapping the natural strata and tides of magic inherent in large collections of sand, ash, and dust. Such gatherings speak to eons of time, weathering, and history. This power is not visible to the unpracticed eye, but for those with the appropriate sensitivity, even common sand is awash with potential that can be tapped to increase the effects of spells and produce other special effects.

**Learning Drift Magic:** Knowledge empowers drift magic. A character must have taken the Drift Magic feat to gain any of the following benefits. With this understanding, a character unlocks the knowledge of the eternal desert. Drift magic is not a secret lore. In fact, information on the craft can be found in desert tombs, scrawled on crumbling papyrus, and in the dreams of those who sleep at the heart of a sandstorm.

**Limitations of Use:** Drift magic requires a connection to the waste, in the form of sand or other desert soil. In waste environments, the soil surrounding a character is sufficient to meet this requirement. When traveling in other environments, a practitioner of drift magic must carry 1 pound of such material among her equipment.

**Using Drift Magic:** To use drift magic, a character must merely keep in mind her special knowledge of the desert. No checks are required. In natural areas of sand, dust, or ash, a practitioner can use drift magic as a free action. Other areas require the practitioner to expend a move action to utilize drift magic. Spells with a casting time of longer than 1 standard action cannot benefi t from drift magic.

**Bonus to Effective Caster Level:** A practitioner of drift magic adds 1 to the effective caster level of any spell that has the earth descriptor or that deals dessication damage. Even if a spell meets both these criteria, the effective caster level only increases by 1.

**Flaywind Burst**: Characters with the Drift Magic feat can learn *flaywind burst* as a 4th-level spell, instead of a 5th-level one.
