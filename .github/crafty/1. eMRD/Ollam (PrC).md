# Ollam (PrC)
## Overview
In Dwarven, the word “ollam” means teacher. The education

of the dwarf people is considered a sacred duty, and

those who are considered knowledgeable in dwarf history

and legend—and thought to possess above-average

common sense—are often called upon to take up the

respected role of teacher in the community. While other

cultures might see this as a job for young girls

or old men, the dwarves see an ollam as

a protector of their cherished culture.

No one in the dwarf community takes

that position lightly.

An ollam is granted a special

position in the temple hierarchy—

Moradin gives her spells that allow

her not only to delve into the secrets

of the universe but also to heal

and keep an eye on her charges.

While most ollams are clerics or

bards, individuals of other classes

are welcomed, as long as they possess

the knowledge needed to teach the children

properly.

NPC ollams are equally likely to be safely

ensconced in the heart of a dwarf community,

passing on the accumulated lore of their people,

or wandering the lands, sharing their knowledge

with dwarves and nondwarves alike.

If there’s something going on in a dwarf

city, you can count on the ollams knowing

about it first. They’re uncommonly well

connected with each clan and stratum of

dwarf society.

Adaptation: One of the functions

of the ollam prestige class

is to give a few bardlike abilities

to nonbards—without

giving away so much that

the prestige class steals

the bard’s thunder. Given

different circumstances, it’s easy to imagine

ollams from other races and cultures.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the ollam prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ollams are proficient

with all simple weapons, with all types of

armor, and with shields.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd, 3rd,

and 4th level, an ollam gains new spells

per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if she had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class to which she belonged

before adding the prestige class level.

She does not, however,

gain any other

benefit a character

of that class

would have gained.

If she had more than

one spellcasting class before

becoming an ollam, she must

decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

If an ollam had no levels in a spellcasting

class before taking the prestige class, at 2nd

level she gains the spellcasting abilities

of a cleric whose caster level is one lower

than her class level.

Lore (Ex): An ollam has the ability

to recall legends or information regarding

various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge.

See the bardic knowledge class feature, page 29 of the

*Player’s Handbook.* An ollam adds her class level and her

Intelligence modifier to her lore check. If the character

has a similar ability from another class (such as bardic

knowledge), her ollam levels stack with class levels

from that other class to determine the success of the

lore check.

Inspire Competence (Su): An ollam of 3rd level or

higher can use oratory to help an ally succeed at a task.

The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on checks with a

particular skill. If the ally is a dwarf, the competence

bonus increases to +3. See the bardic music class feature,

page 29 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

If an ollam has the inspire competence bardic music

ability, she can expend one daily use of her bardic music

to increase the competence bonus to +4 (or +6 if the ally

is a dwarf).

Inspire Resilience (Su): From an early age, dwarves

learn to approach life with steadfast resolution and endurance.

A 5th-level ollam can spend a standard action to use

oratory to tap into this power, granting a single dwarf

ally a +4 competence bonus on Constitution checks and

Fortitude saves, as well as damage reduction 5/—. The

ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the

ollam. The ollam must also be able to see the ally. The

effect lasts for as long as the ollam orates and for 1 minute

thereafter.

Allies who are not dwarves instead gain a +2 competence

bonus on Constitution checks and Fortitude saves,

gain no damage reduction, and are fatigued at the end of

the duration. (Dwarves suffer no ill effect.)
