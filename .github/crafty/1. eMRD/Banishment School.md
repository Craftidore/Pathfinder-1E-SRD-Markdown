# Banishment School
## Overview
**Banishment School**

**Associated School**: Abjuration.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the energy absorption power and the protective ward power of the abjuration school.

**Unstable Bonds (Su)**: At 1st level, your touch can disrupt the bonds that hold a summoned or called creature on this plane. As a melee touch attack, you can cause a summoned or called creature to become shaken and staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Aura of Banishment (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of banishment for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Any summoned or called creature in the area must make a Will save each round. Once the creature fails a Will saving throw, it is staggered as long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second Will saving throw, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and the spell that summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more than one creature, only the creature that failed its saving throws is affected. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
