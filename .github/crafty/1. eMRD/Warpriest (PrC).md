# Warpriest (PrC)
## Overview
Warpriests are fi erce, earthy clerics who pray for peace but

prepare for war. Their strong wills, powerful personalities,

and devotion to their deities make them fearsome combatants.

Clerics make good warpriests; members of other

classes need levels as a cleric before they can qualify as

warpriests because of the domain requirements.

Most NPC warpriests spend their time preparing for war.

This effort includes personal training for combat, prayer,

training with the local ruler’s army, and studying military

history or tactics. Warpriests tend to have the more extroverted

characteristics associated with their deities. Occasionally

they can be found scouting terrain in peacetime,

and some have been known to hide their identities to spy

on enemy nations. They rarely go on adventures, and when

they do it’s to obtain some artifact or wondrous weapon to

increase their prowess.

Adaptation: This prestige class is designed to represent

the cleric who leads large numbers of troops into battle.

Accordingly, members of the class are likely to be part of

a military organization. It’s probable, though not strictly

necessary, that the followers are also members of the same

faith as the warpriest.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the warpriest prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Warpriests gain profi

ciency with all simple and martial weapons, with all types

of armor, and shields (including tower shields).

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A warpriest continues

advancing in divine spellcasting ability. When a warpriest

gains a new even-numbered level, the character gains new

divine spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if

he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting

class he belonged to before he added the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character

of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling

or rebuking undead, more frequent *remove*

*disease,* and so on).

For example, an 8th-level cleric/2nd-level warpriest gains

divine spells per day as if he had risen to 9th level as a cleric.

When he next gains a level as a warpriest, making him an

8th-level cleric/3rd-level warpriest, his number of divine

spells per day does not change; but when he improves his

warpriest level to 4th, he gains divine spells per day as if he

had risen to 10th level as a cleric.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class

before he became a warpriest, the player must decide which

class to assign each even-numbered level of warpriest for

the purpose of determining divine spells per day and spells

known.

Bonus Domain: At 1st level, a warpriest gains the Glory

domain (if he turns undead) or the Domination domain (if

he rebukes undead).

Rally (Ex): A warpriest who currently is not suffering

from a fear effect can use this ability as a standard action.

Allies within 60 feet who are suffering from any fear effect

and who can hear the warpriest are allowed another saving

throw against the fear effect, with a +1 morale bonus per

warpriest level.

Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su): Levels of warpriest stack

with any of the character’s cleric or paladin levels when

turning or rebuking undead.

Infl ame (Ex): As a full-round action, the warpriest can

infl ame the passions of his allies. All who can hear the

warpriest gain a morale bonus on saving throws against

any charm or fear effect. The bonus begins at +2 for a 2ndlevel

warpriest and increases by +2 at each even-numbered

level thereafter (+4 at 4th level, +6 at 6th level, and so on).

This effect lasts for 5 minutes after the speech ends, plus 1

minute per level of the warpriest. The warpriest also gains

the bonus.

*Mass Cure Light Wounds* (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, a

warpriest can use *mass cure light wounds* once per day as a

spell-like ability. Treat the warpriest’s caster level for this

effect as equal to his highest divine caster level.

Fear Aura (Su): Once per day starting at 5th level, a

warpriest can emanate a fear aura in a 20-foot radius for

1 round per level. Foes must make a Will save (DC 10 +

warpriest’s class level + warpriest’s Cha modifi er) or be

affected as if by a *fear* spell.

*Heroes’ Feast* (Sp): Once per day, a warpriest of 6th level or

higher can use *heroes’ feast* as a spell-like ability.

*Haste* (Sp): At 7th level, a warpriest gains the ability to use

*haste* three times per day as a spell-like ability.

*Mass Heal* (Sp): Once per day, a warpriest of 9th level

or higher can use *mass heal* as a spell-like ability. Treat the

warpriest’s caster level for this effect as equal to his highest

divine caster level.

Implacable Foe (Su): At 10th level, a warpriest can

channel positive (or negative) energy to keep allies fi ghting

even after suffering mortal wounds. Activating this ability

requires only a move action, but the warpriest must concentrate

to maintain it each round after that.

While active, the warpriest emanates an aura with a 100-

foot radius. Allies within the radius may ignore the effects

of being reduced to 0 or less hp. However, any creature

reduced to –20 hp dies immediately. When the effect ends,

or if a creature moves more than 100 feet from the warpriest,

the normal effects of the damage apply immediately.

If the warpriest normally turns undead, this ability affects

living allies. If the warpriest normally rebukes undead, this

ability affects undead allies.
