# Troubadour of Stars (PrC)
## Overview
With the exception of Gwynharwyf, who holds her barbarian

champions in special regard, the various lords and knights of

the eladrin Court of Stars do not sponsor individual orders of

followers. Rather, as a group they offer their patronage to certain

mortal bards, granting them the ability to channel their celestial

music through their mortal voices and instruments. These

blessed bards are the troubadours of stars, gifted musicians and

champions of good.

Only a character who spontaneously casts arcane spells can

become a troubadour of stars. Bards are the most common, but

a very few sorcerers take up the eladrins’ mantle as well.

Troubadours of stars tend to wander alone, or as part of a

small band, traveling far and wide across the mortal world.

They strive to bring hope to the hopeless and freedom

to those oppressed or enslaved by tyrants.

Whenever one troubadour encounters

another on her travels, the two exchange

stories and news before continuing on

their separate ways. They are duty-bound

to help each other in times of need, but

rarely seek out extensive contact with

others of their order.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the troubadour of stars

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Troubadours of stars gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Bardic Music: A troubadour of stars adds her class level to

her bard level, if any, to determine what bardic music abilities

she can use and how often she can use them. In addition, her troubadour levels stack with her bard levels for purposes of

determining the bonus granted by her bestow courage ability. A

troubadour of stars with no bard levels gains bardic music abilities

as a bard of her class level.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell.

Holy Cacophony (Su): A 2nd-level troubadour of stars with

8 or more ranks in Perform can, as an extra bardic music effect,

create a song of discordant notes that hampers evil creatures.

Any evil creature within 30 feet of the troubadour must make a

successful Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) in order to

cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. Using the Words of Creation

with this ability increases the save DC to 20 + spell level

and deals 8d4 points of nonlethal damage to the troubadour.

Holy cacophony is a sonic, mind-affecting ability.

Celestial Spells:Once she reaches 2nd level, a troubadour of

stars can cast spells as if she were an eladrin. Specifically, the

troubadour can learn and cast any spell described in Chapter

6 that has a celestial or eladrin component, as long as

she can otherwise cast the spell (it appears on her

spell list, it is of a level of spells that she can cast, and

she has a sufficient ability score to cast spells of

that level).

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each evennumbered

troubadour of stars level, the character

gains new spells per day and spells

known as if she had

also gained a level

in an arcane spellcasting

class to

which she belonged

before adding the

prestige class level. The class must

spontaneously cast spells (as a

sorcerer or bard does). She

does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of that class would have gained (bardic

music abilities, improved familiar abilities, and so on). If

the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a troubadour of stars, she must decide

to which class she adds each troubadour level for

the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Starmantle (Sp): At 3rd

level, a troubadour of stars gains

the ability to use starmantle, as the spell

(see Chapter 6), once per day. Her caster level is equal to her

character level.

Song of Hope (Su): A 5th-level troubadour of stars with 11 or

more ranks in Perform can, as an additional bardic music effect,

inspire powerful hope in her allies. Good-aligned creatures

within 30 feet of the troubadour who are her allies gain a +2

morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill

checks, and weapon damage rolls, as if affected by the good hope

spell. In addition, affected creatures gain a new saving throw

against any fear effect, despair effect (such as the crushing despair

spell), or similar mind-affecting condition, excluding charm

person, dominate person, and similar spells. An affected creature

may use the troubadour’s Perform check result in place of her

saving throw if, after rolling the saving throw, the Perform

check result proves to be better. Using the Words of Creation

with this ability increases the morale bonus to +4 and deals

11d4 points of nonlethal damage to the troubadour.

Song of hope is a sonic, mind-affecting

ability.

Sanctified Spells: A 6th-level troubadour

of stars can use sanctified spells as

though they were among her spells

known.

Eladrin Form (Sp): At 7th level, a troubadour

of stars gains the ability to use

eladrin form, as the spell (see Chapter 6),

once per day. Her caster level is equal to

her class level.

Celestial Symphony (Su): A 9th-level

troubadour of stars with 15 or more ranks in

Perform can, as an additional bardic

music effect, create an effect that

duplicates the holy word spell.

Nongood creatures within 30

feet of the troubadour are affected

as though by the spell. The troubadour’s

caster level is equal to her

class level. Using the Words of Creation

with this effect grants the troubadour

a +4 bonus on her

caster level check to

overcome spell resistance

and deals 15d4 points of

nonlethal damage to

the troubadour. Celestial

symphony is a sonic effect.

Celestial Ascension (Ex): At 10th level, a troubadour of stars

is so attuned to the ways of the eladrins that she becomes a magical

creature. Her type changes to outsider (native) and she

gains damage reduction 10/unholy. Unlike other outsiders, the

troubadour can still be brought back from the dead.
