# C05 - The Dragon Empire and the South
## Overview
**The Dragon Empire and the South**

The lands of the Dragoncoil Mountains and the vast deserts south of the Middle Sea are another world compared to the fertile forests and mountains of the North. They are rich in trade and ancient in magic, but also dominated by a vast draconic empire, and by the god-kings of Nuria before that. Their strange magic and their control of valuable trade routes makes them rich and powerful, and their schools of learning are in many ways more advanced than those of the Seven Cities or the Crossroads, to say nothing of the Rothenian Plains or the Northlands.

In the parched lands of the East, the thralls and subjects of the Mharoti Empire live in fear of the annual onslaught of the sultana’s dragon-mounted legions and the deadly infiltrations of harem assassins. Once a year, the sultana’s decree urges the nobility to put aside its endless feuding to conquer new lands under the banners of the Fire Monks and Wind Priests of the Four Elemental Temples. The various lords, lordlings, and emirs ride mighty wyrms and drakes to war supported by fearsome fire giants, the ogrekin of Kaa’nesh, and eunuch sorcerers of the Eastern Rites. The hunger of their draconic patrons never ceases, and their greed drives never-ending campaigns to gather slaves, resources, and new lands. Indeed, worship of Mammon and the Hunger God Vardesain is a constant problem, since dragons are in many ways as prone to corruption and temptation as humans are.

All this striving has led to wealth and power growing as inevitably as an avalanche in the high passes. Gold and silver trickle through the empire like rivers. The Mharoti Empire’s cities and tent towns host magnificent bazaars, crowded with thieves and criminals. Caravans connect the Southlands with the duplicitous Triolans, and ambassadors of a hundred nations seek the sultana’s blessings in the courts of Harkesh.

The empire’s people are proud, and yet they show hints of hubris, religious zealotry, even signs of faltering bloodlines and decay. Debauched cultists beholden to strange gods kidnap unwary travelers to sacrifice to great fiery Baal, or to minor devils and local cults such as V’ashra the Tormentor or Forty-Finger Nakresh. The cults of Nuria seep across its borders, and the peculiar gods of the East are present in the empire as well, in particular in the form of four-faced Azuran. Paladins, monks, and sects of every kind breed preach loudly, beg quietly, and fight in the streets. Unrest among the priesthood has toppled more than one sultan. Baal’s mouth is ever hungry, seeking sacrifices and taxes for the empire’s further glory.

The empire’s expansion is not unopposed. Triolo’s minotaur corsairs battle against the sultana as red-sailed pirates, while the fiercely independent knights of Illyria and the mysterious White Goddess protect caravans from bandits. Triolo and Illyria have a tentative alliance born of necessity. Idols and walking god-kings ward the ancient tombs of the River Kingdom of Nuria Natal and the rich oases that dot the parched desert lands. At the moment, the Nurians are at peace with the Dragon Empire, though it is only a matter of time before the sultana attempts a new plan to conquer the ancient god-kings. The children of angels hold fast to their ancient lands in Ishadia, though the cost has been steep and currently they also have an uneasy peace. It is believed the Sultana thinks they will fall easily into her hands if she can only push back on other fronts first. The Magdar Kingdom fights a holding action, and its border is a territory of raids and small wars against drakes and dragon knights.

The dragons are somewhat limited by their great successes, and they might be reaching the boundaries of their power—though few would bet against them. Somehow the Dragon Empire fights against four of these kingdoms and at the same time it grapples with the enormous Empire of Khandiria to the east—having dragons among its legions is a great advantage, but perhaps its claws seek to sweep one too many treasures into its grasp at once. But the Mharoti people—from its tiniest kobolds and most ragged humans to the mightiest gem-encrusted vizier and sagest dragon-prince—all believe in the legends of their greatness, and in their kinship with Veles the World-Serpent, the Maker of All Things. Surely the dragons who rule are made in his image, and surely they are fated to rule the world? Such confidence is infectious, and the Mharoti legions fight harder and march faster knowing that the blessings of the Dragon Gods shine on them and their cause.

So, visit the thousand stalls in the Grand Bazaar of Harkesh, loot the tombs of the god-kings, sail aboard the Sand Ships of Siwal, or ascend the Sky Stairs of Beldestan—ten thousand mysteries of mountain and desert abound in the Dragon Empire and its surrounding lands!

**Dragoncoil Ley Magic**

The Mharoti are known for their affinity for elemental magic, and these elements are reflected in the ley lines that thread up and down the valleys of the Dragoncoil Mountains. Wizards and sorcerers refer to fire lines and ice lines as especially common but fleeting, while stone lines and ocean lines are more enduring. The most powerful mountain-peak nodes and the coiling magic of certain updraft ley lines are perhaps best left to those who can fly and cast magic at the same time. When you are placing ley lines here, consider elemental effects as being more common than elsewhere.

Also note that the Mharoti refer to shadow roads and fey roads as the dragon roads, or the Gates of Veles.

The Empire’s expansion is not unopposed.
