# Charming (Trait)
## Overview
**Charming:** Blessed with good looks, you've come to depend on the fact that others find you attractive. You gain a +1 trait bonus when you use [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] on a character that is (or could be) sexually attracted to you, and a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of any language-dependent spell you cast on such characters or creatures.
