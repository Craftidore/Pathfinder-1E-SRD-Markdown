# Mounts and Related Gear
## Overview
These are the common mounts available in most cities. Some markets might have additional creatures available, such as camels or even griffons, depending on the terrain. Such additional choices are up to GM discretion, and rules for the creatures can be found in the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*.

**Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature**: Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table 6–6.

Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as human armor (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see Table 6–8). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

Flying mounts can’t fly in medium or heavy barding.

Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table 6–7. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider and normal saddlebags.

| | **Base Speed** |||
|---|---|---|---|
| **Barding** | **(40 ft.)** | **(50 ft.)** | **(60 ft.)** |
| Medium | 30 ft. | 35 ft. | 40 ft. |
| Heavy | 30 ft.\* | 35 ft.\* | 40 ft.\* |
| \* A mount wearing heavy armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple. ||||

**Dog, Riding**: This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a war-trained horse. Due to its smaller stature, you take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.

**Donkey or Mule**: Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.

**Feed**: Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it meat.

**Horse**: A horse is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.

A combat-trained horse can be ridden into combat without danger. See the Handle Animal skill for a list of tricks known by horses and ponies with combat training.

**Saddle, Exotic**: An exotic saddle is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.

**Saddle, Military**: This saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you’re knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75% chance to stay in the saddle.

**Saddle, Pack**: A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.

**Saddle, Riding**: If you are knocked unconscious while in a riding saddle, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle.
