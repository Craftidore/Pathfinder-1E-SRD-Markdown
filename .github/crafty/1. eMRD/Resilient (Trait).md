# Resilient (Trait)
## Overview
**Resilient:** Growing up in a poor neighborhood or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist on food and water from doubtful sources. Youâ€™ve built up your constitution as a result, and gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 53
