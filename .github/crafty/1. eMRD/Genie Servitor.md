# Genie Servitor
## Overview
**Genie Servitor**

You bind a genie to your service.

**Prerequisite:** Able to cast 3rd level spells

**Benefit:** You gain a genie servant, who loyally and faithfully serves you until dismissed. This genie is one who has volunteered to serve a mortal spellcaster, and is then summoned by you in a ritual similar to those used to call a familiar. Most genie servitors volunteer in order to gain access to the secrets of the Material Plane and its spellcasters, and absorb arcane lore by observing your actions. A few genie servitors agree to such service as punishment for a crime committed amongst geniekind, and are treated as having been banished until their term of service is completed. The rarest genie servitors are those bound to a family or nation through ancient, centuries-old pacts, and are sworn to provide a given number of servitors to the group with which they made the ancient pact.

The maximum HD of your genie servitor is determined by your Arcane Master score (see below). Most wizards summon a janni as their first servitor, then specialize into more powerful genies associated with elements the wizard often uses in his spells. If a genie servitor is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. If a wizard’s Arcane Master score allows for a servitor with more HD than the genie race selected, the genie servitor gains HD using the normal rules for monster advancement.

The magic bond that keeps the genie loyal and faithful to your desires (rather than merely obedient to the letter of your commands) drains some of the genie’s innate magic powers, resulting in limitations to some of their innate spells and spell-like abilities. A genie servitor can’t use any spells or spell-like abilities with a level greater than half your wizard level, and cannot use any based on spells that have a material component with a gp cost, or a focus. Any spell or spell-like ability the genie would normally be able to use at-will is instead limited to 3/day.

**Arcane Master Modifiers:** Several factors can affect your Arcane Master score, causing it to vary from the base score (spellcaster level + Int modifier). These modifiers are based somewhat on your reputation, but more on your mystic power, and how many ways it’s already being pulled.
