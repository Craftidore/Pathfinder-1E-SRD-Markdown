# Ghost Rager (Su)
## Overview
*Ghost Rager (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal creatures even when using nonmagical weapons. She also gains a morale bonus to touch AC equal to her saving throw bonus from her [[Superstition (Ex)|superstition]] rage power. A barbarian must have the [[Superstition (Ex)|superstition]] rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
