# Rune-Carved Creature
## Overview
Words have meaning, names have power, but nothing has more power than the written word. All the secrets of the world begin and end as words, capturing these words, carving them into beings and granting them the personified power that those words represent. Such is the nature of the Rune-Carve Creature. Rune-carved creatures are always easily to identify by the prominent complex sigils they display.

**Creating a Rune-Carved Creature**

"Rune-carved" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A rune-carved creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**CR:** +2

**Defenses/Qualities:** Immune to *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]]*, glyph and symbol spells. Weakness vulnerability to *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* (this spell deals 10 point of damage per caster level to a rune-carved creature, a successful caster level check DC 15+CR also removes the benefits of this template for that creature. )

**Special Abilities:** A rune-carved retains all the special abilities of the base creature, plus the special abilities as described below:

*Domain Rune (Sp or Su):* A rune-carved creature gains all the benefits of the domain or sub-domain associated as a cleric of a level equal to the base creature’s HD. It also gains the domain spells as spell-like abilities, if it has an Int score of 8 or higher useable 1/day, but only those available to a cleric of a level equal to the base creature’s HD. Caster level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). All DCs for the domain abilities and spell-like abilities are Intelligence based rather than Wisdom or Charisma based.

For example, a GM applies this template to the standard Balor Demon choosing the word and rune for “Ruin” choosing to associate this with the [[Destruction (Domain)|Destruction]] domain. This rune-carved Balor would then gain the following abilities:

- *Destructive Smite (Su):* 10/day with a +10 morale bonus on damage.
- *Destructive Aura (Su):* For 20 rounds per day. A +10 morale bonus on damage.
- Spells Abilities (CL 20): 1/day—*[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]], [[Earthquake (Spell)|earthquake]], [[Harm (Spell)|harm]], [[Inflict Critical Wounds (Spell)|inflict critical wounds]], [[Implosion (Spell)|implosion]], [[Rage (Spell)|rage]], [[Shatter (Spell)|shatter]], [[Shout (Spell)|shout]], [[True Strike (Spell)|true strike]]*

*Personal Rune (Sp):* A rune-carved creature can place its rune upon an item and gain a special connection to that item. The rune is permanent, and henceforth the rune-carved creature always knows the item’s location and the name and race of any creature currently touching it a successful Will save negates (DC 10 + 1/2 the rune-carved creature’s HD + its Intelligence modifier) this effect. The rune-carved creature can have as many personal sigils in effect as it has HD. Placing a personal rune is a full-round action.

A rune-carved creature can make this rune function as *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]].* At 5 HD this ability upgrades to *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]*, at 11 HD this upgrades to *[[Glyph of Warding, Greater (Spell)|greater glyph of warding]]*, at 15 HD this upgrades to any *symbol* spell. CL is equal to HD.

*Runic Complexity (Su):* Strange and arcane symbols appear to float in the air all around the rune carved creature as it attacks. A rune-carved creature can require the target of one of its spell or special ability to modify its saving throw with its Intelligence ability score modifier rather than the standard ability score (Constitution for Fortitude saves, Wisdom for Will Saves, Dexterity for Reflex saves), because it must deal with the overwhelming complexity of the attack’s intricacy. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Intelligence modifier.

*Runic Dominance:* All the base creature’s abilities (including DCs) for its Extraordinary, supernatural, spells and spell-like abilities are changed to Intelligence based (for example a rune-carved sorcerer’s spell DCs and bonus spells would be adjusted by his Intelligence modifier rather than his Charisma modifier).

**Abilities:** Con +4 (+2 hp per HD, +2 to Fortitude saves), Int +8 (add 4 bonus languages, add 4 skill points per HD, +4 to [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]], [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]], [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]], and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks; +4 to all of the creature’s DCs)

**Skills:** Rune-carved gain a +8 racial bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) and [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]] checks in addition to gaining these two skills as class skills.
