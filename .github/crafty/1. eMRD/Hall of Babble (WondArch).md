# Hall of Babble (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Babble:** Anyone who enters this stronghold space must make a Will save (DC 14) or have any words that she speaks come out as an unintelligible mess. The creator of this magic item determines the exact nature of the transmuted sounds at the time of creation.

This makes it impossible for anyone in the room to communicate verbally with anyone else. Additionally, it prevents a spellcaster from casting a spell that requires a verbal component.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sculpt Sound (Spell)|sculpt sound]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
