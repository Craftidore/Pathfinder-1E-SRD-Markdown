# Asmodean Demon Hunter (Trait)
## Overview
**Asmodean Demon Hunter (Asmodeus):** Raised in the church of Asmodeus (whether or not you are currently a follower), you've focused your indoctrinated fervor primarily on the elimination of demons. You gain a +3 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) checks about demons and a +2 trait bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting spells and effects from demons.
