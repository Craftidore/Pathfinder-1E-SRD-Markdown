# Mage of the Arcane Order (PrC)
## Overview
Also called a “guildmage,” a member of this prestige class is

a spellcaster who belongs to an academy and guild known as

the Arcane Order. The academy is called the Order in casual

conversation, or sometimes just “that college of wizardry.” It

is both a school for fl edgling spellcasters and a guild for those

of advanced knowledge and power.

The Arcane Order’s charter is twofold. The group’s fi rst

objective is advancing magical knowledge through both

ongoing research and archeological investigation of lost arcane

disciplines. A good portion of research is centered around

elucidating a “magical grammar” of the great power wielded

in ages past, and this research has borne wondrous fruit:

metamagic feats. The second tenet is the support and welfare

of the Order’s membership, initially through arcane schooling

and later through companionship, resources, boarding, and

access to the Spellpool (see the sidebar on page 49). Although

nonwizards can benefi t somewhat from what the Order has

to offer, its emphasis on wizardry deters most applicants. In

fact, the Order boasts almost no sorcerers, bards, or other

characters with signifi cant talent as spontaneous casters.

NPC guildmages often join adventuring companies of

nonspellcasters who are not affi liated with the Order. Thus,

they could be encountered anywhere adventure beckons.

However, a guild member in good standing returns when

he can to the campus, pays his required dues, and does his

part in the upkeep of the Spellpool.

Adaptation: This prestige class can be tweaked by changing

the premise of the Spellpool. Instead of a construct of

stored spells that must always be paid back, lest debt be

incurred (see below), perhaps the Order managed to subdue

and chain a demigod of ancient days below their stronghold.

What the Order members actually do when they call spells

from the “Spellpool” is, perhaps unbeknownst to them, slowly

draining the essence of this being.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the mage of the Arcane

Order prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Mages of the Arcane

Order gain no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a mage

of the Arcane Order gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding

the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as

the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more

than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a mage

of the Arcane Order, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Guild Member: A “guild-level” mage of the Arcane Order

pays monetary dues and accepts various duties in return

for member benefi ts. The dues are 30 gp per month. Duties

include putting in an appearance on campus at least once

every six months and accepting any special commissions

handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls

into arrears on his dues by more than three months has

his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool.

Reinstating membership is diffi cult. However, ex-members

do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained

while in good standing.

A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order

campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for

common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can

browse the Order’s well-respected library, which is stocked

with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore (though no

spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order’s

common laboratory facilities when creating magic items

(although material costs remain out-of-pocket). Furthermore,

he is free to read and post notices to the “job board,” a mundane

medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass

information, advertise their interest in a research topic or

adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical

or otherwise. Last but not least, members form professional

ties with their fellow wizards, possibly leading to lasting

friendships or alliances.

Spellpool (Su): Mages of the Arcane Order can call spells

from a common source: the Spellpool. New members receive

a special focus (a trinket chosen by the spellcaster, such as

a ring, brooch, scarf, or other portable item) at the time of

their initiation. The focus allows access to the Spellpool and

works only for its owner. If a mage of the Arcane Order loses

his focus, he must undergo another initiation. The range of

available spells increases at 4th and 7th levels. See the sidebar

below for details.

Bonus Metamagic Feat: At 2nd level and again at 9th

level, a mage of the Arcane Order gains sudden insight

from studying the reconstructed texts of ancient magical

grimoires. He gains a metamagic feat of his choice as a bonus

feat. He must still meet the prerequisites of the feat.

Bonus Language: At 3rd level and again at 6th level, a

guildmage’s access to the Order’s superb library and resources

allows him to learn a new language.

New Spell: When a mage of the Arcane Order reaches

5th level, and again at 8th level, a fellow wizard allows the

character to copy a spell from his or her spellbook (chosen

by the player, subject to the DM’s approval). He does not

need to make a Spellcraft check to copy the spell into his

own spellbook, although specialist wizards still cannot learn

spells from prohibited schools. Spellcasters who do not use

spellbooks gain no benefi t from this ability.

Regent: A 10th-level mage of the Arcane Order is awarded

the status of regent. A regent gains a +2 competence bonus

on all Charisma-based interaction checks when dealing with

lower-level members of the Order.

The regents set the Arcane Order’s rules and policies,

meeting each month in the Council of Regents. A regent

must attend six council meetings in one year or be removed

from the council and lose his regent status (he loses no other

benefi ts of guild membership, nor does he lose his level in

the prestige class). Enacting new policies or eradicating old

ones requires a three-fi fths majority vote to pass.

Generally, the council hands out commissions for lowerlevel

mages of the Arcane Order to perform on behalf of the

guild. An individual regent might also head up a special group

of lower-level members to accomplish a specifi c goal, such as

investigating a crime committed using magic, undertaking

an archeological dig of an ancient site of wizardry, or some

other important task.

THE SPELLPOOL

A magical reservoir of spell energy is bound into a special matrix

in a guarded vault on a sublevel of the Order’s headquarters.

Using his guild focus, a mage of the Arcane Order can “call”

spells from this common resource as needed.

**Calling a Spell:** Calling a spell from the Spellpool can be done

at any distance but requires the caster to have an open, unused

spell slot of the appropriate level. Wizards preparing spells for

the day decide at that time whether to leave some spell slots

open. A spellcaster can call only for a spell of a level that he could

normally cast. He can call a number of spells per day whose

total levels are equal to or less than half his caster level (round

down, minimum one). For example, Turial Edemont, a 5th-level

wizard/4th-level mage of the Arcane Order can call one 4th-level

spell per day, two 2nd-level spells per day, or any other combination

of spells whose levels do not exceed four, assuming he has

slots available and his Spellpool debt isn’t too high (see below).

When a caster calls a spell, he takes a full-round action to

concentrate on his focus (which provokes attacks of opportunity).

The spell appears in the caster’s mind at the beginning of

his next turn and can be used immediately. However, if he does

not cast the called spell within a number of minutes equal to

his caster level, it fades from his mind as though cast. A wizard

cannot learn a called spell, despite its temporary presence in his

consciousness, though of course he could later attempt to learn

the spell through standard means.

**Spell Availability:** Three stages of access to the Spellpool exist.

A member first joining the Order gains Spellpool I privileges,

which grants access to spells of 1st to 3rd level. Spellpool II

allows access to 4th- to 6th-level spells, and Spellpool III grants

access to 7th- to 9th-level spells. No 0-level spells are available,

but the Spellpool can provide any other spell on the wizard/sorcerer

spell list in the *Player’s Handbook,* as well as any additional

spells designated by the DM.

**Spellpool Debt:** Every time a spellcaster calls a spell, he

incurs a debt. He must return an “energy packet” to the Spellpool:

a spell he has prepared of a level equal level to that of

the called spell, or a number of spells whose combined levels

equal the level of the called spell. For instance, the Spellpool

debt for a 5th-level spell is five levels, which could be paid off

with another 5th-level spell or any combination of spells whose

levels total five. Returning a spell is a full-round action, like

calling a spell, and depletes a prepared spell slot as if the spell

had been cast.

The debt must be repaid within a number of days equal to

the character’s class level; otherwise, the mage’s access to

the Spellpool is automatically suspended. Once the debt is

repaid, a suspended caster immediately regains access to the

Spellpool—except that failure to pay off a debt within one year

results in a spellcaster’s expulsion from the Order. A mage

can’t run a “positive balance” with the Spellpool, paying off a

debt before incurring it.
