# 02a02 - Do I look different from everybody else?
## Overview
Adventurers are often just homegrown heroes, raised in unremarkable communities with ordinary backgrounds. Yet they’re just as often members of strange and mysterious races or outcasts from far-off places. You should consider what races and backgrounds your players might choose when the game begins, and how these will affect their interactions with the NPCs in the starting location. Allowing off beat or colorful races that aren’t standard also means you need to understand those races and how they work in your society.
