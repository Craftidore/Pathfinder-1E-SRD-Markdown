# 3f1 - Lillefor
## Overview
**Lillefor**

The kobold city of Lillefor lies near Morgau and Doresh. It has two simple defenses protecting it from the nearby Ghoul Empire‘s ambitions. First, kobold merchants bring valuable goods to the empire. Second, the city’s tunnels are very small, and its stone is too hard to burrow through easily. Lillefor is a haven for the small races: dark creeper bandits sell their ill-gotten gains, derro sell ore or ingots, and goblins hire themselves out as bat riders or scouts. The kobolds discourage Big Folk (and svirfneblin) from visiting.

The kobold King Kekarrac rules from a central square inside all those trap-riddled tunnels. Appropriately sized and diplomatic creatures can wrangle a short pass to visit the city for 8, 12, or 24 hours (depending on the size of their bribe). Larger travelers can enter Lillefor but must constantly squeeze through the passages and doorways and can never escape observation or suspicion.
