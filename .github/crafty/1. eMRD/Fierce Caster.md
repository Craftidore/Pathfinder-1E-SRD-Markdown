# Fierce Caster
## Overview
**Fierce Caster**

You can channel more power into some of your offensive spells, at the cost of reduced accuracy.

**Benefit:** At the beginning of your round, you may take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls you make with spells and spell-like abilities to gain a +3 bonus to hp damage with spells and spell-like abilities that require attack rolls. These penalties last until the beginning of your next turn. Only spells that deal hp damage gain this bonus. When your caster level reaches 4 (and every 4 caster levels afterward) the penalty increases by -1, and the bonus by +3.
