# Magically Treated Control Device
## Overview
**Magically Treated Control Device**

The ship’s controls are enchanted to make them harder to disable.

**Benefit:** The ship’s steering wheel or tiller is magically treated, doubling its hit points and hardness. This also increases the DC by 5 on any attempts to disable the ship’s control device with a [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check. This improvement can only be added by a spellcaster with the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feat.

**Requirements:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 15; Cost: 1,000 gp

**Source:** Pirate Campaign Compendium (Legendary Games), pg. 97
