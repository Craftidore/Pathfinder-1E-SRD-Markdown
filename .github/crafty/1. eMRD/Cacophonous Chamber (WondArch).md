# Cacophonous Chamber (WondArch)
## Overview
**Cacophonous Chamber:** Whenever someone enters this stronghold space, the very walls scream at him at an eardrum-bursting volume. The creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be or be [[Deafened|deafened]] for 2d6 rounds and take 2d6 points of damage. A successful save avoids the deafness and halves the damage.

Brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures take 7d6 points of damage. Crystalline creatures get a Fortitude save (DC 16) to halve this damage, while creatures holding an endangered object can negate the damage with a Reflex save (DC 16).

This effect cannot penetrate magical silence.

The hall of noise is extremely loud and so works effectively as an *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]*. Anyone within 200 feet of the place can hear the noise easily. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each interposing substantial wall. In quiet conditions, the noise can be heard 300 feet away.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Shout (Spell)|shout]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
