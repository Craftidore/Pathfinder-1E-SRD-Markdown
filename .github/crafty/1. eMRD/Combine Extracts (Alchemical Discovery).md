# Combine Extracts (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Combine Extracts:* When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.
