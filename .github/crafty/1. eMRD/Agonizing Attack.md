# Agonizing Attack
## Overview
*Agonizing Attack\* (Ex):* When a rogue with this talent deals sneak attack damage, all damage from the attack is considered continuous damage for the purposes of any concentration checks made by the damaged creature prior to the beginning of the rogueâ€™s next turn. This talent does not stack with itself, a creature damaged by multiple agonizing strikes in a round only needs to make a single concentration check against the continuous damage from the sneak attack that dealt the most damage. The rogue must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.
