# Precise Treatment (Trait)
## Overview
**Precise Treatment:** You treat others with a clear and calculating intellect. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] checks, and you may use your Intelligence modifier when making [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] checks instead of your Wisdom modifier.
