# Bully (Trait)
## Overview
**Bully**: You grew up in an environment where the meek were ignored and you often had to resort to threats or violence to be heard. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks, and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] is always a class skill for you.
