# Servants' Quarters
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 400 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

These are basic, no-nonsense living quarters. Six slots exist in each such component, separated by thin walls that give the occupants some small semblance of privacy. Each slot has enough room for a bed, a chest of drawers with a small mirror atop it, a small table, and a chair. The furnishing and flooring are all rough but serviceable. Personal decorations hang from the walls. This component includes a privy, though it need not be attached or adjacent to the servants’ quarters.

If you need a greater capacity, purchase this component multiple times. For especially important servants such as a butler, it’s appropriate to put them in a basic bedroom or even a [[Bedroom Suite, Basic|basic bedroom suite]].
