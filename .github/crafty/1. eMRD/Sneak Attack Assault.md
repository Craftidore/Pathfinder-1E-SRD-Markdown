# Sneak Attack Assault
## Overview
*Sneak Attack Assault (Ex):* Whenever you are hidden from one or more opponents at the start of your turn, you may apply your sneak attack damage to each attack that you make against those opponents on your turn, even if you reveal your presence to one or more of your opponents by attacking them. At the end of any turn in which you use this talent, you are revealed, and you may not use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to snipe in the same round that you use this talent.
