# Opposition Research
## Overview
**Opposition Research**

By completing strenuous studies, you have broken through the mental barriers that made it hard for you to prepare spells from one of your opposition schools. Select one wizard opposition school; preparing spells of this school now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer have the –4 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] penalty for crafting items from that school. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.
