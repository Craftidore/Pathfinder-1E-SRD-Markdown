# Ship Feats
## Overview
A feat is a special feature that gives your vessel a new capability or improves one that it already has. A Legendary Vessel gets to choose 1 feat at level 1, one at level 4, one at level 7 and one more at level 10.

Some feats have prerequisites. Your ship must have the indicated statistical score, feat or other quality listed in order to select or use that feat.

Note that although these are called Ship Feats, some of them apply more to the crew than the ship--however since these feats are part of the Legendary Ship, they exist independently of the crew itself, as long as they meet the quality requirement for a Legendary ship. For example, any crew of at least Average quality serving aboard a ship with the Expert Gunner feat would have that feat available, even if they were all newly-hired.
