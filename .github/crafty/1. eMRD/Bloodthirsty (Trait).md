# Bloodthirsty (Trait)
## Overview
**Bloodthirsty**: You have a vicious streak, and nothing satisfies you more than warm blood on your hands and blade. Whenever you make an attack that reduces a foe to 0 hit points or fewer or you confirm a critical hit, your attack deals 1 additional point of damage. The additional damage is a trait bonus, and is multiplied by your weaponâ€™s critical hit multiplier.
