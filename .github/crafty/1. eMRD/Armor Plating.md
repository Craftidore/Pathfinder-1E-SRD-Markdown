# Armor Plating
## Overview
**Armor Plating**

The ship’s sides are clad in iron to shield it from attack.

**Benefit:** By attaching metal plates to the ship, the hull’s hit points are increased by +15% and its hardness is increased by +4. This modification reduces a ship’s cargo capacity by 15%. The armor plating slows the ship, imposing a –1 penalty on all sailing checks. The ship’s tactical speed in ship-to-ship combat is not affected, but its waterborne speed is reduced by 20%.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 28; Cost: 30% of base ship cost
