THE LAND OF HONOR

Symbol: The Land of Honor doesn’t have a nationwide

symbol. Each feudal lordship has its own colorful heraldry,

most using abstract decorations rather than real-world symbols

like animals or words.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Humans from this

land live in a society guided by feudal lords who often war

against one another. But the wars are largely fought by a

caste of noble soldiers who regard battle as an opportunity

to demonstrate their bravery and adherence to a rigid code

of honor. Rather than draw inspiration from medieval and

Renaissance Europe, this land hearkens back to feudal Japan

and the Age of Samurai.

In your own game, the Land of Honor might be its own

nation-state, or perhaps it remains a vague and exotic place

beyond the periphery of the campaign map. Give it whatever

name you like.

Your human character can be a traveler or an exile from

the Land of Honor. If you want to retain your unique cultural

identity, consider an affi liation with others from your land.

Perhaps colonies or communities of exiles exist beyond the

borders of the Land of Honor, or perhaps travel back and

forth is suffi ciently easy that you can periodically return to

the land of your birth.

If you’re wielding executive powers, you’re either one of

the feudal lords or the power behind the lord’s throne. Your

concerns vary as widely as those of any real-world ruler; you

might care about the welfare of your subjects, or you might

care only about games of power or living a life of wealth

and leisure.

Type: Government (racial).

Scale: 15 (continental/empire).

Affi liation Score Criteria: Unless one is human and

born in the Land of Honor, a character is accepted in this

affi liation only under extraordinary circumstances.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Character level +1/2 PC’s level

Fighter or monk +2

5 or more ranks in Diplomacy +1

10 or more ranks in Diplomacy +2

Defeat worthy foe in honorable duel +1

Perform mission at lord’s request +2 (and –4 if you fail)

Titles, Benefi ts, and Duties: As you gain affi liation with

the Land of Honor, your feudal lord will reward you with a

ceremonial—but very functional—katana. A katana is statistically

identical to a bastard sword. Your willingless to live

and die by your honor code becomes increasingly apparent

from your bearing, and many foes will shamefacedly avoid

a duel with you.
