# Dispelling Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Dispelling Bomb:* When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell, using the alchemistâ€™s level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
