# Shadowbane Stalker (PrC)
## Overview
Those they name as heretics or servants of evil call them

zealots. Those they protect from darkness call them

saviors and defenders of the truth. Whatever their label,

shadowbane stalkers rank as some of the most feared

individuals wherever they go.

All shadowbane stalkers belong to the Order of Illumination

(see page 179), a fellowship of holy knights

dedicated to finding and rooting out hidden evil. The

Order of Illumination hunts evil—from liars and petty

con artists to mind flayer cabals hidden in the heart of a decadent empire—in its most secret lair, and shadowbane

stalkers lead the search.

Although many think it restrictive and insensitive,

the Order of Illumination is a powerful force for good.

Shadowbane stalkers do their part to find evil hidden

within the midst of civilized areas so that the martial

arm of the order, led by the shadowbane inquisitors (see

the previous prestige class), can spearhead the attack

against the corruption. Shadowbane stalkers usually work

alone or with small groups of independent adventurers,

but it is also common for a stalker and an inquisitor to

adventure together as partners. Their skills and abilities

complement each other, and they know that the other

members of the order are some of the few beings they

can trust implicitly.

Almost all shadowbane stalkers are clerics who took

a few levels of rogue. This unorthodox career path gives

a character the divine spellcasting power and martial

training necessary to deal with powerful and subtle

evils, as well as giving her the broad expertise in skills

and stealth required to find and ambush the hidden evils

that she seeks.

Adaptation: The Order of Illumination might be too

zealous for some campaigns. Its members are so thoroughly

dedicated to good that they can sometimes stray

into intolerance or unfounded accusations. But by leaving

the game mechanics unchanged and simply removing the

flavor elements of zealotry and suspicion, the shadowbane

stalkers become a small group of dedicated cleric/rogues

who are extremely skilled at finding evil monsters. This

order probably would consist of clerics from several

different churches and would welcome characters who

have the right skills. Alternatively, a single shadowbane

stalker might run into more than she can handle in the

course of an investigation and turn to the PCs for help.

In this way, the shadowbane stalkers could become a

steady source of adventure leads and staunch allies as

the campaign progresses.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the shadowbane

stalker prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Shadowbane stalkers

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A shadowbane stalker

continues training in divine spellcasting as well as learning.

At each level gained in the shadowbane stalker class

except for 4th and 9th, she gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a

level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before

adding the prestige class level. She does not, however,

gain any other benefit a character of that class would

have gained. If she had more than one divine spellcasting

class before becoming a shadowbane stalker, she must

decide to which class to add each level for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Detect Evil *(*Sp): A shadowbane stalker can use

*detect evil* at will. See the spell, page 218 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*.

Sacred Stealth (Su): A shadowbane stalker can channel

some of her divine spellpower to become stealthier.

To do this, she must lose a prepared divine spell from

memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if she

casts spells as a sorcerer). She gains a +4 sacred bonus on

Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes

equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) plus the level of spell

given up in this manner.

At 7th level, the bonus increases to +8.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity.

Discover Subterfuge (Ex): A shadowbane stalker

trains diligently to detect subterfuge and the misdirection

of others. At 2nd level and higher, she gains a +2 competence

bonus on Search and Sense Motive checks. This

bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 8th level.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a shadowbane

stalker deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when

flanking an opponent or any time the target would be

denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies

to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It

increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th

level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.* If a shadowbane stalker gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the

bonuses on damage stack.

Sacred Defense (Su): At 4th level and higher, a

shadowbane stalker can channel some of her divine

spellpower to help her avoid the attacks of enemies. To do

this, she must lose a prepared divine spell from memory

(or give up a potential spell slot for the day if she casts

spells as a sorcerer). The stalker gains a +4 sacred bonus

to Armor Class for a number of rounds equal to the level

of the divine spell given up in this manner.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity.

Sacred Strike (Su): At 10th level, a shadowbane stalker

can channel her divine spellpower to deal extra damage.

To do this, she must lose a prepared divine spell from

memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if

she casts spells as a sorcerer). The stalker can add an extra

1d6 points of damage per level of the spell lost, up to the

number of her sneak attack damage dice. This ability

affects the next attack she makes in the same round that

she uses this ability.

Creatures immune to sneak attacks are immune to extra

damage from this ability. If the affected attack misses,

the sacred strike is lost with no effect.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity.

*Language:* Common.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Farsi deals an extra 3d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Farsi

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Detect Evil *(*Sp): Farsi can use *detect evil* at will. See

the spell, page 218 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Evasion (Ex): If Farsi is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Sacred Stealth (Su): Farsi can lose a prepared divine

spell from memory to gain a +4 sacred bonus on Hide

and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal

to the level of spell given up in this manner.

Trapfinding (Ex): Farsi can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.
