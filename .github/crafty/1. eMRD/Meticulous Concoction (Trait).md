# Meticulous Concoction (Trait)
## Overview
**Meticulous Concoction:** Your meticulous carefulness makes your bombs and extracts more potent. Once per day, you can either add a +2 trait bonus to the save DC for one bomb you throw or extend the duration of one extract you imbibe by 2 rounds. Extracts with an instantaneous duration are not affected by this trait.
