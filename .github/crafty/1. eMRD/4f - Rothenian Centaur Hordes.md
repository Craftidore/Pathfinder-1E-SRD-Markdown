# 4f - Rothenian Centaur Hordes
## Overview
*The bow was impossibly heavy, made of layered yew and horn, decorated with an ebony handle, and strung with a tiger-striped bowstring wound of horsehair as thick as a reed. The Rothenian elf pulled on it again to string it and barely bent the tips of the bow.*

*“It’s not made for two-legs,” rumbled Atropos. “It takes a real archer to string a steppe bow.”*

*Taking the bow back from the elf, the centaur stepped through the string, leaning 1,000 pounds of muscle and bone into the recurved spring, and grunted. Slowly, the wood bent beneath his huge hands and the centaur affixed the string. “Shoot for distance?” he asked.*

*The elf stared and then laughed. “Your bow is bigger than mine; I confess it. But I still think you smell bad.” The centaur smiled and pulled an arrow from his quiver, fully 4 feet long.* 

Centaurs are strange, half-human wanderers with no home or nation. On the Rothenian plains, they are friends and rivals to the elves, half-foolish and half-wise when moved by drink or rage. The centaur clans are small, sometimes as few as a dozen or so members. All too often they serve as mercenaries, fighting someone else’s war for little more than oats and cheese. When roused to anger, though, they burn out entire villages and sack small towns before returning to the great plains, richer and avenged.

Out in the wide grasslands and high in the hills, centaur bands make their lives as hunters, bandits, and nomads. Owing fealty to no one and nothing, they prize their fierce independence and claim they are willing to die rather than settle in any village, obeying only their chiefs and khans. Humans and elves fear their violent tempers and drunken passions. Centaurs think humans and elves are fools to live in huts of wood or stone when they could live free while moving across the great grasslands. These horsefolk would not—could not—live any other way.

The centaur legends claim they are the true sons and daughters of the wind and sky gods and that both humans and horses are their lesser cousins. Humans were made first, but their two legs and small size marked them out as runts and weaklings, and Perun rejected them as too slow and too weak to survive a nomad’s life. Horses were his second attempt: fast and strong and able to live by grazing anywhere on the wide plains. But in time, their failings were clear as well, for they moved as a herd. The horses bred not heroes but followers, and lacked the cunning of a hunter and the clever hands of a smith or archer.

Mocked by his wife for failing twice, Perun the Thunderer decided to make the third time count for all. Thinking carefully on the matter, he saw that the previous failings could be mended by matching human hands with equine speed and power, so the centaurs were his third attempt at making a race to rule the grasslands. Centaurs keep this story to themselves, but they all believe in their hearts it is entirely true.

The centaurs are true nomads, retreating to the hills and Rothenian high meadows in summer and returning to lower elevations when the meadows are bare and the lure of rustling, banditry, and raiding grow strong. They are currently divided into those who live free in the Eastern grasslands and those who hunt and serve as mercenaries in human lands.

## A Centaur Raid
**A Centaur Raid**

Centaurs are happy to take anything that other races do not value enough to protect properly. This is usually livestock but also grains, cloth, and coin. A standard raid begins before dawn or at night, with centaurs shooting sentries with arrows enchanted with silence 15’ radius and, then, galloping to the attack in two groups; one is a diversion, meant to draw defenders away from the object of the raid, whether that be a corral, barn, or a storehouse for grain.

Centaurs are notorious for raiding wineries and brewer’s shipments and for sacking them entirely. Some raiders consider their bows as instruments of revenge on those who build on the Plains. They fire from up to 900 feet away, raining down large, fiery arrows to burn peasant huts or granaries. In addition, they create a form of poison unique to their kind; many Kariv and Khazzaki consider it a form of illness because of the fever and vomiting it induces over time.

## Centaur Wealth
**Centaur Wealth**

Centaurs measure wealth in goats and sheep, which they use for leather, wool, and meat, and the making of panniers, blankets, and tents. The last is especially important—a woolen tent is a sign of adulthood. “Leaving the tent” is a way of speaking of a colt or filly reaching maturity, and “joining tents” is the typical euphemism for two centaurs who marry or who sire foals.

Centaurs use druidic magic, and they are powerful followers of both martial and earthy traditions. A few centaurs thrive as merchants, ever practical as traders among the clans, but most males are warriors first, and female centaurs are rarely seen outside the circles of a clan group. Centaur goods are the goods of nomads: lightweight and few in number. The heaviest goods of a centaur clan are the winter tents, heavy cloth panels that can be rigged with any stout wooden pole to create a shelter for young foals and centaur women.

Centaur summer and winter camps are matters of tradition. The same herd of centaurs returns to the same two or three favored sites year after year.

## Society and Kings
**Society and Kings**

Centaur society includes three kinds of clans: the steppe nomads, the mercenary companies, and the bandits. Each of these has some kinship with the others, and all three share a fondness for direct election of their chiefs and war leaders. It is, above all, a meritocracy, where a king can be deposed by the will of his horde.

A herd of centaurs might seem like an accurate term, but they prefer to call themselves “clans” for groups up to a dozen or so, and a horde for any greater number. Clans are led by a powerful male (a stallion, chief, khan, or captain). When enough clans gather, they sometimes choose to send a group of young warriors on a yearlong or two-year “bandit year” to raid the elven herds, to try the defenses of the Mharoti lands, or to strike west against the Magdar or gnomes. During this bandit year, the young warriors learn both the rudiments of raiding and the tactics that make them successful on the plains.

In practice, many young centaurs spend only a short time raiding, then hire their services to some respected caravan master and serve as guards. This way, they visit distant cities on the islands off the coast of Arbonesse or cross the snows of Trollheim or drink from the desert oases of Hatapesh and Siwal. These wanderers don’t always return to the steppes, but those who do have learned the arts of many lands, strange sorceries, or tricks of healing that they share in the winter camps or the summer gatherings.

At the summer gatherings the captains, khans, and chiefs decide whether any clan or tribe must be avenged. These occasions are rare (perhaps twice a generation or so), but invariably, the entire centaur nation sweeps off the plains that summer to destroy border settlements, burn crops, and run riot against the defenses of the offending nation. The Mharoti, the slavers of Reth-Saal, the prince of Doresh, the tsar of Vidim, and others have all learned this lesson well, so few dare to assault a centaur band.

## Centaurs and Other Races
**Centaurs and Other Races**

The Kariv understand the hardships of the road, and their smiths shoe centaurs for free (for good luck). In return, centaurs scout for and defend Kariv wanderers from human, goblin, or other bandits. More than once centaur information or lances has saved a Kariv caravan, and centaur bandits never rob the Kariv (they consider it ill-fated to rob the cursed).

Elves and centaurs have complex relationship. Elves consider centaurs uncouth, foul smelling, and boorish, but at the same time find them oddly charming for their honesty, directness, and superb woodcraft and archery. Though few elves admit it, centaur archery is superior to their own in raw power and in distance. The difference in accuracy lies in the elves’ favor, but as many have pointed out, “one centaur arrow is worth three of the elves’.”
