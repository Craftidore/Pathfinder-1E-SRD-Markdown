# Charm (Hex)
## Overview
*Charm (Su)*: A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the witch had successfully used the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Witchâ€™s Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.
