# 3e5 - Trade with the Shadow Fey
## Overview
**Trade with the Shadow Fey**

Twenty years ago Antonidas Jabber was a young highwayman, brash enough to get rich and smart enough to never get caught. He loved knives, cheap beer, and cheaper women. These traits endeared young Jabber to the even younger—and vastly richer—Tuck Marick, the youngest son of the Marick merchant house, who had an allowance that beggared description.

Jabber and Tuck were fond of songs and stories, and while on a bender of heroic proportions, they decided that the minstrels’ tales of callous fey were all terribly one-sided; nobody who spun straw into gold and turned frogs into princes could be all bad. 

At the very least, they thought there was money to be made trading with the Winter Court. Though Zobeck boasted many wonders, the city’s market for myth was underexploited, and Jabber and Tuck were notoriously bullish.
