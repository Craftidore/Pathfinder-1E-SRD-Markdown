# Dispelled Battler (Trait)
## Overview
**Dispelled Battler:** When deprived of magic, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls while within an area of antimagic such as that created by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. You also gain this bonus for 1 round after you are subject to an area or targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell, regardless of the effectâ€™s success or failure in dispelling your spells and magical effects.
