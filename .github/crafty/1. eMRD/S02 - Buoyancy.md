# S02 - Buoyancy
## Overview
**Buoyancy**

When a creature fails its [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check by 5 or more, or when it doesn’t spend any actions to swim (whether voluntarily or due to [[S3.1N-Q - Universal Monster Rules N-Q (Bestiary 6 Apx)|paralysis]] or similar conditions), it either sinks or rises based on its buoyancy. There are three normal states of buoyancy: [[Sinking|sinking]], rising, and neutral. If a creature’s buoyancy is [[Sinking|sinking]], it naturally sinks; if its buoyancy is rising, it naturally rises to the surface; and if its buoyancy is neutral, it hangs in place unless it expends effort. Land-dwelling creatures generally have a [[Sinking|sinking]] buoyancy unless they are carrying a substantial amount of low-density gear (like wooden items, at least until they become waterlogged) and little or no high-ensity gear (such as items made from metal or stone). Air tanks (see page 56) in particular make it much easier to change your buoyancy to rising. It’s also possible to adjust an air tank to hold just enough air to achieve a neutral buoyancy—but once a creature has done so, if it picks up other objects or uses the tank to breathe underwater, it loses its neutral buoyancy until it readjusts (which may require returning to the surface to refill the air tank). In addition to these three normal states of buoyancy, there are two extreme states: swiftly [[Sinking|sinking]] and swiftly rising. If a creature is swiftly [[Sinking|sinking]], it and its gear are so dense that it can walk on the bottom of the body of water, but it also needs to succeed at a DC 20 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to swim towards the surface or to stay off the bottom. A creature carrying plenty of dense stone or metal items gains this buoyancy state. If a creature is swiftly rising, it needs to succeed at a DC 20 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to submerge itself and stay submerged; a sizable air tank or other flotation device, or the help of magic, is needed to achieve this state. Several spells starting on page 59 can help adjust buoyancy to the desired state.

**Aquatic and Water Creatures:** Most naturally aquatic creatures (those with the [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|aquatic subtype]]) have some form of air bladder or other organ that allows them to adjust their buoyancy on the fly, enabling them to maintain neutral buoyancy as a free action on their turn (unless they are carrying something large with particularly high or low density), and creatures with the [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|water subtype]] naturally have the same buoyancy as water.

**Buoyancy Speed:** A creature begins to sink or rise at the end of its turn the first time it badly fails (or does not attempt) a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check, moving up or down as appropriate at a speed of 10 feet; this speed increases by 10 feet each subsequent round unless the creature is stopped, to a maximum speed of 30 feet after 3 rounds. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. While [[Sinking|sinking]] or rising because of its buoyancy, creatures are considered off-balance (see Off-Balance and Prone Underwater on page 45). Once per round, a creature [[Sinking|sinking]] or rising because of its buoyancy can stop its momentum by succeeding at a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check as a move action. A creature that chooses to continue moving in the direction of its buoyancy under its own power, rather than through uncontrolled rising or [[Sinking|sinking]], can do so with a successful [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check without needing to stop first. If a creature’s buoyancy changes instantly while [[Sinking|sinking]] or rising from buoyancy (such as via jettisoning something it’s holding or using magic), its buoyancy speed adjusts by 10 feet in the new direction each round. A creature that fails the DC 20 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to move against its buoyancy while swiftly [[Sinking|sinking]] or swiftly rising moves 30 feet in the appropriate direction immediately.

**Moving Against Buoyancy:** Much like flying upwards uses up twice as much of a flying creature’s movement, each square of movement swimming in the opposite direction of a creature’s buoyancy costs twice as much movement as normal (see Thinking in Three Dimensions below for more details). Creatures with a neutral buoyancy ignore this hindrance.

**Drag:** Sometimes, because a PC might want to alter her buoyancy (or simply because she wants to drag a particularly large piece of treasure back home), she might swim with an item that has significant surface area, like a giant treasure chest. In these cases, her speed is reduced by half (or more, at the GM’s discretion). If the object is narrower in one dimension, like a pole, she can avoid drag by turning it so the narrow side faces the direction she wants to move; however, this adjustment requires a move action, so it slows her down if she needs to turn often.
