# Garden of Understanding (WondArch)
## Overview
**Garden of Understanding:** Any character that enters this stronghold space can understand and communicate with all plants (including plant creatures) in the space. This works like a *[[Speak with Plants (Spell)|speak with plants]]* spell, although the effect ends as soon as either the character or the plant leaves the space.

While this bit of wondrous architecture is most often created as part of a garden—all the better to find plants in—it can just as easily be worked into any other place in which the owner might wish to communicate with plants. Some stronghold owners have this effect placed upon any space and then place potted plants about the area. Later, the owner can go back and converse with the plants to see if they have learned or simply overheard anything while she was away.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Speak with Plants (Spell)|speak with plants]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
