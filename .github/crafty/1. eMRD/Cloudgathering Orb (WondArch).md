# Cloudgathering Orb (WondArch)
## Overview
**Cloudgathering Orb:** This large (4-foot-wide) crystal orb keeps the weather nasty (thunderstorms in spring, torrential rain in summer, sleet in autumn, and blizzards in winter) around the stronghold for a two-mile radius. Anyone attempting to magically alter the weather in this area must make an opposed level check against the cloudgathering orb’s power to succeed. See the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide for weather effects.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Control Weather (Spell)|control weather]]**; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
