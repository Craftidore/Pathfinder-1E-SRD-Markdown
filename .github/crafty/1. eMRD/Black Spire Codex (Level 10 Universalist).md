# Black Spire Codex (Level 10 Universalist)
## Overview
*Bound in thick, black leather—worn and cracked with age—this book’s embossed cover displays unusual sigils that defy translation and are perhaps of Ankeshelian origin. The Codex’s pages are sheets of gold hammered paper thin with spells, diagrams, and illustrations carefully pressed into the metal and magically preserved.*

Centuries of spells lay undiscovered in the crypts, libraries, and personal scroll collections of Allain’s wizards. One famous example is the *Black Spire Codex*, so named because of its discovery in that hallowed institution many years ago. Since then, the book has been loaned to other Bemmean libraries and even stolen by the adventurous and ambitious. Its value lies not only in its preparation ritual, used by many students before tests, but also the wealth of ancient magic it reveals. Rules on similar spellbooks and preparation rituals can be found in *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Magic*.

**Protection** Average lock with *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]* (DC 35) and *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]]* (Reflex DC 16)

**Value** 2,820 gp (3,620 gp with the preparation ritual)

**Preparation Ritual**

**Sage Advice (Su)** Centuries of accumulated scribbles, marginalia, and corrections give you unique insight into arcane knowledge. Unlike most boons, you do not spend this one. Instead, until you again prepare spells, you are considered trained in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana); if already trained, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on those checks instead.
