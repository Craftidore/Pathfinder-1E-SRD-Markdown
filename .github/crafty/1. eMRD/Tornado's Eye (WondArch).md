# Tornado's Eye (WondArch)
## Overview
**Tornado’s Eye:** This large (6-foot-wide) crystal orb maintains tornado-force winds (see the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) around the outside your stronghold at all times. See the description of the *[[Hurricane's Eye (WondArch)|hurricane’s eye]]* for how this works.

If you join this item with a *[[Hurricane's Eye (WondArch)|hurricane’s eye]]* or a *[[Windstorm's Eye (WondArch)|windstorm’s eye]]*, they can each only function at the level of the weakest item.

*Caster Level:* 18th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Control Winds (Spell)|control winds]]**; Market Price:* 90,000 gp.
