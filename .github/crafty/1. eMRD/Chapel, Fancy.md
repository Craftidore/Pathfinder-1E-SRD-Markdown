# Chapel, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 2 ss

**Cost:** 6,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One acolyte

This larger chapel features a polished stone altar, handsomely finished pews, and stained glass in the windows. There’s also a small dressing room for the cleric to prepare for services in, and in here there’s a wardrobe for keeping religious garb and supplies in.

Up to 60 people can fit in here for a service. This place requires at least one acolyte (Clr1 or Adp1; [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[religion] +7) to run properly. If you need a greater capacity, purchase this component multiple times.
