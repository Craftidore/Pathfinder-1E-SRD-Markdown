# Natural Disaster (Hex)
## Overview
*Natural Disaster (Su)*: A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a *[[Storm of Vengeance (Spell)|storm of vengeance]]* combined with an *[[Earthquake (Spell)|earthquake]]* that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per day.
