# Pious Templar (PrC)
## Overview
Sworn to the defense of a temple site, the pious templar is a

holy warrior blessed by her deity with combat prowess and

great endurance. She bears her deity’s favored weapon into

battle and fi ghts her deity’s enemies without question or

hesitation. In addition to defending the temple itself, a pious

templar may be charged with additional duties, including a

campaign to attack foes on their own home ground.

Faithful people of all professions can enter the ranks

of the pious templars; clerics and paladins are especially

likely to do so. Some temples (such as those of Boccob or

Wee Jas) welcome wizards and sorcerers to become pious

templars, valuing those characters’ ability to use arcane

magic combined with the martial training of the pious

templar. Likewise, Olidammara’s temples are often guarded

by rogue/pious templars, who combine combat training

with sneak attack tactics. Ranger/pious templars serve in

temples of Ehlonna and Obad-Hai, while barbarian/pious

templars are not unknown in temples of Kord or Erythnul.

Only monks, with their own specialized combat training,

are unlikely to adopt the pious templar class.

NPC pious templars usually live cloistered in temple

buildings or attached quarters.

Adaptation: This prestige class functions best when

tied to a specifi c deity. If you want to customize the pious

templar further, you can modify the spell list to refl ect the

proclivities of specifi c gods or create an order within a religion

that all pious templars are members of.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the pious templar

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Pious templars gain

no weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Mettle (Su): A pious templar’s special blessing allows

her to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm

her. If a pious templar makes a successful Will or Fortitude

saving throw that would normally reduce the spell’s effect,

she suffers no effect from the spell at all. Only those spells

with a Saving Throw entry of “Will partial,” “Fortitude half,”

or similar entries can be negated through this ability.

Spells per Day: A pious templar has the ability to cast

a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the pious

templar must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s

level, so a pious templar with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot

cast these spells. Pious templar bonus spells are based on

Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + the pious templar’s Wisdom modifi er.

When the pious templar gets 0 spells of a given level, such

as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, she gets only bonus spells.

(A pious templar without a bonus spell for that level cannot

yet cast a spell of that

level.) A pious templar

has access to any spell

on the list and can freely

choose which to prepare,

just like a cleric. A pious

templar prepares and casts

spells just as a cleric does

(though the pious templar

cannot spontaneously cast *cure*

or *infl ict* spells).

A good pious templar (or a

neutral pious templar of a good

deity) uses the paladin spell list.

An evil pious templar (or a neutral

pious templar of an evil deity)

uses the blackguard spell list. A pious

templar who is neither good nor evil

and whose deity is neither good

nor evil can chose to use the

paladin or the blackguard

spell list. Once the player

makes this choice, it cannot

be reversed.

Smite (Su): Once per

day, a pious templar of 2nd

level or higher may make

a single melee attack

with a +4 attack bonus

and a damage bonus equal

to her pious templar level (if

she hits). The pious templar must

declare the smite before making the

attack. Starting at 6th level, a pious

templar can smite twice per day and at 10th level, three

times per day.

If a pious templar has a smite evil or smite ability (for

being a paladin or a cleric with the Destruction domain)

already, she can use the ability one extra time per day (two

extra times at 7th level). The attack bonus does not increase,

but the damage bonus is based on the character’s combined

level (pious templar level plus cleric or paladin level).

Damage Reduction (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, pious

templars have the ability to shrug off some amount of

injury from each blow or attack. A pious templar gains

damage reduction 1/—. At 7th level, this damage reduction

rises to 2/—.

Weapon Specialization: At 3rd level, a pious templar

gains the Weapon Specialization feat with her deity’s

favored weapon.

Bonus Feat: At 4th level and again at 8th level, a pious

templar gets a bonus feat. These bonus feats must be drawn

from the feats noted as fi ghter bonus feats in the *Player’s*

*Handbook* and other books.

If a pious templar selects a feat that requires her to apply

its effects to a specifi c weapon (such as Improved Critical),

she may only apply that feat to her deity’s favored weapon.
