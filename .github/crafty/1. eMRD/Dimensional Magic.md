# Dimensional Magic
## Overview
**Dimensional Magic**

Like a sketched creature lifting itself off a parchment and looking back down at the two-dimensional world it left behind, the dimensional caster steps into a higher dimension and looks down upon his own world from the outside. From a dimensional mage’s vantage point, treasures hidden inside chests, inside closets, and inside castles present themselves like X’s on a map. Beating hearts are as easy to see and skewer as the center of a circle drawn on a page.

Dimensional magic is a new subschool of the conjuration school of magic, and such spells are indicated by the dimensional keyword. While similar to the teleportation subschool, the dimensional subschool facilitates vision and movement through alternate dimensions. It may transmute the caster, targets, or the environment through interaction with hyper-dimensional geometry.

Dimensional casters prize dexterity and flexibility. With sweeping, fluid gestures, they feel for the edges of reality and move in directions orthogonal to all we know. Masters are rare. Survivors and apprentices are even more rare. For those who do survive their inquiries into this strange magic, the following spells are available. All dimensional subschool spells are available to magus, sorcerer, witch, and wizard characters, with the exception of *dimensional wave* and *dimensional shove*, which are not available to magi or witches. Some believe that *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]], [[Passwall (Spell)|passwall]]*, and *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* are also derived from the principles of this school, though this subject is hotly debated.
