# Defensive Wall (Room)
## Overview
**Defensive Wall**

**Create** 5 Goods, 2 Influence, 5 Labor (260 gp); **Time** 12 days 

**Size** 20–40 squares 

This simple wooden wall, fence, or hedge surrounds your structure and provides a modicum of security. It is no taller than 10 feet, includes a single gate with a simple lock, and can be scaled with a DC 14 [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check. It can be constructed as a stone wall— increasing the height by up to 10 feet and the [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] DC to 20—by doubling the price. If combined with a [[Guard Post (Room)|Guard Post]], this can be a walkable wall with a parapet.
