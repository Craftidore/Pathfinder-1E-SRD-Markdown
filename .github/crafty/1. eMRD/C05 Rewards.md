# C05 Rewards
## Overview
The Role of Rewards

Much of the famously addictive appeal of the Pathfinder

Roleplaying Game and its predecessor games lies in its

variety of reward mechanisms. These most obviously

include experience points, treasure, and magic items, but

also such in-story advantages like information, property,

status, titles, even the possibility of eventual godhood.

Rewards mark the PCs’ victories. The act of scribbling

down a new item or quantity of coins on a character sheet

solidifies one of the game’s key pleasures. These moments

cement the players’ commitment to the game by connecting

them emotionally to what has just happened, while at the

same time hooking them with the promise of future gains.

Players revel in the success they’ve just scored, while also

looking forward to the future triumphs their characters

will be able to rack up after leveling up, using new gear, or

making use of a long-forgotten scrap of lore.

Expect responses to rewards to vary from group to

group and between individual players. Some players

enjoy constant rewards and actively alter their play styles

to maximize the benefits they receive. Others regard

them as a bookkeeping necessity they’d rather keep in

the background. Observe your players’ responses to see

where they fit on this continuum. As you make decisions

affecting reward distribution, seek out the sweet spot of

compromise that makes the experience as compulsively

entertaining as possible for the majority of your players.

Generalizations don’t always hold but can be useful

as a starting point in determining what your players

will enjoy. Younger or less

experienced players often tend

to prefer frequent rewards, with

no benefit too small to lovingly

describe. Even the most jaded players

can remember their first few sessions,

when a measly clutch of copper coins

wrenched from a stinking

kobold warren seemed like

the most awesome haul ever.

Older players, especially ones

who are squeezed for time and

can only meet for short sessions,

may prefer to move the rewards

process to the background. In this mode,

shopping, swapping, and leveling up usually

occurs outside of precious session time.

Whatever their amount of

experience, some players remain

more oriented toward rewards

than others. Players heavily

invested in their characters' abilities and

in slaying monsters tend to want their rewards as soon

as they can get them. Becoming more powerful is their

biggest thrill. A steady stream of small power boosts suits

them just fine. They don’t want to go into the next fight

until they know they’ve squeezed every last iota of potential

ability from their past accomplishments.

Players more focused on characterization or story progress

may look at reward management as a form of homework.

They’re more interested in seeing what’s on the other side of

that hill, or talking to the crazy hermit, than stopping every

scene to add up their XP totals or divide treasure. They’ll

find it easier to stay engaged with the game if you bundle

rewards together, dealing with them all at the same time.

The diagram on the next page lays out in graphic form the

various considerations to take into account when deciding

how much emphasis to give to rewards over the course of

a session. Factors on the left side of the continuum lead to

giving out awards in occasional bundles. Factors on the right

side argue in favor of giving out rewards throughout the

session.

**Experience**

Experience points are the lifeblood of the Pathfinder

rewards system. They determine the rate at which the

PCs progress, and form the currency with which the

most spectacular and reliable abilities are acquired. By

deciding when and how to give out XP, you’re establishing

the expectations the players will bring to the rest of the

game’s reward system.

Backgrounded Experience

Track experience points throughout

the session, without mentioning it

to your players. Announce awarded

XP at the end of each session, after the

evening’s narrative has concluded. Players

may level up only between sessions,

even if they pass the level mark during

a game session. They're expected to

arrive at the next session ready to go

with all of their character changes.

Players who don’t own the rules set

should show up early to update their

character sheets.

This timing scheme suits groups

at the bundled (left) end of the rewards

continuum. It preserves session time and

keeps participants focused on the fictional

proceedings. Backgrounded awards remove

the temptation for players to undertake

ridiculous, tangential, or out-of-character

actions just to acquire the last few XP they need

to level up.

Rewards 5

Downtime Experience

Track experience points as they accrue. Whenever the party

stops in a safe haven, or the story leaps forward in time

and place, announce a period of downtime. All of the XP

accumulated since the last period of downtime is awarded

and characters may level up. When the PCs leave downtime,

the normal story resumes. Again track experience points

while they are accrued, and hold off awarding it until the

next downtime phase.

Downtime experience suits groups falling in the middle

of the rewards continuum. It compromises between

players who live for rewards and those who view them as an

occasion for homework. Downtime awards make leveling

up seem like something that happens in the world. The

characters only become visibly better at their tasks after

taking some time to rest, ref lect, contemplate, and train.

One danger with downtime awards is that they can

tempt players to take otherwise poorly motivated rest stops

just to gain their XP awards and level up. Depending on

the pacing of a given session, a break for downtime might

completely def late the game’s momentum and make it

hard to recapture your players’ attention. On the other

hand, it might give you a much-needed break to work out

an upcoming encounter, dream up fresh story events, or

simply let your brain idle for a few minutes.

If players seek out downtime at an ill-placed moment, you

can always deter them with a plot development requiring

immediate action. This interruption might range from

a simple wandering monster attack to an elaborate new

wrinkle in the campaign’s ongoing storyline.

Immediate Experience

Award players experience points as soon as they earn them.

Allow the characters to level up at the end of any scene, as

soon as they have accumulated enough XP.

Immediate experience suits a group at the frequent

(right) end of the rewards continuum. It focuses the game

more obviously, for good and for ill, on the acquisition and

expenditure of experience points. As the name suggests,

this system gives the players immediate gratification

when they succeed.

When using this timing scheme, be prepared for the

game to stop at a moment’s notice, shifting into rulesscanning

mode while the players level up. Characters also

risk becoming unsympathetic or unbelievable as they

chase the biggest XP results at the lowest risks.

Handwaved Experience

Ignore XP altogether. Decide how many sessions you want

the group to spend at each level. Allow your players to level

up each time they hit that milestone. This option suits

groups at the far left side of the rewards continuum.

Ad Hoc Experience

Many players recall with great fondness sessions where the

dice were never rolled. When a game spends considerable

time developing plot and character and places fighting

monsters and accumulating XP in the background,

however, some players may feel that they’re being penalized.

In these situations, reward out-of-combat successes with

ad hoc experience awards.

When the group takes part in an entertaining scene that

takes 15 minutes or more, consider awarding ad hoc XP.

Ask yourself the following questions:

• Did the scene move the group toward an important,

identifiable objective?

• Did the group face significant negative consequences if

the events portrayed in the scene went against them?

• Did the players take an active role in the scene, as

opposed to listening to your descriptions or NPC

dialogue?

• Did most of the players make a noteworthy contribution

to the scene?

• Did all of the players appear attentive and entertained?

If you can answer at least four of these questions in the

affirmative, you should award ad hoc XP. The following steps

can be used to determine a baseline figure for ad hoc awards:

• Roughly determine the amount of real time it takes

you, on average, to run a challenging encounter.

• Divide this into 15-minute increments. So if it takes

you an hour, more or less, to run a challenging fight,

you have four increments.

• Take the XP award the group would normally get for

a challenging encounter (usually APL+1) and divide it

by the number of increments. This is your baseline ad

hoc award.

Once you have decided to award ad hoc experience for

a scene, roughly estimate the amount of real time the

sequence took. Award your baseline amount multiplied by

the number of 15-minute increments as ad hoc XP.

Revise the baseline as the group increases in level.

Take into account any increases in the average length of

encounters, as well as the experience awards the characters

garner. Additional individual ad hoc experience points

can also be awarded to players for particularly good

roleplaying. If you decide to use individual awards, be

careful not to show favoritism. All of the characters should

have opportunities to receive such rewards at some point.

Players on the right side of the rewards continuum

probably prefer heavily action-oriented games. If your

game consists mostly of exciting combat sequences with a

minimum of plot to connect them, it’s probably not worth

bothering with ad hoc awards.

Rewards 5

**Treasure**

Game balance depends on rewarding the treasure values as

given on Tables 12–4 and 12–5 on page 399 of the *Pathfinder*

*RPG Core Rulebook*. Award too much, and the PCs will

unpredictably tear through encounters. Too little, and they’ll

be unable to keep up. Within the limits of these charts,

however, you can dole out treasure in various ways, depending

on your group’s position on the rewards continuum.

Groups toward the left end of the continuum tend to favor

a broader storyline and epic action over a game that casts

them in the role of petty coin-counters. In these cases, don’t

spend a lot of time describing coins, currency transactions,

the sale of looted antiquities, or other money issues. Nor

should you worry about minor expenses. The cost of living

guidelines on page 405 of the *Core Rulebook* provide an easy

way to quantify such expenditures. You can place specific

treasures in particular encounters, making sure that the

overall amount equals the recommended character wealth

by level by the time the characters reach a new level.

In extreme cases for the left side of the continuum, you

can handwave treasure altogether. As characters level up,

award them the cash they need to bring them in line with

Table 12–4. The assumption is that they’ve picked this up

along the way, but in a way that wasn’t interesting enough

to make a big deal about. Similarly, assume that the

characters spend enough to keep themselves in reasonable

comfort while in towns and leave it at that.

On the other hand, more reward-focused groups on

the right side of the continuum often enjoy tracking

treasure. To please them, you can research historical

economies and describe each treasure horde in loving

detail. For variety, include art objects, gems, and notable

or valuable mundane equipment. For example, in the

medieval era, items of luxury clothing were among the

most highly valued trade goods. A little later, spices

became wildly desirable.

Some groups prove particularly cash-obsessed, more

interested in leveraging the economic system than killing

monsters. If so, assume that they’ll go the extra mile to get

a higher than usual percentage of the base price, and build

that into your game. Peg the ultimate cash values of their

treasures to the amount they can get if they coax, haggle,

and swindle maximum prices out of their merchant

partners. Use this interest to build in plot elements. They

might happily spend more time spying on rivals, muscling

out competitors, and fending off bandits than they do

fighting orcs and demons. Rather than discouraging this

behavior, you can go with it, building your treasure values

and plot elements around it. The profit motive may not be

traditionally heroic, but it does provide an easy source of

story hooks. For example:

• The Skull of the Crimson Khan might fetch little in

the farming community surrounding the dungeon,

requiring a dangerous overland journey to the Bazaar

of the Silver Kingdoms.

• The corpse of a bizarre aberrant creature, if properly

preserved and maintained, might fetch a pretty penny

from the crazy wizard-sage of the Spiral Tower—if his

automaton rivals don’t swoop in and steal the coffin first.

**Magic Items**

Magic items are an integral part of treasure calculation

in the Pathfinder RPG. The system determines a baseline

treasure haul per character for each level, assuming that

most of the treasure will be used to buy magic items.

Rewards-oriented groups, on the right end of the

continuum, enjoy finding, trading, and selling magic

items. Often they’ll enjoy the economic aspect of the game

so much that they’ll set up lucrative side businesses making

and selling enchanted objects. Let them feel rewarded for

these activities, while subtly reducing dungeon treasure

hauls to keep the group’s overall access to cash in line with

Table 12–4. They might face early successes only to see the

value of manufactured items drop as they contribute to an

oversupply. Let them get away with what seems like a score

or two, then add complicating factors that can also act as

story hooks, such as:

• Other shady adventurers come after the characters, as

easier sources of treasure than dungeons.

• Competing enchanters target the PCs for elimination.

• Supplies of raw materials dry up, requiring quests into

the dangerous wilds.

Keep detailed treatment of magic items low for groups

on the left side of the continuum. Ask them for wish lists

of items they desire for their characters. Use these as the

items they f ind while dungeon crawling, adding in just

enough variation to maintain a sense of surprise. These

groups usually want to use their magic items without

fussing over them. The odd item might serve as an epic

plot device, but most magic items should remain quietly

in the background.

High or Low Magic?

Fantasy game fans often speak of high- or low-magic

settings. High-magic settings feature powerful and

commonly available spells and magic items. Low-magic

settings make magic rarer and less effective.

In fantasy literature, especially works by writers like

Robert E. Howard and J. R. R. Tolkien written before

roleplaying tie-in novels began to inf luence the field,

powerful magic tends to be scarce. Even in settings we tend

to think of as having high magic restrict it to its rare and

remarkable leading heroes and villains. Where magical

gear is concerned, the hero might have one or two very

special items, rather than an entire kit-bag loaded with

devices for every occasion.

The default fantasy setting is usually one of very

high magic. Magic items are widely available. They’re

manufactured by retired magicians, traded by merchants,

and found lying around in dungeons. This conceit trades

epic atmosphere for gaming convenience. The rules as

written assume that characters get magic items in line

with their levels, and that when an adventurer desires a

piece of magical gear, he need only pony up the cash and

it’s his.

But these default assumptions do not appeal to

everyone. If you want a setting with lower magic, two

ways of adjusting the level of magic in your game are

presented below, as well as the repercussions such

changes can have on the game itself.

Reducing Magic with Rules

Adjustments

Certain classes, like spellcasters, lose some of

their effectiveness when deprived of magic

items. If you restrict PC access to magic

items, be sure to revisit all other aspects of the

game system with which they interact. At lower

levels, when magic users are somewhat outshined by

weapon wielders, you already have a functionally

low-magic game and don’t have to change so much.

But limits on magic can change game balance

dramatically at higher levels. Monster Challenge

Ratings will need adjusting, to take into account your

group’s reduced damage output and lower AC values.

Altering the rate at which the magic-wielding classes

acquire spells also changes the balance between them

and their weapon-wielding counterparts. Be careful

when reducing access to healing items and spells, as

this will make the PCs frailer.

Reducing Magic with World Description

As an alternative to altering the rules, you can do

what fantasy authors do—establish magic as rare and

remarkable, then portray the protagonists (the PCs) and

their opponents as the few people who have access to it. In

this model, you have high-magic PCs operating in a lowmagic

world. They retain ready access to magic items, but

that doesn’t mean that every wealthy or accomplished NPC

they meet is likewise dripping with them. People gasp in

awe when they see the heroes walk down the street. The

open display of these items in public makes the PCs a

target for thieves. Be careful not to overdo this last point,

however; having rare items should make the players feel

special, not hounded.

High-magic PCs in a low-magic world can’t easily trade

items and wouldn’t dream of selling them. Use the wish

list method of magic treasure allocation, described above,

to ensure that players get the gear they need and want.

Magic Shops

No issue epitomizes the advantages and drawbacks of a

high-magic game like the question of whether to place

magic shops in your world. Players, especially those

toward the right end of the rewards continuum, love

ready access to stores where they can purchase items they

need, sell the ones they make, and trade the ones they

find and don’t want. On the other hand, this makes magic

items seem as prosaic and interchangeable as modern

consumer goods.

If you consider this a problem, you can simply

declare that magic shops don’t exist in your setting.

Allocate items according to the wish list method. The

PCs must always overcome plot obstacles to swap, sell,

or buy major items they don’t find themselves. Minor

or disposable items, like potions and scrolls, might

be available for sale from itinerant traders or at

general stores.

Alternatively, you can assume that magic

shops exist in the background of the world,

entering into a social contract with players not

to focus on them or make them a part of the story.

If the PCs pay too much attention to them, including

planning heists, they go away, leaving the group

without a way of buying, selling, or trading desired

items.

Types of Magic Shops

Low-end shops are small, dingy operations, usually

owned by a sole proprietor. They’re often disorganized,

dingy, and filled with marginally useful clutter. Shops

of this grade frequently appear in undesirable or

remote neighborhoods. They offer minor magic items,

a range of common magical components, occult texts,

and perhaps the occasional mighty relic misidentified

as useless junk. Most low-end shops follow an inf lexible

“buyer beware” policy, offering no guarantee that items

are free from defects, curses, hauntings, or ownership

disputes. For security, these shops rely on traps, curses,

and crude but effective fortifications. Low-end shop

owners tend to be reclusive, eccentric, or truculent.

Mid-range shops are larger and cleaner, usually with a

small staff that courteously caters to customers. Shops of

this type frequently nestle on cozy side streets not far from

a city’s commercial district. Many double as informal

social clubs for the mystically inclined. Mid-range shops

offer a fuller array of merchandise: in addition to a wide

range of well-labeled components and large collections of

scholarly tomes, they sell both minor and medium items.

Items are guaranteed free from curse or defect, though

the customer’s only remedy is a full refund. Skilled

mercenaries, some of whom are spellcasters, provide

security. Magical traps supplement the fortifications.

Rewards 5

High-end shops are located alongside a city’s purveyors of

luxury goods, in heavily guarded districts. These top-range

shops often specialize exclusively in major items, and reliably

vouch for the quality of their wares, including freedom from

curses or other ill effects. Security such shops is top of the

line, with powerful spells and traps, and highly skilled and

well-paid guards, some of whom may not be entirely mortal.

They might be trained monsters, ingenious automatons, or

summoned outsiders. The identities of a high-end shop’s

true owners are often shrouded in rumor and mystery. They

might be phantasmal surrogates, disguised dragons, or

even powerful entities from the Great Beyond.

Trouble Items

Magic items are not as rigidly tethered to the advancement

system as spells, feats, and other benefits of leveling up.

For this reason, it occasionally happens that a magic item

unbalances your campaign. It might be an item of your

own devising, or an insufficiently playtested bit of gear

from a published product. Even classic items can disrupt

certain campaigns, especially ones with non-standard

premises. For example, unrestricted access to divination

items can ruin a heavily investigative campaign.

Beware of magic items so powerful that they allow their

users to consistently outperform the rest of the group.

Likewise, look out for items that violate the exclusivity of

a character concept out of combat. When players choose

their classes, they expect to be better at the core tasks

associated with those classes than other group members.

If an item does a better job of healing than your group’s

cleric, and it winds up in another PC’s hands, the cleric’s

player might feel eclipsed. Avoid this either by adjusting

or removing the trouble item or by making it an item

usable only by the class whose abilities it duplicates.

When an item proves troublesome, you can handle it

within the storyline, or step out of character to negotiate an

adjustment with the player. In the first option, something

happens to get the item out of the character’s hands entirely,

or change what it can do. The character might be called

on to sacrifice it to fulfill a quest or achieve some greater

story objective. The item might be damaged, magically

altered, stolen, or reclaimed by a previous owner. This

approach allows you to maintain an illusion of fictional

reality. To avoid player resentment, make sure to contrive

in the other direction, too, adding in a compensating plot

development or more appropriate item as a replacement

for lost treasure.

It may be easier to step out of character to handle trouble

items. Propose an adjustment that fixes the problem,

perhaps suggesting several options. Solicit the player’s

input. Some players will accept a toned-down version of

the current item, while others might prefer a completely

new piece of gear.

Story Items

Magic items in fantasy literature often have a narrative

attached to them. When the group gets a powerful item,

you can use it as a springboard for story developments.

Any item can be used as the focus of a story. Using a term

made famous by Alfred Hitchcock, screenwriters refer

to an object that serves as the motivating factor to drive

a storyline as a macguffin. Famous macguffin include

the Maltese Falcon, from the book and movie of the same

name, and *Pulp Fiction*’s glowing suitcase. Mythological

macguffin include the Golden Fleece and Holy Grail.

Any mission that sends the PCs to find a particular item

is a macguffin story, whether a former owner dispatches

them to find it or the group finds reference to it in an old

tome. Once the group finds the macguffin, it might fade

into the background as just another item of treasure, or

gradually lead to a more sweeping narrative. Alternatively,

you can introduce your big storyline sneakily, by having

the item appear as just another piece of dungeon loot.

Only after they begin to use it do the adventurers find

themselves in a swirl of epic events.

With or without a macguffin, you can gradually build

your magic item storyline until it reaches sweeping

proportions. Classic magic item storylines include the

following:

• *The object to be destroyed*. The item is a work of evil.

Disaster looms if it falls into the wrong hands. The PCs

must undergo an extensive quest, at the end of which

they must destroy the item. Along the way, they must

evade pursuers who seek to take it from them. The object

grants power if used, but tempts those who employ it to

become its slaves.

• *The royal symbol*. Like King Arthur’s Excalibur, the ability

to wield this item and awaken its powers indicates that the

owner is some kind of chosen one. By taking possession

of the item, the group embroils itself in a wider conf lict

to defend a kingdom, empire, or secret society.

• *The weapon of destiny*. The item (which need not be a literal

weapon) will turn the tide of a great war—if only the

heroes can find it and use it correctly. As with the object

to be destroyed, enemy pursuers complicate matters,

trying to stop the item's arrival at the pivotal battle.

By making an item central to your storyline, you’re

granting extra attention to the player whose character

wields it. If you make an item usable only by one hero,

find reasons for the other characters to also have a stake in

the overall objective. You might give the item to a quiet or

hard-to-motivate player to draw them into the story, while

tying it into existing plot lines for PCs who have already

established clear goals. Alternatively, use items that

multiple PCs can make use of. Depending on the makeup

of your group, a relic could grant one power to a fighter

and another to a cleric.

Starting Treasure

By default, we tend to think of starting characters as

inexperienced beginners who have scraped together a few

coins to equip themselves with mundane items for a new life

of adventure. By adjusting what beginning characters start

with, you can use starting treasure to define the characters,

making them part of the world they’re about to explore.

**Starting With Magic Items**

Giving each of the PCs a starting magic item makes

them more robust and capable from the jump, and can be

useful for smaller groups. Campaign concepts in which

the characters already enjoy wealth, status, or recognition

might also be reinforced with starting magic. For example,

the PCs might be the younger generation of a land’s great

trading houses. It makes narrative sense for their families

to give them a leg up over other adventurers.

One option is to grant the players a collective budget

of 1,500 gp per person, which they can use to buy any

number of magic items. Leave them alone to agree on a

distribution; they might get one mighty item, used by

only one of them, or many lesser ones, so everybody gets

something. The budget can only be spent on magic; they

don’t get to keep leftover cash.

Keep a close eye on what the players purchase, and veto

anything that might break the game from the beginning.

Also be prepared to adjust encounter difficulties to

account for the increased competence of magically

equipped parties.

Be careful starting young or inexperienced players

with magic items. Giving the stuff away can devalue the

classic moment when a player finds her first piece of

magical gear out in the wild.

Heirloom Items

When characters start play with magical items, ask players

to create a brief story explaining how they got them. The

story should not only reveal something about the item, but

also about the person who carries it. Avoid bogging down the

introductory adventure with a recitation of each description.

Instead, space them out by waiting until the items see use in

play, prompting each player to supply his own anecdote.

We’re calling these heirloom items, because the most

obvious story is that the item was handed down in the

character’s family. This explanation humanizes the

character and creates a supporting cast the GM can bring

into narrative moments. No longer are the PCs rootless

vagabonds; they have a history, and people they care about.

Alternative explanations are as varied as your players’

creativity. An item might be a loan from an organization

or patron, which you can weave into your campaign as

it develops. Characters might tell of finding the item

themselves, in a moment predating their adventuring

careers. A rogue might have stolen her item, implying

an enemy character who may appear later looking to get

it back. Consider ways to build on each mini-narrative,

crafting them into a broader story.

Non-magical equipment can also be treated as

heirlooms, especially for characters from impoverished

backgrounds. That scuffed-up suit of leather armor

might be a hand-me-down from a roguish uncle, or a

precious bit of loot from a terrible battle that took place

nearby a generation ago.

Setting Items

Another way to add f lavor to starting magic items is to use

them to introduce details of your world, whether you’re

using the Pathfinder world of Golarion or a setting you

have created. Make a list of each treasure item selected,

or the most notable piece of standard gear carried by

each PC. Avoid consumable items, which are unlikely to

have survived long enough to have interesting histories

attached to them. Develop quick snippets of narration

referring to their histories. For example:

• “Your sword’s blade is new, but the haft is a crude, castiron

handgrip bearing the runes of the fell king who

ruled a duergar kingdom in Nar-Voth 2 centuries ago.

The haft gives your sword its magic.”

• “Faint hieroglyphs on the *hand of the mage* you wear

around your neck date it to ancient Osirion. The

mummified appendage might have belonged to a vizier

of a god-king, who lived and breathed 5,000 years ago.”

Highlight facts about the world you expect to take on

greater significance in the course of play. Alternatively, you

might choose random setting details and then use them as

inspiration for adventure hooks. The first example above

suggests that the party will eventually meet duergar or

journey to Nar-Voth, while the mummified owner of the

third item might eventually come back to repossess it.

As with heirloom items, slip setting items into your

narration at suitable moments as the action progresses

rather than front-loading them into your opening session

preliminaries. Be ready to collaborate with players on

modified descriptions in case they decide that your

suggestions don’t fit their character concepts.

Plot Items

Plot items work like setting items, except that, instead

of referring to great events of the past, they set up future

developments in the PCs’ personal stories. Introduce

them to the players before the action begins, perhaps with

a brief description on an index card. Be careful not to

impose choices that alter a player’s character background.

Work with the player until you have a hook that works for

you, and a personal detail that fits her vision. Although

secrets occasionally lead to interesting play, backstories

the players are willing to share with the rest of the group

are more likely to take an active role in play.

At a suitable moment in the action, invite the player to

describe the item and its backstory to the other players.

Examples include:

• “I found this magical feather in a red vellum envelope,

slipped under my door at the inn the day before I set

out for the big city. A note inside was signed only, ‘Your

benefactor.’” (The gift establishes a mystery, the identity

of the benefactor, which you can slowly develop and

finally reveal.)

• “This darkwood shield was given to me by my uncle, who

said it saved his hide several times, back during the gnoll

raids.” (This detail introduces a mentor figure who can

give the PCs crotchety advice, and sets up the possibility

that the gnolls will rise again to terrorize the area.)

Mighty Items

Under ordinary circumstances, avoid giving starting

PCs magical weapons that would normally be reserved

for much higher-level characters. Overpowered items can

wreak havoc with your ability to scale encounters to the

characters’ capabilities.

As a change of pace, though, a powerful item can drive

the premise for a campaign or a series of linked adventures

within a campaign. Getting an item that outclasses them

leads the PCs into a series of crises. Entities better equipped

to use the item hunt them down and try to take it away

from them. Political leaders treat them as a destabilizing

threat to public order. Do-good sages try to capture the

dangerous item and lock it in a vault forever. Meanwhile,

the characters realize that they have a goal to achieve or

duty to perform that requires them to hold onto the item

until certain events occur or conditions are met.

For starting PCs, a major item may be mighty enough

to make the plot work. Relics or artifacts, however, carry

more cachet and are more likely to be received with a

mixture of glee and fear. Create a new artifact for the

purpose, or modify an existing one. Limit its number

of uses so that the characters can occasionally use it to

blow through superior opposition, but can’t rely on it to

overcome every obstacle they run up against. The players

should have to think hard before pulling it from their

arsenal. It might cause additional problems whenever

it is used. The item might do collateral damage to

surrounding people and buildings, or its use might alert

pursuers to the party’s presence.

**We althy Characters**

Princes, scions of mighty trading houses, and other

characters of wealth and inf luence bring a ready supply

of plot hooks to your game. But the modest starting

budget given to player characters would seem to rule out

certain background concepts. World logic says that their

vast resources ought to include any piece of gear available

for sale, but game balance requires that treasure must be

earned in the course of play.

This can be addressed in the character’s background.

Perhaps the character is proving a point to doubting elders,

stealing away from familial duties to lead a footloose life, or

has been banished from the fold, justly or not.

During play, you might also acknowledge the characters’

wealth in areas other than the equipment list. Ordinary

citizens fawn over them. They have many contacts and

enjoy access to the highest levels of society. Their noncombat

garb might be expensively impressive—though

of course, social rules forbid them to sell it to buy useful

adventuring gear.

Alternatively, if other players consent, a player with a

character concept that logically demands it might get a

10–20% bonus to their starting budget.

What is a Reward?

With a little added effort, treasure can be much more than

just numbers temporarily penciled onto a character sheet.

You can also extend the definition of treasure by making a

variety of intangible benefits available to the characters.

**Making Basic Treasure**

**Interesting**

Each time you place a major treasure hoard in your game

that includes coins or goods, look for a way to make the

experience of discovering, transporting, or trading it

somehow interesting or memorable. One general point

to bear in mind when f leshing out any aspect of your

world is that engaging details compete with one another.

Players tend to recall one or two salient moments from

any given session. They form strong memories of items

and incidents that carry an emotional charge or promise

to affect future events. If you lovingly add texture and

history to every single item of treasure, all of this detail

will blend together. This technique is more powerful when

used sparingly.

Be prepared to be f lexible when introducing special

treasure details. You may find yourself about to bring

in a vividly detailed treasure when the players are

preoccupied with other concerns, like chasing down an

escaped enemy, saving a dying comrade, or charging

onward to the next plot development. If something else

has already captured their interest, turn the treasure into

a nondescript pile of coins and save the vivid details for

an otherwise uneventful moment.

The most memorable treasure details are those that

relate in some way to other events in the campaign,

including the characters’ backstories. This might be as

simple a matter as specifying that a cache of coins was

minted in Celwynvian, when one of the PCs is exploring

her elven heritage. When customizing basic treasure, ask

yourself the following questions.

**Does the item reinforce a PC ’s**

**characterization?**

If a player has described his character as obsessed with

books, make sure that your campaign’s treasure troves

turn up more than their share of rare and antique tomes.

**Can the item reflect the adventure’s theme?**

In an adventure where the heroes are questioning their

identities, they could discover a precious mirror. During a

quest for political power, they might find a crown or scepter.

**Would the item foster an interesting**

**debate or conflict within the party?**

If one PC hates demons and wishes to destroy anything

associated with them, and the other is interested in

studying dark arts in order to defeat them, give them a

golden demon statuette to argue over. Aim for conf licts

that define the characters, rather than ones that set them

at each other’s throats.

**Is there a detail that will become**

**important later?**

Foreshadow a future adventure into the ruins of a

forgotten civilization by letting the adventurers discover

a tapestry depicting the rise and fall of that society. This

allows you to spread out the history lesson over several

game sessions.

**Can an item of treasure be used to subtly**

**introduce an NPC ?**

Often you want the party to meet a supporting player

in a casual context before they discover his or her true

importance in the story. The NPC might later be revealed

to be an evil conspirator, a prince unaware of his

birthright, or a predatory monster in disguise. If

so, introduce an item of treasure that character

will want to buy, examine, or attempt to steal.

For example, make your conspirator a rug

merchant, and the item of treasure a rare and

valuable carpet.

Would an item lead the characters to

interact nonviolently with an enemy who

wouldn’t ordinarily talk to them?

A precious memento or object of art might attract the

attention of a cruel and powerful entity who wants it enough

to negotiate a fair transaction under neutral circumstances.

This allows the PCs to converse with the dragon, bandit

king, or demon lord they’ll wind up fighting later, when

they have enough experience to tackle the foe.

When none of these questions help you to customize a

treasure item, find a random interesting detail. Turn to a

random page of the *Pathfinder Campaign Setting*, or another

setting sourcebook you happen to be drawing on, and look

for a detail that inspires a unique item of non-magical

treasure. If you’re not using a setting book, any edition of

*Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable* makes a fine source of

random mythological and fantastic inspiration.

For example, let’s say that your random page takes you

to the section of the Campaign Setting detailing the Red

Mantis Assassins. Using this as inspiration, you decide

that the treasure includes a fabulously expensive brooch

given to top members of the organization after performing

an exemplary kill. In order to trade this in for cash, the

party will either have to find a merchant who doesn’t fear

the wrath of the Red Mantis, or seek out a high-ranking

member of the group. One of the PCs might do something

rash, like use the brooch to pass herself off as a member of

the Red Mantis.

**Burdensome Treasure**

The difficulty of moving treasure out of a dungeon and back

to home base might in itself inspire scenes of challenging

adventure. Large or unwieldy furnishings, antiquities, or

art objects may require the hiring of carts, wagons, or entire

trade caravans. Chunks of precious ore or extremely large

coin hoards could also require huge transportation efforts.

Delicate items, though easily carried, might also be tough to

safely move through long stretches of treacherous terrain.

Bandits and nomadic wilderness monsters often prey on

slow-moving caravans. The party might end up battling as

many enemies while taking a burdensome treasure back to

civilization as they did to acquire it in the first place.

Although such problems are realistic and logical, they can

be overused. Players think of treasure as theirs once they’ve

found it and may resent it when it’s taken away from them.

**Special Treasures**

Art objects include paintings, sculptures, ceramics,

tapestries, and so on. Heavily ornamented weapons and

armor may be useless in the field but highly valuable as art

objects. Everyday objects from ancient civilizations may also

be regarded as desirable collectibles, especially when well

made. Ostentatious garments were central to the luxury

trade of the Middle Ages, but textiles are easily damaged.

If found in good condition, a heavily ornamented cloak or

tunic could fetch more than a chest full of coins. Books are

always rare and valuable in a pre-print society, and may be

of value to scholars, collectors, monasteries, or universities.

All of these luxury items are salable to knowledgeable and

specialized dealers located in large civilized centers.

Art objects may be delicate or burdensome. Use of the

Appraise skill is necessary to separate valuable objects from

dross. Condition affects value; a badly deteriorated work

fetches a low price, no matter how renowned the artist.

Works by known artists increase in value if accompanied

by documentation establishing their histories, but this is

rarely found when objects have been stolen or looted.

**Se rvices, Franchises, & Property**

Rather than hauling treasure hoards from the dungeon

hideouts of defeated foes, adventurers may be granted boons

or gifts by patrons assigning them to perform dangerous

tasks. Example assignments can include rescuing hostages,

gathering information, defeating military foes, or clearing

a landholding of hostile occupants.

Artisans, merchants, and others of middling means

may offer free future services in exchange for adventurous

deeds. These can range from free lodgings or repair work

to discount magical services. Churches might gift worthy

adventurers with credits for free spells, up to and including

resurrections. Local authorities or wealthy non-nobles may

grant franchises or licenses to perform lucrative business

operations, such as textile-weaving, bookmaking, glassblowing,

or leather-tanning.

Non-Adventuring Magic Items

The magical objects detailed by the game rules are,

for obvious reasons, restricted to items useful to

adventurers. It stands to reason, though, that in a world

of readily available enchantment, many items would be

broadly useful in everyday life and of little or no interest

to explorers and freebooters. These items are memorable

and unique but players will inevitably trade them for

cash or use them to solve plot dilemmas. You don’t need

detailed rules for them because they don’t affect the world

of adventure in which the characters operate. Categories

of non-adventuring enchantments include:

• **Agricultural**: enhanced plows, fertility potions for

livestock, or magic beans

• **Decorative**: art objects, architectural features, furniture,

or garments made more beautiful and wondrous by

magical means

• **Tools**: enhanced hammers, leather-curing vats, never-dull

scissors, rope-making devices, or self-heating forges

Outright ownership of land by commoners may be rare

in a pseudo-medieval society, but noble patrons often grant

property rights. Adventurers typically gain management

rights over a section of arable land, which belongs to a noble

either as an ancestral claim or a similar feudal grant from a

ruler. When it comes to managing and working such land,

adventurers may prefer to take a hands-off approach, hiring

a bailiff or sheriff to oversee production and taxation. These

details may then be left in the background, except when land

ownership generates the occasional story hook or perhaps

the occasional small profits (nothing rivaling the rewards

of adventuring, of course). The PCs may periodically be

called on to deal with marauders, repel invading rivals, or

quell peasant rebellions.

**Intangible Be nef its**

Other rewards provide benefits with no cash trade-in value.

Kings or other rulers might confer noble titles, granting

the characters status and specific legal rights forbidden

to commoners. These may include various story benefits,

including the right to be present at royal court. There the PCs

can wield political inf luence, gather useful information, and

find ways to enhance their holdings and franchises. Letters

of marque grant the legal right to attack designated enemies,

and in exchange the PCs get to keep financial proceeds

without fear of legal reprisal within the king’s borders.

Other authorities may confer honors and privileges valid

within their own spheres of inf luence. A bandit king may

grant rights of command and passage valid on his turf. A

clerical order might recognize a PC as a defender of the

faith. An honorary degree at a university allows access to

libraries and knowledgeable NPCs.

Certain experiences, usually arising during successful

encounters, may grant a character a bonus on checks related

to a highly specific situation. The situation to which the

bonus applies should ref lect the original experience in

some fashion. For example:

• Noble titles grant characters a +2 bonus on Diplomacy

checks when dealing with NPCs of inferior rank.

• Subduing the famed Golden Bull grants the character a

+2 bonus on Handle Animal involving beasts of burden.

• By slaying the Lich of Gwyndor, the character gains a +2

bonus on all Spellcraft checks concerning necromancy.

To avoid overload, these “situational bonuses” might be

limited to three such awards per character. Characters who

reach their limit can drop old bonuses to gain new ones.

**Story Be nef its**

Some adventures can confer additional benefits to make it

easier for the characters to overcome upcoming obstacles.

Often you can describe these story benefits in advance,

increasing the players’ investment in the proceedings.

• “By driving the orcs out of the valley, you’ll make it safe

for the peasants who live on your landholding.”

• “By capturing the Golden Cornucopia, you can save the

besieged residents of High Castle from starvation.”

• “By disarming the astral cannon, you can stop the priests

of Urgathoa from decimating the paladin army.”

Sometimes story benefits become obvious after the

characters overcome a crucial obstacle. The PCs may

discover only in retrospect that they’ve saved farmers, lifted

the siege of High Castle, or shielded a paladin army.

Story benefits can provide information, grant political

inf luence, or allow NPC allies to overcome rivals and enemies.

They allow adventurers to meet or solidify connections to

important NPCs. As with any exciting ongoing story, a success

often leads to a new challenge, and additional obstacles and

encounters for the heroes to overcome.

Coins

Most of the time, a coin should be a coin—a background

object the PCs quest for, but that warrants little attention.

Occasionally, though, you can add a sense of reality and

nuance to your world by describing certain coin hoards as

possessing special properties.

**Antiquity**: Coins may have been struck hundreds or

thousands of years ago. They might date to a past era

of a still-extant nation, or to an extinct civilization. They

may contain images of long-dead rulers, or symbols of

vanished religions. Figures on the coins can be inhuman

or monstrous.

**Distance**: The coins might be contemporary but

originate from a far distant land. Physical clues found

nearby might explain the past presence of foreign

adventurers or traders.

**Unusual Forms**: Old or foreign coins might have

unexpected shapes. They could have holes in the center,

so they can be stringed as necklaces. Triangular, spherical,

square, or rectangular shapes might replace round coins,

perhaps to suit the peculiar hands of non-human races.

**Bullion**: Large quantities of precious metals are

sometimes found not in coin form, but as bricks or wafers.

For symbolic reasons, other cultures might store them as

cylinders, cones, or other less efficiently stacked shapes.

**Superficial Magic**: Coins of lost or fabulous civilizations

might be imbued with decorative magic. They could glow,

change color, or contain moving images. Enchanted coins

might produce sounds, ranging from soothing hums to

dramatically chiming music. They might emit separate

aromas for each denomination, suggesting that the

people who minted them relied on smell over sight.

Unusual coins might carry a value higher than their

metal content suggests. Magical coins whose functions

prove useful to adventurers should not count as cash, but

as magical treasure far above their face value.

**Treasures as Adventures**

Treasures usually appear as the capper to a successful

encounter or adventure. Though their appearance

may mark the end of one story, they can also serve as

springboards to further events.

You can draw out the sense of emotional reward

treasure brings by making its acquisition a multi-step

affair. Anticipated rewards are sweeter than surprise

treasures. By completing one encounter, the heroes may

obtain a map, document, or verbal description pointing to

a treasure’s actual location. This should be an impressive

haul of cash or magic the entire group will look forward

to claiming.

Alternatively, the treasure itself might be assembled

from several parts, each gained after a separate encounter.

Magical relics might accumulate additional powers as the

pieces are put together. A group of dispersed art objects—

for example, a chess set or a collection of royal jewels—

may have a greater value if sold together than piecemeal.

Linked treasures can unify an otherwise unrelated series

of combat and exploration sequences.

Intelligent magic items give you wide latitude to launch

adventures. Give the item an agenda of its own. It works

to persuade its owner to perform missions furthering

its goal. It might unlock new powers as its agenda is

served, in effect making it a multi-step treasure. Like

any inf luential NPC, an intelligent item may have past

enemies who come gunning for it. Its owners might

simply evade them, or counter by actively seeking and

defeating their newly acquired foes.

Story events may be triggered not only by the discovery

of items but also by their use. When the heroes solve

problems using mighty magic items, the unintended

consequences of their actions may spawn further adventure

plots. For example, magical wishes may alter the world in

unexpected ways. After unwittingly skewing the cosmic

balance, the adventurers may have to undertake further

tasks to put matters right.

Exit Rewards

As your campaign reaches a final climax, you may choose

to lay the groundwork for story rewards that change the

characters forever, bringing closure to their personal

narratives. You may do this when you know a player is

leaving your game for good, or when you want to wrap up

the entire campaign. The latter is a natural choice as PCs

reach the game’s highest levels.

Given enough advance notice, you can create a series

of adventures leading to an indispensable position

for a departing hero. This impressive new role in the

world precludes the PC from embarking on further

adventures—though the character might make occasional

cameo appearances as an NPC, played by you. The exiting

hero might take on political power as a king, emperor, or

elected ruler. She might be granted military authority as

a general, or rise to heights of clerical power as a pontiff

or high priestess.

The ultimate exit reward is apotheosis, an ascension

to godhood or similar immortal status. Perhaps in the

wake of plane-shattering events that leave holes in the

known pantheon, the heroes achieve victories so great

that they depart the mortal world. Now vastly powerful

but unable to intervene directly in mortal events, they

accept worship, dole out divine spells to their followers,

and hold court in their newly acquired celestial realms.

Incorporate these new gods into your next campaign,

allowing players’ new characters to worship their former

ones as deities.

Be careful to avoid favoritism when concluding a PC’s

career with exit rewards. Give everyone a chance to shape

his favored glorious end state. Collaborate with players

to successfully bring the closure they envision to their

exiting heroes. If they see their characters retiring to

blissful obscurity, that can be just as satisfying a reward

as godhood.

PCs Controlling Rewards

In some cases, the PCs themselves can take on the

responsibility of providing their own rewards, using

character abilities and resources gained from their

adventures to create exactly the weapons, armors, tools,

and treasures they desire. While mundane items might

be created using various Craft skills, many PCs set their

sights upon more extraordinary goals, such as researching

and designing new spells and crafting magic items.

**Re search and De signing Spells**

The subject of designing spells is touched on only

brief ly in the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*. While some

guidance on cost and time is provided, a GM needs to

consider balance and design factors before allowing

a PC to introduce a new spell into the game. As a first

step, request a detailed write-up of the spell using the

Pathfinder RPG rules. Based on this write-up, you can

determine whether or not the spell is balanced for its

level and appropriate for the game.

**Spell Categories**: When considering a new spell,

f irst determine the category into which it f its. Spells

can be divided into the broad categories of offensive

magic (spells that deal direct damage, enhance combat

abilities, or summon allies to f ight), defensive magic

(spells that protect the caster or her allies, control or

impede enemies, or heal damage), and utility magic

(spells of general use outside of combat, such as travel

magic and most divinations). Some spells f it into

multiple categories, such as *teleport*, with both defensive

and utility applications.

**Level-Appropriate**: Compare the new spell to other

spells in the same category and at or near the desired

spell level. Pay close attention to “must have” choices

like *fireball*, *dimension door*, and *wall of force*. If the spell

is more powerful or more useful than other spells of the

desired level, increase the level. If it seems weak, consider

lowering the level. If there is already a similar spell in the

game, pay particularly close attention to the new spell’s

relative power.

**Saving Throw or Attack Roll**: Most spells that are

usable against others should require either a saving throw

or an attack roll (generally touch or ranged touch). Spells

that are quite powerful for their level, like *disintegrate* or

*phantasmal killer*, may require both, or allow two saving

throws. Watch out for spells that effectively take the

target out of the fight and are negated by a saving throw.

Consider adding a minor effect even on a successful save,

and toning down the result of a failed save. Spells that

automatically affect the target should be higher level or

limited in their consequences.

**Components**: Unless there’s a particularly good reason,

almost all spells should require both verbal and somatic

components, and most divine spells should require a divine

focus. Spells with no verbal component are particularly

rare. If the spell-as-designed lacks them, consider adding

material component or focus requirements as a means

of adding f lavor. Expensive components and foci are a

good way to adjust the effective power of a spell without

changing the level.

Good Spells and Bad Spells

The best spells do something interesting even when the

casting isn’t fully successful. They should have fairly

simple mechanics without many ambiguities, special

cases, or qualifications. If a spell takes a half-page or more

to describe, it is probably too complicated and should be

rejected or revised.

Watch out for spells that counter or otherwise render

useless equal- or higher-level magics. For defensive spells,

countering an equal-level spell is fine (like *shield* negating

*magic missile*), but an offensive spell generally should only

overcome lower-level defenses or higher-level spells that

duplicate those defenses (like *disintegrate* destroying both

*wall of force* and *forcecage*).

Good spells expand upon the existing themes of magic,

but in a novel manner. The game doesn’t really need

more ways to throw damage around, but a spell that hurls

adjacent enemies away from the caster is both interesting

and useful. Watch for spells that break the implied limits

of the game. Most arcane casters have poor healing

abilities, and divine spells rarely excel at direct damage.

With rare exception, spells shouldn’t duplicate existing

class features or feats.

While as a general rule overly specialized spells are a bad

idea, there’s much to be said for researching specialized

spells like a brewer’s blessing or a charm to hold a shoe on

a horse. If a player is particularly excited about the spell,

consider approving it even if it doesn’t have much ingame

application.

Creating a Spell

Successfully researching a new spell requires time and

expensive research. An optional system for researching

new spells is outlined below. The research should cost at

least 1,000 gp per spell level (or even more for particularly

exotic spells) and require both the Spellcraft skill and a

Knowledge skill appropriate to the researcher’s class.

Wizards and bards use Knowledge (arcana), sorcerers use

a Knowledge skill appropriate to their heritage (usually

arcana, nature, or planes), druids and rangers use the

Knowledge (nature) skill, and clerics and paladins use

Knowledge (religion). The actual research process varies by

the type of spell, often involving magical experimentation,

the purchase and study of moldy scrolls and grimoires,

contact with powerful magical beings or outsiders, and

extensive meditation or rituals.

For each week of research, the caster makes separate

Knowledge and Spellcraft checks against a DC of 20 plus

twice the level of the spell being researched, modified

according to Table 5–1. To successfully research the spell,

the caster must succeed at both checks. Failure indicates the

week was wasted. Spells of 4th–6th level requires 2 weeks

of successful research, while spells of 7th–9th level require

4 weeks. The researcher may employ up to two assistants

in the research process to assist on the skill checks using

the aid another action (see page 86 of the *Pathfinder RPG*

*Core Rulebook*).

**Spell Components**

The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game handles most spell

components in a fairly abstract fashion: the components

are purchased as part of a spell component pouch, which

is assumed to contain the required quantity of any

components for any spell of which the caster has knowledge.

For many GMs, this suits their needs, and other than

having the player mark off some gold when his PC uses a

more expensive component like diamond dust, that is the

extent of attention spell components receive. The virtue of

this system is speed and simplicity. A GM desiring more

verisimilitude can instead require the PCs track down or

prepare individual components, and even allow PCs to

obtain enhanced components that improve their spells.

Even when tracking individual components, many

reagents are so common they can be assumed to be easily

found. Save the legwork for commissioning tiny silver

whistles (for *mage’s faithful hound*), finding dragon scales (for

*form of the dragon*), and things of that nature. Yet even then,

don’t go overboard—while finding rare components can be

a fun opportunity for side-quests, your players go grocery

shopping often enough in real life, and obsessing over

whether their leaves are fresh or their eggshell components

got cracked in the last fall is a good way to bore your players

and ensure nobody wants to play a caster in your game.

Components for New Spells

Two principles of magic to remember when considering

spell components are that of contagion (a part retains a

connection to the whole) and sympathy (like produces like).

A component can be linked to its source, manipulating or

drawing power from that source, or it can produce effects

based upon its nature.

Historically, components such as blood carried both

the life and strength of a creature, and the potential to

bind two lives together; coffin nails could be pounded

or bound into a weapon, making it strike true; hair and

nails rendered the original owner vulnerable to hostile

magic even at great distances; and animal horns and tusks

provide protection to their wearer, not to mention the

healing properties of a unicorn’s horn.

Most spell components in the Pathfinder RPG are based

on sympathy, either duplicating the desired outcome of the

spell (gauze and a wisp of smoke for *gaseous form*) or having

properties related to the spell (an owl’s feather for *owl’s*

*wisdom*). The latter sort of component may utilize contagion

as well, as the single feather retains the nature of the whole.

When adding material components or a focus to a new

spell, consider what forces the spell is shaping, and select

components that ref lect those forces. Good components

don’t necessarily need to be literally appropriate—the

handful of earth required for *detect undead* is an example

of a more symbolic fit. Humorous spell components are

tempting (and well represented in the game), but should

be used sparingly.

Enhanced Components

An enhanced component is a specialized reagent used to

improve a spell. The exact effects of such a component

are up to the GM, but may include a small increase

to save DC, caster level, damage, range, or duration.

Particularly rare enhanced components may even

provide the benef its of metamagic feats. In addition,

enhanced components used in long-duration spells

often make them signif icantly harder to dispel.

The power of a component is strongly inf luenced by

the means by which it was obtained. For most magic, the

most powerful components are those freely given, rather

than taken by force, thievery, or magical compulsion.

A vial of dragon’s tears wept during a masterful

performance may well hold more magic than a vial of

blood taken from that same dragon’s ravaged corpse.

The same is not true for darker magics. For such spells,

components obtained in profane and blasphemous

rituals are the most powerful by far.

Symbolism is key in obtaining enhanced components.

A wizard seeking the last light of an eclipse to enhance

a *sunburst* might catch the sun’s rays in a mirror, while

a druid might gather the nectar of morning glories that

bloomed in the day’s light and shut in the darkness of

the eclipse for the same spell. Neither is literally the last

light of the sun, but the principle of contagion suffices to

enhance the spell.

Before introducing enhanced components into your

game, consider the implications of allowing casters to

increase their abilities without investing in metamagic

feats or permanent magic items. To preserve their rare

and exotic feel, enhanced components should not be

easily obtainable or fixed in price. Finding a source for

an enhanced component is an adventure in itself, and the

quantities available should be limited to just a few castings.

Two examples are as follows:

**Dragon’s Tears**: These yellowish drops extend the

duration of any spell that inf luences emotion, such as

*heroism* or *rage*. If the tears are both genuine and freely

given, the duration is increased by 50%. If obtained by

trickery or magic, the increase is only 20%.

**Vampire Dust**: The carefully sifted dust of a destroyed

vampire enhances spells fueled by negative energy. A

single vampire yields only 1d4+1 uses of dust. Spells

infused with vampire dust receive a +1 bonus to caster

level. If the caster personally slew the vampire, the dust

increases save DCs by +1 as well.

**Wishes**

The monstrous four-armed demon spoke in a surprisingly

pleasant tenor voice. “And what, pray tell, is it you so desire?”

Setiyel paused, steeling his resolve. “I wish suffering for

my family, tenfold for each wrong visited upon myself. I

wish the lord mayor’s daughter and rank, and his head

resting beneath my boot. I wish for such wealth that even

a Qadiran merchant would weep with envy.” The demon’s

laugh boomed throughout the cavern. “Is that all, little

one? I expected ambition.”

More so than almost any other ability, *wish* and its cousin

*miracle* have the potential to drastically change a campaign.

When your players reach the upper echelons of the game at

15th level and beyond, you should consider whether or not

you want to allow your players access to *wishes*, as even if

they can’t buy them, they’ll soon enough be able to cast the

*wish* spell themselves.

The easiest way to control *wish* is to restrict it to

those options listed in the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*.

None of these uses are game-breaking. However, by

expanding the boundaries of *wish* and *miracle*, you

open up roleplaying and story opportunities that can

keep your high-level game fresh and exciting for many

adventures to come.

**Types of Wishes**: One of the f irst boundaries to set

is whether or not all wishes are created equal, and have

similar constraints. Treating all *wishes* the same has the

virtues of consistency and simplicity, and helps keep

your game under control. Having a hierarchy of *wishes*

gives fodder for the story in your game, letting PCs

alter their local reality with their wishes, but leaving

the option of seeking out higher powers to grant the

wishes spoken of in legends. A suggested hierarchy is

*wishes* from spells or magic items, followed by *miracle*,

*wishes* granted by artifacts and relics, *wishes* granted by

powerful outsiders like the efreet and djinn, and f inally

those *wishes* bestowed directly by gods and other entities

beyond mortal ken.

**Making Good Wishes**: The best *wishes* are short,

unambiguous, related to matters immediately at hand,

and usually aimed at a simple (if powerful) task. A *wish* for

a sundered *mirror of mental prowess* to be made whole or a

*wish* to reveal the identity of the thief of the crown jewels is

unlikely to go awry.

**Making Bad Wishes**: *Wishes* born of greed or vengeance

have a way of turning sour. Attempts to guard against

mishap with a list of conditions and qualif iers are rarely

successful, most often resulting in partial fulf illment

of the *wish*. *Wishes* that stretch the limits of the power

granting them are always ill advised. If the *wish* is from

a spell or magic item, failure or backlash is likely, while

if the *wish* is from an outside source, the granter of the

*wish* may be angered by mortal temerity and twist the

*wish* or otherwise seek retribution against the wisher.

**Twisting Wishes**: Folklore is filled with tales of *wishes*

gone awry, bringing heartbreak, misery, and perhaps

eventually wisdom to the hapless wisher. The *wishes* most

likely to be perverted away from the wisher’s intent are *wishes*

granted by hostile outsiders, *wishes* from cursed objects, and

bad *wishes* as described above. Evil outsiders in particular

are loath to grant *wishes* that don’t serve evil ends, and take

every opportunity to twist them toward harm and suffering.

A *wish* for eternal life may leave the wisher imprisoned in a

decrepit yet still undying body. A *wish* for a powerful magic

item can be granted by stealing the item from a powerful

and vengeful lord. *Wishes* are best turned awry by adhering

closely to the letter of the *wish*, but violating the spirit.

**Deferred Results**: Rather than denying a particularly

powerful *wish*, such as for the throne of a kingdom, the *wish*

can be granted over an extended period. The *wish* subtly

reshapes reality, guiding the wisher through seeming

coincidence, good fortune, and the timely appearance of

helpful NPCs. Success is not assured unless the PC takes

advantage of her opportunities.

**Making Magic Items**

In every campaign, there comes a time when the PCs are

no longer satisfied with the magic items available to their

characters. Whether looking for a power to complement

their skills, a new twist on an old favorite, or just the sheer

joy of invention, creating a new magic item opens up new

venues for a PC. It is also a great way to leave a mark on

the campaign—after all, even the oldest magic items were

once new to the world.

Pricing a magic item is more art than science. Guidance

on item pricing is given in Table 15–29 on page 550 of

the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*, but a trip through the

magic item section shows the formulas are often not

applied exactly. An example is the *ring of invisibility*, with

a calculated price of 10,800 gp, but a book value of 20,000

gp. This is because the at-will nature of the ring offsets the

biggest drawback of *invisibility*, namely that it ends after

attacking. When pricing new magic items, watch out for

any item that counteracts a basic weakness of an ability,

class, or spell.

The best test for item pricing is to compare it to

“must have” items in the game, like

weapons, armor, and stat-boosting

gear. Also compare it to other

items that share the same

slot, and items with similar

powers. As a rule of thumb,

if you’d take the item in

a heartbeat over a more

expensive standard

item, it is probably too

cheap. And if you’d

never consider taking

a 10,000 gp ring over a

*belt of physical might +2*

or even a *+2 battleaxe*,

it might just be

overpriced. However,

it is safer to price items

too high rather than too

low. After all, the PC gets a

new, custom magic item out

of the arrangement, and that’s

worth paying a bit extra.

Ad-Hoc Pricing

If there’s no effect in Table 15–29 that

matches the new item’s powers, try looking

through existing magic items for something

that’s close. For example, Seltyiel wants to add

the bladethirst ability to his longsword, a power

he’s come up with that lets him draw the weapon

as a free action. This is essentially the

Quick Draw feat, but tied to a single

weapon. Even though it’s a weapon

enhancement, Seltyiel wants it as a f lat

cost, like adding f ire resistance to a suit

of armor. Looking over the ability, the GM

decides that this f its well, since it doesn’t really scale up

with a more powerful weapon. *Gloves of arrow snaring* are

a 4,000 gp item that grants a feat, so the GM uses this

as the base price. Multiple different abilities on a magic

item would normally increase this cost by 50%, but since

the Quick Draw feat would allow drawing items other

than just a single weapon, the GM splits the difference

and makes it a 5,000 gp weapon enhancement.

Keeping the Balance

Watch out for magic items that provide benefits beyond

the calculated price. Keep an eye toward preserving the

existing power level of magic items in the game.

**Disadvantages That Aren’t**: Be wary of items that

are designed with a class or

alignment restriction in order

to lower the price. Since the

item’s restriction doesn’t

restrict the character who

is going to use it, it isn’t

really a drawback at all and

shouldn’t reduce the price.

**Slotless Items**: The

Pathfinder RPG is designed

with assumptions about

how many magic items a

character can reasonably

use at the same time,

requiring players to make

hard choices about which

magic items their PCs acquire.

Slotless items like *ioun stones* are

usually either relatively low-powered

or specialized in purpose. Think

carefully before allowing a new magic

that essentially duplicates an old one, but

without using up an item slot.

**Good Item, Bad Formula**: Take a look at

what the magic item actually does, and compare

it to the formula used. Consider tweaking the

cost or powers to match the provided

benef it. A ring that provides

*mind blank* calculates to 153,000

gp, while one that casts *mind*

*blank* once per day (at 24

hours per use) comes out to

55,080 gp. In truth, there’s

not a large difference

in utility between the

two items, and the f irst

ring is a better f it for

the theme of continuous

mental protection.

Note that these tables create masterwork versions of armor
