# The Soul Trade
## Overview
**The Soul Trade**

There are many different ways to capture souls. The most commonly used methods are spells like *[[Soul Bind (Spell)|soul bind]]* and *[[Trap the Soul (Spell)|trap the soul]]*, with the former imprisoning the soul of a newly dead creature and the latter trapping the soul of someone still alive. Other creatures, such as the undead called devourers, have their own innate methods of trapping souls, and likewise night hags are capable of using a version of *[[Soul Bind (Spell)|soul bind]]* through their heartstones to capture the souls of those they torment, binding them in dark gems and selling them in planar markets. Still other creatures create magic items called soul jars, which mimic the effects of these spells.

All of these methods, however, pale in the face of daemons’ industrialized harvesting of souls. Abaddon’s fiends use virtually all known methods of collecting and storing souls, many of which are unique to themselves. Cacodaemons, the least caste of daemons, prove vital to this harvest, and represent the most common means of turning souls into trade goods. These ravenous fiends possess the unique ability to devour the souls of freshly killed creatures; transform their souls into small, jewel-like objects called soul gems; and spit them back up for collection. These gems each contain the basic essence of a soul, and daemons use them for various raw and refined purposes depending on the fiend in question, the quality and power of the soul, and the daemon’s knowledge of soul-warping magic. Of course, many cacodaemons would prefer to consume the souls in their entirety, rather than passing the spirits on, but more powerful daemons rarely give them the option, bullying the cacodaemons into giving up their treasures, employing (or enslaving) a particular individual as a partner in the trade, or maintaining whole hunting packs as pets.

Most methods of using souls extinguish them completely, consigning them to oblivion. In these cases, only the direct intervention of a deity can return them to life—and sometimes not even then, such as when the soul is specifically devoured by one of the Horsemen. Other methods bleed a fraction of a soul’s energies away, and while this method is far less powerful, some daemons capture other creatures for the sole purpose of entrapping them and milking their souls over a prolonged period of time, causing horrific agony for spans of months, years, or centuries before finally giving in to their own hunger and consuming what tattered fragments of soul remain.

Unconscionable as most of the universe considers these practices, trapped souls exist as a commodity replete with their own rampant underground economy, both within the evil-aligned planes and elsewhere. Most of these souls ultimately end up in Abaddon, though buyers and markets can also be found in Hell, the Abyss, Axis, and even the worlds of the Material Plane, as evil spellcasters and item crafters can make great use of powerful souls in their dark rites. The economy is complex, with prices determined not only by the strength and power inherent in a given soul, but also according to each soul’s manner of death, alignment in life, and other criteria. These additional factors rarely influence their use in magical experiments unless a soul was particularly noteworthy, but as the daemons are happy to explain, the nature of a soul has everything to do with its unique flavor.

While the value of souls is as relative as any other commodity, and pricing can fluctuate wildly based on an endless parade of factors, presented here are some basic categories. With each of these, it’s important to note that these are guidelines only, and individual spirits may fall lower (such as a dragon slain young, or a king whose general lack of ambition kept him from great deeds) or higher (a commoner of exceptional piety, or one who never had the chance to fully explore her exceptional abilities) than one might expect. These prices are based upon the supply and demand commonly faced by traders upon the planes where such commodities prove far less outlandish than on the Material Plane, where prices might increase by 10 times or more (though such has no effect on their value when put to use; see below). As with anything else, the exact value of a soul is ultimately up to GM discretion. It’s also worth noting that, while trading spirits may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus carries great consequences in the afterlife.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The practice of creating soul gems via spells is evil (since every spell that does so has the evil descriptor) but there are greater and lesser evils. As an example, an arcane executioner who creates soul gems as part of the lawful execution of a murderer is evil, but much less so than the arcane assassin who does so while carrying out his trade. And a good caster who does so against known evil foes is again much less so than a neutral one who does so against anyone who happens to challenge his power.

The GM and players should decide these moral issues on a case by case basis and allow the lesser evils to be atoned for much easier than the larger ones.

## Using Souls
**Using Souls**

In addition to consuming them for the sheer joy of destruction, daemons use souls to empower themselves, conduct strange experiments, construct their hideous domains, and more—and mortal spellcasters have followed their lead. Of these varied uses, the most common is the creation or recharging of magic items, using the life force contained in soul gems and other such vessels—or drawn out of the victim directly at the moment of casting—to empower the magic being worked. In these cases, souls should be assigned values based on the categories presented here and then treated as material components, reducing the gold expenditure necessary to cast the spell according to the souls’ value. (Thus a spell that requires 400 gp to cast might instead cost 300 gp and a basic-level soul.) Souls used in this manner are consumed and destroyed utterly.

Souls are especially useful in the creation of intelligent items. In these cases, usually only one soul crystallizes as the intelligence embedded into the item, though other souls may be cannibalized in the item’s creation. Item alignment, item ability scores, and languages spoken by the item mirror those of the soul used to provide the item’s intelligence. Scholars have long debated whether the intelligence in such an item is the soul used, or if the soul is destroyed and the intelligence is only patterned on it—the implication being that recovered intelligent objects (especially of daemonic origin) might be destroyed in order to liberate the souls used in their construction. As instances of both have been reported over the centuries, the question remains open, though few adventurers are willing to destroy their prized weapons based on conjecture.

Beyond the means described above, daemons have myriad additional means of trapping, keeping, and subsequently using souls for constructing permanent objects and effects, such as a liquid form of soul-stuff mixing multiple souls, a crystalline dust formed from soul gems, and even ink created from souls and used to write down the names of the doomed, imprisoning them in elaborate poems penned on the daemons’ own flesh. Something intrinsic in daemonic nature allows for this flexibility, as some of the same methods they routinely use fail spectacularly when attempted by non-daemons, including such creatures as night hags, devourers, liches, and followers of some fiendish lords, who themselves possess a vested interest in exploiting some or all of these methods.

## The Value of Souls
**The Value of Souls**

Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul’s value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul’s life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul’s age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul’s flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it’s worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).

**Life Force:** A soul’s life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested × 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature’s soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature’s soul is 20,000 gp.

**Age:** A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.

**Flavor:** As a general rule, a soul’s flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM’s discretion, the soul’s flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin’s soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of [[Desna]] might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way.

## Additional Uses for Soul Gems
**Additional Uses for Soul Gems**

Soul gems may be used to lessen experience point penalties (such as those from ECL penalties) and also used to power spells and rituals which require experience points. This is done on a point for point basis, so if a character currently has an experience point penalty of 8,000 XP due to an ECL adjustment, it could consume 3,000 XPs from a soul gem(s) and lessen its penalty to 5,000 XP.
