# Purgatory (Plane)
## Overview
**Purgatory (Neutral)**

Every soul passes through Purgatory to be judged before being sent on to its final destination in [[The Great Beyond|the Great Beyond]]. Vast graveyards and wastelands fill its gloomy expanses, along with dusty, echoing courts for the judgment of the dead. Purgatory is home to the aeons, a race who embody the dualistic nature of existence and who are constantly both at war and at peace with each other and themselves.

Purgatory has the following traits:

**Timeless**: Age, hunger, thirst, afflictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing donâ€™t function in Purgatory, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves Purgatory.

**Divinely Morphic**: Deities with domains in Purgatory can alter the plane at will.

**Strongly Neutral-Aligned**

**Enhanced Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities with the death descriptor, or from the [[Death (Domain)|Death]] or [[Repose (Domain)|Repose]] domains, are enhanced.
