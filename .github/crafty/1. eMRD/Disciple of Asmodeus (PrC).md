# Disciple of Asmodeus (PrC)
## Overview
“Merciless lord of the Ninth Hell, keeper of all

things forbidden and unknown, master of all

you encounter, Asmodeus, I call on your dread

name.”'

—Gilliard DeRosan

The disciple of Asmodeus is a lordly,

domineering sort who craves unlimited

power. He is ruthless in his pursuits

and uncaring of any who might

get in his way. He uses his power and

influence to learn secrets, which in turn gain

him more power, manipulate and

command others, and enhance his

own physical aspect.

Spellcasters (arcane or divine) often make the best disciples

of Asmodeus.

Disciples of Asmodeus are a part of a large but secretive

organization that crisscrosses most of civilized society. Their

hierarchy is rigid, with power-hungry members continually

moving up and down the ranks. The disciples of Asmodeus

seek nothing less than world domination. As such, their

dread master often rewards them with the service of some

minor devils or undead.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Asmodeus

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Asmodeus

are proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a disciple of Asmodeus attains 1st level, and

at every other level after that, the character gains new spells

per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting

class he belonged to before he added the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling

or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats,

hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and

so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

This essentially means that he adds the new level of disciple

of Asmodeus to the level of whatever other spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day, spells

known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if

Ulthanc, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in disciple of

Asmodeus, he gains new spells as if he had risen to 9th level

in wizard, but uses the other disciple of Asmodeus aspects of

level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus.

If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level

wizard/1st-level disciple of Asmodeus, he gains spells as if

he had risen to 10th level as a wizard.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

he became a disciple of Asmodeus, he must decide to which

class he adds the level of disciple of Asmodeus.

Charm (Sp): Once per day, a disciple of Asmodeus can

produce an effect identical to that of a charm person spell cast

by a spellcaster of his effective caster level.

Learn Secret (Ex): Through trickery, deceit, and sometimes

even intimidation, a disciple of Asmodeus can learn

secrets otherwise unattainable. At 1st level, the disciple can

make a Gather Information check once per week with a +10

competency bonus. For every two levels beyond 1st level,

the disciple of Asmodeus can use this ability one more time

per week (twice at 3rd level, three times at 5th level, and so

on) until 9th level, when the disciple of Asmodeus can use

the ability once per day.

Command (Sp): Once per day, a 2nd-level disciple of

Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of a command

spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective caster level.

Summon Hellcat (Sp): A 4th-level disciple of Asmodeus

can summon 1 hellcat once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective

caster level. A 9th-level disciple of Asmodeus gains the ability

to summon 1d4 hellcats once per day.

Evil Authority (Sp): Once per day, at the command of a disciple

of Asmodeus of 6th level or higher, all evil-aligned

creatures within 50 feet that have fewer Hit Dice than the

disciple must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + disciple’s

class level + disciple’s Cha bonus) or recognize the disciple

as their superior. Affected creatures do not attack the

disciple of Asmodeus and do as he commands as though

affected by a mass suggestion spell. This mind-affecting ability

lasts for 24 hours.

Summon Major Devil (Sp): Once per week, a 8th-level disciple

of Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of

a greater planar ally spell to call a devil and work out a bargain

for aid.

Greater Command (Sp): Once per day, a 9th-level disciple

of Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of a

greater command spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective

caster level.

Dread Might (Ex): Drawing some of Asmodeus’s power

into himself, the disciple gains a permanent +2 divine bonus

to Armor Class and on saving throws and attack rolls.
