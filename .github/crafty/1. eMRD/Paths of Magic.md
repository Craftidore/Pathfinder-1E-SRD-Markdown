# Paths of Magic
## Overview

Khenvorm Rallister, called the Gaunt, had worked long hours on the paths of magic, and the road was growing easier the further he travelled it. Today had given him a chance to prove his skills with a petrification spell of his own invention. He looked out of his tower at the results; twelve goblins serving as lawn ornaments, faces frozen in expressions of stony horror. His colleagues at the Guild of Seven Stars had helped him walk the Path of Stone, just as they had helped his first steps on the Path of Lesser Fire Magics.

With luck and hard work, soon he would be a master of all the elements, and ready to challenge that old fool Anselm the Bald for the Guildmaster’s chair. He smiled quietly to himself; no one at the Guild knew that the secret ways of necromancy had fallen to his superior intellect. They thought they had taught him all his tricks at the Seven Stars, but his mastery of the Reapers Road would be an unpleasant surprise for anyone foolish enough to oppose him....

**A variant magic system for the Pathfinder and 3.5 version of D&D game**

In most Pathfinder (and D&D version 3.5) game campaigns, magic is organized into schools, colleges of magic that feature related spells such as charms, alterations, or illusions. Each wizard can choose to learn any spell he finds, of any school. Specialist wizards can memorize more spells each day, at the price of being forever barred from all spells of certain schools. The current rules don’t allow for any variation from these two patterns—but there is another path that a wizard character can follow.

This article describes a new set of rules to govern magic in PF game campaigns. It allows a wizard the best of both worlds; depending on the choices he makes when he begins studying magic, an archwizard may be a specialist, a generalist, or may end up somewhere in between. The spells he chooses early on determine what spells he gains in the future. Path magic—also called pattern magic, step magic, or web magic—operates by mimicking the learning process. Wizards don’t just jump randomly from spell to spell; they choose and then pursue paths of magical power that channel their options.

In the current rules, each spell is learned in isolation, with no connection to a larger picture. Magic loses some of its wonder because it operates just as reliably and simply as a hammer or any other tool. Variant rules based on spell points (sometimes called mana) fail for the same reason; they draw no connections between spells. But magic isn’t a tool; it’s an art, a system of interwoven knowledge and skills. This article reinforces that fact and restores a sense of progression to your fantasy role-playing setting.

In addition to improving the logic of the rules, grouping similar spells in sequence gives players a way to discuss spells in character: “Well, once we saw that Marzak of the Azure Lightning had mastered the seventh step of the Storm Path, we knew his magic could be the death of us all, so we pretended to surrender, and then...”

Paths are bodies of knowledge that are kept in colleges, where the initial stepping stones are passed down from masters to students. Colleges are founded to pursue certain forms of magic; to follow a path, a wizard either must research each step on his own or join a guild or college. Because each wizard’s guild is devoted to certain paths, the DM can limit player choices in a logical way (“They don’t teach the Path of the Mind at the Guild of Seven Stars”), but this also gives the player a chance to either accept the DM’s ruling (“I guess I’ll keep going to the guild anyway”) or take on new goals for more quests and adventures. (“We need to find another guild.“)

**Learning magic step by step**

What are the paths of power? In the game, they are sequences of related spells that must be learned in a particular order, from lowest to highest level. If a path contains more than one spell of a certain level, the wizard only needs to learn one of those spells in order to progress along the path (but she may learn more than one spell of a certain level on a given path if she so desires).

In this system of magic, each step on the path of power depends on understanding the principles behind previous steps; that is, a wizard never can learn a spell if he does not understand the previous spells on the same path. For this reason, spells are arranged in sequences of required learning, like the rungs of a ladder or the steps on a staircase. For instance, before a wizard on the path of Greater Fire Magic can cast a *fireflow* spell (third level), he must be able to cast at least one of the three second-level spells preceding fireflow on this path: *scorch,* *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]**,* or *[[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]]*.

This system might seem too constricting, forcing choices, a straitjacket for wizards. However, there are advantages to pursuing magic along paths. In fact, it opens many choices as well, for a wizard on a path may always automatically find information about the next spell on a path when he reaches the experience level that allows him to cast it. No more need to rummage through dusty tomes with all the dignity of a looter on a battlefield; no need for a player to depend on a DM’s whim for the spells he wants; no need for the DM to drop scrolls and spell books “conveniently” into every adventure.

Simply put, each time the wizard levels, he makes a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) skill check. The DC to learn a spell he wishes (assuming he has access to that level of spell) is 10 + plus the level of the spell + the total number of spells in that particular path. The wizard may learn a number of new spells equal to his level plus his Int modifier each time he levels. All spells he wishes to learn must be from a path the wizard is already on save for the first (lowest level) spell of a path (which indicate the wizard is attempting to start a new path. If a path is frustrated in one direction (he fails the roll for a prerequisite spell), he may be able to approach it from another direction (if the path contains more than one spell of the same level), or he may try again to learn the next spell when he gains another level. Paths of power that contain four or more spells are commonly called “roads,” but in general there is no system for naming paths. Many of the paths of power described below are given different names in different lands: the Trickster’s Road is known as Loki’s Path among the Norse, and Hermes’ Path near Mount Olympus.

Be creative in choosing your own names and your own forks in the roads.

**Greater and lesser paths**

All paths belong to one of two categories, greater or lesser. The distinction between the two is simply a matter of whether a path includes one or more first-level spells. Greater paths, the ones that contain first-level spells, are the paths that all wizards must start on. Their names are printed in bold type in the lists of paths given later in this article.

The shorter paths that begin with higher-level spells are referred to as lesser paths, for their forms of magic are not as simple or as extensive as the greater paths. Only more powerful wizards travel these paths, since they include no first-level spells. Lesser paths are printed in bold italic type in the lists below.

**Skipping steps**

As a wizard progresses along a path, he builds a base of knowledge, formulas, and techniques for the magic of the path. Once he knows spells from two or more consecutive spell levels on a path, he may skip one step farther along on the path. For example, a wizard on the Eagle’s Road already knows *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* (first level) and *ride the wind* (second level). He may then skip one step (the third-level *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* spell) and learn *spectral wings* (fourth level).

Only one spell level can be skipped on any path. However, it is possible to go back and fill in a step that had been skipped earlier. In the example, the wizard could learn *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* after originally skipping it in favor of *spectral wings*, and then, if he so chose, he could skip another step farther along the path—passing over *vortex*, for instance, and learning *spectral steed* as his next spell on this path.

**Interesting connections**

In one sense, path magic is simply an extension and refinement of the schools of magic. However, this interpretation oversimplifies and misses the system’s broader usefulness for DMs and players. Sure, some paths represent the core spells of the various schools; it’s only logical, since the spells of each school are derived from the same arcane tradition. But paths link the spells of a school together (for instance, the Path of Deception described below covers much of the heart of the school of illusion), and also link together spells from completely unrelated schools (as in the Path of Shadows or the Path of the Drow). Paths can make more interesting connections than schools can: for instance, the Dragon’s Road mimics the powers of many dragons, and the Path of the Drow includes many of the powers of the dark elves, as well as their spider magics.

**How many paths can a wizard follow?**

The number of paths a wizard can travel on depends on both his experience level and his Intelligence. Path magic requires a new set of assumptions about how many spells a wizard can learn. The Intelligence Table in the Player’s Handbook defines the maximum number of spells of a certain level that a wizard character can know. But spells in paths are not neatly arranged by level; they cross and intersect and clog that system.

The number of paths a specialist wizard can follow is a more complex issue. Generally, there aren’t any specialists of path magic, since the paths themselves set limits and force a wizard to specialize by limiting what types of spells he can learn and cast. The bonuses for mastering a path provide an additional incentive to master just specialized paths of magic.

However, if the DM and players prefer to keep specialists in the campaign, a specialist retains his normal bonuses (he may memorize one additional spell of each level he is capable of learning about) but he can learn fewer paths at any given level than a generalist (a wizard) can. Spells from opposition schools are still off limits; this may prevent the specialist from gaining mastery of some paths. Opposition paths are beyond the scope of this article.

**Table A: Number of Paths/Level**

**Table B: Bonus Paths for Intelligence**


| **Wizard's** | **Bonus** |
|---|---|
| **Intelligence** | **Paths** |
| 10-11 | 0 |
| 12-13 | +1 |
| 14-15 | +2 |
| 16-17 | +3 |
| 18-19 | +4 |
| 20-21 | +5 |
| 22-23 | +6 |
| 24-25 | +7 |
| 26-27 | +8 |
| 28-29 | +9 |
| 30-31 | +10 |
| 32-33 | +11 |
| 34-35 | +12 |
| 36-37 | +13 |
| 38-39 | +14 |
| 40-41 | +15 |
| 42-43 | +16 |
| 44-45 | +17 |

Table A lists the number of paths that a wizard or a specialist of a certain experience level can follow (i.e., learn spells from). Table B gives bonuses to this number according to the wizard’s Intelligence score and this number of bonus paths also applies to the number of paths available per day (if using that rule).

For example, a wizard (not a specialist) of 10th level with a 16 Intelligence can learn spells from up to 12 different paths (9 for being 10th level, +3 for his Int score).

**Completing a path**

If a wizard learns every spell in a path, the path is said to be completed, and it no longer counts against his maximum allowable number of paths. This rule makes archwizards very powerful indeed, because they can learn more spell paths by completing prior ones. In addition, they can learn new paths very quickly (just by making an unbroken series of successful “to learn” rolls), much more quickly than a traditional wizard could gather all the formulae from spell books and grimoires hidden in obscure corners of the campaign. In general, though, paths become less and less limiting at higher levels, since the archwizard knows almost everything is there is to know about the arcane arts anyway; new paths are less challenging because of their similarities to spells he has already studied and mastered.

**Forking paths**

When paths of power intersect, the wizard learning the paths has three choices: he may continue to follow only the path he began with, ignoring the intersection; he can switch from one path to the other, abandoning the chance of any further progress on the first path; or he can pursue both paths by declaring that he will follow a forking path. These forking paths offer a wizard more options than just a straight line because he can learn spells from either path as he gains more levels, but each “branch” of the fork still counts as a separate path for purposes of determining how many paths a wizard can follow.

Some spells are listed on more than one path; there’s more than one way to learn many of the arts of magic, after all. Spells that intersect at the crossroads of two or more paths are called nexus spells. First-level spells are never nexus spells. To jump the track and switch from one path to another at a nexus point, the wizard must know about the existence of both paths.

Once he switches tracks on a forked path, he can no longer skip any spells beyond the nexus spell; this is only part of the price he pays for forking his path. If he completes one path entirely, he may skip spells on the second forking path normally.

**Two-way travel**

Although paths are generally meant to be followed from beginning to end (from lowest-level spell to highest-level spell), there is nothing to prevent a wizard from “backtracking” to learn a lower-level spell he did not already know. In fact, this is what happens when a wizard fills in a step along a path that he had earlier skipped (see “Skipping steps” above). The same sort of “filling in” can be done for the sake of picking up a spell that didn’t have to be learned earlier (in the case of a path containing more than one spell of a certain level), and for the sake of acquiring lower-level spells along a path that the wizard began to follow at a nexus point (see Forking paths above). A wizard may not often find it useful to engage in this backtracking, but it can be done if she so desires.

**Path magic in the campaign**

In campaign terms, path magic promotes magic as a discipline, an art learned stage by stage. GMs can tailor paths to suit their own tastes and the needs of the campaign, and powerful spells are the direct result of earlier studies. No wizard can simply learn *disintegrate* without learning (for instance) *ESP, iron mind,* and *telekinesis* first, since those spells precede *disintegrate* on the Path of the Mind.

Because the initial selection of paths will determine many of the wizard’s future spell choices, the player and DM should consider the character’s first-level spells very carefully.

**New system**

In addition to the sequenced learning requirements of path magic, you may choose to offer wizards a new system of casting spells as well, Normally, wizards simply master the spells in their grimoires, memorize them, and cast them based on their level. Path magic allows for some interesting variations, if both the players and the GM agree.

The new system of spell-casting does not call on a complicated mana system; a wizard may still cast the same number of spells as given in the basic rules, but he does not memorize them ahead of time. Instead, each day the wizard declares which of the paths that he studies he will use. For that day, the wizard must cast spells from those paths only. The number of daily paths is given on Table A. The number of bonus paths given for Intelligence also applies to the number of daily paths usable by the wizard. This system gives a wizard flexibility within constraints.

**New spells**

The following spells affect paths directly, forming by themselves a sort of “Path of Paths.” Because they strike at the root of a path wizard’s power, they should be extremely rare—and extremely feared. Any wizard using them indiscriminately will soon find himself hunted by other wizards who want to see him stopped.

**Close Path** (abjuration)

**Level:** Wizard (path) 3

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver key worth at least 50 gp, which must be broken during the casting)

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One wizard

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

This lesser magic closes a wizard’s access to a path he normally can follow. This bars his access to one path (determined randomly), for the remainder of the day.

Spells already memorized are not forgotten; the wizard simply can’t access them. The caster does not know which spell or spells are barred from the target (if any). After 24 hours pass, the target may memorize and cast spells of the closed path again normally.

**Seal Path** (abjuration)

**Level:** Wizard (path) 5

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a shining seal made of a special alloy of lead and mithril. The seal is inscribed with the victim’s name or sigil, and its cost is never less than 1,000 gp.)

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One wizard

**Duration:** Permanent until dispelled

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The wizard affected by this spell can learn no more spells in a path (chosen by the caster from among those the caster knows the target follows) until the magical roadblock created by this spell is removed. If the target wizard fails his saving throw by 5 or more, he also suffers the effects of a *close path* spell affecting the same path for the remainder of the day. 

The seal on the chosen path can only be removed by a *break enchantment*, a *limited wish*, *miracle*, or a *wish* spell.

The scroll used as a material component is consumed in the casting.

**Burn Path** (necromancy)

**Level:** Wizard (path) 8

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of beaten gold inscribed with the formula for the spell that serves as the path’s starting point; this special scroll costs no less than <sup>3</sup>,000 gp)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One wizard

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** Will partial; see text

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

This powerful destructive magic destroys all knowledge a wizard has of one path chosen by the caster. The spells and formulas are all instantly forgotten, memorized spells vanish from the victim’s mind, and all spells on that path must be relearned as if the victim never knew them.

The spell’s effect cannot be reversed, but if the target’s saving throw succeeds, the path is merely sealed as per a *seal path* spell.

The scroll used as a material component is consumed in the casting.

**Path Masters**

A wizard’s expertise with any given path improves if he has mastered the path. To become a master of a path, a wizard must know every single spell available to him in that given path—that is, every spell of a level he can cast. So long as he retains mastery, the master casts all of those spells more effectively. The benefits of mastery are simple: his spells gain a +1 saving throw modifier, a +1 bonus per die of damage, and range, duration, and area of affect are all as if the path master were one level higher than his actual level. He loses mastery only if he chooses not to learn a spell of that path when he gains an experience level, if he fails his roll to learn a spell of the path, or if he chooses to forget or skip a spell.

A wizard may only master a number of paths equal to his Intelligence modifier plus 1. If he fulfills all the requirements for mastery in more than one path, the player chooses which paths he has mastery over. The wizard may switch his choice of mastery at the start of each day when he chooses the paths he will use for that day.

**Wiping away paths**

As an optional rule, paths that a wizard ignores may atrophy because the skills required are not kept up. Here’s the formula: If a wizard has not learned any new spells in a path by the time he finishes the experience level when two or more new steps have become available to him, his skill in that path stalls at the lowest level required to cast the spells he does know.

For example, consider a wizard following the Stone Road who has attained 7th level—the point at which he becomes able to cast a fourth-level spell. If that wizard has not learned the third-level spell *Maximillian’s stony grasp* or either of the fourth-level spells *stoneskin* or *dig* by the time he reaches 8th level, his progress on that path is forfeited, and thereafter he casts *fist of stone* and *Maximillian’s earthen grasp* (the first- and second-level spells on the path) as if he were only a 3rd-level wizard (since he has contented himself with casting only first- and second-level spells from the path). If a third step of spells becomes available and is ignored (*wall of stone* or *stone shape* in this example), the path is entirely forgotten.

**Lost paths**

The DM may designate one or more paths as lost, meaning that they are not available to most wizards. Paths named after famous wizards or monsters are especially good for this. Recovering and restoring such a path may become an adventuring goal for player characters.

Furthermore, particular settings may require their own paths: the provinces of sand, sea, flame, and wind in the AL-QADIM® setting certainly can be the basis of several good paths, because the elemental magics of that setting are even more carefully defined and interwoven than in the core rules (see “Customized campaign paths” below). The genies’ paths can easily be constructed using less common spells, and elementalist characters will appreciate these paths as well.

In a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, the spells of the many powerful wizards should serve as starting points for paths: Elminster’s, Snilloc’s, and the Simbul’s magics are all unique. These paths are given below as examples, but many others could be made to suit individual tastes and the needs of powerful wizard characters and the DM’s wishes for a campaign. Bigby’s, Leomund’s, and Mordenkainen’s paths are surely more common in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK® setting—where they were invented—than anywhere else.

These individual variations are always up to the DM.

**Sample lost paths**

**Path of the Drow, or Lolth’s Road, or Spider Road:** spidereyes <sup>1</sup>, spider climb <sup>1</sup>, darkness 15’ radius <sup>2</sup>, skyhook <sup>2</sup>, web <sup>2</sup>, dark wings <sup>3</sup>, hand of darkness <sup>3</sup>, infravision <sup>3</sup>, passweb <sup>5</sup>, summon spider <sup>6</sup>, vipergout <sup>6</sup>, death spider <sup>8</sup>, black blade of disaster <sup>9</sup> 

**Snilloc’s Path:** Snilloc’s snowball <sup>1</sup>, Snilloc’s snowball storm <sup>2</sup>, Snilloc’s major missile <sup>5</sup>

**Simbul’s Path:** hypnotize <sup>1</sup>, forget <sup>2</sup>, suggestion <sup>3</sup>, the Simbul’s synostodweomer <sup>7</sup>, steal enchantment <sup>7</sup>

While path magic is intended for a traditional fantasy setting, it isn’t limited to that style of play. Sure, the lost paths of Toril could include the Road of Southern Magic of the Old Empires, or the magic of the elves of Evermeet, or the lost magic of Myth Drannor, or the forbidden fire magics of the Red Wizards of Thay. But much more exotic roads can be created if there are wizards willing to walk them. The dragons of Athas surely have their own powerful magics of desert survival. The PLANESCAPE setting could easily have Roads of Law and Chaos, and a Road of the Abyss. Each world will have its own magical traditions and cultures, but the pattern and system of magic presented here can readily be adapted to suit your preferences. Experiment!

**Inherited magic**

For long-term campaigns or for developing campaign history, players and DMs may want to consider making magic inheritable, that is, making certain families known for having an aptitude for certain forms of magic. Though this doesn’t reveal exactly what spells an NPC wizard has on hand, it does give player characters a general idea of what they can expect-in this sense it functions as a mechanic that presents a sort of NPC reputation to the players. For example, it allows characters to learn a great deal about potential allies or enemies by knowing something about the character’s ancestors (“Old Zeb, sure, he’s the son of Zackary, who was the son of Geoffry. Everybody knows they’re all enchanters, councilors, divining, and dragon wizards.“) At the DM’s option, bards or PCs with Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (local) may know the origin, ancestry, and genealogy of many of the paths of power, giving the PCs a valuable clue about what they may be up against. Although this might seem like an unfair advantage, the knowledge cuts in both directions. After all, these rules are meant to encourage players and DMs to act more like the wizards of fantasy literature do.

Player characters may be the sons and daughters of well-known lineages, the offspring of a wizard’s house, with all the expected wizard’s blood and wizard’s gifts. As a result, players may be reluctant to reveal their true names to strangers for fear of giving valuable information about the character’s skills: and isn’t that what fantasy wizards are all about?

**Creating new paths**

Players will soon want their characters to create spell paths of their own, but this is a difficult undertaking for any but the most powerful wizards. To create a new path, a PC wizard must list all the elements for the path, that is, all the spells that would comprise it—and the character must be able to cast all of them. The elements of the list must have some common bond: a certain school of magic, the form that the spells all take, their function, the spells’ inventor, or the like. If the DM approves, the wizard can begin researching.

The cost of “path research” is the total number of spell levels in the path times 1,000 gp, and the time required is one week per each spell level in the path. The percentage chance of success is the wizard’s level plus his Intelligence, minus the number of spell levels on the road. For example, if an 11th-level wizard with Int 18 attempted to create a Path of Ice using the Snilloc’s spells (eight total levels),* ice storm*, and *wall of ice* (both fourth-level spells), the total levels would be 16, the cost would be 16,000 gp, the total time required would be 16 weeks, and the chance of success would be 11 + 18 - 16 = 13%.

Researching paths is a chancy business at best, but a wizard can keep trying over and over until he runs out of money.

Usually, a wizard will invent a new path only to accommodate newly researched spells; most new spells can simply be assigned to existing paths based on similarity (for instance, a new series of skiing, water walking, and airwalking spells might require a new path). This does not mean that the newly researched spell is immediately available to all other wizards; paths are a traditional series of spells, and wizards learn of these newly researched spells only slowly, as their inventor and his guild popularize the spells involved. Eventually, when the spell is widely known, it is adopted as part of the path. By then, the inventor is usually long dead.

**Customized campaign paths**

As samples of detailed, specialized paths for a campaign, examine the following lists for the AL-QADIM setting and the multiple paths for the necromancer. The Arabian Adventures rule book describes the category of universal spells; these spells are included in the paths presented earlier in this article, as are the more general spells from the Complete Sha’ir’s Handbook.

The core rule books provide a limited selection of necromantic magic, but with the details from the Complete Book of Necromancers and the necromantic spells of the Forgotten Realms Adventures and Complete Sha’ir’s Handbook expansions, NPC necromancers gain a much broader selection of spells—and correspondingly broader paths of power.
