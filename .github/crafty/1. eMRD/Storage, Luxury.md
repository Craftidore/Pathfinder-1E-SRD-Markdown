# Storage, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 3,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One clerk

This marble-floored room includes well-built shelves and fine-quality cabinets. An overstuffed chair in the center allows you to sit in comfort while the clerk or other servants retrieve desired goods. The clerk here serves as a quartermaster and inventory manager. The area has about 3,000 cubic feet of usable storage space. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.

You can turn a storage space into a vault with the addition of safeguards such as watchmen, strong walls, traps, locks, and wondrous architecture.
