# Manipulator School
## Overview
**Manipulator School**

**Associated School**: Enchantment.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the dazing touch and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

**Beguiling Touch (Sp)**: You can charm a living creature by touching it. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you. Creatures receive a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their save are affected by *charm monster* for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

**Shape Emotions (Su)**: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to either ward off or welcome emotional influence for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. If you choose to ward, you and your allies within this aura receive a +4 morale bonus on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects, and any fear effects targeting you or your allies are reduced by one step (shaken has no effect, frightened becomes shaken, and panicked becomes frightened). If you chose to enhance emotional inf luence, enemies within the aura receive a â€“2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
