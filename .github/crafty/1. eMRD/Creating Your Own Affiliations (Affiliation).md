# Creating Your Own Affiliations (Affiliation)
## Overview
To create your own affiliation, follow these steps:

(1) Devise a concept, name, symbol (if desired), and background.

(1a) Create information (if desired) pertaining to members, enemies and allies, and secrets of the affiliation.

(2) Choose your affiliation’s type and category.

(3) Choose its scale.

(4) Select the affiliation score criteria.

(5) Create the titles held by members and select the benefits and duties that accompany each title.

(6) Choose the executive powers available to the leader or leaders of the affiliation.

Keep in mind that creating your own affiliation is a bit like creating a new magic item and pricing it; tweaking is sometimes necessary. While these rules can be used like a cookbook to combine ingredients and make a decent product, there is always room for extra flavor. Astute readers will notice that the sample affiliations do not always follow this process in lockstep. You are encouraged to modify your affiliations as desired, and your DM is encouraged to allow for it, so that they fit your game and campaign world as well as possible.

As discussed, affiliations bring many new aspects to your game. As you’re working through your creation ideas, don’t forget that many of them can be enriched even further if other people at the table are doing the same with affiliations of their own. Friendly rivalries between affiliations can provide great motivation and background for adventure.

**CONCEPT AND BACKGROUND**

It is most helpful to devise a general concept for your affiliation at the outset. Will it openly rule in an area, or will it act behind the scenes? Are its members, assets, or abilities clandestine or hidden? Does it have a specific creed or objective? The answers to these questions help direct your creative efforts and make the affiliation more coherent and real.

Beyond a general concept, the extent of your affiliation’s background is entirely up to you. Indeed, the extent of what’s known about your affiliation is as broad as your imagination. The following topics can be considered when devising your affiliation. They might be set at the outset. Alternatively, you can move on to the other creation steps after only jotting down a few notes about your concept. Further details can be left for the end of the creation process, or for description and evolution during game sessions.

The example affiliations described earlier in this chapter make up a varied collection, yet they barely scratch the surface of what sorts of affiliations you can create for yourself. Each piece of information that can be part of an affiliation’s description is discussed below.

**Name:** The name of your affiliation could be descriptive of its interests or concerns, or it could be a “false front” hiding its true agenda. It could be complex, legalistic, or long-winded, evincing an effort to impress or awe the general populace. Or it might be short or obscure, requiring a certain level of inside information to understand its true meaning.

**Symbol:** Design your affiliation’s symbol (if you want it to have one), bring it to the table, and place it near your character sheet whenever affiliations are involved in play.

**Motto:** Perhaps everyone in your affiliation shares a battle cry, or perhaps they intone the same blessing before every sunset. (The example affiliations in this chapter have no mottoes, so you can come up with one you like if you want to use an affiliation “out of the box.”)

**Background, Goals, and Dreams:** Just as your character is motivated by his past and driven to his future, so should your affiliation be. Did it start in the slaughterhouse of Bravik, only to become a powerful mercenary company scourging the hinterlands? Did it once rise to dominate the city’s arcane society, only to be shattered by the demons it once commanded? Does your affiliation want to merge with another affiliation? Destroy one? Draft the king’s niece into its ranks?

**Enemies and Allies:** You might choose one or two affiliations, races, regions, or creature types that your affiliation cannot abide. Perhaps your affiliation wants to expunge them from the earth, feels snubbed by them at court, or was almost exterminated by them after a mass immigration from another continent. In combat, members of the affiliation attack these enemies preferentially, and in parley, they bait and insult them. The opposite applies to those creatures of individuals you choose as allies. They should be given aid and succor where possible, and you should expect similar treatment in return. Some information on how this relationship came about, what the degree of cooperation is, and how steadfast the relationship is would be useful as well.

**Members:** Name some of the other people in your affiliation. Identify the leader, his or her subordinates, and the rivals vying for position within the affiliation. You might consider, with the DM’s permission, co-opting several previously existing NPCs from the campaign to be members of your affiliation. Think about how your affiliation treats ex-members (if it tolerates them at all).

**Secrets:** The byzantine politics of some affiliations afford them ample opportunity to gestate a tangled mass of secrets. If you like, choose one or two secrets for your affiliation. Share them with your DM, but only give hints about them within your party. Then, at an opportune time, unveil the secret. Perhaps your order is more ancient than anyone guesses, and under another name it founded the ruined castle you are now exploring—only your order’s motto will activate the *magic mouth* on the nether cyst below the throne room. Perhaps you’ve been hinting at surprise allies, and when you reach the vampire’s manse, you tap on the portcullis to summon the beast’s apothecary, who is actually a spy for your guild.

**TYPE**

Choose your affiliation’s type: business, cabal, college, druid circle, fighting company, government, spy ring, temple, thieves’ guild, or tribe. This selection affects the executive powers available to the affiliation’s leaders.

Some concepts might be difficult to define neatly. A group of related individuals (tribe) might be engaged in a profitable enterprise (business) selling illegal goods (thieves guild). However, for the purpose of executive powers, you’ll need to set one type as the affiliation’s primary focus.

**CATEGORY**

Decide whether your affiliation is a racial one or a social one, and include “(racial)” in the Type entry of the affiliation description if appropriate. (The concept you create could dictate which category the affiliation belongs in.)

**SCALE**

Choose your affiliation’s scale in conjunction with your Dungeon Master. Table 7–1, below, provides guidelines. As a general rule, the scale of an affiliation is an indication of how high up the ladder of infl uence it can rise. For instance, a scale 12 affiliation could obtain an audience with the king; a scale 8 affiliation probably has the count’s ear; a scale 3 affiliation might get a hasty hearing by the local burgomaster on a slow day.

The exact meaning of scale could vary from affiliation to affiliation, however. For example, an affiliation does not necessarily need to be scale 19 to have influence on the Outer Planes. Take a cabal of scale 6—it has infl uence throughout a roughly city-sized area or population. This city might be the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, and the cabal’s scale might be explained by the fact that it is extremely secretive and almost unheard by the general population on its home plane.

You must have the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat to found an affiliation. If you do so, it normally begins at scale 1. Campaign circumstances might dictate otherwise, however, so you should consult with your Dungeon Master.

**Table 7–1: Affiliation Scale**


| **Scale** | **Scope of Influence** | **Examples** |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Neighborhood | Bakery, druid hermit |
| 2 | Neighborhoods | Crossroads tavern |
| 3 | City quarter | Small abbey, small nomadic tribe |
| 4 | City quarter | Bank, slaughterhouse, barbarian trading post |
| 5 | City | Arena, pirate ship, githzerai rrakma |
| 6 | City | City watch, wild elf tree tribe |
| 7 | City and outliers | Large college, tyrant wizard in tower, death slaad commanding a populous gnoll tribe |
| 8 | City/county | Frontier fort, druid sect |
| 9 | Regional/barony | Small castle, established church |
| 10 | Regional/march | Minor nobility, powerful guild |
| 11 | Multiregional/duchy | Nobility, established knightly order, dread pirate fleet |
| 12 | Multiregional/kingdom | Standing army, orc hordes led by legendary chieftain |
| 13 | Multiregional/kingdom | Vast army raised to fight off and vassal states the tarrasque |
| 14 | Continental/seafaring kingdom | Centuries-old large kingdom, illithid underground nation |
| 15 | Continental/empire | Emperor and his legions, circle of archmages |
| 16 | Multicontinental/empire | Imperial legions with arcane and divine support |
| 17 | Global | Ancient order of epic-level knights |
| 18 | Astral Plane | Githyanki incursion force |
| 19 | Multiplanar | Armies in the Blood War between demons and devils |
| 20 | Cosmos | Epic-level affiliations, hero-deities |

**AFFILIATION SCORE CRITERIA**

Affiliations measure a member’s value by a number of factors. Some are baseline: If a character is not of the proper religion, nationality, race, alignment, class, or other nature, his affiliation score is irrelevant (absent special dispensation from the leadership). First, decide if your affiliation enforces any such prerequisites.

Other than baseline criteria, numerous other aspects of a character are considered when awarding benefits and status in a group. For your affiliation, choose up to thirteen of the criteria listed on Table 7–2.

A social affiliation can (and usually does) have some negative criteria—characteristics or accomplishments that reduce a character’s affiliation score instead of increasing it. As a rule of thumb, select one negative criterion for every positive criterion beyond the fifth one you choose (six positive and one negative, seven positive and two negative, eight positive and three negative, or nine positive and four negative).

For the most part, racial affiliations do not have negative criteria; once you’re in a racial affiliation, you have to do something pretty outrageous to lower your status in the group—and such lowering is usually accomplished by simply kicking you out of the group.

Because it is easier to move up in the ranks of a smaller affiliation than a larger one, the base modifiers given on Table 7–2 must be adjusted according to the affiliation’s scale. The base modifiers given are for affiliations with a scale of 1 to 7. For affiliations of scale 8 to 14, divide the modifiers given by 2. For affiliations of scale 15 to 20, divide the modifiers given by 4. The minimum impact of a criterion after modification is 1/2.

**TITLES, BENEFITS, AND DUTIES**

Fill in titles as you wish for affiliation scores of 4 through 30. In general, each ranking covers a range of six points of affiliation score, but variances are common. Often it is easier to move through the lower ranks than the upper.

Choose three to five benefits from Table 7–3 for your affiliation. If you choose more than three benefits, it’s a good idea to choose one duty (so that members don’t get too many benefits without having to do something to earn them). If you choose four benefits, you should select one duty, and if you choose five benefits, you should select two duties.

Not all the benefits and duties detailed in the example affiliations appear in Table 7–3. You and your DM should feel free to devise your own benefits and duties, using the ones given here as guidance.

| Monument—your affiliation, a grateful populace, or a coterie of rich, adoring sycophants erect an obelisk, a dolmen garden, or a statue in your honor, granting you a +2 bonus to your Leadership score and a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when dealing with people who have seen your monument |
| Personal honor guard of 4–12 appropriate creatures (EL 12) |
| Form friendship with head of allied affiliation (often a creature of CR 10 + 1/2 scale) |
| Ancient advisors—the spirits of the former affiliation heads are trapped within will-o’-wisp-like glowing balls on the Wisp Crown, a symbol of your office; three times per day you can use the Wisp Crown’s ancient advisors to grant you a +6 insight bonus on any Appraise, Decipher Script, Knowledge, Sense Motive, or Use Magic Device check |
| Claim audience with a rival (but not enemy) affiliation head within 1d4 weeks once every three months |

| Must defeat a CR 13 creature in single combat |
| Mutiny—succeed on DC 15 Diplomacy check once per month or face mob/challenger (EL 12) |

**EXECUTIVE POWERS**

affiliation leaders wield executive powers to accomplish many tasks on a grand scale. Generally, a leader must have an affiliation score of 30 or higher in order to gain the authority necessary to exercise these powers.

Choose three executive powers for your affiliation from among those described below. The executive power descriptions limit certain powers to certain affiliation types. This was done to balance out the value of the various types. You are free to ignore those restrictions if your campaign or storyline dictates otherwise.

Some of the abilities encompassed by executive powers are only used if you are playing with dynamic affiliations (using the rules for capital, violence checks, espionage checks, and negotiation checks).

Assassinate: Your affiliation can retain the services of an assassin (or send one of its own). The level of the assassin is equal to 1/2 the affiliation’s scale (minimum 1; maximum 10 + 1/2 its scale). Because it takes time to prepare a strike, an assassin can be assigned one mission each three months. You could resolve the results of an assassin strike using normal D&D rules, or you might decide to resolve things “offstage.” In the latter case, make an opposed espionage check against the victim’s affiliation (or against the victim’s Spot check, if he has no affiliation). If you succeed, the assassin penetrates your target’s counterinfiltration measures and strikes. The victim must succeed on a Fortitude save against the normal DC for the assassin’s death attack or perish.

Cabals, druid circles, governments, spy rings, temples, and thieves’ guilds can retain assassins.

**Beatify:** The deeds of a saint are to those of an ordinary man as the clouds are to the earth. Serene, high, and aloof, the saints move through our world, and yet seem not wholly a part of it. Your affiliation has the power to declare someone a potential saint; someone who is beatified gains the title Blessed or Hallowed. A living creature who is beatified gains a +2 sacred bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks when dealing with other members of her faith. When she casts a *cure* spell on a member of her own faith, she adds her Wisdom bonus to the amount cured (maximum bonus equal to the spell’s level).

Druid circles and temples can beatify a creature.

**Craft:** Hammers ring on anvils, saws hum through wood, and kraken-ink quills scratch on half-petrified calf vellum at your affiliation’s headquarters. Your affiliation is adept at producing valuable items. It can craft any masterwork item or magic item from the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* with a market price of up to 2,000 × the affiliation’s scale. This item belongs to the affiliation, but you can borrow it according to the benefits of your title in the affiliation description. Mobilizing the affiliation in this way is a big job; to do so requires either an expenditure of 1 capital or a successful negotiation check (DC 15 + 1 per 2,000 gp value of the item) to bargain with supply and labor vendors. The process of crafting is not quick; you must wait 1–2 months to receive the item. During this time your affiliation is free to engage in other actions.

Businesses, cabals, druid circles, colleges, temples, and tribes can craft items.

**Crusade:** Your affiliation can declare a crusade. You designate an enemy and attempt a Diplomacy check (DC 20 + scale of target affiliation, or DC 20 + level of target creature). If you succeed, your followers martial their resources and travel any distance to attack the offending blasphemer. If the target is an affiliation, make opposing violence checks. If your affiliation is successful, an opposing affiliation loses 1 capital. If the target is an individual, he must make a Fortitude save (DC equal to your violence check result). If the target fails, he perishes under your affiliation’s righteous onslaught. 

If you wronged an enemy affiliation by prying out the ruby eyes of its sacred idol, selling the head of its demon guardian at auction, or rescuing a screaming sacrifice from its altar, your rival might retaliate by targeting your character with an unholy crusade. Your DM might set aside the normal Fortitude save and choose to play out an encounter. In that case, you will be set upon by creatures appropriate to the rival affiliation, with an EL equal to 10 + your opponent’s violence bonus.

Each month that it crusades, an affiliation loses 2 capital due to the cost of the ongoing operations. 

Fighting companies, temples, and tribes can crusade. A crusade can target an individual, business, college, fighting company, government, temple, or tribe. Spy rings, druid circles, cabals, and thieves’ guilds are too elusive for such punishment.

**Excommunicate:** You might instruct your affiliation to shun an individual or an entire group. No cleric of your affiliation will help an excommunicated creature or a member of an excommunicated affiliation. If the excommunicated creature fails a Will save (DC 10 + the scale of your affiliation), your edict is so strong that for a period of 1 year, the subject cannot benefit from a divine spell cast by anyone with an alignment descriptor in common with those of your church. For example, if a lawful good church of Heironeous excommunicates a creature and it fails its save, the creature cannot benefit from divine spells from a caster who is either lawful or good.

Druid circles, temples, and tribes can excommunicate individuals.

**Gift:** Your affiliation might bestow a valuable gift when it matters most. After receiving a gift, the mercenary company sends extra troops, the temple sends its *staff of life* along with the bishop, and the thieves guild doesn’t pickpocket your members on the way back from the tavern. When your affiliation sends a gift to someone, you or an agent of your affiliation receives a +4 competence bonus on your next Diplomacy check involving the recipient of the gift.

Alternatively, when your affiliation sends a gift to an appropriate organization, it secures a +2 competence bonus on its next violence, espionage, or negotiation check, provided the attempt is undertaken within 2 months of the gift. For example, a gift to a fighting company could secure a bonus on your next violence check.

Businesses, colleges, governments, and temples can send gifts.

**Harvest:** The wisdom or savvy of your affiliation’s leader allows your members to work the land to your advantage, coaxing crops from grudging soil or teasing out precious metals from jealous rock. When your affiliation uses the Harvest power, make a DC 20 Appraise check. If your result is between 21 and 30, each member of the affiliation receives gold (your share is 50 gp × the affiliation’s scale), and the affiliation itself enjoys a +1 circumstance bonus on all violence, espionage, and negotiation checks for the next 2 months. If your result was over 30, you can choose the above benefits, or your affiliation can gain 1 capital.

Businesses and tribes can harvest.

**Holiday:** Your affiliation has the power to declare holidays. These holidays can be perennial (Angels Day, Wyrm Waking Day, Feast of the Chapeaux of St. Cuthbert) or one-day events marking grand occasions (the dauphin’s wedding day, the triumph over Snurre and the hill giants, the arrival of the Duke of Brass’s ambassador). Any citizen in a land celebrating the holiday, and any member of an affiliation observing the holiday, gains a +1 morale bonus on all attacks, saves, and skill checks during the day. No more than one holiday per month can be declared.

Druid circles, governments, and temples can designate holidays.

**Inquisition:** With the ringing of the steeple bells, your holy organization declares a hunt for blasphemers. Designate one target affiliation. Throughout your area of infl uence, that affiliation falls under the shadow of suspicion.

On an individual level, members of the targeted affiliation are harassed by dedicated inquisitors. For each day they spend in the lands of the inquisition, they must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your affiliation’s scale) or be fatigued.

On an affiliation level, suspected groups are forced to curtail some activities and conceal others. The target of an inquisition must succeed on an opposed espionage check or be unable to use any executive power requiring a violence or negotiation check during the next month.

Maintaining an inquisition is expensive and interferes with day-to-day activities. Each month when you conduct an inquisition, you must succeed on an opposed negotiation check with the local government or lose 2 capital. 

Druid circles and temples can press an inquisition. Individuals, businesses, colleges, fighting companies, governments, temples, and tribes can be targeted. Cabals, druid circles, spy rings, and thieves’ guilds are too elusive for persecution. 

**Law:** Your affiliation can write and enforce law throughout its domain. You might outlaw arcane or divine casting, concealed weapons, magic items, gnomes, or anything else you desire. If an object or practice is outlawed, anyone caught using it, engaging it, or being it is fined or jailed, as you decide. Penalties beyond a fine of 100 gp × your scale are rare.

An individual can attempt a Disguise check (DC equal to your espionage check result) to engage in an outlawed practice with impunity. If you outlaw an affiliation, it goes underground and takes a –2 penalty on all checks until it relocates or the ban is lifted. A banned affiliation has a maximum capital of 1.5 × its scale, and it is exterminated if its capital reaches 0.

Particularly outrageous laws could require your affiliation to present the plan persuasively to your countrymen; a Diplomacy check (DC 20 + scale) is required to accomplish this.

Your affiliation can also make a law requiring certain tasks of citizens in your area. If all citizens are required to undergo martial training, each adult militia member in your lands gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, and your government as a whole gains a +1 competence bonus on violence checks. If you require all citizens to be literate, local civil servants are recruited from a more knowledgeable populace and your government gains a +1 competence bonus on negotiation checks. If you require all citizens to participate in a state religion or a state industry, every citizen gains at least 1 rank in Knowledge (religion) or Profession (relevant industry), and a +1 competence bonus on checks made using that skill. If you raise taxes to an extraordinary level, you have a 25% chance of gaining 1 capital each month. Other requirements and benefits are possible; consult with your Dungeon Master. Requirements demand a citizen’s time and energy, however, and only one such requirement can be in place at a time (establishing a new requirement counts as the affiliation’s use of executive power for that month). Requirements are also oppressive—your affiliation’s leader must make a DC 30 Diplomacy check or reduce his affiliation score by 1 each month that the requirements are in place.

Normally, only governments can set laws. If there is no government in a region, druid circles or temples might enforce scripture as law.

**Mint:** Your affiliation stamps its leader’s face on coins and issues them as currency. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate and Diplomacy checks with money-using creatures in lands where the coins circulate. The awe inspired by such a powerful act might shake your foes’ resolve; anyone who confronts you in battle and has used your coins spends the first round of combat shaken (no save). You also receive free meals and free stays in inns or roadside houses with a DC 5 Diplomacy check.

Governments can mint coins, and if the government allows it, businesses can do so as well.

**Pariah:** Through rumor, propaganda, forgeries, and lies, you portray an individual as anathema to his affiliation. You spread tales of priests slaughtering innocents, of businessmen squandering riches on games of knucklebones, of soldiers plotting sedition. This causes the individual to be outcast from his affiliation. The target’s affiliation score drops to 0 temporarily, during which time he has no access to any affiliation benefits, funds, items, or abilities.

Your affiliation must succeed on an espionage check or negotiation check opposed by the individual’s Diplomacy check to make the rumors stick. If the individual exercises executive power within his affiliation, he can add his guild’s negotiation bonus on his Diplomacy check as a competence bonus.

Each month, the pariah can attempt to clear his name by making the same opposed check. When he succeeds, the record is finally set straight, and the sheep-faced members of his affiliation welcome him back with his full affiliation score restored. A pariah who has cleared his name cannot be again outcast from his guild with the pariah power for 1 year plus 1d12 months.

Cabals, spy rings, and thieves guilds can declare a member to be a pariah.

**Plague:** Filth fever, centipede swarms, corn blight, a rain of shocker lizards—all these are examples of plague. When your affiliation plagues a land or another affiliation, each affected person must make a Will save (DC equal to your violence check result) each day of the month. Failure imposes a –1 penalty on all saving throws for that day. Any leader of a plagued affiliation must make a Diplomacy check (DC equal to your violence check result) with the members of his affiliation any time he wants to use an executive power; failure means that he is powerless in the face of the plague and his affiliation score decreases by 1.

Druid circles, temples, and tribes can bring a plague. Businesses, colleges, druid circles, fighting companies, governments, temples, and tribes can be targeted by a plague. Cabals, spy rings, and thieves’ guild are too small and too diffuse to be affected by a plague.

**Plunder:** Treasure is the goal, and speed is the means. When your affiliation plunders an area, you are not attempting to damage it permanently only to add to your own wealth. When your affiliation launches a plundering attack, make an opposed violence check. If successful, you gain gold and gems; your share of the loot is 100 gp × your affiliation score. The enemy has a 1 in 6 chance of losing 1 capital as a result of your plundering; your affiliation has a separate 1 in 6 chance of gaining enough treasure to increase its capital by 1.

Fighting companies, governments, spy rings, thieves’ guilds, and tribes can plunder. Only businesses, colleges, governments, and temples can be plundered.

**Raid:** A raiding party seeks to deal as much damage as possible and escape unscathed. Make an opposed violence check with the target affiliation. If your check is successful, the opposition suffers the loss of 1 capital. If unsuccessful, your raiding party has been trapped in the enemy’s territory. Make opposed espionage or negotiation checks to either sneak or talk your way home. Failure indicates that the raiding party perishes and your affiliation loses 1 capital.

Cabals, druid circles, fighting companies, governments, spy rings, thieves’ guilds, and tribes can stage raids. 

**Research:** Gathering information is the raison d’etre for spy rings and colleges, but it is useful for other affiliations as well. When your affiliation conducts research, you can make an arcane discovery or unearth information about your enemies.

Your affiliation can research any arcane spell. The leader must pay the market price of a scroll of that spell in seed money for the research. In 1d4 months, your affiliation produces a scroll of the researched spell.

Your group can also research opponents. Against any NPC who has been researched, you and other members of your affiliation gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls in the first round of combat (after that, the NPC realizes you are anticipating his moves and switches tactics).

Finally, research can be conducted on an enemy affiliation. Your group gains a +2 insight bonus on its next violence, espionage, or negotiation check against that affiliation.

Cabals, colleges, and spy rings can conduct research.

**Shadow War:** Your affiliation stalks the alleys, the underpasses, the rooftops, and the dark copses on the edges of country lanes. From concealment you strike, and to concealment you return. When engaged in a shadow war, your affiliation makes an opposed espionage check against your target. If your check fails, your target exposes your affiliation before it can strike, and your affiliation takes a –2 penalty on negotiation checks for the next month. If your check succeeds, your shadow strike is true. If your successful check result was 10 or lower, your enemy affiliation’s internal structure is disrupted, and it takes a –2 penalty on violence, espionage, and negotiation checks for the next month. If your successful check result was between 11 and 20, the opposition’s command and control structure is paralyzed, preventing any affiliation member from using any benefits for the next month. If your successful check result was higher than 20, your opponent loses 1 capital.

Cabals, druid circles, spy rings, and thieves’ guilds can start a shadow war.

**Terrorize:** Skull flags on the horizon, ominous drums along the mountains, illusions cast on pillows that cackle suddenly to life and screech out bloody warnings when the target lies down to bed—all these are techniques used by your affiliation to strike terror in the hearts of individuals and other groups.

Your affiliation can speak eloquently to the victim, threatening violence, or it can swing for the kneecaps and actually provide the violence. A terrorized individual must make two Will saves (DC equal to your violence or negotiation check result). If she succeeds on both, there is no effect. If she fails one, for the next month she is shaken in the first round of combat when fighting a member of your affiliation. If she fails both, for the next month, she is frightened of any member of your affiliation and fl ees at the first opportunity. 

Your group can also attempt to terrorize an enemy affiliation. To do so, make an opposed negotiation or violence check (depending on how you would like to deliver the threat). If your affiliation wins, the opposing affiliation cannot use any executive powers during the next month.

Even the worst atrocities become commonplace if repeated too often. An individual or affiliation cannot be targeted for terrorism more than one month out of every four.

If your affiliation succeeds on an opposed espionage check before terrorizing another affiliation, the victim does not know who terrorized it.

Cabals, druid circles, fighting companies, governments, spy rings, thieves guilds, and tribes can terrorize. Cabals, druid circles, spy rings, and thieves guilds cannot be terrorized.

**Trade:** Commerce is the life blood of business, and it can provide a much-needed infusion of capital for other affiliations as well. When your group trades, choose one friendly affiliation. Each organization gains 1 capital. Make opposed negotiation checks; whoever wins has a 1 in 6 chance of gaining 1 additional capital.

Alternatively, your affiliation’s trade connections can help an individual entrepreneur. If your affiliation’s trading facilities are put at the disposal of an individual, he gains a +4 competence bonus on Appraise checks and a +2 competence bonus on any Diplomacy checks that involve trade for 1 month.

Lastly, a trading network can provide rumors of exotic items. Make a DC 20 negotiation check. If it succeeds, a seller has been located who possesses a wondrous item determined randomly from those described in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* (50% chance for a minor item, 30% chance for a medium item, 20% chance for a major item; roll on Table 7–27, 7–28, or 7–29 as appropriate). Because of your trading connections, you have a percentage discount equal to your affiliation’s scale should you purchase the item. For example, if you belong to an affiliation with a scale of 12, you would receive a 12% discount on the purchase.

Only businesses and colleges can instigate trades, but any other type of affiliation can be the other partner in a transaction. 

**War:** Fires sweep the rooftops, and the plains shake under the boots of marching troops. War means many different things depending on your campaign, but two results are constant. First, throughout your affiliation’s sphere of infl uence, prices double. This price increase affects everything from adventuring equipment such as 10-foot poles and scrolls of *lesser restoration* to mundane items such as livestock and food. It applies both to purchases and to crafting expenses, including item creation costs.

Second, whenever a PC attempts to contact an NPC who resides in the area ravaged by war, the NPC must make a DC 12 Fortitude save. Failure means the NPC has perished in the war. Your DM might make this check once per month for other important NPCs she deems at risk, regardless of whether anyone attempts to contact them.

Every month that your affiliation is at war, the war effort decreases its capital and its enemy’s capital by 1. Additionally, make opposed violence checks. The loser suffers an additional loss of 0–2 capital (roll 1d6; 1–2 = 0, 3–4 = 1, 5–6 = 2).

Your DM might have an NPC-controlled affiliation declare war. If two governments exist in the same territory, they must go to war until one perishes (even if war is not an executive power possessed chosen by either government). A wise affiliation keeps its warchest well stocked with ingots; poor affiliations are ripe targets for conquest.

Fighting companies, governments, and tribes can start a war. War can be waged against a college, fighting company, government, temple, or tribe. Cabals, druid circles, spy rings, and thieves guilds are too elusive. Businesses are mobile enough to avoid war, but can be outlawed by governments. If a business is outlawed, however, it simply turns to the black market (see the law executive power).

**EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULES**

If your concept for a new affiliation doesn’t mesh neatly with the guidelines for creating your own affiliation, don’t let the guidelines keep you from doing what you want (within reason, of course).

In particular, several of the affiliations presented earlier in this chapter don’t rigidly follow the guidelines concerning executive powers, so they can serve as examples of exceptions to the general rules.

The Caravan of Shadows is a business that has the executive powers pariah and shadow war, both of which are not normally available to businesses—but they work well in the context of this affiliation’s concept.

The Chalice is a fighting company that has the inquisition executive power—a justifiable exception for a group of holy crusaders.

Dragon Island is a government affiliation that has four executive powers rather than the usual three, reflecting the overall power not only of the affiliation but of its highest-ranking members.

The leaders of the Wintervein Dwarves have access to the craft executive power, which is not normally available to a fighting company—but for a fighting company of dwarves, it makes perfect sense.
