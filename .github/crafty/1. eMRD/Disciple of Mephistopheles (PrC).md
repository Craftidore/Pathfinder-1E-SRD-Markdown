# Disciple of Mephistopheles (PrC)
## Overview
“Mephistopheles, Lord of Hellfire and Duke of Brimstone, I call upon you in your fiery elegance. I pledge myself to you, rightful King of Hell. One day your dark power will reign supreme.”

—Nhagruul, hellfire master

The disciple of Mephistopheles wields hellfire as his weapon, striking down all who oppose him. He focuses on all things fire-related, as is fitting with the preoccupation of the archdevil he serves.

Clerics, wizards, and sorcerers are the most frequent converts to Mephistopheles, although virtually any class can learn to wield the deadly power of hellfire.

Disciples of Mephistopheles

are equally comfortable

alone or in gatherings:

covens of evil schemers

and destructive megalomaniacs.

Although the company

of devils is pleasant,

disciples of Mephistopheles

just as frequently find

themselves among hell

hounds, salamanders, and

other evil fire creatures.

Fire giants often attempt

to become disciples of

Mephistopheles.

Hit Die: d8.
