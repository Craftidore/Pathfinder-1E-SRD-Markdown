# Weapons
## Overview
From the common longsword to the exotic dwarven urgrosh, weapons come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target’s AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon’s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon’s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).

**Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons:** Anybody but a druid, monk, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons possessed by their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

**Melee and Ranged Weapons:** Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

*Reach Weapons:* Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren’t adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder’s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.

*Double Weapons:* Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaves, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see page 202 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

*Thrown Weapons:* Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn’t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn’t have a numeric entry in the Range column on Table 6–4), and a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

*Projectile Weapons:* Blowguns, light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, halfling sling staves, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it’s a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he uses a bow or a sling.

*Ammunition:* Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), darts (for blowguns), or sling bullets (for slings and half ling sling staves). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons on page 149 of the *PF Core Rulebook*), and what happens to them after they are thrown.

**Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons:** This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon’s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

*Light:* A light weapon is used in one hand. It is easier to use in one’s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and can be used while grappling (see Chapter 8 of the *PF Core Rulebook*). Add the wielder’s Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or half the wielder’s Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder’s primary hand only.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.

*One-Handed:* A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it’s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his Strength bonus if it’s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls.

*Two-Handed:* Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character’s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

**Weapon Size:** Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.

A weapon’s size category isn’t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon’s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

*Inappropriately Sized Weapons:* A creature can’t make optimum use of a weapon that isn’t properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn’t proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.

The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder’s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon’s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can’t wield the weapon at all.

**Improvised Weapons:** Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

## Weapon Qualities
**Weapon Qualities**

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table 6–4).

**Cost:** This value is the weapon’s cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as a scabbard or quiver. 

This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.

**Dmg:** These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon’s extra attack. Table 6–5 gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.

**Critical:** The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.

Extra damage over and above a weapon’s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

*×2:* The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.

*×3:* The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.

*×3/×4:* One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

*×4:* The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

*19–20/×2:* The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

*18–20/×2:* The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

**Range:** Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.

**Weight:** This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon’s description for details.

**Type:** Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

**Special:** Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.

*Brace:* If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character (see Chapter 8 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

*Disarm:* When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.

*Double:* You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A double weapon can be wielded as a one-handed weapon, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

*Monk:* A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows (see Chapter 3 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

*Nonlethal:* These weapons deal nonlethal damage (see Chapter 8 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

*Reach:* You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe.

*Trip:* You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.

### Laminated Steel Weapons
***Create Laminated Steel weapons:*** Another special type of weapon can only be created by weaponsmiths wilh at least 12 ranks of [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (weaponsmith) skill. This type of weapon is created using a special forging process, where multiple layers of steel are interspersed with layers of a softer, more pliable metal, such as nickel. These layers are then welded and folded several times. Each fold doubles the number of layers in the steel, until they are practically microscopic. The end effect is a weapon that is both flexible and extremely hard. The soft metal provides the flexibility, and the steel provides the hardness. When the steel is polished and given its edge, the grinding reveals a distinctive wood-grain like pattern in the metal created by the dozens of layers. This process not only increases its durability but also its slicing power, because the numerous micro-thin layers create an invisible serrated edge.

This can be done with any type of slashing or piercing weapon. Weapons must be created with this method; they cannot be modified once they have been forged. The exception to this are the spells *[[Masterwork Transformation (Spell)|masterwork transformation]]**,* *[[Fold Steel (Spell)|fold steel]]**,* and *serration.*

**Benefits of a Laminated Steel Weapon:** A laminated steel weapon gains +1 to all its damage rolls and its critical hit multiplier goes up by one as well. For example, a laminated steel longsword deals 1d8+1 damage and has a x3 critical hit multiplier. Furthermore, the weapon gains +5 to its normal hardness.

**Creating Laminated Steel Weapons:** You can create a laminated steel weapon with a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (weaponsmith) check if you have at least 7 ranks in the skill. To create a laminated version of a weapon in the table below, you create the laminated steel component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The laminated steel component has its own price (900 gp) and DC (23). Once both the standard component and the laminated steel component are completed, the item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the laminated steel component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the price of the raw materials.)

However, creating a laminated steel weapon is more difficult and delicate than other special types. Any errors result in a complete loss of raw materials and time spent. If the check to create the laminated sreel component of the weapon fails, the entire process is a complete loss, and you must start completely over.

**TABLE 6-8: LAMINATED WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Slashing)** | **DC (Piercing)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 | 20 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 | 23 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 20 | 25 |

Metals other than steel have been known to be worked using the same process, especially [[Mithral|mithral]] and [[Adamantine|adamantine]]. Using an alternate metal increases both the cost (use new metal cost) and difficulty (+5 for [[Mithral|mithral]], +10 for [[Adamantine|adamantine]]).

### Serrated Weapons
***Serrated Weapons:*** A special type of edged weapon can be forged by a skilled weaponsmith, similar to masterwork weapons, wherein the blade of the weapon is serrated to increase its cutting power. This can be done with any type of slashing or piercing weapon. Weapons must be created with a serrated edge; they cannot be modified to have a serrated edge once they have been forged, because doing so would destroy the integrity of the steel.

**Benefits of a serrated weapon:** A serrated weapon has its critical hit threat range increased by +1. For example, a serrated longsword has a critical threat range of 18-20, instead of 19-20.

**Creating Serrated Weapons:** You can create a serrated weapon with a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] ·(weaponsmith) check. To create a serrated version of a weapon in the table below, you create the serrated component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The serrated component has its own price (300 gp) and DC (20). Once both the standard component and the serrated component are completed, the serrated item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the serrated component is one-third of the given amount, just as iti s for the price of the raw materials.)

**TABLE 6-9: SERRATED WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Slashing)** | **DC (Piercing)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 12 | 17 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 | 20 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 | 23 |

**Combining Special Weapon Types**: You can combine the effects of masterwork, serrated, and laminated steel. Treat each special type as its own component that must be created separately. Add the extra gold piece cost of each type separately and multiply that by the total number of components. For example, if you wish to create a masterwork serrated laminated steel longsword, the cost would be increased by masterwork (+300), serrated (+300), and laminated steel (+900) times 3. The result would be a masterwork longsword with a hardness of 15, 1d8+1 damage, critical threat range of 18-20, and x3 critical damage multiplier, for 4,545 gp.

Note that the serrated or laminated steel weapon qualities must be added to the masterwork weapon quality.

## **Size Changes, Effective Size Changes, and Damage Dice Progression: I'm confused by how to increase and decrease manufactured and natural weapon damage dice when the weapon's size or effective size changes. There's a bunch of different charts, and I'm not sure which to use.**
When the damage dealt by a creature’s weapons or natural attacks changes due to a change in its size (or the size of its weapon), use the following rules to determine the new damage.

• If the size increases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and increase the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Small or lower (or is treated as Small or lower) or the initial damage is 1d6 or less, instead increase the damage by one step. 
• If the size decreases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and decrease the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Medium or lower (or is treated as Medium or lower) or the initial damage is 1d8 or less, instead decrease the damage by one step. 
• If the exact number of original dice is not found on this chart, apply the following before adjusting the damage dice. If the damage is a number of d6, find the next lowest number of d6 on the chart and use that number of d8 as the original damage value (for example, 10d6 would instead be treated as 8d8). If the damage is a number of d8, find the next highest number of d8 on the chart and use that number of d6 as the original damage value (for example, 5d8 would instead be treated as 6d6). Once you have the new damage value, adjust by the number of steps noted above. 
• If the die type is not referenced on this chart, apply the following rules before adjusting the damage dice. 2d4 counts as 1d8 on the chart, 3d4 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d4. 1d12 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d12. 
• Finally, 2d10 increases to 4d8 and decreases to 2d8, regardless of the initial size, and so on for higher numbers of d10.

## **Size increases and effective size increases: How does damage work if I have various effects that change my actual size, my effective size, and my damage dice?**
As per the rules on size changes, size changes do not stack, so if you have multiple size changing effects (for instance an effect that increases your size by one step and another that increases your size by two steps), only the largest applies. The same is true of effective size increases (which includes “deal damage as if they were one size category larger than they actually are,” “your damage die type increases by one step,” and similar language). They don’t stack with each other, just take the biggest one. However, you can have one of each and they do work together (for example, *[[Enlarge Person (Spell)|enlarge person]]* increasing your actual size to Large and a bashing shield increasing your shield’s effective size by two steps, for a total of 2d6 damage).
