# C02 Stronghold Components
## Overview
Now that you’re familiar with the basics of designing a stronghold, it’s time to go over the vast variety of different components that you can use to fill up your stronghold, to turn it from a listed number of stronghold spaces into a real building.

You can add extras to any component. Extras have costs and prerequisites just like components, but they don’t take up stronghold spaces because they fit inside the rooms of the stronghold (such as protective sigils) or they stand outside (such as moats).

**COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS**

The remainder of this chapter consists of the descriptions of various components you can build into your stronghold. Your choice of components dictates the purpose of your stronghold, whether it’s a military fortress, palatial home, or arcane nexus.

Components use the following format.

**Name:** The name of the component. Each component’s name is unique so that you can distinguish them.

In the title text for each section in this chapter, component names are listed by their major function first, such as “bedroom suite.” If they have a modifying tag, such as “Luxury,” which follows the main name, separated by a comma ([[Bedroom Suite, Luxury|bedroom suite, luxury]]). The text uses the full name of the component (such as “[[Bedroom Suite, Luxury|luxury bedroom suite]]).

This makes it easier to look up the various components when you’re hunting through this book for them. In addition, because the components are listed alphabetically, it leaves the variations on each component together in the text. That way, you don’t have to flip pages to see how a [[Bedroom Suite, Basic|basic bedroom suite]] compares to a [[Bedroom Suite, Luxury|luxury bedroom suite]].

**Size:** The number of stronghold spaces that the component takes up. This usually ranges from 0.5 to 2 but could theoretically go higher. Remember, a stronghold space averages 4,000 cubic feet or 400 square feet, given a 10-foot-high ceiling.

**Cost:** Each component has a cost associated with it, listed here in gold pieces.

**Prerequisites:** Some components have prerequisites, which include other components or staff. For example, if you want a dining hall, you must have a kitchen. If you have a kitchen large enough to require servants, you must have servants (purchased as an extra below) and have [[Servants' Quarters|servants’ quarters]].

Some prerequisites state that you must have a certain component “or better.” That means you must purchase either the listed component or a component of the same type but higher quality. For example, if you need a library, the [[Library, Fancy|fancy library]] or [[Library, Luxury|luxury library]] also satisfies the prerequisite.

## Building Up and Down
**Building Up and Down**

The component costs assume you’re constructing a stronghold with no more than two stories and no more than a single underground level (basement). If you want spaces whose floors are more than 10 feet above-ground level (that is, three or more stories above ground) or more than one level below-ground, there’s a surcharge. Note that it doesn’t matter how deep your subterranean layers are, though DMs should feel free to adjust these prices for extraordinary circumstances. Just because the table doesn’t list a cost adjustment for building 1,000 feet below the surface doesn’t mean that such construction always costs the list price. Costs below are per space.

Note that some spells can reduce the cost adjustment for constructing taller strongholds. See Table 1–5 for more information.

**Table 2–2: Height and Depth Adjustments to Cost**


| **Height** | **Depth** | **Cost Adjustment per Space** |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 10 feet up (first two stories) | First subterranean layer | none |
| 20 feet up (third story) | Second subterranean layer | +400 gp |
| 30 feet up (fourth story) | Third subterranean layer | +1,000 gp |
| 40 feet up (fifth story) | Fourth subterranean layer | +2000 gp |
| 50 feet up (sixth story) | Fifth subterranean layer | +3000 gp |
| Each additional +10 feet | Each additional subterranean layer | Add 1,500 gp to adjustment |

## Clusters
**Clusters**

Clusters represent collections of components grouped together and given a single price for your convenience. You can use them to quickly create a stronghold for use in your game.

**Table 2–3: Sample Clusters**


| **Cluster Name** | **Cost** | **Staff** |
|---|---|---|
| [[Army Base\|Army base]] | 24,000 gp | Cooks (4), soldiers/guards (100) |
| [[Banquet Hall\|Banquet hall]] | 136,200 gp | Cooks (10), servants (5) |
| [[Cavalry Base\|Cavalry base]] | 40,000 gp | Cooks (4), grooms (16), soldiers/guards (100) |
| [[Guard Tower\|Guard tower]] | 1,300 gp | Guards (6) |
| [[Inn]] | 13,050 gp | Cooks (2), grooms (2), servants (2) |
| [[Inn, Dockside\|Inn, dockside]] | 12,550 gp | Cooks (2), groom, laborers (2), servants (2) |
| [[Prison Complex\|Prison complex]] | 10,500 gp | Cooks (4), guards (20), torturer (1) |
| [[Residential, Basic\|Residential, basic]] | 12,000 gp | Cooks (2) |
| [[Residential, Fancy\|Residential, fancy]] | 66,400 gp | Cooks (2), servant |

| [[Temple]] | 14,900 gp | Acolyte |
| [[Wizard's Research\|Wizard’s research]] | 16,900 gp | Alchemist, apprentice spellcaster |

## Walls
Walls are a part of any stronghold, although you can choose wooden walls in aboveground structures or hewn stone walls below ground at no extra cost. In general, you pick both an interior wall type and an exterior wall type, and pay for each proportionately.

Figure out what percentage of interior walls and exterior walls you have according to the following table. Floors and ceilings count as interior walls.

**Table 2–4: Interior and Exterior Walls**


| **Stronghold Size,** | **Percentage of Interior and** |
|---|---|
| **in Spaces** | **Exterior Walls** |
| 1–5 ss | 20% interior, 80% exterior |
| 6–10 ss | 30% interior, 70% exterior |
| 11–20 ss | 40% interior, 60% exterior |
| 21–45 ss | 50% interior, 50% exterior |
| 46–120 ss | 60% interior, 40% exterior |
| 121–450 ss | 70% interior, 30% exterior |
| 451–3,800 ss | 80% interior, 20% exterior |
| 3,801+ ss | 90% interior, 10% exterior |

Decide what kind of exterior wall you want. The exterior walls for your stronghold cost a number of gold pieces equal to your stronghold size in spaces × material cost per space × exterior wall percentage.

After you assign and price your exterior walls, follow the same procedure for your interior walls. Interior walls cost a number of gold pieces equal to your stronghold size in spaces × material cost per space × interior wall percentage.

If you want to be clever, you can split things up. If you have a two-story castle, you can assign half your walls as masonry (the ground floor) and half as wood (second floor), and price accordingly.

If you want a single room that’s unusually strong, figure out how much it costs by noting what percentage of the total stronghold that particular space is, then paying for that.

**Adamantine:** Adamantine represents a step up from mithral in hardness, hit points, and break DC, though its price limits its use to only the most important walls.

*HP:* 40 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 34 + 2 per inch of thickness.

**Bone:** This jumble of bone grants a permanent *desecrate* effect (as the spell cast by a 5th-level cleric) in each stronghold space made of it. Bone walls often add the magically treated augmentation (see Augmentations, below). Treat bone as stone for the purposes of blocking *detect* spells and the like.

*HP:* 5 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 11 + 1 per inch of thickness.

**Deep Coral:** Underwater builders can shape this species of coral into vast palaces beneath the waves. It automatically repairs 1 point of damage every minute. Treat deep coral as stone for the purposes of blocking *detection* spells and the like.

*HP:* 15 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

**Earth:** Typically found as part of primitive strongholds or as an extra layer sandwiched between stone or masonry walls (to increase the overall thickness of the wall at a low cost).

*HP:* 10 per foot of thickness; *Break DC:* 10 + 3 per foot of thickness.

**Glass:** Most glass walls add the magically treated augmentation (see Augmentations, below), in order to be effective. Glass doesn’t block *detect* spells and the like.

*HP:* 1 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 15 + 1 per inch of thickness.

**Ice:** Strongholds made of ice are only viable in arctic climates or when protected from heat by an appropriate *elemental protection* augmentation (see Augmentations, below). Ice doesn’t block *detect* spells and the like.

*HP:* 3 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 15 + 1 per inch of thickness.

**Iron:** Walls of iron provide decent protection for vital areas at a reasonable price.

*HP:* 30 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 21 + 2 per inch of thickness.

**Living Wood:** This specially bred wood, found in elven forest strongholds, regrows quickly if damaged. It repairs 1 point of damage every round. Treat living wood as wood for the purposes of blocking *detect* spells and the like.

*HP:* 10 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 14 + 1 per inch of thickness.

**Masonry:** The typical secure stronghold has walls of masonry: stones piled atop one another and usually held in place with mortar. Superior masonry walls have tighter-fitting stones and less cracking, making climbing them difficult. Reinforced masonry walls include iron bars on one or both sides of the wall, or placed within the wall itself to strengthen it. Treat any form of masonry as stone for the purposes of blocking *detect* spells and the like.

*HP:* 15 per 2 inches of thickness (masonry and superior masonry), 15 per inch of thickness (reinforced masonry); *Break DC:* 23 + 1 per inch of thickness (masonry and superior masonry), 33 + 1 per inch of thickness (reinforced masonry).

**Mithral:** Harder than iron, some stronghold builders use mithral to protect their most secure areas (such as treasuries).

*HP:* 30 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 29 + 2 per inch of thickness.

**Obdurium:** This incredibly rare and hard metal represents the pinnacle of nonmagical wall strength. Treat weapons and armor crafted from obdurium as adamantine, except for hardness (30), hit points (60 per inch of thickness, or twice as many hit points as a typical item), and price (twice the listed price for adamantine).

*HP:* 60 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 48 + 4 per inch of thickness.

**Stone:** Generally, only underground strongholds use hewn stone walls because of the high price for that quantity of stone.

The price for unworked stone actually reflects the difficulty in finding natural caverns of the right size and shape. If you have already located the desired caverns, you need pay only 100 gp per stronghold space (for minor reshaping).

*HP:* 15 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

*Wall of Force:* Resistant to all but a few forms of attack, *walls of force* represent the ultimate in stronghold defense. Of course, the spell’s lack of versatility limits its usefulness, since you can’t put doors or windows in a *wall of force*.

*HP:* n/a; *Break DC:* n/a.

**Wood:** Though uncommon in dungeons, wooden walls are common in aboveground structures (particularly those not intended to withstand attack).

*HP:* 10 per inch of thickness; *Break DC:* 14 + 1 per inch of thickness.

## Freestanding Walls
A freestanding wall is any wall that isn’t part of a stronghold component. You must purchase, modify, and augment freestanding walls separately from your stronghold components. They tend to be much thicker due to the lack of structural support found in a more complex structure.

Sometimes, stronghold builders construct freestanding walls (also called curtain walls) after the stronghold is already in place, whether to guard against unwanted visitors or simply to add privacy.

Some older strongholds add a freestanding wall due to population growth beyond the stronghold’s ability to house them. In fact, in older cities or towns that once began as much smaller strongholds, you might find several rings of freestanding walls encircling the original stronghold and everything that has grown out of it over the years. In other cases, a common wall going around them both or simply attaching the two, leaving a common courtyard between them, might unite two strongholds.

Occasionally, a group of allied adventurers build separate strongholds for each member, then combine funds to build a freestanding wall to surround them all. In this way, they share the costs of the wall and sometimes even the guards that watch over it, agreeing to come to the mutual defense of their fellows.

**Building Freestanding Walls**

You can purchase any freestanding wall in multiple units. The wall sections on the table below are assumed to be 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide each. See the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* for more on how the different kinds of walls work in the game. Freestanding walls are cheaper than those inside a stronghold because of the greater ease of building in the open, with fewer considerations of engineering and design.

If you want to build freestanding walls higher than 10 feet, you must add an extra layer of thickness to each lower 10-foot layer on the stack. This addition is cumulative; for example, a 20-foot tall wall of masonry has a single 2-foot thick layer for the top 10 feet and a double-thick (4 feet) layer for the lower 10 feet, while a 30-foot-tall masonry wall would be 2 feet thick at the top (one layer), 4 feet thick in the middle (two layers), and 6 feet thick at the bottom (3 layers). The accompanying illustration shows examples of masonry and hewn stone walls of 10-foot, 20-foot, and 30-foot height, indicating the number of layers required.

You can purchase freestanding walls of different thicknesses than those noted in Table 2–6. Simply multiply the cost by the fraction of thickness you choose. For instance, a 3-foot-thick freestanding wall of hewn stone costs only 40 gp per section, while a 12-foot-thick freestanding wall of hewn stone costs 160 gp per

section.

**Using Freestanding Walls**

Military structures, such as barbicans, guard posts, towers, and drawbridges can be placed adjoining a freestanding wall. For the purposes of designing your stronghold and calculated the costs of walls, these castle components should be calculated as independently, as tiny independent strongholds.

**Specialized Wall Sections**

Walls are generally sheer structures that grow thinner as they grow taller, thanks to the need for a thick, stable base. However, most stronghold builders have walls that are customized for defense.

*Crenellation*: The most common customization to a wall, this notched battlement is made up of alternate crenels (opening) and merlons (square sawteeth). They provide cover to castle defenders standing upon the wall. No cost exists to carve merlons into the top feet of a wall.

*Machicolation:* Adjusting a wall’s design so that a section extends outward beyond the exterior edge of the wall provides a point at which defenders can drop arrows, rocks, flaming oil, or other unpleasantries upon those assaulting the wall directly below. To construct a machicolation, the wall must be at least 15 feet in height. The wall sections to be extended cost twice the listed price; see Windows below for pricing arrow slits.

*Parapet:* If defenders have sufficient width to walk along the wall’s top (preferably 5 feet, but as little as 2 feet can suffice), it’s common to build a wall-walk (also known as an allure). This wall can be made out of any substance as a freestanding wall that crowns the rest of the wall. Another choice is to construct a wooden platform to act as a wall-walk. Braced with beams on the inner wall, cost it as if an additional wooden wall for whatever length of the freestanding wall you wish to equip with the wall-walk. You need not construct a thicker wall base to support the wall-walk.

**Layered Walls**

You can pick more than one material for your walls by simply noting both and adding the material costs together. This method is good for two things: extra thick walls (pick the same thing twice), and composites (a layer of iron over hewn stone).

When building a tall freestanding wall, you can substitute other materials (such as packed earth) for the extra layers required; however, these layers must be at least as thick as the layer of material they replace (which may require extra layers). For instance, if you replace a layer of hewn stone with packed earth, you must use a full 6-foot thickness of packed earth (which is actually the equivalent of two standard layers of packed earth). See Figure 3 for an example of a 30-foot-tall freestanding wall of hewn stone with a packed earth core (layers 2 and 3).

### Wall Cross-Sections
![[Wall Cross Sections.PNG|Wall Cross-Sections|300]]
[[Wall Cross Sections.PNG|open outside]]

**Lead-Lined Walls**

Adding a thin layer of lead has no effect on a wall’s statistics (hardness, hp, break DC, climb DC), though it will block detection spells and other effects blocked by this material. This costs 1,000 gp per stronghold space (or per 1,600 square feet of freestanding wall) so protected.

## Wall Augmentations
**Wall Augmentations**

You can augment walls by adding these effects to them. Unlike the wall materials above, they don’t support weight by themselves. You can’t build a castle of “magically treated,” for example. It must be magically treated something.

Some augmentations only affect exterior or freestanding walls. In this case, even though you pay for an entire stronghold space to be augmented, the augmentation does not affect any interior walls.

Unless otherwise stated, any wall’s augmentation also applies to any doors, windows, or other accessways through that wall. You can leave such items out of its effects, though their area still counts toward the limit of the augmentation’s effect. In other words, you can’t increase the augmentation’s effective area by leaving out doors or windows.

Unless specified otherwise, you can apply more than one augmentation to your walls. For augmentations that only affect a single side of the wall, you can augment both sides by purchasing the augmentation twice.

As magic items, augmented walls gain a saving throw against any spells that could affect them, with the save bonus equaling 2 + half the caster level of the magic reinforcing the wall. In the case of a wall with multiple augmentations, use the highest caster level to determine the save bonus.

**Disabling Wall Augmentations**

Remember that augmentations are essentially magic items, and magic exists through which their effects can be temporarily suppressed (such as *dispel magic*) or permanently disjoined (such as *mage*’*s disjunction*). Treat each stronghold space of augmented wall (or each 800 square feet, for freestanding walls) as a separate magic item for this purpose.

As stationary magic items (see Wondrous Architecture, below), wall augmentations can be discovered by a rogue (or other character capable of finding traps) and deactivated with a Disable Device check. The DC for both Search and Disable Device checks is equal to 25 + the spell level of the highest-level spell used in the creation of the wall augmentation. If a wall has multiple augmentations, each one must be discovered and disabled separately. A successful Disable Device check against a wall augmentation suppresses the magic properties (just as if you had successfully cast *dispel magic* against the item)of a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall for 1d4 rounds. If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you suppress the magic properties for 1d4 minutes instead.

## Doors, Windows, and Locks
**Doors, Windows, and Locks**

The *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* describes the various kinds of doors available. Each space in your stronghold comes with two simple wooden doors for free. You don’t have to use them all if you don’t want to. In fact, it’s your option if you even want to have the doorway installed. Door prices listed below don’t include a lock (see Locks, below, for prices).

**Table 2–8: Doors**


| **Door Type** | **Game Information** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|
| Door, simple wooden | 1 in. thick, hardness 5, 10 hp | 10 gp |
| Door, good wooden | 1 1/2 in. thick, hardness 5, 15 hp | 20 gp |
| Door, strong wooden | 2 in. thick, hardness 5, 20 hp | 40 gp |
| Door, stone | 4 in. thick, hardness 8, 60 hp | 300 gp |
| Door, iron | 2 in. thick, hardness 10, 60 hp | 500 gp |
| Door, secret (Search DC 20) | as normal for door type | +100 gp |
| Door, secret (Search DC 25) | as normal for door type | +150 gp |
| Door, secret (Search DC 30) | as normal for door type | +200 gp |
| Door, secret (Search DC 35) | as normal for door type | +300 gp |
| Portcullis, wooden | 3 in. thick, hardness 5, 30 hp | 400 gp |
| Portcullis, iron | 2 in. thick, hardness 10, 60 hp | 750 gp |
| Drawbridge, wooden | 6 in. thick, hardness 5, 60 hp | 1,000 gp |
| Drawbridge, iron | 4 in. thick, hardness 10, 120 hp | 1,500 gp |

**Windows**

Windows are essentially holes in the wall, so they have no inherent cost. Each space in your stronghold comes with a simple shuttered window for free. You don’t have to use them all if you don’t want to. The price for a window doesn’t include a lock (see Locks, below, for prices).

Table 2–9: Windows


| **Window** | **Stats** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|
| Shutters, simple | 1 in. thick, hardness 5, 10 hp | 5 gp |
| Shutters, good | 1 1/2 in. thick, hardness 5, 15 hp | 15 gp |
| Iron bars | 2 in. thick, hardness 10, 60 hp | 60 gp |
| Glass | 1/8 in. thick, hardness 1, 1 hp | 10 gp |
| Arrow slit | Provides 9/10 cover | 30 gp |
| Stained glass, fancy | 1/8 in. thick, hardness 1, 1 hp | 600 gp |
| Stained glass, deluxe | 1/8 in. thick, hardness 1, 1 hp | 3,000 gp |

**Locks**

In general, iron locks have a hardness of 15 and 30 hit points. A mithral lock has hardness 20 and 30 hit points and costs five times as much as a typical lock. An adamantine lock has hardness 25 and 40 hit points and costs 10 times as much as a typical lock.

**Table 2–10: Locks**


| **Lock** | **Disable** <br>**Device DC** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|
| Simple | 20 | 20 gp |
| Average | 25 | 40 gp |
| Good | 30 | 80 gp |
| Superior | 40 | 150 gp |
| Amazing | 50 | 300 gp |

## Staff
**Staff**

Most strongholds require at least a few staff members, and many others have added dozens if not hundreds of soldiers and artisans. Table 2–11: Typical Staff Members describes the types of hirelings you’ll most likely need, along with their primary skills and skill modifiers (and key abilities), typical class (staff members are 1st level unless otherwise noted), and monthly wage. A typical staff member has a 12 or 13 in the key abilities for his skills (included in the skill modifiers listed).

You will undoubtedly find the need to hire staff members that aren’t described on this table. Use this information as a guide when determining appropriate numbers for any hireling not listed here. The *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* has more information on hirelings.

Many of the components have staff members as prerequisites. The smithy, for example, requires one smith. If you have a character with Craft (weaponsmithing), you can satisfy this prerequisite yourself. If you anticipate hiring a smith later, it’s okay to build the smithy now, even if you can’t fire it up until then.

In general, strongholds don’t have upkeep costs because D&D is about adventure, not balancing the castle’s monthly checkbook. One exception does exist to the no upkeep rule: staff wages. Add up the costs of your stronghold’s staff, and that’s the amount you have to pay each month to keep the stronghold running.

**Table 2–11: Typical Staff Members**


-tx-
| **Hireling** | **Primary Skills and Modifiers (Key Ability)** | **Class** | **Monthly Wage** |

| \*Cross-class skill. ||||
| \*\*Level 2. ||||

**Equipping Staff**

You only have to buy equipment for your military staff, using Chapter 7 of the *Player’s Handbook* to equip your soldiers however you like. You can use the following equipment clusters to arm your troops quickly.

**Archer:** leather armor, longbow, 20 arrows, dagger; 88 gp per person.

**Archer, horse:** light warhorse, studded leather armor, shortbow, 20 arrows, short sword; 216 gp per person.

**Cavalry, light:** light warhorse with studded leather barding, scale mail armor, large wooden shield, heavy lance, light flail; 315 gp per person.

**Cavalry, heavy:** heavy warhorse with chainmail barding, banded mail, large wooden shield, heavy lance, longsword; 1,292 gp per person.

**Infantry, light:** scale mail armor, large wooden shield, longsword; 72 gp per person.

**Infantry, heavy:** splint mail armor, large wooden shield, longsword; 222 gp per person.

**Guard:** chainmail, guisarme, heavy pick; 167 gp per person.

**Officer:** breastplate, large steel shield, longsword, dagger; 237 gp per person.

**Skirmisher:** studded leather armor, buckler, shortbow, 20 arrows, scimitar; 86 gp per person.

## Extras
**Extras**

Extras differ from components in that they a) don’t take up stronghold spaces, and b) don’t represent a mandatory or assumed element of a stronghold. Ranging from the mundane (such as siege weapons and traps) to the extraordinary (such as spells, magic items, and *portals*), the extras you select in construction help make your stronghold unique.

**Magic Items**

Beyond spells, many different magic items can make useful additions to your stronghold. This section describes a selection of the most useful of such items, along with notes on suggested stronghold uses. Each heading also includes the item’s price in gold pieces (in parentheses). For full descriptions of these items, check with your Dungeon Master.

This section only addresses each item’s utility in a stronghold setting. You can find full descriptions of these items in the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*. Market prices for each magic item are listed after their titles. Many of these devices are too valuable to leave in the hands of underlings, but desperate times—such as when your stronghold is under danger of imminent attack—call for desperate measures.

**Armor of Etherealness (varies)**

Enchanted armor of this variety allows the user to become ethereal once per day. This item provides a great way to get into secret areas, but since you had better have another way out. Otherwise, you’re stuck for a day while the armor “recharges.”

**Bag of Devouring (15,500 gp)**

Although normally considered a cursed item, a *bag of devouring* can be extremely handy in a stronghold—as a means of waste disposal. It makes an excellent means of getting rid of kitchen scraps, human and animal body waste, and just about anything else.

Two tricks exist with such an item. First, don’t overfill it. The *bag* eats when it wants to, and you can’t force it.

Second, don’t stick your hand in it—or any other body part, for that matter. Some stronghold builders set up their *bag of devouring* at the bottom of a narrow well capped with a grate to prevent any untoward accidents from happening with a hungry bag*.*

You can also use a properly prepared *bag of devouring* as a trap. When you know intruders are in your home, simply remove the grating over the top of the thing and toss a bar of gold or some other valuable item into its gullet. Assuming the bag doesn’t simply swallow the gold right away, the precious metal should provide bait that few invaders can resist.

**Boots, Winged (12,000 gp)**

While not as impressive as *wings of flying*, these boots don’t attract nearly as much attention. They also make it easy to get back and forth to airborne strongholds.

**Cloak of Etherealness (52,000 gp)**

This cloak allows you to become ethereal for up to a total of 10 minutes per day. This lets you move freely into rooms or stronghold spaces otherwise sealed off from the rest of the world. Used judiciously, you could base an entire stronghold on it, with few if any doors, using the cloak for those few moments when you need to pass through walls, ceilings, or floors.

Since ethereal characters can move vertically as easily as horizontally, these normally inaccessible rooms can be high in the air or buried deep beneath the earth. Either way, you can get to them easily.

**Daern’s Instant Fortress (55,000 gp)**

This wondrous item allows you instantly to set up a tower, essentially three stronghold spaces stacked atop each other. You can use *Daern’s instant fortress* as a stronghold all on its own, or as the basis of a larger stronghold. Simply attach other stronghold spaces to it as you desire. In fact, if you had four such fortresses, you could make each a corner of a much larger stronghold.

The only real downside is that you can’t repair a *Daern’s instant fortress* with anything less than a *wish* or a *miracle*.

**Decanter of Endless Water (9,000 gp)**

With a *decanter of endless water*, you have access to fresh water anywhere in your stronghold, no matter how far from a well. The decanter also proves invaluable for putting out fires, especially in its geyser mode. Most stronghold owners keep at least one *decanter of endless water* on hand for such emergencies. Wealthy landowners also use decanters to water their gardens and even to irrigate crops. Others use it to keep their moats fresh and full in the absence of a natural source of water for it. The device has no limits, so it can generate a theoretically limitless amount of water, enough to create a small stream.

The only real problem with a *decanter of endless water* is that many different people in the household will want it. It’s incredibly convenient in the kitchen or the laundry. Even the stable hands will want one to help tend to the horses. Of course, you don’t want to leave such powerful magic in the hands of just anyone. More than one stronghold has been flooded by a *decanter of endless water* that someone left running.

**Deck of Illusions (9,200 gp)**

If you want your place to look dangerous but you can’t stomach actually exposing your family and staff to such danger, a *deck of illusions* can come in handy. While the illusions generated by a *deck of illusions* are entirely random—you never know what you’ll get when you draw a card—they’re almost all useful as illusory sentinels. Best of all, these illusions last until they’re dispelled.

**Drums of Panic (30,000 gp)**

This item is a great device for your captain of the guard to leave with the commanding officer of each watch. It can scare off surprise attacks, giving your soldiers time to seal up the stronghold and prepare themselves for the oncoming assault.

The only real drawback is that they can scare people inside the stronghold as well. Still, that’s a small price to pay if the drums drive off invaders, even for a little while.

**Everburning Torch (90 gp)**

If you don’t mind your sources of *continual flame* looking like torches, this is a fine way to save money. These magic items actually cost 20 gp less than it would to have the *continual flame* spell cast on a torch.

**Eversmoking Bottle (5,200 gp)**

This magic item can help camouflage yourself and your friends. Most of the time, you won’t want to activate this until the enemy has come through the gates, giving those inside the stronghold who know its layout a great advantage over those who don’t.

The *eversmoking bottle* covers just over 400 square feet with smoke, about the size of a single stronghold space. A single item can’t obscure sight of most strongholds, although a strategically placed number of them working in conjunction might do the trick.

**Eyes of the Eagle (1,000 gp)**

These magic lenses are a great help for watcher on lookout, either in watchtowers or on the perimeter of your stronghold. A single set of lenses, shared among shifts, can dramatically increase your guards’ watchfulness. You can double the usefulness by splitting the set between two watchers, though guards must then cover the other eye, which isn’t very practical for long-term use.

**Figurines of Wondrous Power (varies)**

Most of these are useful in some way, but a few are particularly helpful. The various steeds allow a watcher in an outpost to be able to return to the main stronghold with news quickly, especially the *obsidian steed* (28,500 gp). The *silver raven* (3,800 gp) is a bit more reasonably priced and can ferry messages back and forth with excellent speed.

**Goggles of Night (8,000 gp)**

A watcher equipped with a set of *goggles of night* can go without a light source (and thus avoid making himself a target for those skulking in the darkness). The limited range of the darkvision (60 feet) does mean that you shouldn’t use this for long-range sentries.

**Helm of Teleportation (48,600 gp)**

This device can make it easy for the wearer to get around the most secret and sealed-off sections of any stronghold.

**Helm of Underwater Action (24,000 gp)**

If you have an underwater stronghold, you should consider having one of these on hand so that you can entertain air-breathing guests. Not everyone out there has gills, after all.

**Horn of Blasting (12,000 gp)**

This item is the perfect weapon to let loose from the ramparts of your stronghold at invaders laying siege.

**Horn of Fog (2,000 gp)**

A *horn of fog* works well to obscure the sight of your stronghold. It continues to spread an *obscuring mist* for as long as anyone blows on it. Theoretically, a team of big-lunged blowers could mask even the largest stronghold. The only drawback is the noise that the *horn of fog* makes, which can lead attackers directly to the horn blowers.

**Horn of the Tritons (15,100 gp)**

If you have an underwater stronghold, this device is a must, especially if you’re having problems with local creatures poking around your home.

**Ioun Stone (dark blue rhomboid) (8,000 gp)**

This *ioun stone* gives the user the Alertness feat. As with the *eyes of the eagle*, multiple shifts can share a single stone, maximizing its utility.

**Ioun Stone (iridescent spindle) (15,000 gp)**

This *ioun stone* sustains the user without air. If you have an underwater stronghold, this is great to have on hand for visitors—and it’s cheaper than a *helm of underwater action*.

**Immovable Rod (7,500 gp)**

For an interesting foundation, you can place your (small) stronghold upon a series of *immovable rods* placed at whatever height in the air you can reach. Each rod can support 8,000 pounds, so putting one at each corner of a stronghold space is enough to hold a space built of wood and most furnishings. Using heavier materials requires more *immovable rods*, which could prove financially untenable. Don’t overburden the rods, unless you want to risk a disastrous collapse.

Smart builders encase the rods in something substantial before the project gets too far along. After all, if anyone can come along and push the button to allow the rod to be moved again, the entire place it supports is in constant danger.

Unlike other floating strongholds, one based on a foundation of *immovable rods* cannot be moved about. Once a rod has been made part of a foundation, causing the rod to move in any way destabilizes the whole building. How drastically this would happen depends in part upon what rests upon the *immovable rods* and how many rods are in use.

**Iron Flask (170,000 gp)**

In a pinch, an *iron flask* can function as an expensive self-destruct system. Just leave one in a secret area, filled with a powerful creature. When an invader opens the *iron flask* without the command word, the creature will attack and likely destroy the stronghold and everyone in it.

**Lantern of Revealing (30,000 gp)**

This great tool allows your doorman to discern if any invisible (and unwelcome) visitors are lurking in the darkness. Placed at a guard post, it lets sentries spot any invisible intruders sneaking around.

**Lyre of Building (13,000 gp)**

The *lyre of building* provides you with a measure of free labor when constructing a stronghold. If you play it for 1 hour per week, it cuts the labor cost on your stronghold in half, which means your stronghold’s base price is 15% lower. If you succeed at the Perform check and play for an additional hour, all your labor is free, and thus your stronghold is 30% cheaper. Keep in mind that you can use this savings to reduce the build time instead if you like. It isn’t possible to reduce the stronghold price by more than 30% with a *lyre of building,* because much of a stronghold’s cost is in materials. The DM may choose to limit this item’s effectiveness in speeding along construction of wondrous architecture and other magical enhancements to the stronghold (since such items aren’t built by common labor).

Then, when the place is done, the *lyre of building* can help protect your investment from the most determined attackers. Strumming the lyre makes your stronghold (or at least all of it within 300 feet) immune to damage from any source—including attacks, spells, magic items, or anything else that might damage or destroy it—for 30 minutes. Of course, it doesn’t protect you or your guards, so it doesn’t replace good defenses.

**Mattock of the Titans (25,000 gp)**

While it might be the most expensive digging tool in the world, the *mattock of the titans* is perfect for clearing stone for your building project. Utilization of the mattock reduces the cost of any underground stronghold space by 5%.

It’s also the bane of a stronghold owner who thinks her place is impregnable.

**Mirror of Life Trapping (152,000 gp)** 

This expensive trap nonetheless proves effective against even the most dangerous creatures.

**Mirror of Opposition (92,000 gp)**

Another excellent but costly trap, this can help soften up the opposition.

**Murlynd’s Spoon (5,500 gp)**

If you find yourself under siege, this item can keep you and three other people fed indefinitely. If you can’t (or don’t want to) keep a cleric on staff, it’s the next best thing.

**Necklace of Adaptation (19,000 gp)**

This item is another excellent device to have on hand for visitors if you own an underwater stronghold.

**Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments (5,500 gp)**

This magic item is a great boon for those do-it-yourself owners who would rather not have anyone know about the secret doors and traps in their strongholds. You may not be able to build such things yourself by hand, but with the aid of *Nolzur’s marvelous pigments* you can create them after the workers have gone.

**Pearl of the Sirines (15,300 gp)**

Lend this item to guests in your underwater stronghold, and they can breathe and move about easily.

**Plate Armor of the Deep (16,650 gp)**

If you want to get around an underwater stronghold in style and you’re not a water-breather yourself, this is the preferred suit of armor. Not only does it offer protection from attacks, it keeps the pressures of the deep from crushing you like a tomato, and it allows you to breathe and talk underwater. Best of all, it’s easy to swim in.

**Quaal’s Feather Token (Bird) (300 gp)**

You can place this reasonably priced item in each of your outposts. Watchers there can use it to alert you to any encroaching threats.

**Quaal’s Feather Token (Tree) (100 gp)**

This token is of some great use if you’re trying to build a tree-house stronghold or if you want to do some quick landscaping.

**Ring Gates (40,000 gp)**

You can use these as a quick and useful message system between any two points up to one hundred miles apart. You could even string several together to form a relayed message system.

**Ring of Blinking (30,000 gp)**

Besides its obvious benefits in combat, a *ring of blinking* comes in handy if you want to step through walls into secret areas of your stronghold. This ring functions an unlimited number of times per day, allowing you to come and go as you please.

**Ring of Elemental Command (Earth) (200,000 gp)**

This item can be extremely useful when building your stronghold. The most important powers it grants are *soften earth or stone* (at will), *stone shape* (2/day), and *wall of stone* (1/day).

**Ring of Feather Falling (2,200 gp)**

If you spend most of your time in an airborne stronghold, you’ll probably want *winged boots* for yourself. If you can’t afford such swank footwear for your entire family and staff, the least you can do is hand out a few *rings of feather falling*. After all, one wrong step and it’s a long way down.

**Robe of Eyes (90,000 gp)**

Though fantastic for a guard, this item is probably too valuable to hand out to any common sentry. Still, if you happen to have one on hand, why leave it hanging in your closet while you sleep?

**Rod of Security (61,000 gp)**

This magic item lets you whisk away a number of people to temporary safety should invaders overrun your stronghold. The only downside is that you and your fellow refugees reappear in the same place when you return from the rod’s pocket paradise. If you can manage to hold out long enough, you may be able to return after the hubbub has died down and the invaders have either left or given up looking for you.

**Staff of Earth and Stone (85,000 gp)**

This staff allows you to use *passwall* or *move earth* for 1 charge each. The *move earth* spell can be useful during a stronghold’s construction. *Passwall,* on the other hand, can be used in place of a secret door to permit access to otherwise inaccessible, secret parts of your stronghold.

**Staff of Passage (180,000 gp)**

If you eliminate a number of doors in your stronghold for security purposes, this staff can help you move about the place freely, leaving others behind to wonder where you went and how you got there.

**Staff of Power (200,000 gp)**

Among its other powers, this staff can cast *wall of force* for 2 charges. See the descriptions in the earlier sections for how to best use this spell in your stronghold.

**Stone of Alarm (1,000 gp)**

This device works as a reasonably priced alarm. Some builders scatter them throughout the more sensitive areas of a stronghold, working them into the floors of the place. Since the *stone of alarm* need only be in contact with an item for the alarm to go off if the item is touched, builders often place them on the inside of doors and underneath chests, making them virtually impossible to detect by other than magical means.

**Stone Horse (10,000 gp)**

This statue is a great item to help run messengers to and from outposts, since it creates a tireless mount. It also makes a handsome statue to decorate any courtyard when not in use.

**Well of Many Worlds (82,000 gp)**

Use this amazing item as a last-ditch attempt to get away from a stronghold that has fallen to invaders. Alternatively, you can use the well as an entrance to your stronghold on another world.

The only problem is that moving the *well of many worlds* breaks the link between the your world and the alternate one, leaving anyone on the wrong side of the well trapped a long way from home. Consider pinning down your well with stones and mortar, making it look a lot more like a real well than its close cousin, the *portable hole*.

In any case, once you get the *well of many worlds* working the way you want it—going to the right place on the other end—take great pains to lock it away and pin it down. Otherwise, you may find it moved and the link to your ideal other world broken.

You must also watch for creatures coming through from the other side. It’s prudent to set many locks and alarms on both sides of the well.

**Wings of Flying (22,000 gp)**

Devices such as this are essential for getting back and forth to airborne strongholds. Sure, you could teleport or climb a rope ladder, but when you do it with wings, you do it with style.

Note that the price listed above is a correction to early printings of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*. Consider this as official errata for that product.

## Moats and Trenches
**Moats and Trenches**

The typical moat, listed in Chapter 5 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*, costs 50,000 gp. That gives you 500 linear feet of a channel 15 feet deep and 30 feet wide, with your choice of a wooden drawbridge or a permanent bridge of reinforced masonry.

If you want to customize your moat, build it in 10-foot linear sections. For each section, pay 100 gp for each 10-foot wide by 5-foot deep excavation. For example, a 20-foot-wide, 40-foot-deep moat costs 1,600 gp per 10-foot section.

The above costs assume normal earth. If your stronghold sits on particularly rocky ground, double the cost. If it sits on solid stone, multiply the cost by 5.

A typical bridge costs 5,000 gp. Table 2–8: Doors lists drawbridge prices. You can have water in your moat, or you can leave it as a dry trench.

## Mobile Strongholds
**Mobile Strongholds**

Another expense is necessary for strongholds magically designed to be mobile or capable of extraplanar travel. The most fantastic of strongholds, these incredible creations can take flight into the skies, sail across the seas, submerge below the oceans, or even tunnel down into the hard earth. Of course, such wonders are exceedingly rare, and with good reason. They don’t come cheap.

Much like the augmentations listed above, the cost for mobile strongholds depends on the size of the stronghold (in spaces). Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion and Table 2–13: Stronghold Mobility list a cost per stronghold space for the function selected.

In addition, you can build your stronghold so that it can move in nonstandard methods, including teleportation and planar travel. See Table 2–14: Stronghold Planar Mobility for the cost (also per stronghold space).

You can tie your stronghold’s mobility to a single object within the stronghold (which may be activated by anyone touching the object and uttering a command word), a location within the stronghold (which may be activated by anyone standing within the location and uttering a command word) or to a single creature within the stronghold (who can activate the movement from anywhere within the stronghold with a command word).

You can’t use Search to discover a stronghold’s mobility functions, nor will Disable Device have any effect on a stronghold’s mobility. *Dispel magic* or *mage’s disjunction* must affect or be cast separately on each space of the mobile stronghold to lose its mobility.

**Mobility Descriptions**

**Astral:** The stronghold can shift into the Astral Plane and back again. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), it cannot move once in the Astral Plane (though its occupants may exit and move about the plane).

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *plane shift; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.

**Burrowing:** This mobility function allows the stronghold to pass through earth and rock much like an earth elemental or phasing creature. The entire stronghold and every stronghold space must have this mobility function to allow movement through the normally solid substance. Unless it has immunity to fire, the stronghold cannot pass through magma or lava, and so it is limited to about fifty miles in depth and must avoid volcanic rifts. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), this mobility function has no effect.

*Caster Level:* 13th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *phase door; Market Price:* 10,000 gp.

**Crawling:** Strongholds that creep across the ground, sliding along rock and paving through forests, use this mobility function. A crawling stronghold can also move along a seafloor or continental shelf as long as the depth does not exceed 50 feet; in this case, making it airtight may be necessary to ensure the survival of its occupants. This cost notes the price of securing the stronghold components and reinforcing them. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), this mobility function has no effect.

The speed of a crawling stronghold is subject to the modifiers for terrain. See Table 9–5 in Chapter 9 of the *Player's Handbook.*

*Caster Level:* 13th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *augment object; Market Price:* 1,000 gp.

**Ethereal:** The stronghold can shift into the Ethereal Plane and back again. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), it cannot move once in the Ethereal Plane (though its occupants may exit and move about the plane).

*Caster Level:* 11th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *etherealness; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.

**Flying:** This function allows the stronghold to float adrift in the air, immune to the call of gravity. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), the stronghold floats and does not truly fly—in this case, the designer must, during construction, choose a fixed height from 10 feet to ten miles in altitude. If this mobility function is dispelled or destroyed somehow, the fortress slowly drops down to whatever surface lies below (as if under the effect of *feather fall*).

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *reverse gravity; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.

**Inner Plane-Linked:** The stronghold can shift to a specific location in one of the Inner Planes, determined at the time of the stronghold’s construction, and back again. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), it cannot move once in the Inner Plane (though its occupants may exit and move about the plane). In addition, this provides the stronghold with protection against any dangers posed by conditions within the plane, though this doesn’t extend to other, similar effects. For instance, while a stronghold linked to the Elemental Plane of Fire won’t suffer any damage from that plane’s conditions, it would suffer normal damage from a *fireball* or any other source of flame.

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *gate; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.

**Outer Plane-Linked:** The stronghold can shift to a specific location in one of the Outer Planes, determined at the time of the stronghold’s construction, and back again. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), it cannot move once in the Outer Plane (though its occupants may exit and move about the plane).

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *gate; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.

**Plane-Shifting:** The stronghold can shift from one plane to another as per the *plane shift* spell. As noted under the spell description, exact location within the target plane is impossible, and the stronghold appears 5–500 (5d%) miles from its intended destination. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), it cannot move once on the new plane (though its occupants may exit and move into the plane).

*Caster Level:* 15th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *plane shift; Market Price:* 25,000 gp.

**Sailing:** The stronghold floats as if naturally buoyant, and no natural force can bring the castle beneath the sea’s surface. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), the stronghold simply floats and does not actually sail under its own power (though currents will move it about). If this mobility function is dispelled or destroyed somehow, the fortress slowly sinks to the bottom of whatever body of water it sails upon.

*Caster Level:* 11th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *water walk; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.

**Shadow-Shifting:** By infusing the walls with umbral ichor (found in pools on the Plane of Shadow), you can create a stronghold that shifts between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow. The price below assumes a single dose of umbral ichor and allows the stronghold to exist on the Plane of Shadow for 1 hour (set at the time of construction) each day. For example, if you mix 12 doses of umbral ichor into the mortar of your stronghold, it can remain on the Plane of Shadow for 12 hours and the Material Plane for 12 hours each day. Which hours are spent on the Plane of Shadow is set during construction, but night on the Material Plane is common. Every space in your stronghold must have umbral ichor for it to be effective.

*Caster Level:* 13th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *shadow walk; Market Price:* 5,000 gp.

**Submersing:** The stronghold can withstand the pressures of the deep sea, able to travel to depths as great as twenty miles below the sea. If the inhabitants need to breathe air, the stronghold must have the airtight augmentation. Without locomotion (see Table 2–12: Stronghold Locomotion), the stronghold sits on the seafloor and does not move.

*Caster Level:* 15th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *water walk, augment object; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.

**Teleporting:** The stronghold can teleport without error as a whole once or more per day. In a single round, it disappears from one location and appears in another. 

*Caster Level:* 15th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Wondrous Item, *teleport without error; Market Price:* 50,000 gp.

## Portals
**Portals**

A *portal* is simply a permanent teleportation effect that safely whisks its user to a predetermined place. Most *portals* lead from one place on a plane to another place on the same plane, but a few lead to other planes.

**Qualities of Portals**

*Portal* magic is unusually durable, and often survives for centuries—or millennia—after its creators have vanished into history or lost any use for their handiwork. Accordingly, the workings of *portals* are mysterious and unpredictable. Each one is built for a reason, but all too often, these reasons are lost when the creator passes into history or obscurity.

*Portals* share some common qualities. All *portals* are two-dimensional areas, usually a circle with a radius of up to 10 feet, but sometimes square, rectangular, or another shape. (Larger *portals* are more expensive, but necessary for creatures of greater than Huge size.) The *portal* itself is intangible and invisible.

*Portals* often come in pairs or networks. A single *portal* is a one-way trip. There must be a matching *portal* at the destination to return. Some *portals* are attuned to several potential destinations, each equipped with a matching *portal*, but most are simply two-way doors between one point and another far distant. Once created, a *portal* cannot be moved.

**Detecting Portals**

An archway or frame of some kind usually marks a *portal*’s location so it can be found when needed and so that creatures don’t blunder into it accidentally. *Detect magic* can reveal a *portal*’s magical aura. If the *portal* is currently functioning (ready to transport creatures), it has a strong aura. If the *portal* is not currently able to transport creatures (usually because it has a limited number of uses, and they are currently exhausted), it has a weak aura. Strong or weak, a *portal* radiates transmutation magic.

Even a character capable of locating traps can’t find a portal with the Perception skill.

**Portal Operation**

Creatures who touch or pass through the area of the *portal* are instantly teleported to the locale the *portal*’s builder specified. (The teleportation effect is similar to *teleport without error* cast by a 17th-level caster, except that interplanar travel is possible.) It is not possible to poke one’s head through a *portal* to see what’s on the other side. A *portal* can only transport creatures that can fit through the *portal*’s physical dimensions.

If a solid object blocks the destination, the *portal* does not function. Creatures, however, do not block *portals*. If a creature already occupies the area where a *portal* leads, the user is instead transported to a suitable location as close as possible to the original destination. A suitable location has a surface strong enough to support the user and enough space to hold the user.

Unattended objects cannot pass though a *portal*. For example, a character can carry any number or arrows through a *portal*, but he cannot fire an arrow through a *portal*. An unattended object that hits a *portal* simply bounces off.

Unless the builder has preset some limit, any number of creatures can pass through a *portal* each round. A creature using a *portal* can take along up to 850 pounds of gear. In this case, gear is anything a creature carries or touches. If two or more creatures touch the same piece of equipment, it counts against both creatures’ weight limits.

**Keyed Portals**

*Portal* builders often restrict access to their creations by setting conditions for their use. Special conditions for triggering a *portal* can be based on the possession of a *portal key*, the creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don’t qualify.

Keyed *portals* may be created at no extra cost. The key must be designated during the creation of the device and cannot be changed after that.

A keyed *portal* remains active for 1 full round. Any creature that touches the activated *portal* in the same round also can use the *portal*, even if such creatures don’t have a key themselves.

Many *portal keys* are rare and unusual objects that the creature using the *portal* must carry. Some *portals* are keyed to work only at a particular time, such as sunrise, sunset, the full moon, or midnight. Spells can serve as *portal keys*, as can the channeling of positive or negative energy. When the *portal* is the target of the specified spell or within the spell’s area or touched by its effect, the spell is absorbed and the *portal* is activated. Any form of the spell works to activate the *portal*, including spell-like effects of creatures or magic items and spells from scrolls.

**Sealing Portals**

A *portal* cannot be destroyed by physical means or by spell effects that destroy objects (such as *disintegrate*). A successful targeted *dispel magic* (DC 28) causes a *portal* to become nonfunctional for 1d4 rounds. *Mordenkainen’s disjunction* destroys a *portal* unless it makes a Will save (a *portal*’s Will save bonus is +10).

*Portals* can’t be disabled with Disable Device.

**Building a Portal**

Any character of at least 17th level can build a *portal* if she knows the Create Portal feat (see sidebar) and either the *teleportation circle* or *gate* spell. See below for *portal* prices.

The *portal* can lead to any locale the builder has personally visited at least once. The *portal* fails if the builder chooses a destination that cannot safely hold her (such as inside a solid object or into thin air). The *portal* also fails if the destination is a locale where astral travel is blocked (see the *teleport* spell description). The prices and construction times noted are for *portals* that operate constantly, transporting anyone who passes through them at any time. If the *portal* can be used less than five times per day, the base costs are reduced. Multiply the market price by the number of uses per day, then divide by 5. This gives you the new market price of the limited-use *portal.* Each activation of a limited-use *portal* lasts 1 round. Once activated, a limited-use *portal* can transport as many creatures as can touch it that round.

***Portal:*** This continuously active *portal* allows one-way travel only. It covers an area with radius of anything from 6 inches (about 1 square foot) up to 10 feet (about 300 square feet).

A larger *portal* adds 100% to the market price for each extra 300 square feet of area or fraction of 300 square feet.

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Portal, *gate* or *teleport without error*, caster level 17; *Market Price:* 100,000 gp.

***Portal, Two-Way:*** This construction is actually a matching pair of *portals*, one at each end of the “trip.” It is otherwise identical to a standard *portal*.

*Caster Level:* 17th; *Prerequisites:* Craft *Portal*, *gate,* or *teleport without error*, caster level 17; *Market Price:* 150,000 gp.

The following 3.5 feat is included for completeness but was folded into Craft Wondrous Item later on.

**Create *Portal* \[Item Creation]**

You have learned the ancient craft of creating a *portal*, a permanent magic device that instantaneously transports those who know its secrets from one locale to another.

**Prerequisite:** Craft Wondrous Item.

**Benefit:** You can create any *portal* whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a *portal* takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a *portal,* you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this base price.

Some *portals* incur extra costs in material components or XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the *portal*’s base price.

**GM Note**

The *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting* is the [only source](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/lists/feats&tablesort=2&tablefilter=create%20portal) I'm aware of for the feat Create Portal. The feat is untouched by errata and has as its only prerequisite the feat Craft Wondrous Item (*PH* 92-3).

But the *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting* on Building a Portal says

Any character of at least 17th level can build a *portal* if she knows the Create Portal feat and either the *teleportation circle* or *gate* spell.

As the feat Craft Wondrous Item has as its lone prerequisite *Caster level 3rd*, a wizard can take the feat Craft Wondrous Item then the feat Create Portal as his wizard bonus feat *at level 5*.

Yet he won't be able to create on his own a *portal* until level 17.

This seems like a long time to wait.

While it's *interesting* that a low-level wizard could knock on the archmage's door and offer his *portal*-building skill in exchange for the archmage's spell knowledge (the Wiz5 providing the feat and Wiz17 providing the spell knowledge), unlike [many](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm#creatingMagicArmor) [other](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm#creatingRods) [magic](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm#creatingWands) [items](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm#creatingWondrousItems), the *portal* doesn't need the Wiz17 to **expend** the spell *gate* or *teleportation circle* during the the *portal*'s creation. Seriously, in the hypothetical scenario, the archmage **supervises** *portal* creation, expending zero resources except time (and, perhaps, patience at being stuck hanging around a Wiz5).

### Here're the questions.
The *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting* is from 2001. The game is in its infancy. Should the quoted text be read as *guidelines*, as the feat Create Portal has no further prerequisites? That is, should anyone with the *capacity* to cast either the spell *gate* or the spell *teleportation circle* be permitted to use the feat Create Portal? (Perhaps cribbing from an arcane *scroll of teleportation circle* (9th-level spell at caster level 17) (*DMG* 241) (4,825 gp; 0 lbs.) is sufficient?)

Alternatively, is there a *reason* to restrict creating *portals* to characters level 17 and higher but to give characters the ability to consider for 12 levels their poor and probably pointless choices?

Was the portal creation process updated or expanded upon in later texts?

### The feat Create Portal was deleted by the *Player's Guide to Faerûn*, but prerequisites for creating *portals* remain otherwise unchanged
The *Player's Guide to Faerûn* on Changes to Feats from the Campaign Setting says

In addition to overhauling the regional feat system, this chapter also introduces a small number of changes to other feats from the *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting*. Most of these alterations are minor changes to the wording for clarity, but some of the key changes include the following.…

**Create Portal:** *Portals* are now considered wondrous items and are built with the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The new Portal Master feat makes it easier for a character to build a *portal*. (42)

(The *Player's Guide* likewise describes the feat Portal Master (42).)

So by removing the feat Create Portal, any ol' caster with access (somehow) to the [correct](http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/resources/systems/pennpaper/dnd35/soveliorsage/spellsFtoG.html#gate) [spells](http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/resources/systems/pennpaper/dnd35/soveliorsage/spellsTtoZ.html#teleportation-circle) and [a feat with a prerequisite of caster level 3rd](http://www.systemreferencedocuments.org/resources/systems/pennpaper/dnd35/soveliorsage/featsAll.html#craft-wondrous-item) can opt to create a *portal*.

Thus, without *portals* requiring their own specific feat to create and the large number of high-level casters on Toril and the utility value of the feat Craft Wondrous Item, the ubiquity of Faerûnian *portals* becomes a bit more understandable, despite *portals* themselves still possessing sort-of silly yet otherwise untouched prerequisites for creation.

So you know, *Underdark* has a few more portal qualities (52-3), *Expedition to Undermountain* describes Halaster’s drifting *portals* (218), and *Power of Faerûn* and *Dungeon* #92 describe a *portal* that emits deadly flying needles (152) and coral *portals* (79), but these latter two designs are largely specific to the location and group associated with them, respectively.

***Note:** This revision means that the DM must make minor adjustments to the prerequisites of the item creation feat Create Moving*[ Portal ](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/pg/20030611a)*and the epic feat Create Time*[ Portal](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/pg/20030416b).

## Answer to Question #1
*Yes*, there are rules supporting multiple people during magic item creation. SRD states:

It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.

If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator’s level must be known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to make the item.

## Answer to Question #2
*No*, there are no other RAW supporting Portal Creation outside of the texts you have already quoted. As I can't prove a negative - this may seem as opinion. There may be some 3rd party resources that I am unaware of, and some Homebrew resources floating around the internet somewhere.

## Suggestion
Make a Magic Door (portal) as a spell trigger wondrous item using [Teleport](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleport.htm) / [Greater Teleport](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleportGreater.htm) with the other Magic Door linked. There will need to possibly be some creative license by the DM. It could be some "fun" roleplaying allowing a chance of failure using the standard Teleport spell. But having the DM state that the two "doors" linked teleporting back and forth to each other shouldn't be too far a stretch of the imagination. It is not gamebreaking by any method. And using certain spell triggers could also help prevent others from freely using the Magic Door. Also, having familiarity limitations as prescribed from the two Teleport spells can also prevent the Average Joe from utilizing the Magic Door.

The only reason Create Portal requires 17th level, is due to [Teleportation Circle](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleportationCircle.htm) being a 9th level spell.

## Spells
**Spells**

Many spells can assist in the construction or protection of a stronghold. To be useful, such spells must have a long-lasting effect, be triggered by some kind of contingency, or be made permanent.

Tips on how best to use these spells in your stronghold are provided below. The “Casting” entry gives the price in gold pieces to have the spell cast for you and, in parentheses, the lowest-level wizard, sorcerer, and bard who can do so. In some cases, this listing includes variant casters of other classes. All costs include the full price of any material components, plus 10% of the cost of any focus component. The *Player’s Handbook* contains full descriptions of these spells.

If the spell can be made permanent via the *permanency* spell, the “Permanent” listing gives the minimum additional cost in gold pieces (and the minimum level of caster required) to do so. Add this to the cost of casting the spell (assuming you don’t cast it yourself ) to find the final cost.

## Permanency or Magic Item?
**Permanency or Magic Item?**

Two methods exist for creating a magical effect that lasts indefinitely: casting *permanency* or building the effect into a continuous or use-activated magic item. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages.

**Permanency:** The biggest advantage of the *permanency* spell is speed. Just cast the spell, follow it with *permanency*, and you’re done. *Permanency’s* XP cost makes it expensive to hire an NPC to cast it, but if you can do the work yourself, your only cost is the XP and 2 rounds of your time.

*Permanency’s* biggest disadvantage is that it only works on spells listed in the spell description for *permanency*. With the exception of *wall of force*, which is immune to dispelling, one successful *dispel magic* wipes out your permanent spell as if it was never there.

**Magic Item:** The biggest advantages of a magic item are its flexibility and its resistance to *dispel magic.* When you’re creating a magic item that uses a spell effect, you don’t have to follow the text of the relevant spell exactly. A *cube of force*, for example, has the *wall of force* spell as a prerequisite, but it works differently (look at how the cube responds to *disintegrate*). *Dispel magic* ends a permanent spell for good, but it only suppresses a magic item for 1d4 rounds.

It takes the relevant item creation feat and time (1 day per 1,000 gp) to make a magic item. If the item you’re creating has a spell prerequisite with a material component, you’ll need to buy that component 100 times to make the item. While it’s easy to figure out the cost of a spell made permanent, calculating the cost of a new magic item is a tricky business. Use the guidelines in Chapter 8 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide,* but remember that the cost suggested there should be the beginning of the item-pricing process, not the end. For instance, if your magic item is more flexible than the spell that acts as a prerequisite, you’ll want to charge more.

**Alarm**

You can cast this spell on an object or area to sound an alert when anyone without the proper password passes through the area or touches the object. Of course, if you use this in a high-traffic area, it will go off all the time and drive you nuts.

Just having the *alarm* in place, isn’t enough. You must have a plan to respond to it quickly. Permanent *alarms* cast around the outside of a building or on the roof can help alert your guards to intruders. After that, the guards must still respond.

Permanent *alarms* are great for placing in or around treasure vaults or other particularly sensitive or valuable areas. Some characters place mental *alarms* around their bedchamber to awaken them instantly the moment an intruder arrives.

**Casting:** 10 gp (Sor1 or Wiz1) or 20 gp (Brd2)

**Permanent:** 2,950 gp (9th)

**Arcane Lock**

*Arcane lock* is a wonderful spell if your character can cast it—or if the caster heads up your stronghold’s security. Otherwise, it can prove more hindrance than help, because only the spellcaster can easily bypass the lock. That’s where *improved arcane lock* (see below) comes in handy, since it allows the caster to designate others who can freely pass through the portal. Add 5 gp to the price for each individual attuned to the *improved arcane lock* spell.

**Casting:** 85 gp (Wiz3) or 105 gp (Sor4); 175 gp and up (Wiz5) or 205 gp and up (Sor6) for *improved arcane lock*

**Improved Arcane Lock**

Abjuration

**Level:** Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3

**BoXM:** Wizard 5

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp, plus 5 gp per individual attuned)

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Door, chest, or *portal* touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level in size

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Stronghold Builder's Guidebook (WotC), pg. 51

This spell works identically to *arcane lock*, except that at the time of casting you may attune up to 1 individual per caster level to the object targeted by the spell. These individuals (who need not be present during casting) can freely pass the *improved arcane lock* as if they had cast the spell.

**Binding**

While not every version of a *binding* spell is permanent, they all last at least months if not years. With a bit of creative work, you can use this spell to create the most effective of guardian creatures, not to mention a horrifying self-destruct device for the stronghold.

**Table 2–15: NPC *Binding* Costs**

By binding a powerful monster to the roof of your stronghold, you send a warning to all around you that you are not to be trifled with. Who wants to mess with someone who literally has a dragon chained to the top of his tower?

Similarly, you can bind creatures in sensitive areas, programming the spell to break if someone entering the area doesn’t supply the password. This works fine with chained or slumbering creatures, especially if you want their very presence to scare off interlopers. You can use the metamorphosis or minimus containment versions of the spell if you want to catch the intruders by surprise instead.

Don’t forget, though, that bound creatures aren’t likely to be too happy with you once they get free. You should be ready to handle them—or you should be long gone once they get out.

This can also provide a method of ensuring that, should your stronghold fall to invaders, they won’t get the chance to enjoy it. Simply bind a powerful creature in a secret area of your place. The minimus containment works best for this, since it shrinks the target to a manageable size, removes its need for sustenance, and is permanent until you decide to break the spell. Set up a trigger for the spell’s dismissal as desired: perhaps merely the entry of anyone but yourself into the bound creature’s area. Secure the room with *arcane lock* and warn the residents to keep out. When an unwary intruder breaks into the chamber hoping for a treasure hoard, the surprise is worth the price, even if you’re no longer around to appreciate it.

Unless you have pacified the target creature beforehand, NPC spellcasters charge more to provide a creature for *binding.* Costs to have *binding* performed by an NPC spellcaster are shown on Table 2–15: NPC *Binding* Costs.

**Casting:** Cost varies by creature bound; see table for sample creatures

**Bless Water**

If you’re having troubles with undead or evil outsiders, it can be to your advantage to have a steady supply of holy water on hand, and that’s what a *bless water* spell can do for you. This method of obtaining holy water is more expensive than buying it on the open market, but few temples have large quantities just lying around.

If you have a low-level cleric or a paladin on staff—which you may if you have a chapel in your stronghold—he can take care of this duty for you, replenishing your supplies as they run dry.

**Casting:** 35 gp (Clr1) or 45 gp (Pal4, treated as a Pal2 for spellcasting purposes)

**Clone**

To make sure that you can continue on should the worst happen, have a clone of yourself created. Should you die, your spirit immediately makes its way to the new body, giving you a new lease on life without relying on divine resurrections.

Place your clone under the (top secret) care of a trusted spellcaster who can keep it fresh with *gentle repose* spells. The preservation costs mount quickly (minimum cost 60 gp per casting, which lasts one day per caster level), making this service a profitable one.

Some wealthy characters even clone their friends and family, though the costs can quickly become prohibitive.

**Casting:** 2,250 gp (Wiz15) or 2,320 gp (Sor16)

**Continual Flame**

This spell is an essential feature in many strongholds. With a *continual flame* you don’t have to worry about feeding fires, refilling lanterns, or replacing candles. The *continual flame* burns endlessly and cannot be put out by normal means. As an extra bonus in hotter climates, it creates no heat, which means you can sit beneath or near one without becoming uncomfortably warm.

Some guards carry torches lit by a *continual flame*. This simple device makes it easy for them to always find an inextinguishable light source, one that burns brightly in the strongest winds and the wettest rains.

To shut the light off from time to time, you need only hide it under a shield or basket. Since the *continual flame* doesn’t burn, this shade could even be made of straw or wood if you like, although some people prefer steel for its solidity and opacity.

*Continual flames* mounted around the exterior of your stronghold provide security lighting, making it hard for rogues or other ill-intentioned louts to skulk in the shadows. You can also have a *continual flame* cast into a lantern, allowing you to carry it from place to place with you. If the lantern has a shutter, then you can hide the light whenever you wish.

**Casting:** 110 gp (Wiz3) or 130 gp (Sor4) or 200 gp (Clr5)

**Curse Water**

This spell essentially works the same as *bless water*, as noted above. However, it affects good outsiders instead of undead, which means that a large stash of this stuff would generally be found only in an evil character’s stronghold.

**Casting:** 35 gp (Clr1)

**Dancing Lights**

At first glance, a permanent casting of *dancing lights* doesn’t appear all that helpful, but in the right hands, it can do a lot. While standing still, the lights act as a light source wherever directed, making them great for illuminating tight or hard-to-reach places. When the spellcaster takes control of them, the lights can act as a magical spotlight, sweeping along exterior walls at a rate of 100 feet per round (to a maximum distance of 100 feet plus 10 feet per caster level from the controller).

**Casting:** 5 gp (Brd1, Sor1, or Wiz1)

**Permanent:** 2,950 gp (9th)

**Drawmij’s Instant Summons**

You can use this spell to summon objects to you, which can come in handy when trying to recover something lost or stolen from your stronghold. The trick is that you have to set up the involved spells ahead of time, before the item is taken.

First, place *arcane mark* on the object in question. Then have a spellcaster cast *Drawmij’s instant summons* for the object, which involves invisibly inscribing the item’s name on a valuable gem.

If the item is stolen, your hired wizard can activate *Drawmij’s instant summons*. If the object in question isn’t in someone’s direct possession at the time, it comes right back to the wizard—even if on another plane—who can then give it to you.

If someone has the item on his person or under his direct control, it cannot be returned by means of this spell. Still, it tells the spellcaster where the possessor is and who has it at the moment the spell is cast, which can be a great help in tracking the thing down.

This spell is an expensive form of security. For items that you can’t afford to lose, this magical insurance policy could be worth the price.

**Casting:** 1,910 gp (Wiz13) or 1,980 gp (Sor14)

**Explosive Runes**

It’s not wise to simply leave *explosive runes* up all over the place. Innocent people might inadvertently read them and set them off.

If you own something that must not fall into the wrong hands and that is usually kept under wraps or at least in a private chamber, then *explosive runes* can help. Have the spell cast on the object in question and instruct the caster to allow you and anyone else you care to name at that point to be able to read the rune without detonating it. Then, when someone unauthorized comes across the rune, it explodes, doing damage to the reader but—possibly more importantly—damaging the inscribed item as well. This form of security is all or nothing; use it only on documents and so forth that are better off destroyed than falling into the wrong hands.

*Explosive runes* can also be used as a simple trap by placing it near your valuables. If you want to keep your valuables intact, however, remember to protect them from the resulting explosion.

One neat trick to do with *explosive runes* is to suspend a load of heavy rocks above a secret area by means of a net or wooden props. Then place a note that reads “Look up” in the area. If the intruder looks up, she sees the rune. When it detonates, it not only does damage but also burns away what’s supporting the rocks, releasing them and burying anyone in the area. The total damage varies according to the kind and amount of load used. Treat it as a falling block trap.

Smart characters link *explosive runes* with a permanent *alarm* or some other system to alert the character or guards to the fact that someone has set off the rune. Otherwise, the intruder might recover and move on without anyone realizing her presence.

The DC to find and to disable an *explosive runes* trap is 28.

**Casting:** 150 gp (Wiz5) or 180 gp (Sor6)

**Fire Trap**

A *fire trap* is a wonderful way to protect your belongings, since if the caster gives you the password, you can bypass the trap without any trouble: a great step forward in convenience when compared to mechanical traps, which treat all comers alike.

A *fire trap* doesn’t deal as much damage as *explosive runes*, but on the other hand it doesn’t pose a threat to the object it protects.

Smart characters link a *fire trap* with a permanent *alarm* or some other system to alert the character or guards to the fact that someone has set off the *fire trap*. Otherwise, the intruder might recover and move on without anyone realizing her presence.

The DC to find and to disable a *fire trap* is 27 (or 29 if created by a wizard or sorcerer).

**Casting:** 85 gp (Drd3) or 305 gp (Wiz7) or 345 gp (Sor8)

**Forbiddance**

This spell is great for characters who have powerful enemies—and what character worth his salt doesn’t? Once cast upon an area, it prevents anyone with a different alignment from the caster’s from entering the area. It also seals the area against all planar travel into it, preventing people or monsters from making a surprise visit. Finally, it’s huge. You get a shapeable 60-foot cube per level—and each such cube is enough to cover fifty stronghold spaces.

The key here is to make sure that you find a caster with an alignment identical to your own. Otherwise, you’ll be shoved out of your own place.

Creatures with high spell resistance can bypass *forbiddance*. Furthermore, a successful Will save allows people to physically enter the area, so this is hardly foolproof security. An intruder could teleport right next to the area and then walk in, for example, so it’s up to you to take secondary measures as well. The first step is to make sure that the *forbiddance* spell actually covers the entire interior of a room. After that, you can figure out other ways to help seal up the room tight.

You can set up the spell so that anyone with the right password can bypass its effects. However, that increases the material component cost by another 5,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

**Casting:** 660 gp (Clr11) plus material components

**Ghost Sound**

Made permanent, this spell serves as a scare tactic. There’s nothing like the sound of a prowling pack of attack dogs to frighten off a rogue listening at a door.

**Casting:** 5 gp (Brd1, Sor1, or Wiz1)

**Permanent:** 2,950 gp (9th)

**Glyph of Warding**

*Glyphs* are a fine way to protect your stronghold. First, they’re programmable. You can set them to ignore people who have the proper password or a certain observable characteristic. They can also be set with regard to good, evil, law, or chaos or even whether or not the intruder is a member of the caster’s religion.

Second, you can use a *glyph* to trigger a blast or any harmful cleric spell up to 3rd level, cast by the same caster. Viable options include *bane, bestow curse, blindness/deafness, cause fear, contagion, darkness, deeper darkness, desecrate, dispel magic, doom, hold person, inflict light wounds, inflict minor wounds, inflict moderate wounds, inflict serious wounds, invisibility purge, magic circle against chaos/evil/good/law, obscuring mist, searing light, shatter, silence, sound burst, spiritual weapon, summon monster I, summon monster II, summon monster III, wind wall*, and *zone of truth.*

The level of the spellcaster you hire affects the efficacy of spells stored in the *glyph,* and it means that a *blast glyph* cast by a 5th-level cleric does only 2d8 points of damage.

A glyph can be activated by a touch, by simply passing it, or by entering an area it happens to be in. It can detect invisible intruders, but *mislead, polymorph*, and *nondetection* can fool it. Note that stored spells that have a range or require a touch only work if the target is within range or touching them. Plan the placement of your *glyphs* accordingly.

Smart characters link a *glyph of warding* with a permanent *alarm* or some other system to alert the character or the guards to the fact that someone has set off the *glyph*. Otherwise, the intruder might recover and move on without anyone realizing her presence.

The DC to find and disable a *glyph of warding* is 28.

Casting: 350 gp (Clr5)

**Greater Glyph of Warding**

This functions essentially the same as the standard *glyph of warding*, but packs more punch.

At the minimum caster level, the *greater blast glyph* does 5d8 points of damage.

A *greater glyph* can store any harmful spell up to 6th level. This includes all those listed under the *glyph of warding* note above, plus *antilife shell, banishment, blade barrier, circle of doom, dismissal, flame strike, forbiddance, geas/quest, greater dispelling, harm, inflict critical wounds, insect plague*, *mark of justice, plane shift, poison, slay living, summon monster IV, summon monster V,* and *summon monster VI.*

The DC to find and disable a *greater glyph of warding* is 31.

**Casting:** 1,060 gp (Clr11)

**Greater Planar Binding**

This spell can be used similarly to a *binding* spell, but you only have one choice: to call and capture some elementals or outsiders (up to 24 HD worth) to act as guardians or servants in your stronghold.

Creatures called through *greater planar binding* have three ways to escape: by using their spell resistance, by using dimensional travel to escape, or by succeeding at a Charisma check. Smart spellcasters use *dimensional anchor* to prevent dimensional travel and use a calling diagram and the relevant *magic circle* (see the Conjuration section of Chapter 10 of the *Player’s Handbook*) to negate the creature’s spell resistance and make the Charisma check harder. The price below assumes you have hired a spellcaster to cast all three and prepare a calling diagram.

Most spellcasters use *greater planar binding* to make a deal with the called creatures, using their predicament as leverage. Of course, nothing says you have to let the creatures go once you have your hands on them. You can set them up in a public cage as a warning to trespassers if you like, a display of your character’s power.

You can use them as part of a trap. Set up the spell so that the creatures are bound in some hidden part of your stronghold. Then set up a *greater glyph* right near the area and store a *greater dispelling* spell inside it. When an intruder enters, the *glyph* goes off and, with any luck, frees the captives, a group of creatures that are not likely to be in a very good mood. Of course, you risk the possibility that the *glyph* might not go off, but the mere presence of the elementals or outsiders may be enough to scare off less than courageous intruders.

The real danger here is that the captured creatures can try to break free once per day. Eventually, they will succeed. As such, many stronghold owners only set up such systems when they expect imminent invasion. This tactic serves as insurance: If you survive the larger battle, you can set the creatures free without prejudice. If you die, the creatures will eventually get free to plague the area.

**Casting:** 1,630 gp (Wiz15) or 1,710 gp (Sor16)

**Guards and Wards**

While *guards and wards* doesn’t have the longer-lasting effects of the other spells in this section, it is specifically designed to protect strongholds. Note that that *guards and wards* only protects up to 200 square feet per level, about half the volume of a standard stronghold space, although it can cover up to 20 feet above this area, about twice as high as a standard stronghold space. In other words, a clever caster could stack two separate levels with two castings of this spell, although the two levels would have to be one atop the other for it to work.

The spell’s effects last up to 22 hours, assuming you use the lowest-level caster possible, so you could have the spell cast once per day, although the costs would add up quickly. For the ability to cast the spell when you need it, see the Wondrous Architecture section of this book.

**Casting:** 660 gp (Wiz11) or 720 gp (Sor12)

**Gust of Wind**

A permanent *gust of wind* can help ventilate underground passageways or other parts of a stronghold that may otherwise become dank. This proves especially useful in storage areas, such as basements or dungeons. It virtually eliminates the risk of mildew and rot setting into such areas.

Vain characters can apply a *gust of wind* to one side of a flagpole standing over the stronghold. This ensures that your personal, family, or national banner always billows dramatically over your stronghold.

A permanent *gust of wind* can also provide motive power to a flying stronghold with sails. Such a stronghold moves at two miles per hour in the direction set by the position of the sails.

**Casting:** 150 gp (Wiz5) or 180 gp (Sor6) or 210 gp (Brd7)

**Permanent:** 8,050 gp (11th)

**Hallow**

If you’re of a religious bent, this is a perfect spell to help protect your stronghold. When cast by a 9th-level caster, the spell can cover a 90-foot-radius circle (which would completely cover a relatively compact stronghold of about sixteen spaces, or more if you build in three dimensions).

Not only does *hallow* provide a permanent *magic circle against evil* throughout the affected area, but any body buried there cannot become undead. If a cleric casts the spell, it also provides a +4 sacred bonus on turning undead and a –4 sacred penalty on commanding them.

Best of all, you can fix a programmable spell to the site with a duration of one year. If you do this, you must pay the cost to have the extra spell cast, plus another 1,000 gp per level of the spell. You can designate whether the spell affects everyone, only creatures that share your faith or alignment, or just creatures that have a different faith or alignment.

Some common choices (and the cost for an NPC spellcaster to provide them) are listed below.


| **Spell** | **Additional cost** <br>**(not including *hallow*)** |
|---|---|
| *Bane* (on enemies) | 1,010 gp |
| *Bless* (on allies) | 1,010 gp |
| *Daylight* (cleric version) | 3,150 gp |
| *Detect evil* | 1,010 gp |
| *Discern lies* | 4,280 gp |
| *Dispel magic* (on enemies) | 3,150 gp |
| *Invisibility purge* | 3,150 gp |
| *Negative energy protection* | 3,150 gp |
| *Remove fear* (on allies) | 1,010 gp |
| *Silence* (on enemies) | 2,060 gp |
| *Tongues* (cleric version) | 4,280 gp |
| *Zone of truth* | 2,060 gp |

**Casting:** 1,450 gp (Clr9 or Drd9) plus additional cost for extra spell (see above)

**Illusory Wall**

While you can’t build things with it, *illusory wall* works well to keep things out of sight. Even if someone or something passes through the *illusory wall,* the image remains. In this way, you can use it to cover a secret door, a pit trap, or anything else that you want to be concealed.

Despite its name, *illusory wall* works just as well to create illusions of floors and ceilings.

**Casting:** 280 gp (Wiz7) or 320 gp (Sor8)

**Invisibility**

*Invisibility*’s multitude of useful functions marks it as one of the most valuable spells for a stronghold builder. You can use it to make protected windows by casting it on a spot in the outer wall of your stronghold. The affected part of the wall remains as strong as the original material, but becomes entirely transparent. Cast on your roof, it provides a skylight that never leaks (unless your roof does).

Cast *invisibility* on a case protecting a valuable item on display, such as in a museum. Instead of a fragile glass case, you can now have a durable iron, mithral, or adamantine case protecting the item.

Use *invisibility* to create peepholes in doors. Cast on a dividing wall, it creates a transparent barrier between you and any visitors to your main hall (and it’s cheaper than *wall of force*). If the wall has an arrow slit, it grants an archer far more cover than apparent while still allowing a wide field of vision (though the archer’s field of fire remains restricted by the arrow slit).

**Casting:** 60 gp (Clr3 or Wiz3) or 80 gp (Brd4 or Sor4)

**Permanent:** 5,500 gp (10th)

**Leomund’s Trap**

This spell makes a safe place or item appear to be trapped. Cautious characters who don’t have the funds to install real traps everywhere—or who don’t want to bother with dismantling them every time they want to get past them—often use this spell.

The main idea here is not to hurt anyone but to slow down any intruders and force them to expend resources. Don’t bother using this spell to protect anything truly valuable.

**Casting:** 110 gp (Wiz3) or 130 gp (Sor4)

**Lesser Planar Binding**

This spell works much like *greater planar binding* (see above), but it only allows you to capture one outsider or elemental of up to 8 HD. The price below includes *lesser planar binding, dimensional anchor,* and the relevant *magic circle* spell.

**Casting:** 880 gp (Wiz9) or 940 gp (Sor10)

**Magic Mouth**

Employing a standard *magic mouth* spell (as opposed to the permanent version) is mostly a cost-saving measure. Instead of getting the benefits of *magic mouth* that you don’t have to recast after every use, you get it at a great price. You could pay to have *magic mouth* cast dozens of times for what it would cost you for a single permanent *magic mouth*, and that kind of savings can add up.

A *magic mouth* makes a great audible alarm. The spell is programmable, meaning you can set it to go off whenever an intruder—as you happen to define the term—enters the area. Then it can yell bloody murder for the next 10 minutes, making sure the guards know that something’s going on.

Of course, once the *magic mouth* is tripped, it’s gone, which means you have to get a spellcaster back in there to recast the spell quickly unless you want to do without. Some rogues have caught on to this scheme. They make a point of disturbing a *magic mouth* alarm early in the night, then return later that same night, before a spellcaster can be brought in to get the *magic mouths* up and running again. The permanent version circumvents that tactic.

A permanent *magic mouth* can also be used to welcome your guests as they arrive through the stronghold’s front door or into any other part of the place. Extremely proud characters can use *magic mouths* as a kind of tour guide throughout their stronghold or hall of trophies as well. All the visitors have to do is reach out and touch a specially prepared plate, and an oratory about the room or exhibit begins. This spell is the kind of addition to a stronghold that speaks of the character’s wealth as much as it does of his accomplishments.

**Casting:** 70 gp (Wiz3) or 90 gp (Brd4 or Sor4)

**Permanent:** 5,500 gp (10th)

**Mark of Justice**

If you want to make sure you can trust your staff, consider using *mark of justice*. As a condition of employment, you can have *mark of justice* inscribed on the skin of a prospective employee, forbidding him to betray you or your family (or however you would like to put it). Then, if the employee does you wrong, you and he both know he’ll pay for it.

Tread cautiously here, though. Some otherwise loyal employees may be offended by having to bear the *mark of justice.* When that happens, they may go out of their way to have it removed. After that, they’re free to do as they wish, and the first thing on their list may be retribution for your lack of trust in them.

More circumspect ways of calming your fears exist. Few, though, are as effective.

**Casting:** 450 gp (Clr9)

**Modify Memory**

When you build a stronghold full of secrets, you want to limit the number of people who know those secrets. For evil characters, the answer is simple: Dead men tell no tales.

For good or even neutral characters, though, killing off your workers isn’t an option worth considering. By carefully limiting the number of people who have access to your stronghold’s secrets while it’s being built, you can narrow down the number of people you need to be concerned about. Then you can reduce that vital statistic to zero with judicious use of *modify memory*.

Essentially, you need only take those workers, architects, craftsmen, and so on aside once their jobs are complete. Bring them into a private room one by one, then wipe their memories clean of secrets you want to protect.

Ideally, you should limit the number of people you have to do this to, as well as the time they spend on the project. After all, each casting of *modify memory* only affects 5 minutes of memory, so it can be quite a chore to use it to destroy even an hour’s worth of secrets in someone’s head.

**Casting:** 400 gp (Brd10)

**Permanent Image**

With this spell, you can create a permanent illusion that satisfies all five senses. The thing is all but solid, and the caster can even move the illusion later.

If you only need a wall to cover something up, stick with the much cheaper *illusory wall*. While a *permanent image* is still an unchanging image, there’s a lot more you can do with it. Some characters have been known to use the spell to decorate their home with amazing tapestries or bits of art. You can even move your illusory artwork from room to room.

Sometimes characters use *permanent image* to show a group of guards at an entrance. Careful observation determines that these people aren’t real, though, since they never move. No guards are that stoic.

Even at minimum caster level, this spell can cover about three stronghold spaces at once. Some stronghold owners use several overlapping versions of *permanent image* to conceal their entire stronghold. Cunning owners make arrangements for this kind of concealment before they even break ground, all the better to hide any trace of the place they plan to build.

**Casting:** 760 gp (Wiz11) or 820 gp (Sor12) or 1,060 gp (Brd16)

**Phase Door**

A *phase door* provides one of the best kinds of security devices you can have in a home. You must set it into wood, plaster, or stone, but it then operates as a door only for those you choose, stopping others cold in their tracks. You can program the *phase door* to open for people with certain observable qualities, including passwords or badges, making it usable by more than just yourself.

While a *phase door* is useful as an entrance, it can prove even more handy as an exit. When you place such a spell strategically in your bedchamber or the main meeting hall, you can rest assured that you always have a means for a quick getaway for yourself and any you have entrusted with your secret. When cast by a 13th level spellcaster, the *phase door* only allows six uses total from either direction. Once the uses are gone, the spell ends, and the *phase door* is no more.

If you want the convenience and power of a *phase door* at all times, use it with the *permanency* spell. Since this costs more than twenty separate castings of *phase door*, make sure you choose wisely and don’t waste your money. On the other hand, having a permanent *phase door* means never having to worry about being caught on the wrong side of the door when its uses are gone.

**Casting:** 910 gp (Wiz13) or 980 gp (Spr14) or 1,200 gp (Clr15)

**Permanent:** 18,250 gp (15th)

**Planar Binding**

This spell works much like *greater planar binding* (see above), but it only allows you to capture a number of outsiders or elementals of up to 16 total HD. The price given below includes *planar binding, dimensional anchor,* and the relevant *magic circle* spell.

**Casting:** 1,090 gp (Wiz11) or 1,150 gp (Sor12)

**Plant Growth**

You can use *plant growth* in a number of ways around a stronghold. The enrichment version can help your new landscaping take hold right away. If you happen to have sharecroppers or leasing farmers on your nearby lands, you have just made yourself a whole lot of new friends.

The overgrowth version can help set up a perimeter defense around your stronghold, much like a living moat. You’ll probably need multiple castings to completely surround your fortress.

Smart builders use the overgrowth version to create two separate rings around the stronghold—the first some 50 feet out, and the second right up against the stronghold walls. This slows down invaders as they approach and then makes it hard for them to mount ladders or siege equipment designed to top the walls.

**Casting:** 150 gp (Clr5, Drd5, or Rgr11)

**Prismatic Sphere**

A permanent *prismatic sphere* is most often used as a private sanctum for the designated owner. It’s usually stuck into the center of a laboratory, but some paranoid characters even sleep inside one.

When you create a permanent *prismatic sphere*, remember that the sphere actually cuts through the floor and into any room below, which might render that room uninhabitable. Some cunning architects place their private chambers directly over their treasure vaults. This way, they get the double benefit of the full protection of the sphere in their daily lives, plus they can count on the sphere’s blinding effects to affect anyone with less than 8 HD that wanders into their vault.

Other characters mount a permanent *prismatic sphere* in the single doorway into their stronghold. This effectively keeps anyone else from leaving or entering the place, so this tactic is mostly used only by hermits or characters who have other means of getting their staff members in and out of the place.

Similarly, such a sphere could cover an escape hatchway, making it difficult if not impossible for pursuers to follow you into the sphere one way and then out the other.

**Casting:** 1,530 gp (Clr17 or Wiz17) or 1,620 gp (Sor18)

**Permanent:** 23,350 gp (17th)

**Programmed Image**

This spell is like a more powerful version of *magic mouth.* Instead of creating a single mouth that speaks a script, you can create an entire moving image to go along with it. The spell is programmable, and once the illusion is triggered, it does whatever you like for 11 rounds (when cast by an 11th-level caster).

For instance, if someone unauthorized opens the door to your bedchamber, you could have a demon appear in an explosion of fire and brimstone to scare the intruder away. The smell and heat of the demon would be palpable, and most trespassers would likely find better places to be quickly. If you make it loud enough, the *programmed image* can also function as an alarm, alerting yourself or nearby guards to the situation.

As with *magic mouth,* this trick only works once, and the spell must then be recast.

**Casting:** 685 gp (Wiz11) or 745 gp (Sor12) or 985 gp (Brd16)

**Refuge**

This spell creates an item that triggers the spell’s full effects once the item is broken and a command word is spoken. Doing this allows the item’s user to summon the caster to her side or to transport herself to the caster’s abode. Assuming the caster lives in your stronghold, this can be a powerful, though expensive, tool.

You could use *refuge* to return to your stronghold. You could also give a *refuge* item to a scout or a guard at a remote watchtower so that he could report to you as soon as he ran into trouble. You could also use it to call your favorite spellcaster to you, but this requires additional bargaining with the spellcaster (and at least another 500 gp per level up front).

**Casting:** 2,410 gp (Clr13) or 3,030 gp (Wiz17) or 3,120 gp (Sor18)

**Sepia Snake Sigil**

Much like the *symbol* spell, this spell allows you to protect an object or location from intruders. Unfortunately, you can’t program it to let anyone pass (though it won’t attack the caster), so it finds less use in populated strongholds. Its best feature is its ability to capture an intruder alive and keep her in suspended animation until you figure out what to do with her.

**Casting:** 650 gp (Wiz5) or 680 gp (Sor6) or 710 gp (Brd7)

**Shambler**

With this spell, you create a number of shambling mounds that you can use for guard duty. They cannot leave the region you set them to guard, and only the caster has any control over them. Still, they can provide a powerful means of keeping a place protected, if well placed.

Some characters have shamblers patrol the walls outside their stronghold. This works fine as long as no friendly visitors stray too far off the road to the stronghold. 

The spell lasts for only seven months when used for guard duty, so the shambler guard system requires some maintenance. When you consider the benefits of having guards that don’t require sleep, food, drink, or salary, the shamblers can look like a real bargain.

**Casting:** 1,530 gp (Clr17 or Drd17)

**Shrink Item**

The permanent version of this spell is only of limited use, since only the original caster can expand and reshrink the target object. That said, if you can pull it off—or have such a caster in your employ or among your friends—it can be a useful spell for the imaginative stronghold owner.

This spell is especially handy if you have some kind of large, awkward, or heavy item—anything from a catapult to a pipe organ—that needs to move easily from place to place on a regular basis.

Don’t limit your thinking merely to solid objects, however. Shrinking a large brazier or fire pit allows you always to have a warm and ready fire. A shrunken pool of water turned clothlike could be worn as a shimmering, transparent cape, but you could throw down the cape and transform it back into water at any time. If holy water filled the pool, this tactic could prove even more useful.

**Casting:** 150 gp (Wiz5) or 180 gp (Sor6)

**Permanent:** 8,050 gp (11th)

**Simulacrum**

Have you ever wished you could be in two places at once? *Simulacrum* can make it seem that way.

Although not directly useful to a stronghold, some characters make regular use of *simulacrum* to handle dangerous meetings with untrustworthy audiences. If the visitors kill the simulacrum, you have only lost the money you spent on it.

The only drawback is that only the spellcaster can control the simulacrum, and that can only be done directly.

**Casting:** 6,010 gp (Wiz13) or 6,080 gp (Sor14)

**Snare**

This spell provides a great way of quickly setting up a magic trap in your stronghold or—better yet—around the outskirts. You can’t program the *snare*, so it’s best employed in little-used areas where you fear intruders. *Snare* works best when attached to trees, so many characters scatter them about the land outside their strongholds, preferably in a region already affected by the overgrowth version of *plant growth*.

**Casting:** 60 gp (Drd5) or 80 gp (Rgr8)

**Solid Fog**

A permanent *solid fog* works best as cover for your stronghold. Ambitious characters—or those with small strongholds—can cover their entire structures with such spells. This spell conceals the place wonderfully, but it presents two problems.

First, people in the area may be suspicious of a perpetually foggy locale, especially in a region in which fog is uncommon. Nothing sticks out worse than a fog bank on the side of a mountain on an otherwise bright and sunny day.

Second, the *solid fog* impedes your guards’ ability to see out as much as it keeps other people from looking in. If you don’t have much in the way of guards, this may not concern you.

*Solid fog* can block off obvious paths toward your stronghold. If, for instance, you can only get to your stronghold by making the proper turn at a fork in the road, obscuring that region may help keep strangers from finding their way to your home. Similarly, you can block a pass between your stronghold and the main road with *solid fog*. Just put enough space between the spell and your stronghold that you have plenty of time to react to anything you might see coming out of it. 

Note that while a severe wind (31+ mph) can blow way a *solid fog*, the *permanency* spell means that the dispersed fog returns as soon as the wind fades away. This can create a dramatic situation in which your stronghold is exposed during a storm but is back within its cover as soon as the wind dies down.

Consider placing a permanent *alarm* spell on the far edge of the *solid fog*. That, combined with the effect the *solid fog* has on movement, should give you plenty of time to react to anyone who manages to find his way through the soupy stuff.

**Casting:** 280 gp (Wiz7) or 320 gp (Sor8)

**Permanent:** 10,600 gp (12th)

**Stinking Cloud**

You can use a permanent *stinking cloud* very much like *solid fog*, but it’s important to keep the stuff as far away from your stronghold as possible. After all, you don’t want to make yourself or your people sick with your own spells.

A *stinking cloud* is dispersed more easily than *solid fog*—a moderate wind (11+ mph) breaks it up in 4 rounds, while a strong wind (21+ mph) does the job in 1 round—making it not as consistently useful when it comes to obscuring a view. Still, it can prove even handier at blocking off a pass.

As with *solid fog, stinking cloud* works best in conjunction with an *alarm* spell. This can alert you to the intruders’ presence as they enter the *stinking cloud,* allowing you to deal with the hindered victims as they emerge.

Some heroes (and some not so noble people) install a permanent *stinking cloud* inside a (sealed) prison cell. Nausea generally overcomes any prisoners placed in the room, making them unable to cast spells, use skills, or come up with much more of a plan for a breakout than “Let’s get out of here!”

**Casting:** 150 gp (Wiz5) or 180 gp (Sor6)

**Permanent:** 8,050 gp (11th)

**Symbol**

*Symbols* differ from most spells that you can program to activate only under certain circumstances, in that they can react to a person’s name, identity, or alignment, as well as to the standard observable circumstances. For instance, a good character could put up *symbols* that only affect evil characters. This makes the *symbol* much harder to circumvent, since you needn’t use passwords or identifying insignia.

When *symbol* is cast, you can attune it to anyone within 60 feet. This means that the *symbol* won’t affect these beings, even if triggered nearby. However, since you can’t add anyone to this attunement after the casting, it doesn’t work well in situations of rapid staff turnover.

At the time of creating a carefully inscribed *symbol*—quickly scribed ones aren’t of much long-term use in a stronghold—you can also specify a password, but to do so risks the security of the thing. Passwords can be overheard or given out by traitorous underlings.

A permanent *symbol* allows you to avoid recasting the spell every time intruders trigger it. Though this costs more than individual castings, it can prove a bargain if you anticipate repeated intrusions. If you make a quickly scribed *symbol* permanent, it remains always on rather than being triggered by specific actions. Most times, builders inscribe *symbols* on doors or over portals, but an ambitious character could put them on every exterior wall of her stronghold. Those who worry about attacks from above could inscribe *symbols* on the roof as well.

*Symbols* work best when paired with another spell, such as a permanent *alarm* or a *magic mouth*. Otherwise, you might wake up one morning and go for a stroll around your stronghold only to find a heap of bodies (sleeping, dead, insane, or otherwise) scattered about the outer walls of your place. With the notifying magic in place, you can respond to the threat right away, hopefully before any friends of the *symbol*’s victims manage to defeat or circumvent it.

Some characters place a *symbol of hopelessness* or a *symbol of persuasion* over their chair in their main meeting hall. In this way, they can affect the minds of those who come to visit them.

Other times, stronghold owners use more deadly *symbols*, set to go off at the sound of a trigger word from the character or at the removal of an awning or tapestry that conceals the *symbols*. Of course, the character and any nearby companions, if not attuned to the *symbol*, run the same risk of exposure as anyone else in the room.

Remember that *symbols* only function if they can be seen or touched. This instance is another in which *continual flame* or—even better—permanent *dancing lights* can come in handy. Not only do *dancing lights* illuminate the area, but they attract the attention of unwary souls, drawing them closer to the *symbol* until it’s too late.

**Casting:** 11,200 gp if carefully inscribed or 6,200 gp (Clr15 or Wiz15) or 11,280 gp if carefully inscribed or 6,280 gp (Sor16)

**Permanent:** 20,800 gp (16th)

**Teleport Trap**

*Teleport trap* wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell’s area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected by a *teleport trap* can resist the effect with a Will save—if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn’t teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)—either to the intended location or the *teleport trap*’s actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the *teleport trap*’s presence, but does not reveal the trap’s linked destination.

At your discretion, the *teleport trap* can exclude a category of creatures, such as an alignment, a type of creature, or creatures that carry a specific item or know a password (though this only works if the creature is teleporting out of the area, not into it). You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of *teleport trap* can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells.

*Teleport trap* can be made permanent at the cost of 7,000 gp. A single *permanency* spell can be used on all *teleport traps* that share a linked destination, but the gold piece cost must be paid for each individual spell.

**Casting:** 6,010 gp (Wizard 13)

**Permanent:** 7,000 gp (13th)

**Teleportation Circle**

This spell is one of the most useful ones to make permanent. With it, you can set up easy, foolproof ways both in and out of your stronghold. This allows an easy means of getting into a stronghold without any apparent entrance, or of escaping when cornered.

For instance, you could set up a *teleportation circle* to teleport the user from a protected entry point into an air-filled chamber in an underwater stronghold or even from the ground into a stronghold in the sky. Similarly, you could keep a *teleportation circle* in a small room off your bedroom or main greeting hall to give you a good means of escaping should the need arise.

The only real drawback is that anyone can use the *teleportation circle*. To guard against this feature, place the *teleportation circle* in a protected chamber. Such a place could be inside a *prismatic sphere* or in a sealed, doorless room only accessible through a *phase door* or some similar means.

*Teleportation circles* only work one way: from the circle to the designated spot. If you want to travel back and forth between two different spots, you need to set up a parallel pair of *circles*.

This spell can also form a mean trap. Anyone who steps on it can be sent to any place that you are familiar with or at least have a reliable description of. This destination can’t be into something solid, but it could send a victim deep into the ocean, several thousand feet into the air over a nearby mountain or farm, or even simply into a prison cell beneath the stronghold.

**Casting:** 2,530 gp (Wiz17) or 2,620 gp (Sor18)

**Permanent:** 23,350 gp (17th)

**Temporal Stasis**

This spell lets you set up an elaborate self-destruct system for your stronghold. First, cast it on a truly dangerous creature and then bring the creature into the belly of your stronghold. Seal the creature behind a door trapped with a *greater glyph of warding* set to cast a *greater dispelling* spell of the highest level you can afford. If this releases the creature, the fireworks will fly.

Since the creature trapped by the *temporal stasis* doesn’t get a regular chance at a saving throw after being caught, this tactic is far superior to even *greater planar binding*.

**Casting:** 6,530 gp (Wiz17) or 6,620 gp (Sor18)

**Unhallow**

This spell is the evil version of *hallow* (see above). It works much the same way, including the ability to add the effects of certain spells to the affected area for a year.

**Casting:** 1,450 gp (Clr9 or Drd9) plus additional cost for extra spell (see Hallow)

**Wall of Fire**

The *wall of fire* is a defensive tool. While it won’t do much for your lawn—or leave you any lawn to talk about, for that matter—some people line the perimeters of their strongholds with a set of nearly continuous *walls of fire*. This risk is a real hazard in dry conditions, so clear the area of any flammable vegetation before you try it. Otherwise, you could end up burning the surrounding countryside.

A more innovative use of a *wall of fire* would be to use it as the basis of an interior, fuelless heating system. To work this tactic, install a permanent *wall of fire* in an empty room in the lowest level of your stronghold. (Heat rises, remember.) Then, to assist with circulation, place a permanent *gust of wind* either behind or perpendicular to it, situated to blow the heated air out of the room and through the rest of the place. Remember that anything within 20 feet of the flames takes damage from it directly.

In warmer climates, you may choose to shut the *wall of fire* down in the summer months so you don’t swelter. In the meantime think about how much effort you’ll save in having to haul wood in for your fireplaces in winter.

This kind of heating system can easily take care of a place with up to twenty (contiguous and relatively compact) stronghold spaces, keeping the temperature in the place balmy throughout the harshest winters. In larger places, you can set up multiple heating rooms if you like. Alternatively, you can heat a portion of the place and seal the rest of the rooms off for the colder seasons.

Particularly ruthless stronghold owners could even place a pit trap in the room over a heating room lined with a *wall of fire*.

**Casting:** 280 gp (Clr7 or Wiz7) or 320 gp (Sor8) or 450 gp (Drd9)

**Permanent:** 10,600 gp (12th)

**Wall of Force**

Chapter 2 presents the prices for using a *wall of force* as building material, which requires the Create Wondrous Item feat to build walls as wondrous architecture. What if you simply cast a permanent *wall of force*?

*Wall of force* neatly avoids the bane of other *permanency* options: the *dispel magic* spell. When cast directly, it only makes featureless, flat vertical walls. You can’t make doorways or windows, so it’s not much good for your stronghold itself. For a freestanding wall outside your stronghold, it’s much better. In that case, the *wall of force* is the best, most durable material to use for a wall.

Permanent *walls of force* can be useful inside the stronghold as well. For instance, using a *wall of force* as one wall of a room gives the equivalent of a huge picture window with “glass” stronger than steel. Some builders install *wall of force* hemispheres as skylights in the ceilings of their main halls or even their bedchambers or laboratories. They also make wonderfully protective shells for those who wish to study the skies in the ultimate in observatories.

**Casting:** 450 gp (Wiz9) or 500 gp (Sor10)

**Permanent:** 13,150 gp (13th)

**Wall of Iron**

This spell can help in construction, especially if you need a wall in place right away to help seal off an area. Remember that *wall of iron* only creates flat, featureless vertical walls. Even if you used *wall of iron* spells to construct a room, you would have to fasten them together yourself and cut out doors and windows.

The typical casting (by a 9th-level caster) gives you a 225-square-foot wall, 2 inches thick. Alternatively, you can halve the thickness (to 1 inch) and double the area (to 450 square feet). The DC for a Strength check to break it is either 27 (for a 1-inch-thick wall) or 29 (for a 2-inch-thick wall).

You can only conjure a *wall of iron* as a flat plane, although the edges do not have to be square.

**Casting:** 500 gp (Wiz9) or 550 gp (Sor10)

**Wall of Stone**

Unlike *wall of iron, wall of stone* proves useful to the typical stronghold builder, and the costs for hewn stone walls in Chapter 2 assume you use this spell when it’s more efficient than traditional stonecarving. The spell allows you to crudely shape the wall however you like, so you can build corners, doorways, and whatever architectural features you like. Only crude control is available, and you must still hire stonecarvers or use *stone shape* if you want fine detail.

The typical casting (by a 9th-level caster) gives you a 225-square-foot wall, 2 inches thick. Alternatively, you can halve the thickness (to 1 inch) and double the area (to 450 square feet). The DC for a Strength check to break it is either 22 (for a 1-inch-thick wall) or 24 (for a 2-inch-thick wall).

Despite the name, you can use *wall of stone* to build almost anything—a bridge, a throne, whatever you can come up with as long as it merges with and is supported solidly by existing stone. If the *wall of stone* is made to go over a span of more than 20 feet, it must be buttressed, cutting its overall area in half.

**Casting:** 450 gp (Clr9 or Wiz9) or 500 gp (Sor10) or 660 gp (Drd11)

**Web**

A permanent *web* proves of limited value as a building material unless you happen to be an intelligent monstrous spider. However, it makes a good trap. While it’s tempting to cover the outside of your stronghold with permanent *webs*—perhaps giving rise to local rumors that you’re some kind of spider worshiper—such spells don’t prove that useful if someone already knows of their existence. Intruders can easily burn them away, reducing your investment to ash.

Instead, put such things in the bottoms of shallow pits, especially if you are intent on capturing intruders rather than killing them. Alternatively, you can spread them across roofs to entangle airborne invaders, or even along the tops of outer walls to ensnare intruders as they top the battlement.

In any case, given enough time, most intelligent creatures can get free from a *web*. The obstruction is only there to slow intruders down and hold them still for a while. As such, you should put an *alarm* or *magic mouth* in the same locales. Optionally, your guard should patrol such areas regularly.

**Casting:** 60 gp (Wiz3) or 80 gp (Sor4)

**Permanent:** 5,500 gp (10th)

## Traps
Traps

Traps are an important means of protecting many

strongholds. They never sleep, cannot be distracted,

and they don’t take bribes.

The trick here is to be judicious. Though you want to

make your stronghold as safe as possible, it’s not worthwhile

to have every square foot of the place trapped.

People must get around it on a daily basis, after all.

If you would like to create your own traps, use the

following guidelines, originally presented in *Song and*

*Silence*.

\*\*These formulas supersede those given in the Creating Magic Traps section in Chapter 4 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*.

Step 1: Figure out the Concept

This step drives all the other decisions you’re going to

make. It’s the most important, but also the simplest

step—decide what you want the trap to do.

Types of Traps: A trap can be either mechanical or

magical. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps,

falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and

anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.

Magic traps are further divided into spell and magic

device categories. Spell traps are simply spells that

themselves function as traps, such as *fire trap* or *glyph of*

*warding.* Magic device traps initiate spell effects when

activated, just as wands, rods, rings, or other magic

items do. The rules for cost, CR, and construction differ

depending on the type of trap you intend to make.

Elements of a Trap: All traps—mechanical or magical—

must have the following elements: trigger, reset,

Search DC, Disable Device DC, attack bonus (or saving

throw or onset delay), damage/effect, and Challenge

Rating. Some of these elements may be more or less

important than others, and some traps may also

include optional elements, such as poison or a bypass.

Step 2: Determine the Trigger and Reset

Now that you have a general idea of what you want

your trap to do, you can start defining the specifics.

The choices you make here may result in adjustments

to the CR and cost of the trap, as given on Tables 2–2

and 2–3. Keep a running total of these adjustments;

you’ll need them in Step 4.

Trigger

The trigger element determines how the trap is

sprung. Each trigger type is described in detail below.

Location: A location trigger springs a trap when

someone stands in a particular square. For example, a

covered pit trap typically activates when a creature

steps on a certain spot. This trigger is the most

common type for mechanical traps.

Proximity: This trigger activates the trap when a

creature approaches within a certain distance of it. A

proximity trigger differs from a location trigger in that

the creature need not be standing in a particular

square. Creatures that are flying can spring a trap with

a proximity trigger but not one with a location trigger.

Mechanical proximity triggers are extremely sensitive

to the slightest change in the air. This, of course, makes

them useful only in places such as crypts, where the air

is unusually still.

The *alarm* spell functions as a proximity trigger for

magic device traps. You can voluntarily reduce the area

of the spell to make it cover a smaller area.

Some magic device traps have special proximity triggers

that activate only when certain kinds of creatures

approach. To build such a trigger, add an appropriate

spell (usually a divination) to the trap so that it can differentiate among approaching creatures. For example,

a *detect good* spell can serve as a proximity trigger on an

evil altar, springing the attached trap only when someone

of good alignment gets close enough to it.

Sound: This magic trigger springs the trap when it

detects any sound. A sound trigger functions like an

ear and has a +15 bonus on Listen checks. Silent movement,

magical silence, and other effects that would

negate hearing defeat it. To build a sound trigger, add

*clairaudience* to the trap you’re building.

Visual: This magic trigger works like an actual eye,

springing the trap whenever it “sees” something. To

incorporate a visual trigger into your trap, add one of

the spells listed on the following table. Sight range and

the Spot bonus conferred depend on the spell chosen,

as shown.

**Spell Sight Range Spot Bonus**

*Arcane eye* Line of sight (unlimited range) +20

*Clairvoyance* One preselected location +15

*True seeing* Line of sight (up to 120 ft.) +30

If you want the trap to “see” in the dark, you must

either choose the *true seeing* option or add *darkvision* to

the trap as well. (*Darkvision* limits the trap’s sight range

in the dark to 60 feet.) If invisibility, disguises, or illusions

can fool the spell being used, they can fool the

visual trigger as well.

Touch: A touch trigger, which springs the trap

when touched, is generally the simplest kind to construct.

This trigger may be physically attached to the

part of the mechanism that deals the damage (such as

a needle that springs out of a lock), or it may not. You

can make a magic touch trigger by adding *alarm* to the

trap and reducing the spell’s area to cover only the

trigger spot.

Timed: This trigger periodically springs the trap

after a certain duration has passed. A sharpened pendulum

that sweeps across a hallway every 4 rounds is an

example of a timed trigger.

Spell: All spell traps have this type of trigger. The

appropriate spell descriptions in the *Player’s Handbook*

explain the trigger conditions for each of these traps.

Reset

A reset element is simply the set of conditions under

which a trap becomes ready to trigger again. The available

types are explained below.

No Reset: Short of completely rebuilding the trap,

there’s no way to trigger it more than once. Spell traps

have the no reset element.

Repair Reset: To get the trap functioning again, you

must repair it.

Manual Reset: Resetting the trap requires someone

to move the parts back into place. It’s the standard reset

for most mechanical traps.

Automatic Reset: The trap resets itself, either

immediately or after a timed interval. Magic device

traps get this feature at no cost.

Bypass (Optional Element)

If you plan to move past a trap yourself, it’s a good idea

to build in a bypass mechanism—something that temporarily

disarms the trap. Bypass elements are typically

used only with mechanical traps; spell traps usually

have built-in allowances for the caster to bypass them.

The check DCs given below are minimums; raising

them alters the base cost as shown on Table 2–2.

Lock: A lock bypass requires an Open Lock check

(DC 30) to open.

Hidden Switch: A hidden switch requires a Search

check (DC 25) to locate.

Hidden Lock: A hidden lock combines the features

above, requiring a Search check (DC 25) to locate and

an Open Lock check (DC 30) to open.

Step 3: Figure out the Numbers

Now that you have figured out the trigger, reset, and

bypass elements, it’s time to define the trap itself. You

need DCs for Search and Disable Device, plus attack/

saving throw and damage/effect information. Keep

your list of cost and CR adjustments running; many of

these elements also change those factors.

Search and Disable Device DCs

The builder sets the Search and Disable Device DCs for

a mechanical trap. For a magic trap, the values depend

on the highest-level spell used.

Mechanical Trap: The base DC for both Search and

Disable Device checks is 20. Raising or lowering

either of these affects the base cost and CR as shown

on Table 2–2.

Magic Trap: The DC for both Search and Disable

Device checks is equal to 25 + spell level of the highestlevel

spell used. Only characters with the traps ability

can attempt either check. These values do not affect

the trap’s cost or CR.

Other Ways to Beat a Trap

It’s possible to ruin many traps without using Disable

Device, of course. Some possibilities are listed below.

Ranged Attack Traps: Once you know the trap is

there, the obvious way to disable it is to smash the

mechanism—assuming you have access to it. Failing

that, you can plug up the holes from which the missiles

emerge. This option not only gives you total

cover relative to the trap, but it also prevents the trap

from firing unless its ammunition does enough

damage to break through the plugs. This option also

works for magic traps with effects that have obvious

emergence points.

Melee Attack Traps: You can disable these devices

by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons,

as noted above. Alternatively, if you study the trap as it

triggers, you might be able to time your dodges just

right to avoid damage. If you are doing nothing but

studying the trap when it first goes off, you gain a +4

dodge bonus against its attacks if you trigger it again

within the next minute. (After that, you forget the

exact timing and arc of the attack, so no bonus applies.)

Pits: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the

trap door, making it an uncovered pit. Options such

as filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge

across it are applications of manual labor, not Disable

Device. You could also disable any spikes at the

bottom of the pit by attacking them—they break just

like daggers do.

Magic Traps: *Dispel magic* works wonders here. If

you succeed at a caster level check against the creator’s

level, you suppress the trap for 1d4 rounds. This

works only with a targeted *dispel magic,* not the area

version.

Attacks/Saving Throws

A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a

saving throw to avoid it. Consult one or more of following

sections to determine which option is appropriate

for your trap, based on its type. Occasionally, a trap

uses both of these options, or neither (see Never-Miss,

page 29).

Pits: These are holes (covered or not) that characters

can fall into and take damage. A pit needs no attack

roll, but a successful Reflex save (DC set by the

builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical

traps also fall into this category.

Ranged Attack Traps: These traps fling darts,

arrows, spears, or the like at whoever activated the trap.

The builder sets the attack bonus.

Melee Attack Traps: These traps include sharp

blades that emerge from walls and stone blocks that

fall from ceilings. Once again, the builder sets the

attack bonus.

Damage/Effect

The effect of a trap is simply what happens to those

who spring it. Usually this takes the form of either

damage or a spell effect, but some traps have special

effects.

If your trap does hit point damage, calculate the

average damage for a successful hit and round that

value to the nearest multiple of 7. (Damage from poisons

and pit spikes does not count toward this value,

but mighty damage and extra damage from multiple

attacks does. For example, if a trap fires 1d4 darts at

each target, the average damage is the average number

of darts × the average damage per dart, rounded to the

nearest multiple of 7, or 2.5 darts ×2.5 points of damage

= 6.25 points, which rounds to 7.) Consult Table 2–2 to

determine the CR bonus.

Pits: Falling into a pit deals 1d6 points of damage

per 10 feet of depth.

Ranged Attack Traps: These traps deal whatever

damage their ammunition normally would. A trap that fires longbow arrows, for example, deals 1d8 points of

damage per hit. You can also build mighty traps that

deal extra damage. For example, a mighty (+4 Str

bonus) ranged attack trap that fires shortspears could

deal up to 1d8+4 points of damage per successful hit.

Melee Attack Traps: These traps deal the same

damage as the melee weapons they “wield.” In the case

of a falling stone block, you can assign any bludgeoning

damage you like, but remember that whoever

resets the trap has to lift that stone back into place. You

can also build mighty traps that deal extra damage.

Spell Traps: Spell traps produce the spell’s effect as

described in the appropriate entry in the *Player’s Handbook*.

as with all spells, each spell-based trap that allows

a saving throw has a save DC equal to 10 + spell level +

caster’s relevant ability modifier.

Magic Device Traps: These traps produce the

effects of any spells included, as described in the

appropriate entries in the *Player’s Handbook.* If the spell

in a magic device trap allows a saving throw at all, its

save DC equals 10 + spell level ×1.5. Some spells make

attack rolls instead.

Special: Some traps have miscellaneous features

that produce special effects, such as drowning for a

water trap or ability damage for poison. Saving throws

and damage depend on the poison (see Table 2–1) or

are set by the builder, as appropriate.

Miscellaneous Trap Features

Some traps include optional features that can make

them considerably more deadly. The most common

such features are listed below.

Alchemical Device: Mechanical traps may incorporate

alchemical devices or other special substances or

items, such as tanglefoot bags, alchemist’s fire, thunderstones,

and the like. Some such items mimic spell effects.

For example, the effect of a tanglefoot bag is similar to

that of an *entangle* spell, and the effect of a thunderstone

is similar to that of a *deafness* spell. If the item mimics a

spell effect, it increases the CR as shown on Table 2–2.

Gas: With a gas trap, the danger is in the inhaled

poison it delivers. Traps employing gas usually have

the never-miss and onset delay features.

Never-Miss: When the entire dungeon wall moves

to crush you, your quick reflexes won’t help, since the

wall can’t possibly miss. A trap with this feature has

neither an attack bonus nor a saving throw to avoid,

but it does have an onset delay (see below). Most water

and gas traps are also never-miss.

Multiple-Target: Traps with this feature can affect

more than one character.

Onset Delay: An onset delay is the amount of time

between when the trap is sprung and when it inflicts

damage. A never-miss trap always has an onset delay.

Poison: Traps that employ poison are deadlier than

their nonpoisonous counterparts, so they have correspondingly

higher CRs. To determine the CR modifier

for a given poison, consult Table 2–4, above. Only

injury, contact, and inhaled poisons are suitable for

traps; ingested types are not.

Some traps (such as a table covered with contact

poison) simply deal the poison’s damage. Others,

such as poisoned arrows, deliver ranged or melee

attacks as well.

Table 2–18: CR Modifiers by Poison Type

**Poison Type CR Modifier**

Black adder venom +1

Black lotus extract +8

Bloodroot +1

Blue whinnis +1

Burnt othur fumes +6

Carrion crawler brain juice +1

Deathblade +5

Dragon bile +6

Giant wasp poison +3

Greenblood oil +1

Insanity mist +4

Large scorpion venom +3

Malyss root paste +3

Medium-size spider venom +2

Nitharit +4

Purple worm poison +4

Sassone leaf residue +3

Shadow essence +3

Small centipede poison +1

Terinav root +5

Ungol dust +3

Wyvern poison +5

Pit Spikes: Treat spikes at the bottom of a pit as daggers,

each with a +10 attack bonus. The damage bonus

for each spike is +1 per 10 feet of pit depth (to a maximum

of +5). 1d4 spikes attack each character who falls

into the pit. Pit spikes do not add to the average

damage of the trap (see above), nor do their damage

bonuses constitute mighty damage.

Pit Bottom: If there’s something other than spikes

at the bottom of a pit, it’s best to treat that as a separate

trap (see multiple traps, below) with a location trigger

that activates on any significant impact, such as a

falling character. Possibilities for pit bottom traps

include acid, monsters, or water (which reduces the

falling damage; see the Obstacles, Hazards, and Traps

section in Chapter 4 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*).

Touch Attack: This feature applies to any trap that

needs only a successful touch attack (melee or ranged)

to hit.

Water: Any trap that involves a danger of drowning

(such as a locked room filling with water or a patch of

quicksand that characters can fall into) is in this category.

Traps employing water usually have the nevermiss

and onset delay features (see above).

CR for the Trap

To calculate the CR for a trap, add all the CR modifiers

collected above to the base CR value for the trap type.

Mechanical Trap: The base CR for a mechanical

trap is 0. If your final CR is 0 or below, add features

until you get a CR of 1 or better.

Magic Trap: For a spell or magic device trap, the

base CR is 1. Only the highest-level spell used modifies

the CR.

Multiple Traps: If a trap is two or more connected

traps that affect approximately the same area, determine

the CR of each one separately.

*Multiple Dependent Traps:* If one trap depends on the

success of the other (that is, you can avoid the second

trap altogether by not falling victim to the first), they

must be treated as two separate traps.

*Multiple Independent Traps:* If two or more traps act

independently (that is, neither depends on the success

of the other to activate), use their CRs to determine

their combined Encounter Level as though they were

monsters, according to Table 4–1 in the *DUNGEON*

*MASTER’s Guide.* The resulting Encounter Level is the

CR for the combined traps.

Step 4: Figure out the Cost

Cost depends on the type of trap. Calculations are

given below for the three basic types.

Mechanical Trap

The base cost of a mechanical trap is 1,000 gp. Apply

all the modifiers from Table 2–2 for the various features

you have added to the trap to get the modified

base cost.

The market price is the modified base cost × the

Challenge Rating + extra costs. The minimum market

price for a mechanical trap is 100 gp per +1 CR.

After you have multiplied the modified base cost by

the Challenge Rating, add the price of any poison or

alchemical devices you incorporated into the trap. If

the trap uses one of these elements and has an automatic

reset, multiply the poison or alchemical device

cost by 20 to ensure an adequate supply.

Multiple Traps: If a trap is two or more connected

traps, determine the market price of each separately,

then add those values together. This holds for both

dependent and independent traps.

Magic Device Trap

A one-shot magic device trap costs 50 gp × caster level

× spell level + extra costs plus 4 XP × caster level ×

spell level. Magic traps with the automatic reset feature

cost 500 gp × caster level × spell level + extra costs plus

40 XP × caster level × spell level. If the trap uses more

than one spell (for instance, a sound or visual trigger

spell in addition to the main spell effect), you must pay

for them all (except *alarm*, which is free).

These costs assume that you are casting the necessary

spells yourself. If you are hiring an NPC spellcaster

to cast them, see the Special and Superior Items

section of Chapter 7 in the *Player’s Handbook* for costs.

Magic device traps take one day to build per 500

gp cost.

Spell Trap

A spell trap has a cost only if you hire an NPC spellcaster

to cast it. See the Special and Superior Items section

in Chapter 7 of the *Player’s Handbook* for these

costs.

Step 5: Craft the Trap

Now that you’re finished with the design, it’s time to

build the trap. Depending upon the components, this

may require purchasing raw materials, using the Craft

(trapmaking) skill, casting spells, or some combination

of these steps.

Mechanical Traps

Building a mechanical trap is a three-step process. You

must first calculate the DC for the Craft (trapmaking)

check, then purchase the raw materials, and finally

make a Craft (trapmaking) check every week until the

construction is finished.

The Craft Check DC: The base DC for the Craft

(trapmaking) check depends on the CR of the trap, as

given in Table 2–5.

Table 2–19: Craft (Trapmaking) DCs

**Trap CR Base Craft (Trapmaking) DC**

1–3 20

4–6 25

7–10 30

**Modifier to Craft**

**Additional Components (Trapmaking) DC**

Proximity trigger +5

Automatic reset +5

Add any modifiers from the second part of the table to

the base value obtained in the first part. The result is

the Craft (trapmaking) DC.

Buying Raw Materials: Raw materials (including

weapons, poison, and incidental items) typically cost a

total of one-third of the trap’s market price. At the DM’s

discretion, however, unusual traps may require raw

materials that aren’t available where the trap is being

constructed. This forces the builder to either undertake

a journey to obtain them or pay a higher cost. For

example, giant scorpion venom may not be readily available

to a character who’s fortifying a polar ice castle.

Making the Checks: To figure out how much progress

you make on the trap each week, make a Craft

(trapmaking) check. If it is successful, multiply the

check result by the DC for the check. The result is how

many gp worth of work you accomplished that week.

When your total gp completed equals or exceeds the

market price of the trap, it’s finished. If you fail the

check, you make no progress that week, and if you fail

the check by a margin of 5 or more, you ruin half the

raw materials and have to buy them again.

*Check Modifiers:* You need artisan’s tools to build a

proper trap. Using improvised tools imposes a –2 circumstance

penalty on the Craft (trapmaking) check,

but masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance

bonus. In addition, dwarves get a +2 racial

bonus on Craft (trapmaking) checks for building traps

that involve stone or metal.

*Assistance:* If the trap requires construction work, it

helps to have another set of hands available, even if

they’re unskilled. Unless the trap is so small that only

one person can effectively work on it at a time, the

help of one or more assistants speeds the work along.

As long as you have the optimal number of assistants

(DM’s decision as to how many that is) helping you,

you accomplish double the gp equivalent of work each

week that you could have alone.

Example Trap: Baltoi’s Rolling

Boulder

Here’s an example of how the trapmaking rules work.

Step 1 (Concept): Baltoi the dwarven rogue wants

to construct a trap to prevent incursions into her

underground lair. She has in mind a huge boulder that

rolls down the entry corridor, crushing the intruders.

Step 2 (Trigger, Reset, and Bypass): Baltoi has had

bad luck with flying intruders, so she wants a proximity

trigger—a very sensitive apparatus that starts the

rock rolling upon the slightest disturbance in the air. A

manual reset sounds fine to her, even though it’ll take

all her guards to roll the boulder back into position.

For a bypass, Baltoi opts for a well-hidden switch

(Search DC 30 to locate). The proximity trigger adds

+1,000 gp to the base cost and the bypass switch adds

another +400 gp. The manual reset doesn’t change the

cost. None of these components change the CR. *Base*

*cost modifier so far: +1,400 gp. CR modifier so far: +0.*

Step 3 (Numbers): Trying to save some money,

Baltoi doesn’t spend too much effort hiding the big

hole in the ceiling through which the boulder drops.

She reduces the Search DC to 16, thus shaving 400 gp

from the base cost. As a point of pride in dwarven

stonecraft, she leaves the Disable Device DC at 20.

The rolling boulder is a melee attack, and Baltoi

wants to make sure it connects. Therefore, she decides

to increase its attack bonus to +15, which adds +1,000

gp to the base cost and increases the CR by +1.

Baltoi picks a boulder big enough to do 6d6 points of

damage. Its average damage is 21 points (+3 CR for

high average damage), and it’s wide enough to hit two

intruders standing abreast (+1 CR for multiple targets).

Step 4 (Cost): The base cost is 1,000 gp. Adding the

base cost modifier of +2,000 gp gives Baltoi a modified

base cost of 3,000 gp. Multiplying that by the final CR

value (5) gives the market price of the trap: 15,000 gp.

Step 5 (Craft): Table 2–5 gives the base DC for a CR

5 trap as 25. Adding the +5 modifier for the proximity

trigger gives a final Craft (trapmaking) DC of 30. Baltoi

buys 5,000 gp worth of raw materials (one-third of the

trap’s market price) and gets to work.

Baltoi normally has a Craft (trapmaking) bonus of

+19. For the purpose of this trap, she gets an additional

+2 for being a dwarf working with stone and another

+2 for using masterwork tools, giving her a total Craft

(trapmaking) bonus of +23. Her first roll is a 15.

Adding 23 gives her a check result of 38—success!

Multiplying 38 by the DC for the check (30) results in

1,140 gp worth of work completed the first week. The

DM says that five assistants would be useful building

such a trap, and she easily has that many helpers to call

upon in her complex. Her assistants double the

amount of work completed, giving her a first-week

total of 2,280 gp.

Building such a trap is no easy task, it

seems! Assuming average rolls, it’ll take

Baltoi another seven weeks to complete

the trap. Maybe the proximity trigger

was a poor choice....

**Repairing and Resetting Mechanical Traps**

Repairing a trap requires a

Craft (trapmaking) check

against a DC equal to the one

for building it in the first

place. The cost for raw materials

is one-fifth of the trap’s

original market price. To calculate

how long it takes to fix

a trap, use the same calculations

you would for building

it, but substitute the cost of

the raw materials required for

repair for the market price.

Resetting a trap usually

takes only a minute or so—

you have to lever the trapdoor

back into place, reload the

crossbow behind the wall, or

push the poisoned needle

back into the lock. For a trap

with a more difficult reset,

such as Baltoi’s boulder, the

DM should set the time and

manpower required.

## Weapons
Ballistas, catapults, and rams function as

described in Chapter 5 of the *DUNGEON*

*MASTER’s Guide.* In addition to those

weapons, those who make careers out of

attacking and defending strongholds

have developed a wide variety of tools

(both mundane and magical) to ply

their trade.

Ballistas and catapults are commonly

affixed atop towers inside strongholds,

but they work just as well for those

attacking a stronghold. Their great

weight requires multiple heavy horses to

move them about.

Table 2–20: Siege Weapons

**Weapon Cost Damage Critical Range Increment Weight Crew**

Ballista 500 gp 3d6 ×3 120 ft. 800 lb. 1

Ballista bolt 1 gp — — — 9 lb. —

Catapult, heavy 800 gp 5d6 — 200 ft. (100 ft. minimum) 2,400 lb. 5

Catapult stone, heavy 1 gp — — — 50 lb. —

Catapult, light 550 gp 3d6 — 150 ft. (100 ft. minimum) 1,200 lb. 2

Catapult stone, light 1 gp — — — 25 lb. —

Trebuchet 1,200 gp 6d6 — 250 ft. (125 ft. minimum) 3,600 lb. 5

Trebuchet stone 1 gp — — — 60 lb. —

Trebuchet: The trebuchet is a massive

sling that hurls large stones even farther

than a heavy catapult can. It uses the

same targeting rules as a catapult (see the

Siege Engines section in Chapter 5 of

the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*). It can fire

once every 12 rounds. It can’t be used

effectively unless the complete crew is

present. As with catapults, initial set up

and aiming time for a trebuchet is 10 minutes.

Masterwork siege weapons cost an additional 1,000

gp. These can receive all the magical enhancements that

standard ranged weapons can. For example, a *+1 ballista*

costs 3,500 gp, and a *+2 flaming heavy catapult* costs

19,800 gp. Note that the enhancement bonus of a siege

weapon or ammunition adds either to the attack roll

(for a ballista) or to the Profession (siege engineer) skill

check (for catapults and trebuchets), as appropriate.

The weapon list assumes standard ammunition (catapult

stones or ballista bolts). Masterwork catapult and

trebuchet stones and masterwork ballista bolts cost 10 gp each, and they can receive magical enhancements at

the same price as arrows or other ammunition (in

batches of 50). In addition, various forms of special

siege weapon ammunition exist, as described below.

Table 2–21: Special Ammunition

\*Alchemical item.

Special Ammunition

Ballista Bolt of Healing: Unlike most weapons,

this white ballista bolt is fired close to allied troops, not

aimed at the enemy. One round after it lands, everyone

within 20 feet of the bolt is cured of 1d8+5 points of

damage. Well-trained troops know to rush toward the

ballista bolt when they see it land nearby.

The *ballista bolt of healing* deals 1d8+5 points of

damage to undead within 20 feet on the round after it

lands.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *healing circle; Market Price:* 2,260 gp.

Ballista Bolt of the Walking Dead: If this ballista

bolt kills a target of up to 5 HD, the target arises as a

zombie 1d3 rounds later. The zombie will attack the

nearest living creature every round until slain.

*Caster Level:* 5th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *animate dead; Market Price:* 810 gp.

Banshee Stone: This catapult stone gives a keening

wail as it flies through the air. When it lands, all creatures

with less than 6 HD within a 15-foot radius must

succeed at a Will save (DC 13) or become frightened.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *scare; Market Price:* 310 gp.

Deathstone: A 30-foot wide, 20-foot high bank of

yellowish-green poison gas emerges from this catapult

(or trebuchet) stone on impact. The cloud kills creatures

with 3 or fewer HD (no save), causes creatures

with 4–6 HD to make Fortitude saves (DC 17) or die.

Those with more than 6 HD and those who survive the

Fortitude save take 1d10 points of damage each round

in the cloud.

The cloud moves away from the impact point at a

speed of 10 ft. It can be dispersed by wind just as a *fog*

*cloud* can.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *cloudkill; Market Price:* 2,260 gp.

Explodestone: This catapult (or trebuchet) stone

becomes a 5d6 *fireball* on impact (DC 14). It is consumed

in the attack.

*Caster Level:* 5th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *fireball; Market Price:* 760 gp.

Flaming Catapult Stone: This catapult (or trebuchet)

stone has a secondary bulb that breaks on

impact, releasing alchemist’s fire. On the round following

a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points

of fire damage. The target can take a full-round action to

attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this

additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving

throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames, and rolling on

the ground allows the character a +2 bonus. The flaming

catapult stone deals splash damage to targets within

5 feet of where it lands, just as with alchemist’s fire.

*Cost:* 30 gp.

Fogstone: Often used to provide cover for advancing

troops, the fogstone is a catapult (or trebuchet)

stone that covers a 30-foot radius area with a 20-foot

high fogbank within 1 round of impact. The fog

obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.

This fog can be dispersed by the wind just as the *fog*

*cloud* spell can.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *fog cloud; Market Price:* 310 gp.

Greenroot Ballista Bolt: Favored by elves, this ballista

bolt brings the forest to life around it when it

strikes. Trees, bushes, and undergrowth within 40 feet

of the impact point entwine themselves around creatures

(as the *entangle* spell cast by a 1st-level cleric).

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *entangle; Market Price:* 60 gp.

Illuminating Ballista Bolt: This bolt ignites like a

sunrod when loaded into the ballista, burning for 6

hours or until extinguished. Making an illumination

ballista bolt requires an Alchemy check (DC 25) and

follows the normal rules for crafting items.

*Cost:* 20 gp.

Lolth’s Egg: This catapult (or trebuchet) bursts open

on impact, sending tendrils of sticky webbing in all

directions, just as if a *web* spell had been cast centered

on the stone’s hit location.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *web; Market Price:* 310 gp.

Stormbolt: This ballista bolt becomes a 5d6 *lightning*

*bolt* when fired (DC 14). It is consumed in the

attack.

*Caster Level:* 5th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *lightning bolt; Market Price:* 760 gp.

Rams

The ram described in Chapter 5 of the *DUNGEON*

*MASTER’s Guide* weighs 1,000 pounds, so it’s a heavy

load for a crew of 10 Medium-size soldiers with

Strength 10. The superstructure of the ram usually

includes a roof that provides three-quarters cover

from ground-level foes and full cover from enemies

above. The roof is typically 6 inches of wood (hardness

5, 60 hit points).

Some armies equip soldiers with smaller, more

portable battering rams. The portable ram described in

Chapter 7 of the *Player’s Handbook* does 2d6 points of

damage to structures if two attackers wield it together,

and both attackers apply their Strength modifier to the

damage. The portable ram is too unwieldy to use as a

weapon against a moving opponent, however.

Battering rams (full-size or portable) can be enhanced

just as any other siege weapon. Some common

enhancements are listed below.

Ram of the Mighty Bellow: This *+1 ram*, capped

with the metal sculpture of a shouting head, deals 2d6

points of sonic damage in addition to its 4d6 points of

normal damage with each blow.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *shout; Market Price:* 21,000 gp.

Burrowing Ram: This ram, tipped with a massive

drill-like screw, starts turning of its own volition when

it comes into contact with a flat surface. It deals 4d6

points of damage every round for a minute, as long as

the crew can hold it against the target. It can burrow in

such a manner three times a day.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, *animate object; Market Price:* 30,000 gp.

Siege Towers

The siege tower described in Chapter 5 of the *DUNGEON*

*MASTER’s Guide* weighs 1,600 pounds empty, so a team of

horses will probably be necessary to wheel it into position.

The siege tower is essentially a 0.5-space guard

post (300 gp) placed three stories up (400 gp ×0.5

spaces) and given two layers of wood wall (1,000 gp

×0.5 spaces). You can build taller, more durable, or

more spacious siege towers by using the stronghold

construction rules in Chapter 2.

## Wondrous Architecture
**Wondrous Architecture**

Chapter 3: Strongholds in the Campaign discusses how best to use existing magic items—as described in the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*—in a stronghold. In this section, we introduce a number of new magic items of special interest to the builder or owner of a stronghold. Wondrous architecture are essentially immobile (or largely immobile) magic items, and follow all the normal rules for using such items.

Remember that dungeons are a form of stronghold. Even when you’re not building strongholds for characters, you can use the wondrous architecture presented here to spice up your dungeons.

Add some surprises to your next dungeon-crawl adventure.

If you want to have a continuing magic effect in use in your stronghold, and it’s not something you can find in the *Player’s Handbook* or the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*, then you should build it yourself. For this, use the rules on creating magic items in Chapter 8 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*.

**Creating Wondrous Architecture**

To create wondrous architecture (stationary or bulky versions of wondrous items), the character needs the proper tools and equipment to work on the item in question, whatever it may be. She also needs a supply of certain materials. The first and foremost of these is the item to be enchanted.

Unlike with other magic items, the cost of an architectural item is not subsumed into the cost of creating the item. Any other materials needed are covered in this basic cost, but the item itself must be purchased or obtained separately.

If the item has a permanent spell effect, the costs are simple to determine. They depend only on one factor: whether the item in question is removable or an embedded part of the stronghold.

If the item is bulky but technically removable—like a statue, a tapestry, or a rug—the cost to imbue it with a permanent spell effect is 1,000 gp × the spell level × the caster level.

For example, a *guardian statue* is a normal statue that has had the *alarm* spell permanently infused into it. Since *alarm* is a 1st-level spell and can be cast by a 1st-level caster, the cost for giving the statue this ability is (1,000 ×1 ×1) = 1,000 gp. The cost of the statue is entirely separate. In this way, the character can give this magic ability to any statue that she likes, no matter how artistic or mundane, and pay the original cost.

If the item is not movable at all—if it’s actually a part of the stronghold and would be damaged or destroyed if removed—then the cost is 500 gp × the spell level × the caster level.

For example, an *ambassador’s chamber* is a room in which everyone inside is affected by *friendship*, as listed under the *emotion* spell. Since *emotion* is a 3rd-level bard spell and can be cast by a 7th-level bard, the cost for giving the room this ability is (500 ×3 ×7 =) 10,500 gp. Building the room, of course, is paid for normally.

If the prerequisites for making the item include one or more spells, the creator must have the spells prepared ahead of time or, in the case of a sorcerer or a bard, at least know the spells. She does not have to provide any material components or focuses the spell requires, nor are any XP costs inherent in any of these spells incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the spell triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting on any of the days that the creator is working on the item. Those spell slots are expended from the creator’s currently prepared or known spells, just as if they had been cast in the course of an adventure.

Creating some items may involve meeting other prerequisites than simply being able and available to cast the spells in question. See the individual descriptions of the various magic items for full details.

Crafting wondrous architecture requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the worth of the created item. Creating the *ambassador’s chamber* described above, for instance, would require eleven days of work on the part of the creator.

**Disabling Wondrous Architecture**

As a stationary magic item, wondrous architecture is essentially identical to a magic trap (even though some have beneficial rather than harmful effects), such items can be discovered by a rogue (or other character capable of finding traps) and deactivated with a Disable Device skill check. The DC for both Search and Disable Device checks is equal to 25 + the spell level of the highest-level spell used in the construction of the wondrous architecture.

A successful Disable Device check against an item of wondrous architecture suppresses its magic properties for 1d4 rounds (just as if you had successfully cast *dispel magic* against the item). If you beat the check by 10 or more, you suppress its magic properties for 1d4 minutes instead.
