# Musclebound (Trait)
## Overview
**Musclebound**

You are good at almost everything that requires strength, but less adept than most at tasks that require coordination.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Strength-based skill checks and ability checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait are likely to solve problems with physical strength rather than through trickery or finesse.
