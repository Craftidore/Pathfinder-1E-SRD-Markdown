# Defensive Feedback
## Overview
**Defensive Feedback**

Rather than dissipate damaging energy, you can redirect some of it back to its source. When an abjuration spell you cast prevents damage (with damage reduction or energy resistance), if the attacking creature is within 30 feet of the protected creature, the foe takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 points of damage prevented.
