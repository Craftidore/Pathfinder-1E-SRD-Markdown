# Exalted Arcanist (PrC)
## Overview
Tales say that sorcerers gain their innate magical ability from draconic

blood, and many sorcerers (especially kobold sorcerers)

loudly champion this legend. Aasimar sorcerers, meanwhile,

smile to themselves, knowing that dragons are not the only

source of spontaneous arcane power. Among both sorcerers and

bards, some trace the source of their power back to celestial influence,

either bloodline or simply favor. These are the exalted

arcanists, spontaneous spellcasters who gain access to spells that

channel celestial energy.

Only characters who spontaneously cast arcane spells can

become exalted arcanists, which means that in most campaigns

the class is limited to sorcerers and bards.

Exalted arcanists are very often adventurers, using the power

they consider a gift to the purpose for which it was intended: to

help combat evil. They gravitate to places where their ability to

cover a battlefield with holy smite spells is useful, so they are

rarely found in cities or placid villages. They frequently join

forces with other exalted adventurers, much less frequently

with other exalted arcanists.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features

of the exalted arcanist prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Exalted arcanists gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Exalted Spell List: An exalted arcanist gains access to spells

that do not normally appear on arcane spellcasters’ spell lists.

The exalted arcanist’s spell list additions appear below. At 1st

level, an exalted arcanist adds the spells of up to 3rd level to her

spell list, and each additional exalted arcanist level grants her

access to two more spell levels on the spell list. She does not

automatically know these spells, but can choose them as spells

known.

Spell Knowledge (Ex): At 1st level, an exalted arcanist learns

two new arcane spells of any level up to the maximum spell

level she can cast. These can be spells from her normal spell list

or from the exalted spell list that appears below. She does not

gain any extra spell slots at this level.

Faster Consecrate (Ex): At 2nd level, an exalted arcanist can

spontaneously cast spells with the Consecrate Spell feat without

extending the spells’ casting time.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each exalted arcanist level

after the first, the character gains new spells per day and spells

known as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting

class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class

level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character

of that class would have gained (bardic music abilities,

improved familiar abilities, and so on), though she does retain

the ability to exchange spells known with every even-numbered

equivalent sorcerer or bard level. If the character had more than

one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an exalted arcanist,

she must decide to which class she adds each exalted arcanist

level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Bonus Exalted Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 5th level, an

exalted arcanist gains a bonus feat. This feat must be chosen

from the exalted feats that appear in Chapter 4.

Faster Purify (Ex): At 4th level, an exalted arcanist can spontaneously

cast spells with the Purify Spell feat without extending

the spells’ casting time.

Sanctified Spells: A 5th-level exalted arcanist can use sanctified

spells as though they were among her spells known.

EXALTED ARCANIST SPELL LIST

Exalted arcanists choose their spells from the following list or

from their normal spell list:

1st Level: bless, vision of heaven\*

2nd Level: consecrate, zone of truth

3rd Level: helping hand, searing light

4th Level: holy smite, lesser aspect of the deity\*, lesser planar ally,

sword of conscience\*

5th Level: crown of flame\*, hallow, heavenly lightning\*, mark of

justice

6th Level: aspect of the deity\*, bolt of glory\*, planar ally

7th Level: heavenly lightning storm\*, holy word, righteous smite\*

8th Level: greater planar ally, holy aura

9th Level: greater aspect of the deity\*
