# Sewer Access (Room)
## Overview
**Sewer Access**

**Create** 2 Goods, 1 Influence, 2 Labor (110 gp); **Time** 4 days 

**Size** 4â€“6 squares 

A Sewer Access might be a tunnel or room, or something as simple as a sturdy trap door in the floor. Constructing it requires a settlement with a sewer or septic system, and connects some part of the building to that system. You can use this as an [[Escape Route (Room)|Escape Route]], but only to get to and from the sewer. The door to the sewer is a strong wooden door with a good lock. For an additional 500 gp, it has an iron door instead. If you have a [[Lavatory (Room)|Lavatory]] and Sewer Access, you may automatically connect the [[Lavatory (Room)|Lavatory]] to the sewer with indoor plumbing.
