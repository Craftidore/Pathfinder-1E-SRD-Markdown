# Water Sense (Ex)
## Overview
*Water Sense (Ex):* The barbarian’s senses are no longer fooled by the rippling surface and confounding ref lections seen in water that is being used as cover by her foes. While the barbarian is raging and on land, opponents in the water gain only partial cover from her attacks, instead of improved cover. In addition, while on land and targeting an opponent in water, she takes only a –1 penalty on attacks with ranged weapons (including thrown weapons) for every 5 feet of water they pass through (instead of the usual –2 penalty for every 5 feet of water).
