# Wild Plains Outrider (PrC)
## Overview
The wild plains demand constant vigilance from those

who wander their spaces. While moving through such

areas, groups of nomads, adventurers, and even armies

call upon the services of specially trained outriders. These

scouts and wanderers work tirelessly to keep the plains

as safe as such remote places can be.

The many dangers of the plains necessitate trust

between mount and rider, and the two must move as

one—whether on a week-long trek covering hundreds

of miles or in a short, bloody combat against a group of

goblins. The wild plains outriders, a group of powerful

rangers and druids who have gathered together to protect

the plains and those who cross them, work to perfect this

bond between mount and rider.

Joining the wild plains outriders requires a special bond

with a mount of some kind, so all outriders must have at

least a few levels of druid, ranger, or paladin. Beyond that

requirement, the life of an outrider demands survival,

tracking, and combat skills that appeal more to rangers

than to members of other classes. Although barbarians

and scouts must multiclass before gaining levels in the

outrider prestige class, they often find the class appealing.

Barbarians are drawn to the class because of an outrider’s

ability to travel great distances with a trusted mount and

because of their strong survival skills; scouts find that

the outrider’s skills and abilities mesh well with their

own expertise.

Adaptation: The wild plains outrider prestige class

can be tailored easily to fit a specific campaign, race,

culture, or organization. Simply add a minor aspect to the

requirements. For example, specifying that an outrider’s

animal companion or special mount must have a fly

speed and changing the name of the class to the “Skythunder

outrider” makes it a better fit for a reclusive but

powerful tribe of goblins called the Skythunder tribe.

Similar changes can make the class fit dwarf rangers

on dire boars, elf foresters on giant lizards, or human

nomads on wild horses.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a wild plains outrider, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Skills: Ride 9 ranks.

Feats: Mounted Combat, Track.

Special: Animal companion large enough to serve as

a mount, or a paladin’s special mount.

CLASS SKILLS

The wild plains outrider’s class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha),

Jump (Str), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), Survival

(Wis), and Swim (Str).

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the wild plains

outrider prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Wild plains outriders

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Animal Companion/Special Mount: A wild plains

outrider adds his outrider class levels to his effective

druid level (his actual druid level or one-half his ranger

level) to determine the capabilities of his animal companion.

Alternatively, he can add his outrider class levels

to his effective paladin level to determine the capabilities

of his special mount. However, he can only use one

of these abilities. The choice must be made when the

character enters the wild plains outrider class and can

never be changed.

Ride Bonus (Ex): A wild plains outrider gains a

competence bonus equal to his class level on all Ride

checks, as well as on Handle Animal checks made in

conjunction with his animal companion mount or

special mount.

Wild Plains Stalker (Ex): A wild plains outrider

knows how to move a mount stealthily through nearly

any terrain. His mount uses the outrider’s skill ranks,

rather than its own, to make Hide and Move Silently

checks. The mount still uses its own size, Dexterity, armor

check penalty, and other applicable modifiers when

making such checks.

Wild Plains Swiftness (Ex): A wild

plains outrider knows how to draw

every bit of speed possible from a

mount. At 2nd level and higher,

a wild plains outrider (while

mounted) increases his mount’s

base speed by 10 feet. This increase

affects every movement mode the

mount has, including fly, climb, and swim

speeds.

Wild Plains Offensive (Ex): Starting

at 3rd level, a wild plains outrider can make a

full attack with a melee weapon as long as his

mount takes only a single move.

Multiclassing Note: A paladin

can multiclass as a wild plains outrider

without losing her ability

to take additional levels in

paladin.
