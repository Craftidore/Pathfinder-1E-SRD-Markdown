# Deep Bond: Familiar
## Overview
**Deep Bond: Familiar**

Your arcane bond with your familiar is much stronger and deeper than that of most wizards.

**Prerequisite:** Arcane bond (familiar)

**Benefit:** Because of this bond, when you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less, you may choose to cast it as a full-round action, and have the spell originate at your familiar’s location (as if you were standing where your familiar is), rather than your own. You must have line of sight on your familiar, and you may only use this option a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier.

Because your bond to your familiar is so strong, Should the familiar die, you may not summon another familiar for 30 days or until you gain a wizard level, whichever comes first. During this 30‑day period, you take a -1 penalty to your caster level.
