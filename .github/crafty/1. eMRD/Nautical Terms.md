# Nautical Terms
## Overview
**Nautical Terms** 

Before further describing the sorts of vessels one might encounter on Golarion, it’s important to define a number of nautical terms not frequently used in non-nautical contexts. This may serve as both a glossary to aid in the understanding of content presented elsewhere in this book and a vocabulary primer GMs can use to spice up the flavor of a ship-based campaign. 

**Directions** 

Aboard a ship, one uses specialized terms to describe direction and position, either relative to the ship’s heading or on the ship itself. The following terms refer to location and direction aboard a nautical vessel. 

**Aloft and Alow:** In the upper and lower rigging of a sailing ship, respectively. 

**Beam and Abeam:** A vessel’s width, and at right angles to the centerline of the ship’s keel, respectively. 

**Belowdecks:** Beneath the solid “weather deck” of a ship. There is no “downstairs” aboard a ship. 

**Bow and Stern:** The forward-most and aft-most extensions of the deck. 

**Fore and Aft:** Forward and rearward aboard a ship. Also “afore” meaning in front of, and “abaft” meaning behind. 

**Port and Starboard:** The left and right direction or side, when facing the ship’s bow. 

**Parts of a Ship** 

The following terms are used to describe the various parts of a sailing ship or other seafaring vessel. 

**Bilge:** The lowest interior compartment of a vessel. 

**Bollard:** A post to which ropes are secured. 

**Boom:** A fore-and-aft rigged spar supporting the lower edge of a sail. 

**Bowsprit:** A spar extending forward from the bow to support forward sails. 

**Crow’s Nest:** A platform for a lookout near the top of a mast. 

**Draft:** Measure of how deep the ship is, from the keel to the waterline. 

**Forecastle:** The often-raised forward part of the weather deck of a vessel. Also called the “fo’c’sle.” 

**Gaff:** A spar to support the top of a fore-and-aft sail; also a hooked pole for landing fish. 

**Galley:** A vessel’s kitchen. 

**Helm:** A wheel or tiller by which a ship is steered. 

**Hull:** The outer body of a ship. 

**Jib:** A triangular sail suspended from a forward stay. 

**Keel:** The bottom of a hull, and the main source of a vessel’s structural strength. 

**Lateen Sail:** A fore-and-aft rigged triangular sail set on a sloping yard. 

**Launch:** Any small boat used to travel between the ship and a dock, shore, or another ship (such as a gig, cutter, jolly boat, barge, or pinnace). 

**Mast:** A long spar rising from the keel or deck of a ship and supporting the yards, booms, and rigging. 

**Mizzen:** Any rigging belonging to the aft-most mast of a ship. 

**Quarterdeck:** The part of the deck abaft of the mainmast. 

**Ratlines:** Ropes or lines that serve as steps for going aloft. 

**Sheet:** A rope for adjusting a sail. 

**Shroud:** Any rope converging from both sides of a ship to support a mast. 

**Spar:** Any pole meant to support a sail. 

**Stay:** Any rope for steadying masts on a fore-and-aft axis. 

**Sterncastle:** A ship’s enclosed, aft-most elevated portion. 

**Transom:** The flat back panel forming the stern of a ship. 

**Waist Deck:** The upper deck amidships—the working area of the deck. 

**Weather Deck:** The unenclosed deck or decks of a vessel, which are exposed to the weather. 

**Yard:** The spar from which square-rigged or lateen sails are supported.
