# Flight (Hex)
## Overview
*Flight (Su)*: The witch grows lighter as she gains power, eventually gaining the ability to fly. At 1st level, the witch can use *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* at will and gains a +4 racial bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. At 3rd level, she can cast *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]* once per day. At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
