# Generation School
## Overview
**Generation School**

**Associated School**: Evocation.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the intense spells and force missile powers of the evocation school.

**Lingering Evocations (Su)**: Any evocation spell you cast with a duration greater than instantaneous lasts an additional number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level, any dispel checks made against your evocation spells must be rolled twice, and your opponent must use the less favorable result.

**Wind Servant (Sp)**: As a standard action, you can generate a blast of air that hurls an unattended object (or objects) in your possession up to 30 feet in a straight line. If you have a free hand, you can catch an object hurled toward yourself. You can move objects weighing up to 1 pound per wizard level. Objects are not thrown with enough force to cause damage, although fragile objects like alchemical weapons shatter on contact with a creature or hard surface. To hit a creature with an object, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
