# Tattoo Magic
## Overview
Though known to almost any culture that practices ritual tattooing, tattoo magic is most often employed by Varisian spellcasters. Their tattooed sorcerers bind magic into intricate patterns upon their flesh, and even awaken tattoos into sentient art (details on the tattooed sorcerer archetype can be found on page 40 of *Inner Sea Magic*). Yet the wonders of tattoo magic are not limited to sorcerersâ€”any spellcaster can craft magical tattoos, given the proper training.
