# Artifact Spells
## Overview
The giants of Xen’drik developed spells and powers far beyond those of modern spellcasters. Their dragon-taught magic rained acid from the skies, tore the ground asunder, and shattered the connection between Eberron and Dal Quor. While much of this magic is now beyond the reach of all but epic spellcasters, some of the magical lore of the giants lives on. Scribed on large iron tablets or carved into stone walls, these secrets wait for those with the talent and tenacity to find them.

Anyone capable of casting a spell of the proper level and type (arcane or divine) can learn to cast an artifact spell. However, though artifact spells must be studied like any other, they are too complex and difficult to fully comprehend, and so they cannot be added to a caster’s normal repertoire. Those who study one of these spells gain the ability to prepare or spontaneously cast the spell only once.

A spellcaster must study the appropriate runes and formulas for 1d4 hours and succeed on a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 15 + twice the spell’s level) in order to comprehend an artifact spell. A failed check can be repeated in 24 hours. A character cannot take 10 on this check. Once an artifact spell has been learned, a character can cast the spell once during the next year. If it is not cast within one year, the spell fades and is lost. A character who prepares spells can prepare an artifact spell in an appropriate slot. If the artifact spell is not cast (if its spell slot is used for some other purpose, for example), it can be prepared again at a later date within the year. A character who casts spells spontaneously can simply cast the artifact spell using a spell slot of the appropriate level. Because an artifact spell is learned only temporarily, it does not replace one of a spontaneous caster’s known spells.

Artifact spells never have a material component or an arcane focus, though divine artifact spells might have a divine focus. An artifact spell can’t be modified by any metamagic feat or effect. An artifact spell cannot be made into a potion, scroll, or other magic item.

A caster cannot possess the ability to cast a given artifact spell more than once, although once cast (or if lost after a year has passed), the spell can be renewed if the ancient source is studied again. Artifact spells are always scribed on some large, immovable object, such as an immense stone wall, or inscribed on the facets of a towering crystal pillar. As such, they cannot be transported, and are far too complex to translate into written form or copy as rubbings. Those wishing to learn an artifact spell must travel to its ancient site and learn from the source.

Rumors hold that portable artifact spells exist in giant-crafted forms, perhaps as heavy adamantine books or priceless gems that reveal the formulas when the correct light is shone through them. Such portable repositories would be nearly priceless.

These spells need to be entered:

ACIDIC ERUPTION

Evocation \[Acid] and Transmutation

**Artifact Spell Level:** Arcane 5

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area:** 20-ft.-radius cylinder, 50 feet high

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half

**Spell Resistance:** No

*The ground blasts upward in a spray of broken earth and caustic*

*black acid.*

You create a vertical cylinder of acid that throws creatures

up into the air. Those in the area take 1d6 points

of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). They

are tossed into the air to a height of 50 feet, taking falling

damage as normal unless they can halt their subsequent

descent. Those who strike some other surface

before reaching their maximum height take 1d6 points

of damage per 10 feet of ascent before falling back to the

ground. A creature that makes a successful Reflex save is

not tossed into the air and takes half damage from the

caustic spray.

INFERNO SPIRAL

Evocation \[Fire]

**Level:** Arcane 3

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** 60 ft.

**Area:** 60-ft. line

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

*A line of white-hot flame spirals out from your finger, burning all creatures*

*and objects in its path.*

You shoot a line of fire that deals 1d8 points of fire

damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) to each creature

within its area. The spiraling bolt sets fi re to combustibles

and damages objects in its path. If the damage

is sufficient to burn through a barrier that blocks its

path, the *inferno spiral* continues if its range permits;

otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell

effect does.

RENEW

Conjuration (Healing)

**Level:** Divine 2

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will half (harmless); see text

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless); see text

*As you lay your hand upon the target, its wounds close instantly.*

With a simple touch, this spell restores vitality to the

target creature, mending torn flesh and broken bones.

*Renew* uses positive energy to cure 6d8 points of damage +1

point per caster level (maximum +10). In addition, this

spell removes any of the following conditions: exhausted,

fatigued, nauseated, and sickened.

Since undead are powered by negative energy,

this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their

wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance,

and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

RENEW, GREATER

Conjuration (Healing)

**Level:** Divine 3

*As you lay your hand upon the target, its gaping wounds close instantly.*

This spell functions like *renew*, except that it cures 9d8

points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, this spell removes any of the following

conditions: exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed,

and sickened.

RENEW, LESSER

Conjuration (Healing)

**Level:** Divine 1

*As you lay your hand upon the target, its minor wounds close and it feels*

*rejuvenated.*

This spell functions like *renew*, except that it cures 3d8

points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum

+5). In addition, this spell removes both of the following

conditions: fatigued and sickened.
