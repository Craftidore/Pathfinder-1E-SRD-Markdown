# Witch Hunter (PrC)
## Overview
*“Curse me, revile me, it makes no matter. I cleave to the*

*Necromantic Censure and it is my sacred duty to uncover the filth*

*of human corruption, to destroy those blasphemous creations of the*

*necromancers, and to bring to justice those who dabble in the dark*

*arts. It is thankless work, but I take heart in knowing that with*

*each black wizard I burn, I am doing my part in thwarting the*

*ancient Necro-Kings from rising once more.”*

Founded by the Inquisitor-Mages at the behest of the Council

of Harmony many centuries ago, the witch hunters are a force

of investigators and warriors whose sole purpose is to root out

necromancers and consign them to the purifying flames of the pyre. At

first, these bold men and women were tasked with capturing suspected

necromancers and bringing them before the Seven High Inquisitors

who would interrogate and pass judgment based on their findings, and

once pronounced only the most powerful leaders of the land could

countermand their decisions. What began as a temporary solution

was eventually made a permanent feature of Hexworth and after the

nation was deemed cleansed, the witch hunters moved beyond their

borders to hunt for undead and necromancers all over the Continent.

Becoming a Witch Hunter

Witch hunters are drawn from the ranks of priests and holy warriors.

Most witch hunters were once holy warriors who left their various

orders to take up the sacred cause of the Council of Harmony and

purge the world of those blasphemers who dabble in the dark arts.

Other witch hunters were clerics or multiclass cleric/rangers who

become witch hunters to further their standing in their respective

churches. Although clerics and paladins are the most common sorts

of candidates, any character with the ability to turn undead can find

a place in this violent order.

Class Features

The witch hunter’s class features are all fueled by righteous fury. As

the character advances in this prestige class, he gains more options for

how to use this fury and even extend some of the benefits to his allies.

Even though the witch hunter is very much specialized in fighting

undead, many of the righteous fury features can be used against just

about any type of foe, making the witch hunter a formidable foe.

Righteous Fury (Su)

All witch hunters work to cleanse the world of necromancers and

their blasphemous creations. Charged with this sacred duty, witch

hunters can awaken the righteous powers of justice to improve their

combat abilities, resist the vile touch of undeath, and overcome their

life-sworn enemies. A witch hunter receives a pool of supernatural

energy, called righteous fury, he can use to fuel many of his class

abilities. At the beginning of each encounter, he receives a number of

righteous fury points equal to his class level. As long as he has at least

one point of righteous fury remaining, he receives a sacred bonus to all

saving throws equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1). Unspent

righteous fury points are lost at the end of the encounter.

Necromantic Censure (Su)

At first level, he may sacrifice a point of righteous fury as an immediate

action to imbue his next attack with divine energy, adding his

Charisma modifier as a sacred bonus to his attack roll and his class

level as a sacred bonus to his weapon damage roll.

Divine Shield (Su)

Starting at 2nd level, the witch hunter may spend 1 point of righteous

fury as an immediate action to add his class level as a sacred bonus to

his Armor Class for 1 round. This bonus applies to his touch and flat–

footed ACs, and applies even if the witch hunter is immobilized.

Sacred Resolve (Su)

At 3rd level, the witch hunter may spend 1 point of righteous fury as

an immediate action to completely negate a single negative energy

effect or necromancy spell that targets him.

Divine Judgment (Su)

By 4th level, the witch hunter can channel positive energy to damage

or destroy undead creatures. As a standard action, he may spend 2

points of righteous fury to deal 1d6 points of divine damage per

class level to all undead creatures within 60 feet. Undead targets that

succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + the witch hunter’s class level + his

Charisma modifier) take half damage.

Spectral Weapon (Su)

Beginning at 5th level, the witch hunter can imbue a weapon he

wields with the power to strike incorporeal creatures. As an immediate

action, he may spend 1 point of righteous fury to grant a weapon he

wields the *ghost touch* property (see *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*). If the

witch hunter imbues a ranged weapon with this power, it bestows the

*ghost touch* ability on its ammunition. The weapon retains this ability

for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1

round). If the witch hunter loses control of the weapon for whatever

reason (disarmed, passes it to a friend, etc), it loses this ability.

Beacon of Justice (Su)

At 6th level, the witch hunter can channel his righteous fury into a

shining beacon that inspires terror in undead enemies and weakens

necromancy spells. As a standard action, and by spending 1 point of righteous fury, all intelligent undead within 60 feet must succeed on

a Will save (DC 10 + the witch hunter’s class level + his Charisma

modifier) or spend their next action cowering. In addition, any

spellcaster that would cast a necromancy spell must first succeed

on a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the spell level + the witch hunter’s

Charisma modifier) or the spell is wasted.

Divine Restoration (Su)

Starting at 7th level, the witch hunter may channel his righteous

fury into a powerful restorative to give him the strength to continue

fighting. As a full-round action and at the cost of 2 points of righteous

fury, the witch hunter may heal an amount of damage equal to his

Charisma bonus (minimum 1) times his class level.

Divine Denial (Su)

At 8th level, as a full-round action the witch hunter may spend 2

points of righteous fury to grant spell resistance equal to 10 + his

character level against all necromancy spells to all allies within 30 feet.

The spell resistance lasts for 1 round per point of the witch hunter’s

Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round).

Purifying Flame (Su)

By 9th level, the witch hunter has learned to harness his righteous

fury to imbue his weapon with purifying flames. As an immediate

action and by spending 2 points of righteous fury, the witch hunter’s

weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of sacred damage to all undead he

hits. In addition, any such creature struck must succeed on a DC 15

Reflex save or catch fire, taking 1d6 points of sacred damage each

round. Water does not extinguish these flames however. An affected

creature may spend a move action on its turn to attempt another DC

15 Reflex save to put out the flames. Multiple strikes from a weapon

affected by purifying flame have no additional effect.

Destroy Undead (Su)

Finally, at 10th level the witch hunter can channel positive energy to

destroy undead creatures in a 30-foot radius. As a standard action,

he may spend 3 points of righteous fury to automatically destroy all

undead who have less than one-half his class level in Hit Dice (plus

their turn resistance if any).

Using Witch Hunters

The witch hunters were founded with the noblest intentions, but as

the institution’s role has become permanent and expanded beyond the

boundaries of the Empire in which it was created, the ranks of this

organization have become sullied by ambitious politicians and sociopaths

who masquerade their violent impulses behind the veneer of doing holy

work. Even those witch hunters who cleave closest to the principals of

their order are ruthless in their pursuit of justice and, as often as not,

they serve as jury, judge, and executioner when confronting a suspected

necromancer. As a result, witch hunters find fear and hatred wherever

they go, but few have the resolve to refuse their demands.

Adapting the Witch Hunter

The witch hunter prestige class is tightly bound to the history of the

Continent, though this need not be the case. A witch hunter might

be an independent agent, rooting out corruption and destroying evil

wherever he finds it. Or, witch hunters could be a secret society of zealots

and mystics who oppose necromancers and their ilk for some altogether

different reason—maybe even to hide their own disturbing practices of

the dark arts. Furthermore, witch hunters don’t have to be undead hunters;

you could adapt them to work as demon or devil hunters by exchanging

undead for evil outsider. If you make this change, you should replace the

Knowledge (religion) requirement with Knowledge (planes) and remove

the turn undead requirement completely.
