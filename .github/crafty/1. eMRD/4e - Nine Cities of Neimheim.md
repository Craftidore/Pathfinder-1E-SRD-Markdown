# 4e - Nine Cities of Neimheim
## Overview
**Nine Cities of Neimheim**

Some creatures of Midgard are gentle, loving, and brave. The gnomes of Neimheim are none of these things. They are servants of Hell. They were not always so. The gnomes lived among the people of Krakova for many years as friends and allies, teaching humans the arts of fey sorcery, weaving, and gardening. They were a kindly people, eager to discuss the finer points of pottery, alchemy, tanning, and the illumination of manuscripts. Their hats and noses were sources of mirth, but their wisdom was valued and respected.

Then, 200 years ago, a gnome prince betrayed a promise made to Baba Yaga. A blood oath of loyalty and service was foresworn. The prince died swiftly, but his people’s suffering was slow.

Ever since, it is said, Baba Yaga sought to use their beards for her pillow-stuffing. The gnomes lived in fear of night-haunts, strigoi, the ala hags and the psoglav demon-dogs—all servants of Baba Yaga. The gnomes lived in perpetual pants-wetting terror, knowing their children would be grist for Baba Yaga’s mortar, and their villages kindling for her fire and her hunting drakes. Village by village, the gnomes disappeared.

Until one day, a devil of the Eleven Hells made the King of the Gnomes an offer. A very generous offer.

## The Devil's Offer
**The Devil’s Offer**

The devil swore he would hide the gnomes deep in the Krakovan woods in a dozen far-flung villages. Furthermore, the demons and devils of the Eleven Hells, the erinyes and barbed and bearded devils in their many varieties, would encircle those villages as wardens against Baba Yaga. The creatures of Hell would protect the entire gnome race—for a small price in blood and souls.

It says volumes about the terrors that Baba Yaga brought down upon the gnomes that they considered this a bargain worth making. In their defense, their only other choice was gradual extinction in Baba Yaga’s stewpots. And so they swore themselves to Hell, and they have made the best of it ever since.

## The Infernal Gnomes Today
**The Infernal Gnomes Today**

Once a month, the gnomes make blood sacrifices. If no strangers come to their tidy little towns, they must offer one of their own. Gnome thugs and illusionists and enchanters ply the roads and taverns, amusing travelers. Some of those travelers might follow a kindly gnome to the forest, or hear rumors of wealth and fame. They become curious about the silent land beneath the pine boughs. Someone always becomes curious, when the gnome bards spin a tale.

Visitors to the Wormwood have grown exceedingly rare, and few intrude on the gnomes in their deep piney woods these days. The gnomes hold a dozen villages or towns east of Krakova, all well ordered, with pretty gardens and neat central squares and half-timbered houses. They work hard as tanners of calfskin and hunting leathers. Gnome wives weave clever woolens, and the gnome charcoal burners make the fuel to light the dark nights and the hottest kilns outside of the Ironcrags. Potters fight each other for bright gnome glazes, and housewives prize small kitchen knives of Neimheim steel. The gnomes produce suspiciously fine vellum in inordinate quantities, enough to fill the scriptoria of the magocracy of Allain. None question their source or methods.

The gnomes still have enemies, but Baba Yaga’s eyes are blinded in their lands. In spring, raiding Krakovan hussars might ride in with a half-drunk Khazzaki scout and steal some sheep. But those hussars and the riotous centaurs who enter into Neimheim without permission vanish into the forest. Not long after, a new shipment of fine tallow candles, finely honed knives, and neatly repaired tunics is loaded on a dwarven mule train to Vidim or Morgau, and the gnomes grow a little richer.

The gnomes’ land is defined by their fear of Baba Yaga’s wrath, and its people shelter quietly and modestly among the dark forest boughs of the Wormwood. The forest is one of their defining elements; they cut lumber and export it in many forms to Krakova, Morgau, and Vidim, but the trees are more valuable by far for the sense of shelter they give the gnomes. Their towns and two cities are half above the earth and half below, easily overlooked when fully covered in fey glamours. It seems as if the gnomes wish that everyone would ignore them and their woods.

This is the way of things, under the dark branches of the forests of Neimheim.

### Illusions with Heft
**Illusions with Heft**

The influence of the Eleven Hells bends magic within the gnome’s kingdom, perhaps as part of the infernal protection provided against Baba Yaga. All illusions within Neimhiem have a +2 bonus to their saving throw DC (if any) or a +1 bonus per die of damage (never both). Scrying spells all have a 50% chance of failure against any target in Neimheim, a fact that draws a certain unsavory element to its outer cities.

### Traitor Fields
**Traitor Fields**

Fifty years ago, the Khazzaki of Rhos Khurgan joined forces with Neimheim and the Duke of Domovogrod to quell assaults on both their lands by a centaur bandit king. The battle took place at what’s now known as the Traitor Fields, for when the battle was done and the centaurs routed, Neimheim’s army turned its crossbows upon their Khazzak allies, wiping them out rather than pay them in booty and land. The Neimheimers call it a great victory, but to the Khazzaki, it was black treachery. The fire of revenge burns brightly in many a Khazzak youth’s heart.

### Glower Stones
**Glower Stones**

Staring out over the coasts and grassland borders of Neimheim are hunched stone statues accompanied by a fan of severed heads mounted on pikes. Stone eyes watch unblinkingly for approaching raiders, and severed heads moan at any who approach, warning of souls imprisoned and unable to reach Valhalla. Their cries are enough to make a Viking band look elsewhere for victims. Curses, ill-luck, and summoned unholy creatures plague those who ignore the warnings.

## King Redbeard
**King Redbeard**

The gnome king is an imposing figure for such a small man with such improbably curled shoes and such a wild beard (enchanted to resemble flames). He seems somewhat crazed and distressed by the forces he sees arrayed against him. The Master of Demon Mountain is one of the few non-gnomes he trusts. He keeps no priests in his company except when he must, and his courtiers primarily include gnome wizards, some pact drakes, and a great many sharp-eyed scouts and inquisitors, keeping him constantly informed of his nation’s wellbeing.

Though the kingdom seems lost to diabolism, there is some hope for it. Redbeard’s wits might be shaken, but they are still sharp: he knows if he could somehow secure a peace with Baba Yaga, he could break the shackles keeping the gnomes in thrall to devils. But Baba Yaga is known for the implacable nature of her enmity, and the gnomes are just more victims to her.

Though Redbeard’s fears threaten to overcome him, his heart is fundamentally courageous and he strives to keep his people’s hellish bargain from affecting most of the population. At the same time, King Redbeard is rarely seen without Ambassador Xingat at his side, a bone devil of erudition and cultured cruelty who serves a constant reminder of the power and the price of the king’s bargain with the Eleven Hells. There is little laughter in the king’s halls of Holmgard.

### Redbeard's Hidden Palace
**Redbeard’s Hidden Palace**

The palace is both an administrative center for justice and courtier’s pleas and a military fortress, well guarded and warded with arcane magical powers against shadow magic, divination, and scrying of any kind. Redbeard’s personal guard is said to number more than 200 veteran wands and blades, all of whom have petitioned the throne and sworn a blood oath to serve His Majesty as the Gentleman Irregulars.

The presence of devils and hellish ambassadors in the Hidden Palace is a matter of some annoyance to visitors (they speak only Infernal, and occasionally take offense at some imagined insult). Roads to the planes are said to be common in the Hidden Palace, and the conjunction of arcane forces here is very strong.

## The Great City of Holmgard
**The Great City of Holmgard**

The city of Holmgard is the most human and approachable settlement of Neimheim. It was founded by Northern adventurers from among the dwarfholds long ago, and it fell into human hands for centuries before the elves came. Those days are long past, though, and the gnomes have converted its temples to the worship of their dark and fearsome gods. Over the centuries, the city has grown large enough to throw off attacks by anything less than a whole army of Northlanders. As a trading centers for goods to and from the far South and even the far East, Holmgard sees travelers from distant lands as well as elves and centaurs from the Rothenian Plains. Expeditions to distant realms set out from Holmgard and Volvyagrad over the plains and past rowdy bands of Khazzaki and centaurs in search of riches on the Grass Road or in the shining desert cities of the far South. Enclaves of merchants give the city an exotic feel.

Despite this outward openness, Holmgard is the gnome capitol and its Hidden Palace is, well, hidden. Gnomes who are invited to the palace receive an invitation at dawn and are expected to wander the streets until they are (somehow) conjured along a magical path to the palace. Non-gnomes who are invited require a gnome guide to find the place, and are escorted out blindfolded on owlback.

## The Metropolis of Volvyagrad
**The Metropolis of Volvyagrad**

This shabby river city is defended by the marshy land around it and by a tremendous grod, an earthen rampart topped with a wall of timber with extensive hoardings. Centaurs have learned that the swamp conceals dangers all around and that gnome night raiders are worthy foes, and their devilish allies even more so. Humans and dwarves are relatively common on its streets, centaurs a little less so (and they leave before nightfall in all but the worst weather). Many of the humans in Volvyagrad are Kariv of the Kalder clan, which sometimes serves the gnomes as scouts, diviners, and kidnappers.

The city is a trade outpost, taking silks, furs, and horses from the East in exchange for salt, fine wools, iron ingots, and salt cod and herring from the west. It is ruled by the Metropolitan of Mammon, and trade and taxation are its function. Without Volvyagrad, there would be insufficient gold to please the gnome king.

## Lesser Cities of Neimheim
**Lesser Cities of Neimheim**

The cities within the Wormwood are poorly known and some are never visited by outsiders. Dorograd and Überlauten are the most outwardly focused.

**Dorograd:** A center of information-gathering, Dorograd stands on a small hill overlooking the Rothenian Plain to the south. Visitors run a high risk of being kidnapped for use as sacrifices. It is filled with veteran scouts, bards, and snatch-and-grab artists. Stolen children, it is said, are taken to Dorograd for sacrifice to the dark gnome gods in its large temple district.

**Hexen:** Deep in the forest heart of Neimheim, the rumored city of Hexen is off-limits to all but gnomes. It is said to be home to a college of hundreds of gnome wizards and witches who create new spells and summon new servants for the king, but no one is sure what truly goes on there. The last traveler to visit and return with a report was 150 years ago.

**Hellersbad:** Host to the king’s summer palace, this small town is home to scholars, fishermen, hot springs, and not much else. The town is sleepy even by gnome standards.

**Janosgrod:** A lumbering town near a significant mithral deposit, Janosgrod is a working forge town with a strong defense. Most magical gnome blades bear its mark, a triangle within a circle.

**Königsheim:** Located at the mouth of the River Brocken, Königsheim is a significant center of gnome trade, finance, and worship. It is famous for its cherry brandies and for the Black Spire, the city’s enormous black temple to Chernobog. The Spire is built entirely of black bricks and continuously echoes with prayers. Königsheim is home to a significant order of dark cavaliers and (some say) anti-paladins. The gnome cavaliers call themselves the Hellspurs.

**Ostzig:** This small trading port is the gnome naval center and home to few fast ships. The gnomes trade little with others, but their expeditions can sometimes bring a fortune to the Northlands, Vidim, or the duchies of Dornig. They never leave the Nieder Strait.

**Überlauten:** A city of soldiers, trained wolves, and permanent suspicion, this is the gateway to Krakova, Courlandia, and the west beyond the forest. The gnomes obviously expect an invasion, because the city is well fortified and its walls enchanted.

## Adventures in Neimheim
**Adventures in Neimheim**

The most common adventures in Neimheim involve hunts in the forest or shadow warfare against gnome plots.

- Explore a hidden forest shrine to a dark god and rescue those whom the gnomes have kidnapped for sacrifice.
- Discover a vault of cursed gold and carry it free of the Wormwood forest safely.
- Spy on the foul creatures of Holmgard, and report on the number and kind of the gnome armies.
- Destroy a gnome border tower, and banish its demonic guards to the hells they came from.

## Gnome Names
**Gnome Names**

The gnomes take their paranoia to a certain degree in naming and introductions. They never claim to give their true names: they introduce themselves with obfuscations such as, “I am a master smith and you may call me Cinderspark.” Their true names are kept among family and the closest of friends only. Even their king goes by a public name; his true name is a secret protected by his wife and daughters. Naming ceremonies are highly important and secret affairs. Being invited to such an occasion is a sign that a gnome trusts you with his or her child’s life, for they believe that Baba Yaga can find and kill any gnome whose true name she sniffs out.
