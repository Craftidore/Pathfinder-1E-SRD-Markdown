# Daggerspell Shaper (PrC)
## Overview
In a reclusive monastery in the heart of an ancient

forest, a varied group of druids and arcane spellcasters

train together. The adherents of this monastery work

to perfect a unique fighting and spellcasting style that

relies on wielding a pair of daggers at all times. Some of

these students—known as daggerspell shapers—blend

the fighting style with druid magic, spinning a deadly

web of steel in front of them as they perform powerful

feats of natural magic, or blending their daggers into the

claws and talons of their wild-shaped forms.

Daggerspell shapers see the precise martial powers of

their twin-dagger style and their magic as an extension

of one powerful philosophy. The shapers seek truth in

all things, believing that you can separate right from

wrong and nature from corruption with the clean slice of

a blade. Although never numerous, shapers are respected

as judges, warriors, and defenders of the weak.

Daggerspell shapers are closely related to the other half

of their guild, the daggerspell mages. Both preserve the

work of good folk and balance the concerns of civilized

communities against the sanctity of nature, but where

a daggerspell mage is wild and impulsive, a shaper is

quiet and calculating. The two halves of the Daggerspell

Guardians organization (see page 167) work together

amicably, but they have decidedly different approaches

to most problems.

Almost every daggerspell shaper begins her career as

a druid, taking a level or two of rogue or scout after a

few successful adventures. These individuals are drawn

to the exotic fighting style and balanced ideals of the

guild. Although most daggerspell shapers are primarily

spellcasters, some have more complicated multiclass

pathways that include ranger or barbarian levels. These

shapers follow all the precepts of the guild, but they

are more likely to defend nature with the steel of their

daggers than with their spells.

Adaptation: The daggerspell shapers and their colleagues,

the daggerspell mages, form the two halves of

the organization known as the Daggerspell Guardians.

Although normally bound together through the guild,

these groups need not be used together in every campaign.

The shapers, well suited for druid/rogues of any alignment,

can become a drastically different group with just a few

changes. Adding neutral evil as an alignment requirement

might change the shapers into a group of dagger-wielding

fanatics dedicated to preserving the sanctity of nature by

assassinating those who intrude into the wild.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the daggerspell

shaper prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Daggerspell

shapers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Daggercast (Ex): Daggerspell shapers seamlessly blend

the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting

abilities. A daggerspell shaper can cast a spell with somatic

and material components even when holding a dagger in

each hand. If a daggerspell shaper holds anything other

than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast

a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a

spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity

normally.

In addition, a daggerspell shaper can deliver a touch

spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or

a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).

Wild Shape (Su): A daggerspell shaper can change into

a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so

more often than most other characters with the wild shape ability. See the druid class feature, page 37 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.* This ability lasts for 1 hour per class level or

until she changes back. Levels of the daggerspell shaper

prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of

determining the maximum duration of the wild shape

ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as

the size and type of creature that a shaper can become).

A daggerspell shaper gains one additional daily use of her

wild shape ability at 1st level, 5th level, and 10th level.

At 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper becomes able to use

her wild shape ability to take the form of a Tiny animal.

At 4th level, she can use wild shape to take the form of a

Large animal.

Dagger Claws (Su): When a daggerspell shaper of

2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical

properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand

into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a

single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with

the corresponding limb in the shaper’s animal form,

not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell

shaper holding a *+1 flaming dagger* in one hand and a *+2*

*keen dagger* in the other hand transforms into a leopard.

The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as

follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage

rolls and also gains the flaming special ability, and the

other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and

also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form

does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that corresponds

to the druid’s natural limbs, this ability has no

effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration

of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability,

her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage

reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding

when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper

would be able to overcome a foe’s damage reduction as if

both of her natural weapons were magic.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level,

a daggerspell shaper gains new spells per day at each level

(and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained

a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged

before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however,

gain any other benefit a character of that class would have

gained. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class

before becoming a daggerspell shaper, she must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell

shaper deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when

flanking an opponent or at any time when the target

would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage

applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30

feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points

at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the

*Player’s Handbook.* If a daggerspell shaper gets a sneak

attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue),

the bonuses on damage stack.

Fast Wild Shape (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a daggerspell

shaper can use her wild shape ability as a move

action rather than as a standard action.

Enhanced Wild Shape (Su): Starting at 8th level, a

daggerspell shaper can preserve the physical enhancements

granted by her equipment even when in wild shape.

Whenever the shaper uses wild shape, she retains any

enhancement bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution

granted by any equipment she wears, even if the

equipment can’t be worn normally by her new form.

Daggerspell Flurry (Ex): A 10th-level daggerspell

shaper can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger

attacks. When using this ability, the shaper can quicken

one spell as part of a full attack with her daggers. Doing

this has no effect on the spell’s effective level. A daggerspell

shaper must make at least one melee attack in any

round in which she uses this ability, and she cannot make

an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if

a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an

attack roll, she can still make the spell’s attack).

A daggerspell shaper can use this ability a number of

times per day equal to her Dexterity bonus (minimum 1).

SAMPLE DAGGERSPELL SHAPER

Zaadi Akanthas: Female human druid 5/rogue

1/daggerspell shaper 4; CR 10; Medium humanoid; HD

5d8 plus 5d6; hp 43; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 15, touch

12, flat-footed 13; Base Atk +6; Grp +7; Atk +9 melee

(1d4+2/17–20, *+1 keen dagger*) or +8 ranged (1d6/×3, shortbow);

Full Atk +7/+2 melee (1d4+2/17–20, *+1 keen dagger*)

and +7 melee (1d4+1/19–20, *+1 dagger*) or +8/+3 ranged

(1d6/×3, shortbow); SA daggercast, daggerclaws, sneak

attack +2d6, spells; SQ animal companion (cheetah),

animal companion benefits, resist nature’s lure, trackless

step, trapfinding, wild empathy +8 (+4 magical beasts),

wild shape 2/day, woodland stride; AL CN; SV Fort +5,

Ref +9, Will +11; Str 13, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 8, Wis 16,

Cha 12.

*Skills and Feats:* Concentration +8, Handle Animal +7,

Heal +7, Hide +4, Knowledge (nature) +9, Listen +7, Move

Silently +4, Spot +7, Survival +11 (+13 in natural terrain),

Tumble +6; Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Two-Weapon

Fighting, Weapon Focus (dagger).

*Languages:* Common; Druidic.

Animal Companion (Ex): Zaadi has a cheetah named

Rula as her animal companion (see *Monster Manual,* page

271). Its bonus trick is attack.

Animal Companion Benefits: Zaadi and Rula enjoy

the link and share spells special qualities.

*Link (Ex):* Zaadi can handle Rula as a free action. She

also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy

checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding her

cheetah.

*Share Spells (Ex):* Zaadi can have any spell she casts on

herself also affect her animal companion if Rula is within

5 feet at the time. She can also cast a spell with a target

of “You” on Rula.

Daggercast (Ex): Zaadi can cast a spell with somatic

and material components even when holding a dagger

in each hand. If she holds anything other than a dagger,

she must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with

somatic or material components as normal. Casting a

spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity

normally. In addition, Zaadi can deliver a touch spell with

a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal

melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).

Daggerclaws (Su): If Zaadi uses her wild shape

ability to assume animal form while holding her magic

daggers, she incorporates the daggers’ enhancement

bonuses and special qualities into the natural attacks

of her wild-shaped form. One of her claw attacks gains

a +1 enhancement bonus and the keen special ability

(from her *+1 keen dagger*), and the other claw gains a +1

enhancement bonus (from her *+1 dagger*). The benefits

last for the duration of the wild shape effect.

Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex): Zaadi gains a +4 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Zaadi deals an extra 2d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Zaadi

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trackless Step (Ex): Zaadi leaves no trail in natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Trapfinding (Ex): Zaadi can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Wild Shape (Su): Twice per day, Zaadi can change

into a Tiny to Large animal and back again, as per the

*polymorph* spell. Her preferred forms are that of a lion

and a cheetah. This ability lasts for 9 hours or until she

changes back.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Zaadi can move through

natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain

at her normal speed and without damage or other

impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion

still affect her.

*Druid Spells Prepared* (caster level 8th): 0—*cure minor*

*wounds, detect magic, detect poison, guidance, light, read magic;*

1st—*charm animal* (DC 14)*, entangle* (DC 14)*, faerie fire,*

*longstrider, obscuring mist;* 2nd—*bull’s strength, flame blade*

(+9 melee touch)*, resist energy, summon swarm;* 3rd—*cure*

*moderate wounds, dominate animal* (DC 16)*, greater magic*

*fang, poison* (+9 melee touch, DC 16)*;* 4th—*flame strike*

(DC 17)*, freedom of movement*.

*Possessions: +1 leather armor of light fortification*, *+1 keen*

*dagger*, *+1 dagger*, shortbow with 20 arrows, 2 *potions of*

*barkskin (+2)*, *potion of invisibility*, scroll of *bear’s endurance*,

scroll of *cat’s grace*, 5 gp.
