# Brewmaster (Trait)
## Overview
**Brewmaster:** Your family brought the secrets of dwarven brewing to non-dwarven lands. Though this has given you skill in the brewer's craft, it's also earned you distrust among dwarven purists. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (brewer) and [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) checks, but you take a â€”1 penalty on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made to change the attitude of dwarves who know that your family has shared brewing secrets with non-dwarves.
