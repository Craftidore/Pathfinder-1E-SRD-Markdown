# Paragnostic Apostle (PrC)
## Overview
*“If knowledge is power, omniscience is omnipotence. When we understand*

*the nature of the world, we become its masters.”*

—Pallavarta Santalieri, Master of the Unturned Page

The paragnostic apostles are the most devoted of the Paragnostic

Assembly (see page 72)—the most erudite of a sect

dedicated, mind and soul, to the acquisition of knowledge.

These eminent scholars use the secrets they’ve learned to

augment their spells, and to shape the world around them in

ways that other casters cannot. Knowledge is indeed power,

and the paragnostic apostle understands that power better

than most.

BECOMING A PARAGNOSTIC APOSTLE

Wizards, clerics, and archivists are best suited to this prestige

class because of their skills and spellcasting progressions.

However, bards, druids, sorcerers, favored soulsCD, and

warlocksCAr sometimes follow this path as well. A high

Intelligence score is essential because of the Knowledge

skills required.

**Entry Requirements**

**Skills:** Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 5

ranks, Knowledge (any other) 5 ranks.

**Spellcasting:** Able to cast 3rd-level spells or use spell-like

abilities of equivalent level.

**Special:** Must be a member of the Paragnostic Assembly.

**Hit Die: d4**

**Class Skills (4 + Int modifier per level):** Concentration, Craft, Decipher Script, Knowledge (all skills, taken individually),

Profession, Search, Speak Language, Spellcraft, Spot.

CLASS FEATURES

You have mastered the art of modifying your magic based on

what you know. With the proper application of your Knowledge

skills, you can raise the potency of your spellcasting.

Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per day

and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable)

as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which

you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do

not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a paragnostic apostle, you must decide

to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Holy Texts (Ex): Because of your study of sacred writings,

your paragnostic apostle levels stack with other class levels

for the purpose of turning or rebuking undead and leveldependent

domain abilities. You do not gain such abilities

if you do not already have them, however.

Knowledge Is Power (Ex): At each level, you gain a

spellcasting enhancement based on your Knowledge skills.

Each time you gain this feature, choose one of the following

abilities for which you meet the skill-based prerequisites.

Although you can choose some of these abilities multiple

times (as indicated in the descriptions), you may not

select the same one twice in a row, and the minimum

required skill rank increases by 2 for each subsequent

selection of the same ability.

These benefi ts apply to warlock invocations as

well as spells, where applicable.

*Accurate Retort:* You gain a +1 circumstance bonus

on your ranged attack roll with every ray

spell that you aim at a creature with a natural

armor bonus. (Knowledge \[arcana]

8 ranks)

*Backhanded Attack:* If you successfully

hit with an attack that deals

hit point or ability score damage

and requires a saving throw against

an additional, nondamaging effect (such as

a warlock’s *beshadowed blast*CAr or the *orb of*

*acid*CAr spell, add 1 to the DC of the saving

throw. (Knowledge \[arcana] 6 ranks)

*Call of Worlds:* Each creature you

summon with a conjuration (summoning)

spell gains the fast healing

ability. The damage healed per

round begins at 2 hit points and

increases by 1 for every three

caster levels (maximum +5

at 15th caster level). (Knowledge

\[the planes] 6 ranks)

*Discern Weakness:* Choose one

creature type or subtype from the ranger’s

favored enemy list (*PH* 47). If you have 8 ranks in the appropriate

Knowledge skill (such as Knowledge \[arcana] for dragons,

or Knowledge \[nature] for humanoids), the save DC of every

spell that you target on a creature of that type increases by 1.

You can select this ability multiple times, choosing a different

creature type each time.

*Divine Understanding:* Choose one clerical domain. For the

purpose of this ability, you can choose any domain, whether

or not your deity offers it. Your effective caster level increases

by 1 when you cast spells that appear on that domain’s spell

list. You can select this ability multiple times, choosing a

different domain each time. (Knowledge \[religion] 5 ranks)

*Energy Supremacy:* Choose an energy type from the following

list: acid, cold, electricity, fi re. Your effective caster level

increases by 1 when you cast spells of that energy type. You

can select this ability multiple times, choosing a different

energy type each time. (Knowledge \[the planes] 5 ranks)

*Manifest Ethos:* Choose one non-neutral aspect of your own

alignment

(chaos,

evil,

good,

or law).

When you

cast an energybased

offensive

spell against a

creature with an

opposing alignment

component (chaos/law

or good/evil), one-half the

hit point damage dealt is

pure divine power instead

of its normal energy type, and

thus not subject to reduction

by energy resistance or immunity.

You can select this ability multiple

times, assuming that your alignment permits

it, choosing a different aspect of your

alignment each time. (Knowledge \[religion]

8 ranks or \[the planes] 10 ranks)

*Mind over Body:* Your effective caster

level increases by 1 when you cast conjuration

(healing) spells or transmutation

spells that grant ability bonuses or

penalties. (Knowledge \[nature or

religion] 7 ranks)

*Mind over Matter:* Whenever you

cast a spell that creates a solid object, its hardness and hit points each increase by 2. When you cast

a spell that provides an armor bonus, that bonus to AC also

increases by 2. (Knowledge \[architecture and engineering]

5 ranks)

*Mortal Coil:* Your effective caster level increases by 1 when

you cast spells that physically change the subject’s form (such

as *alter self, enlarge person*, or *baleful polymorph*). (Knowledge

\[nature] 6 ranks)

*Noble Presence:* Whenever you cast a charm spell, or a compulsion

that affects the subject’s emotions but not specifi c

actions (such as *good hope* or *rage*, but not *dominate person*), the

save DC increases by 1. (Knowledge \[nobility and royalty]

5 ranks)

*Penetrating Insight:* You gain a +1 bonus on caster level

checks made to overcome spell resistance, or to successfully

dispel another caster’s spell. (Knowledge \[arcana] 9 ranks)

*See through the Veil:* Whenever you cast a necromantic spell

that targets undead, the save DC increases by 1. In addition,

your effective turning level increases by 2, if you possess

the ability to turn or rebuke undead. (Knowledge \[religion]

7 ranks)

*Spatial Awareness:* Your effective caster level increases by

1 when you cast conjuration (teleportation) spells. Furthermore,

the subject of any spell that increases base movement

rate or grants a new type of movement gains an additional

10 feet to the designated speed. (Knowledge \[geography]

5 ranks)

Lore (Ex): You can recall legends or information regarding

various topics, just like a bard can with bardic knowledge.

To use this ability, make a lore check (1d20 + twice your

paragnostic apostle level + your Int modifi er). Success grants

you the same result as a bardic knowledge check would. If

you have the bardic knowledge or lore ability from another

class, your levels in those classes stack with your paragnostic

apostle levels for the purpose of this check.

PLAYING A PARAGNOSTIC APOSTLE

Knowledge is the most important prize in the universe. What

you know defi nes what you are, and what you might learn

defi nes what you can become. Even when other objectives

are at the forefront of your endeavors, the acquisition of

new secrets and new understanding continues to drive you.

An ancient text is far more valuable to you than gold, and

forgotten spells interest you not merely for their power, but

for what they can tell you about those who scribed them. Use

your knowledge to aid your allies, and do not worry about

seeming haughty or superior—information was meant to

be shared, and any who are threatened by it simply lack the

will to accomplish what you have.

As a paragnostic apostle, you are a combination high priest

and headmaster who represents the heart and soul of the

Paragnostic Assembly. You answer when your superiors need

you, but you also have the right to all the support and resources

they can offer. Share any new secrets you learn with your colleagues,

so that no knowledge can ever be lost again.

Combat

Stand behind the front lines and cast your spells from the

rear. If you were a wizard or sorcerer before becoming a

paragnostic apostle, you’re likely accustomed to such tactics,

but if you were a cleric, don’t give in to your inclination to

stand beside the fi ghters—such tactics are no longer as viable

for you as they once were. When given the choice, focus on

the foes against whom your specifi c class abilities are most

effective, but don’t be afraid to make use of your spells where

appropriate—they are no less useful against other opponents

than they ever were. In other words, focus is advisable, but

don’t become so determined to confront specifi c foes that

you ignore the good you can do against others.

Advancement

The paragnostic apostles are the elite of the Paragnostic

Assembly. They do not openly ask other members to join

their ranks, though individual apostles might have subtly

recommended that you do so. Only members who express

an interest and prove themselves suffi ciently capable can

become paragnostic apostles, and you managed both.

More than a researcher, more than an adventurer, you

have now combined both into a single package, becoming a

traveling and spellcasting seeker of secrets. You might devote

your abilities to other goals as well, but while you do so, you

are casting about for new information to absorb and to add

to the Paragnostic Assembly’s archives.

Although you place most of your skill points into Knowledge

skills—not merely for the sake of your class abilities, but

also to represent the learning you achieve as you advance—you

shouldn’t completely ignore your other skills. Search and Spot

are useful for fi nding new secrets to learn, and Spellcraft and

Concentration are no less important for you than they are for

other spellcasters. And consider boosting your Intelligence

at least once. Even if it’s not your primary casting ability, an

extra skill point per level adds up.

Resources

The libraries and sages of the Paragnostic Assembly can aid

you in researching any topic imaginable. If you’re a wizard,

you can fi nd almost any arcane spell known in the organization’s

libraries or purchase spells from its members (subject,

as always, to DM approval). You aren’t likely to get a reduction

of price, but at least you know that you can fi nd such spells,

and perhaps you can trade for some of your own. Similarly,

minor magic items such as potions, scrolls, and some wands

can be purchased from the Paragnostic Assembly’s members

or its chapterhouses. The organization doesn’t often provide

more potent items, but if you are seeking a particular secret on

its behalf, its leaders might provide magic items to aid you in

that endeavor, on the understanding that anything not used

up will be returned. Such items may be worth no more than

25% of the standard value for a character of your level.
