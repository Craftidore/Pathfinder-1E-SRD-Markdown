# Wondrous Whisperer (WondArch)
## Overview
**Wondrous Whisperer:** This 5-foot-wide concave cone is carved into an exterior wall of the stronghold. The wide end of the cone opens into the stronghold, while the tip is actually a small hole into the outside. Any message (of up to twenty-five words) spoken at the open end travels through the wind to any known location within three miles (as the *[[Whispering Wind (Spell)|whispering wind]]* spell).

The location must be reachable by a wind. The wind covers one mile every 10 minutes. When the wind reaches its objective, it swirls about, leaves its message, and then dissipates.

Many outposts use this item to deliver messages to the main stronghold. In addition, in open and airy strongholds, it provides a fine way to communicate with others throughout the place.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Whispering Wind (Spell)|whispering wind]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
