# Swyft (Template)
## Overview
Swyfts are creatures that possess heigntened speed. Some inherit their powers from quickling parents or distant swyft ancestors, but others seem to become swyfts spontaneously. Such creatures are often individuals in need of great speed to flee a foe or reach a loved one in time to prevent tragedy. Most count their gift of speed as a great blessing at first, but they soon learn to curse it when they see their lives rapidly passing by.

Swyfts, like quicklings, are prime examples of the old adage, “Live fast and die young.” In fact, they age twice times as fast as normal for their kinds. Elf swyfts die of old age just as their companions are old enough to be married, and human swyfts rarely live past fifty or so. Knowledge of their impending doom, however, drives many swyfts to accomplish great deeds in the small amount of time they have.

Creating a Swyft

“Swyft” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A swyft creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature +1

**Initiative:** A swyft gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks.

**Armor Class:** A swyft gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

**Weaknesses:** A swyft has the following weakness:

*Aging Vulnerability (Ex)* A swyft takes 50% more damage from aging effects, including the number of years aged.

**Speed:** Each of the base creature’s speeds is doubled. If the base creature has a fly speed, its maneuverability increases one category (maximum *perfect*).

**Special Attacks:** A swyft retains all of the base creature’s special attacks and gains the following.

*Rapid Actions (Ex):* A swyft gains one extra attack or move action each round. This does not stack with other *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* effects.

**Abilities:** Dex +4.

**Skills:** A swyft creature gains a +2 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +5 racial bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks.

**Feats:** A swyft creature gains either [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]] or [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] as a bonus feat.

*Rapid Aging (Ex)* A swyft ages 2 years for every 1 year that passes.
