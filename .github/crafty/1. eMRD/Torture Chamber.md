# Torture Chamber
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 3,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One torturer, one guard per shift

All sorts of pain-inducing devices fill this dark chamber, including an iron maiden, a rack, thumbscrews, vises, and so on. Wall-mounted shackles allow the torturer to dangle victims from chains, and a lockable cage in the center can hold a single Medium-size prisoner between sessions. A fireplace allows heating of brands, while a barrel of water stands nearby for extinguishing flames.

This chamber provides a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks. Unlike most verbal threats and bluffs, use of a torture chamber allows retries on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks every hour against restrained and helpless opponents.

This place requires at least one torturer (Exp1; [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] +7, [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] +5) and one guard to run properly.

**Torture**

The brutality of torture doesn’t have a place in a typical game. Generally, if characters choose to use this questionable method to extract information, let a die roll handle it and move on. A successful [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill check indicates the victim gives up the desired information.

If desired, the DM may rule that each hour of torture deals 1d3 points of temporary Constitution damage to the target and applies a cumulative +1 bonus on the torturer’s [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check. Victims reduced to 0 or lower Constitution die.
