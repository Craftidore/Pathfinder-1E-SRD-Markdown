# Advanced Talents (Master Trick)
## Overview
*Advanced Talents*: The ninja can select a rogue talent from the list of Advanced Talents in place of a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select a rogue talent that has the same name as a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select [[Improved Evasion|improved evasion]] unless she has [[Evasion (Master Trick)|evasion]] (either as a class feature or as a ninja master trick).
