# Deflection
## Overview
**Deflection:** When creating this augmentation, choose one face of the wall. Any ranged attack has 50% of being deflected which negates the deflected attack. Spells cast at the augmented wall have a 25% of being deflected (negated).

When creating the augmentation, you can choose to include the first 10 feet above a wall of stronghold space in the augmentation (for instance, to protect your wall-mounted guards from arrows); it automatically covers any openings in the wall such as arrow slits, doors, or windows.. Remember that the *deflection* works against attacks going in either direction.

*Caster Level:* 5th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Deflect (Spell)|deflect]]; Market Price:* 5,000 gp.
