# Consecrated Harrier (PrC)
## Overview
The consecrated harrier acts as a bounty hunter for her religion

or organization. Where church inquisitors hunt evil

and corruption within a church and other champions of

good fi ght external forces of evil in general, a consecrated

harrier hunts blasphemers, heretics, and those who betray or

attack the church directly. For instance, a consecrated harrier

might accept a mission to track down and kill an ogre that

defi led a shrine, or to bring a heretic before the heads of her

church. The mission is always related to either a single, specifi

c offense of blasphemy or defi lement, or to the source of a

heresy. The church assigns missions or targets as needed.

Hunting specifi c enemies of a church requires many of the

skills possessed by bounty hunters. While the consecrated

harrier deals with her targets capably once she fi nds them, she

must fi nd them fi rst. The consecrated harrier must be subtle

and clever, as well as strong in her faith. Because her foes

may have spells and magical abilities of their own, she must

be strong-willed and prepared to properly deal with such.

Paladins and clerics often make good consecrated harriers

because of their high Charisma scores. Rangers are equally

desirable because of their superior tracking abilities. Rogues

often possess the subtlety and conversational skills to locate

their targets.

A consecrated harrier can be diffi cult for others to spot.

She uses her skills, spells, and abilities to mask her nature

until she can confront her target. Most consecrated harriers

appear to be genial, pleasant people who always have a joke

or a story to tell. This facade masks their true, implacable

nature, allowing them to gather clues without arousing interest

or suspicion. Particularly powerful or well-protected foes

attract small groups of consecrated harriers who work with

other classes to reach and confront their targets.

Hit Die: d10.

To qualify to become a consecrated harrier, a character must

fulfi ll all the following criteria.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the consecrated

harrier prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Consecrated harriers

gain no weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day: A consecrated harrier gains the ability

to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the

consecrated harrier must have a Wisdom score of at least 10

+ the spell’s level, so a consecrated harrier with a Wisdom

of 10 or lower cannot cast spells. Consecrated harrier bonus

spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wis modifi er. When the

consecrated harrier gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance

0 1st-level spells at 1st level), the harrier gets only the bonus

spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score

for that spell level.

The consecrated harrier uses the ranger spell list, with the

following additions: 1st—*animate rope, calm emotions,*

*command, disguise self, doom*; 2nd—*charm*

*person, daylight, detect thoughts, hold person*;

3rd—*clairaudience/clairvoyance, death*

*ward, discern lies, see invisibility*;

4th—*dismissal, dominate person,*

*legend lore, mark of justice*.

Blessing of Scripture (Su): All

consecrated harriers receive a +2 sacred

bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Survival checks when in pursuit of their

church-assigned target. If the assigned target

is a group, this bonus applies to the group’s

leader. They receive the same bonus on

weapon (or unarmed) damage rolls

against their targets. This bonus

increases to +4 at 5th level,

and to +6 at 10th level.

*Detect Chaos* (Sp): A consecrated

harrier can use *detect*

*chaos* at will as a cleric of

equal level.

Sanctified Sight

(Su): Beginning at 2nd

level, a consecrated

harrier re ceives a +4

bonus on all saves

against illusions.

*Dispel Magic* (Sp):

A 3rd-level consecrated

harrier can use *dispel*

*magic* as a spell-like

ability. She may

add her blessing

of scripture

bonus on dispel

checks when using this

spell-like ability. She may use this ability a number of times

per day equal to her Wisdom modifi er (minimum 1).

*Crushing Despair* (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a consecrated

harrier can use *crushing despair* as a spell-like ability. She

may use this ability a number of times per day equal to her

Wisdom modifi er (minimum 1).

*False Vision* (Sp): A 6th-level consecrated harrier can use

*false vision* as a spell-like ability. The effect must be

centered on the consecrated harrier.

She may use this ability a number of

times per day equal to her Wisdom

modifi er (minimum 1).

Implacable Hunt (Su): Beginning

at 8th level, if the consecrated harrier

wounds a target and the target escapes,

the consecrated harrier always knows the

direction in which her target lies and the

approximate distance (within 10% of the

total distance) between her and her target.

If the target is within 50 feet, the

consecrated harrier can pinpoint

the target’s precise

location. This ability

only works if the

consecrated harrier

and her target are on

the same plane of

existence. Implacable

hunt can be

used simultaneously

against different

targets, as

long as each

of those individual

targets is part

of a group that is, in

total, the harrier’s target

for her current mission.

Faultless Hunt (Su): At 10th level, a consecrated harrier

who establishes an implacable hunt can intensify this to a

faultless hunt, enabling her to locate her quarry even across

planar boundaries. Unlike an implacable hunt, which can

affect several individuals at the same time, only one faultless

hunt against a single individual can be pursued at one

time. For the consecrated harrier to begin a faultless hunt,

she must abandon any faultless hunt that she is already

conducting.

Code of Conduct: A consecrated harrier must make

it known to her target who she is and why she is there at

the time of the confrontation. She cannot sneak attack her

target. She cannot slay her target on a battlefi eld without the

target knowing who she is and why she is there. Consecrated

harriers purposely word the requirements for conducting

themselves vaguely, so that an individual consecrated harrier

in the fi eld has some fl exibility. Harriers who fail to act

according to their code of conduct must undertake an act

of atonement before they can add any further levels of this

class (see the *atonement* spell description, page 201 of the

*Player’s Handbook*).

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a consecrated

harrier may continue advancing as a paladin.
