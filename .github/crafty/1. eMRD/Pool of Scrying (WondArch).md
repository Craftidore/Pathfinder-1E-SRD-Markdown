# Pool of Scrying (WondArch)
## Overview
**Pool of Scrying:** This shallow pool forms a reflective surface in which the user can scry on others. This works like the standard *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* spell. Spellcasters can cast certain spells through the *pool of scrying* at creatures or things they are scrying upon, as per the *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* spell.

While the pool can be shallow, it must be at least 2 feet ×4 feet. It can be formed into the top of a large pedestal, but these items are just as often found in a room’s floor. If the water is ever entirely emptied from the pool, the item loses its magic.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]**; Market Price:* 12,000 gp.
