# Courageous (Trait)
## Overview
**Courageous**: Your childhood was brutal, but you persevered through force of will and faith. No matter how hard things got, you knew youâ€™d make it through as long as you kept a level head. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 52
