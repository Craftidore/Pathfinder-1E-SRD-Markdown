# Windguard
## Overview
**Windguard:** When creating this augmentation, choose one face of the wall. A *[[Wind Wall (Spell)|wind wall]]* protects that side of the wall.

When creating the augmentation, you can choose to include the first 10 feet above a wall of stronghold space in the augmentation (for instance, to protect your wall-mounted guards from arrows). Remember that the *windguard* works against objects going in either direction.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wind Wall (Spell)|wind wall]]; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
