# New Familiars
## Overview
The following are statistics for several new animals that

can serve as familiars, in addition to a number of familiars

first mentioned in the witch class entry in the *Advanced*

*Player’s Guide*. You should use these statistics rather than

those in the brief entry in the *Bestiary*. These familiars can

be taken by anyone gaining a familiar, and utilize all the

standard rules for familiars presented on pages 82–83 of

the *Core Rulebook*. Tiny or smaller familiars in this section

use Dexterity to modify Climb and Swim skill checks.

Blue-ringed octopus Master gains a +3 bonus on Swim checks

Donkey rat Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude

saves

Fox Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves

Goat Master gains a +3 bonus on Survival checks

Hedgehog Master gains a +2 bonus on Will saves

House centipede Master gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks

Pig Master gains a +3 bonus on Diplomacy

checks

Scarlet spider Master gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks

Small and Vermin Familiars

Some of these familiars break some of the rules and

assumptions of the familiars presented in the *Core Rulebook*.

Small-sized familiars threaten the areas around them

like Small creatures, and can be used to flank enemies,

though both familiars and their masters are often loath

to use such tactics, as the result is often a dead familiar.

Small-sized familiars are also harder to keep on a master’s

person than Tiny or smaller familiars. Often they require

some form of magic item, like a *bag of holding*, for such

a feat to work.

The process of making a vermin into a familiar grants

it an Intelligence score and removes the mindless trait.

Vermin familiars communicate with their masters and

other vermin of their kind (greensting scorpions with

other scorpions, house centipedes with other centipedes,

and scarlet spiders with other spiders) by way of a strange

combination of behaviors, slight changes in coloration,

and even the excretion of scents, subtle and otherwise.

As with other types of familiars, other creatures cannot

understand this communication without magical aid.
