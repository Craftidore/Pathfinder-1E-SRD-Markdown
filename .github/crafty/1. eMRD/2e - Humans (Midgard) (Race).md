# 2e - Humans (Midgard) (Race)
## Overview
**Humans**

The humans of Midgard are among the most numerous and thriving races, with kingdoms and duchies and small settlements scattered from shore to steppes and from icy vastness to searing sands. Human racial traits follow the Pathfinder RPG standard traits for humans. For additional traits and abilities, see the regional traits in this book and in the Player’s Guide to the Crossroads, Player’s Guide to the Wasted West, Player’s Guide to the Seven Cities, and Player’s Guide to the Dragon Empire.

The people divide themselves into seven main groups and many smaller ones, based on their culture and languages.

**Caelmarans:** The descendants of the nine magocracies—Allain, Andarre, Barsella, Caelmarath, Carnessa, Cassilon, Molovosch, Uxloon, and Vael Turog—are a pasty lot, with hair from rust-red to moss-green as common as black or brown. Some claim that the Caelmarans are all tainted by association with demons and devils, pointing to the high prevalence of tieflings among the shattered towns and deserts of the West. Caelmarans speak the Trade Tongue, though many also speak the Northern Tongue.

**Dornigfolk:** The Dornigfolk of the Great Duchy are numerous and strong in their numbers. They have skin ranging from pink-white to a watery brown, and hair from brown to blond, though red hair is largely unknown. The Dornigfolk pride themselves on their hard work and their elven empress, and consider themselves the last bastion of the true Empire of Thorn. Those pretenders in Valera arouse only their pity and scorn. Dornigfolk speak Elvish and the Trade Tongue.

**Kushites and Nurians:** The people of the great Southern bastion of Nuria Natal are the best known of the Kushites, but hardly the only ones: the desert folk, the Mharoti humans, and many of the Southern reaches are Kushites. Both have mahogany skin, but their rulers and customs are quite different. Kushites take great pride in their status as the first and greatest of the human kingdoms. They speak Nurian and often a Southern dialect or Draconic.

**Magdar:** Dark-haired and customarily green-eyed, the Magdar are beautiful and relatively tall among humans. They have rich, musical voices and an efficient way with horses and oxen. Though many Magdar ride the Plains or wander far afield as mercenaries or adventurers, their kingdom is a strong one, and the Magdar are bold explorers and fighters. A few Magdar have a regrettable tendency to drunkenness. They speak the Trade Tongue, and a few speak Draconic or the Northern Tongue.

**Northlanders:** Pale and tall and strong, the Northlanders are a race of survivors and warriors. Their hair runs to pale blond or even white, sometimes with golden or red streaks. Their eyes are often a piercing blue or purple. They speak the Northern Tongue, and many also speak Dwarvish.

**Roshgazi:** Dark-skinned and eagle-nosed, the Roshgazi are associated with their friends the minotaurs, and they wander the western deserts as well as dwelling in small villages in Capleon, Kyprion, and Cindass. They speak Roshgazi, a language closely related to Minotaur. Speakers of either language can understand the other.

**Septimes:** Olive-skinned and dark-haired, the people of the Seven Cities, Illyria, and Kyprion call themselves the Manzaro, but most others call them the Septimes. They are a small and swift people, quick-speaking and sometimes too quick with a blade. They speak the Trade Tongue and a dialect they call Valeran.

**Smaller Peoples:** Dozens of smaller groups of humans consider themselves distinct from their neighbors, including the Kariv, Khazzaki, Mharoti, Morphoi, Khandirians, Olandska, Toar, and Vadi. Most speak the Trade Tongue and have a private language of their own as well.

**Human Corruption**

When the other races speak ill of the humans of Midgard, their complaints are clear: humans are corrupt, decadent, and untrustworthy. Humans are more prone to breed with demons and devils, become the prey of vampires, and turned into the tools and toys of elves. The entire existence of the elfmarked is attributed to human fecundity and general lack of discretion. Dwarves, gnomes, minotaurs, and other races are far more concerned with the purity of their bloodlines and the maintenance of their traditions and heritage. Human traditions are strong in some places – witness their schools of magic, or their knightly orders – and quite weak in others. In the eyes of other races, humans require persistent watching and paternal oversight, which explains why dwarves and elves can seem so constantly condescending.

The general sense that humans are more readily bribed, coerced, seduced, and corrupted encourages demons, devils, shadow fey, and other horrors to prey on humans in preference to other races. Perhaps this makes the impression a self-fulfilling prophecy, and other races are just as susceptible to corruption but simply less tempting targets. If human strength lies in the ability to adapt and large populations, human weakness originates in the race’s lusts, greed, and lack of discernment.
