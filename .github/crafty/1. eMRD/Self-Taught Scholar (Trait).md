# Self-Taught Scholar (Trait)
## Overview
**Self-Taught Scholar:** Being self-taught has made it necessary for you to scour all documentation you can get your hands on. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] checks to decipher unfamiliar languages, and [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] is always a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks made to decipher the writing on a scroll.
