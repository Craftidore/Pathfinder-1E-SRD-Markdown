# Dojo (Room)
## Overview
**Dojo**

**Earnings** gp, Influence, or Labor +8 

**Benefit** counts as a training facility for training or retraining 

**Create** 7 Goods, 1 Influence, 7 Labor (310 gp); **Time** 20 days 

**Size** 15–30 squares 

This open area is used for practicing combat or other physical skills. If used for combat training, it includes humanoid-shaped training dummies or silhouettes for target practice. Most Dojos include simple floor mats or straw pallets to cushion falls, plus racks containing nonlethal versions of standard weapons. If used by a Thieves’ Guild, instead of combat the Dojo might instead focus on evasion training, picking locks, and disabling traps. You can use a Dojo to train up to 10 people at a time. It can be used as Bunks, though it is much less comfortable than using actual beds or cots.
