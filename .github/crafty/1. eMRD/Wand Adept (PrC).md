# Wand Adept (PrC)
## Overview
Knowledge of how to create a thing leads to knowledge of how to master it. That principle drives most artificers and wizards. The wand adept is an artificer or other spellcaster who follows that principle to its logical conclusion, as it applies to wands. A wand adept’s knowledge bears tremendous practical fruit: she learns to identify the spell stored in a wand, to draw wands quickly and activate two wands at once, to siphon the magic power in a wand to alter fate in her favor, recharge a wand like it was a staff and even to power her own magical spells with charges from a wand.

Most wand adepts are artificers or wizards, who bring an impressive knowledge of wand creation to their specialized training. The high number of

ranks of [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] required before characters can adopt the class keeps out sorcerers and clerics until higher levels, but some high-level

sorcerers in particular seek out the training when they are eligible. Some bards meet the prerequisites, but few seek out the training, as it is not common for bards to do so.

The wizards' guilds (and magical crafting guilds, if any) of any major metropolis usually practice many different types of creation and artifice, and wand crafting is often but a minor portion of the guild’s operations. That said, the wand adepts of the guild form a small cadre of proud, elite crafters. They are trained in a one-on-one mentoring process: when a candidate is accepted into the training, she is assigned to a mentor who carries out the training. Wand adepts are highly protective of their own, and mentors commonly take new trainees under their wings in more than just an educational sense, becoming financial and political patrons to their students.

A great number of wand adepts put their particular talents to work on the battlefield or in dungeoneering; such dangerous occupations have a high mortality rate and this has resulted in senior wand adepts always being on the look out for new talent to fill their ranks.

**Hit Die:** d8.

**Class Features**

All of the following are class features of the wand adept prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Wand adepts gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Identify Wand (Ex):** A wand adept can identify the spell stored in a wand by handling and examining the wand for 1 minute and making a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 30 + the level of the stored spell). No retry is allowed on this check.

**Wand Focus (Ex):** A wand adept adds his class level to the saving throw DC and caster level of any wand he uses. This benefit stacks with that of the [[Wand Mastery (Feat)|Wand Mastery]] feat.

In addition, a wand adept gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made when casting any spell from a wand, regardless of whether the spell is a ray, a touch spell, or a spell that requires a normal attack roll. This bonus stacks with the benefit of [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (ray) and similar feats.

**Wand Quick Draw (Ex):** A 2nd-level wand adept can produce a wand stored at his belt or in a bandolier as a free action, as if he were drawing a weapon using the Quick Draw feat.

**Dual Wand Use (Su):** Also at 2nd level, a wand adept learns how to activate two wands nearly simultaneously as a full-round action. The adept must hold a wand in each hand in order to activate both wands. Activating two wands in this way is horribly inefficient, and consumes 1d4 charges from each wand rather than just 1 charge. If using this ability would require more charges than the wand has remaining, the wand fails to activate and loses all of its remaining charges.

**Siphon Charge (Su):** At 3rd level, a wand adept can use charges from a wand in his hand much to improve a single d20 roll used to make an attack, a skill check, an ability check, a level check, or a saving throw. He must make a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 25) to activate the wand in this way, which he can do as a free action once per round. The wand must have at least 6 charges. With a successful check, the wand adept drains 1d6 charges from the wand. If the wand holds 1st-level spells, the adept adds 1d6 to his d20 roll. Wands that hold higher-level spells allow him to roll more dice, in the same way. The wand adept rolls a number of dice equal to the spell level contained in the wand and adds the highest result to his d20 roll. If the wand contains 0-level spells, he rolls 1d4 instead.

**Recharge Wand:** At 4th level, each morning, when a wand adept prepares spells or regains spell slots, she can also imbue one wand with a portion of her power so long as the spell cast by the wand is on her spell list. Imbuing a wand with this power restores one charge to the wand, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the spell cast by the wand. 

**Power Spell:** At 5th level, a wand adept may power the casting of a spell by drawing on a wand in her hand. If the spell being powered is of the same type of magic (arcane or divine) as the wand then for each level of the spell a single charge is expended; if the spell is not of the same type as the wand then two charges are expended. A wand adept may do this once per day per point of her casting modifier (Cha, Wis, or Int).
