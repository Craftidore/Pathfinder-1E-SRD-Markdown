# Darakim (Archetype)
## Overview
**DARAKIM (MONK, UNCHAINED)** 

Darakhul, more disciplined than most other undead, practice a martial tradition that makes full use of their natural weapons and undead nature. 

**Bonus Feat:** Remove [[Gorgon's Fist (Feat)|Gorgon’s Fist]] and [[Medusa's Wrath (Feat)|Medusa’s Wrath]] from the list of bonus feats available to the darakim. At 6th level, add Improved Darkvision to the darakim’s list of bonus feats. At 11th level, add Paralytic Tongue. 

**Clawed Monk:** Beginning at 1st level, the darakim gains Ghoul Claws as a bonus feat. A darakim applies effects that would normally be delivered through flurry of blows or unarmed strikes through his natural weapons. At 3rd level, the darakim can make an additional attack with one of his natural weapons by spending a point of ki from his ki pool. This replaces flurry of blows and unarmed strike. 

**Improved Damage:** At 4th level, and every 4th level thereafter, the darakim’s natural weapons increase the damage they deal by one size category. This replaces unarmed damage. 

**Necromantic Strike (Su):** At 5th level, the darakim channels the power of undead through his martial prowess. Whenever he makes a full attack with his natural weapons, he can spend a point from his ki pool to designate one attack as a necromantic strike. If this strike deals damage, the darakim gains 5 temporary hp. At 9th level, the darakim’s target is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] in addition to the temporary hp. At 13th level, the target gains a negative level instead of fatigue. At 17th level, the darakim gains 10 temporary hp instead of 5. This replaces style strike. 

**Ki Powers:** The following ki powers complement the darakim: abundant step, ki hurricane, quivering palm, wholeness of body.
