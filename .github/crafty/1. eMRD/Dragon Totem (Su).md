# Dragon Totem (Su)
## Overview
*Dragon Totem (Su):* The barbarian must select a single color of dragon (black, blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, or white) as her totem. While raging, she gains a +1 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear, paralysis, and sleep effects. This bonus increases by +1 for each additional dragon totem rage power (such as dragon totem resilience and dragon totem wings) the barbarian possesses. A barbarian must have the [[Animal Fury (Ex)|animal fury]] and [[Intimidating Glare (Ex)|intimidating glare]] rage powers and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
