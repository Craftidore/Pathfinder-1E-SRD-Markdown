# Inscriptions of Privacy (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Privacy:** This wondrous architecture places arcane sigils throughout the walls and ceiling of a room. They can be as subtle or outlandish as the creator likes. However, when anyone tries to spy upon anyone in the room by means of *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance (Spell)|clairaudience/clairvoyance]]**,* *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]*, a *[[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]]*, or any other method of scrying, the inscriptions glow softly. If the scrying attempt originates within the stronghold space, the person attempting it begins glowing as well.

Anyone scried upon can make an opposed scry check. If the target of the scrying attempt wins the roll, she immediately gets a mental image of the scrier, along with a sense of the direction and distance of the scrier, accurate to within 10%.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Detect Scrying (Spell)|detect scrying]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
