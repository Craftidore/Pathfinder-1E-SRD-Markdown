A vast variety of boats and ships exist in the real world, from small rafts and longboats to intimidating galleons and swift galleys. To represent the numerous distinctions of shape and size that exist between water-going vessels, Table 2 describes several standard ship sizes and their respective statistics. Just as the cultures of the real world have created and adapted hundreds of different types of seafaring vessels, races in fantasy worlds might create their own strange ships. GMs might use or alter the statistics below to suit the needs of their creations and describe such conveyances however they please. All ships have the following traits. 

**Ship Type:** This is a general category that lists the ship’s basic type.

**AC**: The ship’s base Armor Class. To calculate a ship’s actual AC, add the captain’s [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) modifier to the ship’s base AC. Touch attacks against a ship ignore the captain’s modifier. A ship is never considered [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

**hp**: The ship’s total hit points. In addition, all ships have a hardness rating based on their construction material (hardness 5 for most wooden ships). At 0 or fewer hit points, a ship gains the [[Sinking|sinking]] condition as described above.

**Base Save**: The ship’s base save modifier. All of a ship’s saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will) have the same value. To determine a ship’s actual saving throw modifiers, add the captain’s [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) modifier to this base value.

**Maximum Speed**: The ship’s maximum tactical speed in combat. An asterisk indicates the ship has sails and can move at double speed when it moves in the same direction as the wind. A ship with only sails can only move if there is some wind.

**Arms**: The number of siege engines that can be fitted on the ship. A ram uses one of these slots, and only one ram may be fitted to a ship.

**Ram**: The amount of damage the ship inflicts on a successful ramming attack (without a ram siege engine).

**Squares**: The number of squares the ship takes up on the battle mat. A ship’s width is always considered to be one square.

**Crew**: The first number lists the minimum crew complement the ship needs to function normally, excluding those needed to make use of the vessel’s weapons. The second value lists the ship’s maximum crew plus additional soldiers or passengers. A ship without its minimum crew complement can only move, change speed, change direction, or ram if its captain makes a DC 20 [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check. Crew in excess of the minimum have no effect on movement, but they can replace fallen crewmembers or man additional weapons.
