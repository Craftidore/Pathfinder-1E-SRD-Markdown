# 3e7 - Mule Trains, Barges, and Wagon Trains
## Overview
**Mule Trains, Barges, and Wagon Trains**

The Crossroads is a region of trade, shifting goods and gold north to south and east to west. Mule trains, barges, wagon trains, and even a few dwarven airships do move cargo around from spring to late fall, but none of the roads are easy: bandits, goblins, snows and avalanches, deadly fey, and worse undead are all part of the need for vigilance and preparation. Most merchants move their cargoes only under heavy guard, even along the relatively quiet roads of the Magdar Kingdom or the Grand Duchy of Dornig.

## Table 3-1: Daily Pay for Guards
**Table 3-1: Daily Pay for Guards**


| **Type** | **Pay (gp/day)** |
|---|---|
| Archer | 2 |
| Cleric | 10 |
| Crossbowman | 1 |
| Scout | 3 |
| Outrider, mounted | 6 |
| Wagon Master | 20 |
| Wizard | 12 |

**Hiring:** A standard rate of pay doesn’t mean that all applicants are hired. Wagon masters are notoriously picky about who they hire, fearing cowardice, desertion, lack of martial skill, and—worst of all—betrayal to bandits or rival merchant groups. In most cases, a new hire is brought in as a scout, archer, or crossbowman.

**Novice, Veteran, and Heroic Pay:** In all cases, a novice of a particular type is 1st-level archer, warrior, fighter, cavalier, or ranger, and receives half the usual pay. A veteran of the type listed is 2nd to 4th level and receives standard pay. A heroic guard is 5th level and receives 10 times the usual pay. The pay is provided on safe arrival at the caravan or mule train’s destination.

**GM Note**

At the GM's discretion, PCs may hire out as guards during their downtime, so long as the duration of the venture they sign on for falls within the amount of downtime to be spent.
