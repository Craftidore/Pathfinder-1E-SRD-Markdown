# Church of the Whirling Fury (Affiliation)
## Overview
**Symbol:**  A vortex of wind behind a pair of crossed scimitars.

**Background, Goals, and Dreams:**  The Church of the Whirling Fury seeks to oppose the advance of demonic influences into the Material Plane, while at the same time venerating its patron, the eladrin paragon Gwynharwyf. It keeps its presence in Sasserine subtle, operating on the theory that to openly oppose such dangerous forces invites open retaliation from the enemy. The church was founded by an elven woman known to the church members only as Lady Silvermane.

**Enemies and Allies:** The Church Opposes all those who would traffic with demons and who would seek to allow demons and their influence to extend into the Material Plane. Evil religions. cabals of conjurers, and demon cultists are viewed with equal contempt. The church is wary of the Witchwardens, as it suspects some of its members of such activity.

**Members:** The Church of the Whirling Fury is a place of worship for those dedicated to the eladrin paragon Gwynharwyf. Her faithful consist of only a few dozen, and of these only a few know her by her name. Members meet once, a month on the night of the new moon to offer prayers and hear Lady silvermane speak. According to Lady Silvermane, a time will soon come to Sasserine when the people will need protection from themselves and it falls to the faithful of the Whirling Fury to cast aside their secrecy at this time to defend the city.

**Secrets:** The church’s true nature is known to only a few (such as Father Ruphus Laro of the church of St. Cuthbert), A carytid column is said to guard the church, and rumors of a larger complex below the above ground structure persist among its lay members.
