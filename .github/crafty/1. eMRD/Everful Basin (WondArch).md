# Everful Basin (WondArch)
## Overview
**Everful Basin:** This enchanted basin always has six gallons of water in it, no matter how many times it might be dipped into. However, if the *everful basin* is ever emptied completely, such as by tipping it over, it ceases to work forever, the magic spilling away with the last of the water.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Create Water (Spell)|create water]]**; Market Price:* 4,500 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 76
