# Dungeon Delver (PrC)
## Overview
In many ways, the dungeon delver is the ultimate adventuring

rogue. He’s skilled at moving stealthily through

all types of dungeon terrain, detecting and disarming

inconvenient traps, bypassing locks, locating treasure,

and filching protected items.

Since a dungeon delver frequently works alone, he

must learn to think and act independently, relying upon

no one but himself. Even when exploring a dungeon

in the company of other adventurers, he often keeps to

himself—scouting ahead, disarming traps a safe distance

from the group, or seeking treasure while the others are

distracted.

The typical dungeon delver has forsaken interaction

skills to concentrate on the nuts and bolts of dungeon

exploration and treasure retrieval. Rogues and scouts

make excellent dungeon delvers, as do the rare few ninjas

and spellthieves who choose to pursue this track. Multiclass

rogue/rangers who favor the darkness of caverns

to the light of the sky also make good dungeon delvers.

The best NPC dungeon delvers become legends and are

sought after by anyone with a particularly inaccessible

treasure to recover. Some even accept regular stipends from

various nobles to leave their treasures alone. Only the best

survive to make names for themselves, however—those

who lack the necessary skill and savvy perish anonymously

on unsuccessful expeditions, leaving behind their bones

for some luckier compatriot to discover.

Adaptation: Some of the most interesting adaptations

for the dungeon delver prestige class involve associating

it with a certain race. Although dwarves and gnomes are

natural choices because of their ties with underground

life, dungeon delvers of less obvious races such as

humans, dark elves, and halflings are interesting as well

because such characters offer something other than the

stereotypical depiction of their race. The dungeon delver

and the nightsong infiltrator (see page 62) also serve as

interesting roguelike prestige classes that do not rely on

the sneak attack ability and might serve as a model for

making similar prestige classes in your own campaign.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a dungeon delver, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Skills: Climb 10 ranks, Craft (stonemasonry) 5 ranks,

Disable Device 10 ranks, Hide 5 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering)

5 ranks, Move Silently 5 ranks, Open Lock

10 ranks, Search 10 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Blind-Fight.

Special: Trapfinding class feature.

Special: The character must survive a great trial underground.

This trial usually takes one of three forms:

• A solo dungeon expedition that earns the character half

of the experience points needed for advancement to

the next level. (For example, a 7th-level character must

earn 3,500 XP on such a solo run.) The character must

complete the venture in one week, though he may leave

the dungeon and return as often as desired during that

time.

• Survival of a cave-in or other collapse (see page 66 of

the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).

• Living for a year without seeing the light of the sun,

usually among underground denizens such as the deep

dwarves or drow.

CLASS SKILLS

The dungeon delver’s class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Climb (Str),

Craft (Int), Disable Device (Int), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str),

Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis),

Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic

Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the dungeon

delver prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Dungeon delvers

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Darkvision (Ex): A dungeon delver’s long exposure

to pitch-black subterranean surroundings enables him to

develop darkvision out to 60 feet. If the character already

has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.

Deep Survival (Ex): A dungeon

delver’s experience in

deep, dark places grants him

a great familiarity with that

world. He adds his class level

to Survival checks made in

underground environments.

Trap Sense (Ex): A dungeon

delver is adept at evading the

effects of traps. See the barbarian

class feature, page 26 of the

*Player’s Handbook.* The bonuses

rise by 1 for every three additional

dungeon delver levels

gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at

7th level, and +4 at 10th level)

and stack with similar bonuses

granted by other classes.

Reduce (Sp): A dungeon

delver frequently finds it necessary

to squeeze through

narrow crevices, half-collapsed

passages, prison

bars, and other tight spots

that would normally block

a character of his size and

bulk. Starting at 2nd level,

a dungeon delver can use *reduce*

*person* on himself three times

per day (regardless of his creature

type). His caster level is equal to his

class level.

Stonecunning (Ex): At 2nd level, a dungeon delver

gains the stonecunning ability. This functions exactly

as the dwarf racial trait of the same name (see page 15 of

the *Player’s Handbook*), except that the check modifiers

are competence bonuses rather than racial bonuses. If

a dungeon delver already has stonecunning because of

his race, both sets of bonuses apply.

Augury (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a dungeon delver

can foretell whether a particular action will bring good or

bad results for him in the immediate future. Once per day,

he can use *augury* as a free action; his caster level is equal

to his class level. He can use this ability one additional

time per day for every three additional class levels gained

(2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level).

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, a dungeon delver

becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that he

can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

The character selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his

Intelligence modifier. See the rogue class feature, page

51 of the *Player’s Handbook.*

Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, a dungeon delver

can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful

Reflex save. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the

*Player’s Handbook.*

If a dungeon delver already has evasion, he gains

improved evasion instead, allowing him to

avoid damage from certain attacks with

a successful Reflex save and take only

half damage on a failed save. See the

monk class feature, page 42 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.*

Blindsense (Ex): At 5th level, a dungeon

delver gains the ability to activate

an acute sensitivity to sounds, smells,

movement, and other disturbances within

30 feet. This functions as described on

page 306 of the *Monster Manual* and

lasts for 1 minute per class level. A

dungeon delver can use blindsense

once per day at 5th level and

twice per day at 10th level.

Passwall (Sp): Starting at

6th level, a dungeon delver

can use *passwall* once per day

as a caster of his class level.

This ability comes in handy for

bypassing small cave-ins or sneaking

into vaults.

Find the Path (Sp): Starting at 8th

level, a dungeon delver can use *find the*

*path* twice per day as a caster of his class level.

Typically, a delver uses this to find his way into and out

of confounding mazes and dungeons. He can target only

himself with the ability.

Phase Door (Sp): At 9th level, a dungeon delver gains

the ability to use *phase door* once per day as an 18th-level

caster. This ability enables him to bypass cave-ins, walk

through dead ends and immovable obstructions, and

make quick escapes through walls.

Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Weapon Finesse.

*Languages:* Common, Dwarven; Undercommon.

Augury (Sp): Morzul can use *augury* once per day as

a free action. Caster level 3rd.

Dwarf Traits: Dwarves have stonecunning, which

grants them a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice

unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10

feet of it can make a Search check as if actively searching.

Morzul adds his racial bonuses to his dungeon delver class

bonuses to determine his total stonecunning bonuses.

When standing on the ground, dwarves are exceptionally

stable and have a +4 bonus on ability checks made

to resist being bull rushed or tripped. Dwarves have a +1

racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids

and a +4 racial bonus to Armor Class against giants. Their

race also gives them a +2 bonus on Appraise or Craft

checks that are related to stone or metal items.

\*Dwarves have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws

against spells and spell-like effects.

Evasion (Ex): If Morzul is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Reduce (Sp): Morzul can use *reduce person* (self only)

three times per day. Caster level 3rd.

Skill Mastery (Ex): Morzul has mastered the skills

Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, and Search to the

extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress.

These skills are designated by SM in the statistics block.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Morzul deals an extra 4d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet

away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Morzul can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his

sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for

that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): Morzul can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Morzul retains his Dexterity

bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

*Possessions: +2 mithral shirt, ring of protection +1, +1 short*

*sword,* masterwork light crossbow, 25 *+1 bolts,* 10 silver

bolts, 10 cold iron bolts, *gauntlets of Dexterity +2, Heward’s*

*handy haversack*, 4 *potions of cure light wounds,* 50-ft. coil of

silk rope, grappling hook, masterwork thieves’ tools*.*
