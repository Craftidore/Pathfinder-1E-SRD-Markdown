# Gatehouse (Room)
## Overview
**Gatehouse**

**Benefit** defenders get bonus on initiative and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks 

**Create** 15 Goods, 3 Influence, 12 Labor (630 gp); **Time** 40 days 

**Size** 8–12 squares 

**Upgrades From** [[Gauntlet (Room)|Gauntlet]], [[Guard Post (Room)|Guard Post]] 

This defensive structure prevents access to a building. It is normally arranged so defenders have a clear line of sight to all room entrances or a clear view of all approaches to the building. It includes a strong wooden door with a good lock. You can improve this to an iron door for 500 gp. You can add a wooden portcullis for 500 gp or an iron portcullis for 1,000 gp. For an additional 80 gp, you can also count this room as a [[Gauntlet (Room)|Gauntlet]], allowing defenders to fall back and trap intruders here. You can construct this room in a tower layout (at no additional cost), which includes a second story that also counts as a Gatehouse. The listed price includes the cost of having unskilled employees as guards (1st-level commoners or experts with uniforms, but no armor or weapons). If the building has an [[Armory (Room)|Armory]], these employees are armed and armored, but still mostly for show. If you want trained guards who can defend against dangerous intruders, hire professional guards or recruit a team of Guards or Soldiers. You can use a Gatehouse as a [[Tollbooth (Room)|Tollbooth]], which provides the same Earnings (gp or Goods +4). Any defender using the Gatehouse’s defenses gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks against intruders at the Gatehouse.
