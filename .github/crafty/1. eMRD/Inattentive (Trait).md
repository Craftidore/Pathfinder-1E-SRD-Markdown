# Inattentive (Trait)
## Overview
**Inattentive**

You are skilled at finishing simple tasks quickly, but you have a difficult time dealing with longer, more complex tasks.

**Benefit:** Choose a skill that allows complex skill checks.

You gain a +1 bonus on simple skill checks made using the chosen skill.

**Drawback:** You take a -4 penalty on any complex skill checks made with the chosen skill

**Special:** You can take this trait more than once. Its effects do not stack. Instead, choose a new eligible skill each time you select this trait.

Ihis trait is avclilable only if your campaign includes the complex skill checks variant described earlier in this chapter.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might flit from subject to subject in conversation, or they might seem typical in most situations but leave most of their long-term projects perpetually unfinished.
