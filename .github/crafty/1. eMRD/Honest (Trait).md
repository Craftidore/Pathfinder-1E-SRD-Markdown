# Honest (Trait)
## Overview
**Honest**

You are naturally straightforward and sincere. This quality helps you persuade people to your viewpoint, but you have difficulty telling lies and seeing deception in others.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be naive and too unsophisticated to lie, or they might be aware of worldly matters and simply choose to take a higher ground.
