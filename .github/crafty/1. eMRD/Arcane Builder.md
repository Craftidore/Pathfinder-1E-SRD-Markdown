# Arcane Builder
## Overview
**Arcane Builder** 

You have an exceptional understanding of the theory behind creating magical items. 

**Benefit:** Select one type of magic item (potions, wondrous items, and so on). You create items of this type 25% faster than normal, and gain a +4 bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks (or other checks, as appropriate) to craft items of this type. 

**Special:** You may select this discovery multiple times; its effects do not stack. Each time you select this discovery, it applies to a different type of magic item.

**Source:** Ultimate Magic, pg. 86
