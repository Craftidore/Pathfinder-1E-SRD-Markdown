# Stare Feats
## Overview
**Stare Feats** 

Stare feats allow a mesmerist to apply additional effects to his painful stare ability. Characters without the Compounded Pain feat can apply the effects of only one stare feat to an individual attack; a mesmerist with multiple stare feats must choose which to apply before the damage roll is made. 


| **Feats** | **Prerequisites** | **Benefits** |
|---|---|---|
| Bleeding Stare\* | Mesmerist level 5th, painful stare class feature | Painful stare causes bleed damage |
| Demoralizing Stare\* | Mesmerist level 9th, painful stare class feature | Painful stare causes the shaken condition |
| Excoriating Stare\* | Mesmerist level 11th, painful stare class feature | Painful stare causes the sickened condition |
| Fatiguing Stare\* | Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature | Painful stare causes the fatigued condition |
| Intense Pain\* | Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature | Painful stare deals more damage |

  \* This is a combat feat, and can be selected as a brawler, fighter, gunslinger, swashbuckler, and warpriest bonus feat.
