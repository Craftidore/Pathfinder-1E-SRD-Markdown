# Caustic Magic
## Overview
**Caustic Magic**

You can imbue your acid magic with the terrifying power of caustic vapors.

**Benefit:** When you deal acid damage to a foe with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, as a swift action you may also force that foe to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 level + Int modifier) or be considered flanked by you for 1 round. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
