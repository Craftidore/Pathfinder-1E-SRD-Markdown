# Inscriptions of Dimensional Stability (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Dimensional Stability:** This wondrous architecture places arcane sigils throughout the walls, floors, and ceiling of a stronghold space. They can be as subtle or outlandish as the creator likes. However, when anyone tries to bring an item that has an extradimensional space as part of it makeup (such as a *bag of holding,* *[[Handy Haversack|handy haversack]]**,* or a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*) this spell stabilizes it in the event it is brought within the stronghold space so warded; preventing the rupturing which normally occurs and allowing the item to function normally (ie., the extradimensional space can be accessed)..

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]**; Market Price:* 8,000 gp.

**Source:** Sourceforge (Ideaware), pg. 3
