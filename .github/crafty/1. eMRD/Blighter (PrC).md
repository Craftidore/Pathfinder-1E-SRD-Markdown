# Blighter (PrC)
## Overview
When a druid turns away from the land, the land turns away

from her. Some ex-druids make peace with this change;

others seek to restore the bond. A few, however, actually

embrace their disconnection from nature and become

forces of destruction. These few, called blighters, bring

desolation wherever they tread.

A blighter gains her spellcasting ability by stripping the

earth of life. A swath of deforested land always marks her

path through the wilderness.

The vast majority of blighters are nomadic loners constantly

in search of green lands to destroy. Some are grim;

others laugh at the destruction they wreak. Almost all,

however, are friendless and mad. What puts them over the

edge is the knowledge that nature gets the last laugh: To

gain their spells, they must seek out the richest forests of

the land, even if it’s only to destroy them. Thus, even though

they’ve turned away from nature, they must constantly

return to it.

Only human ex-druids seem attracted in any number to

the blighter’s path. Legends say that a few elven druids have

also turned to destruction over the millennia—a terrifying

prospect given how much land they could destroy in their

long lifetimes.

Adaptation: In many ways, the blighter is to the druid

what the blackguard is to the paladin. While it’s likely that

blighters are loners, you could also develop a secret cult of

blighters devoted to ruining the world’s ecology.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the blighter prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Blighters gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day: Since blighters are ex-druids, they lose

their druid spellcasting abilities. However, they gain access

to new, more destructive spells. At each blighter level, the

character gains spells per day according to Table 2–3. She

must choose her spells from the blighter spell list, below.

The blighter’s caster level is equal to her blighter level plus

her druid level.

To cast a blighter spell, a blighter must have a Wisdom

score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a blighter with a

Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blighter

bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blighter’s

Wisdom modifi er. When the blighter gets 0 spells per

day of a given level (for instance 2nd-level spells for a 2ndlevel

blighter), she gains only the bonus spells she would

be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell

level. The blighter’s spell list appears below. A blighter has

access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a druid. A blighter prepares and casts spells

just as a druid does (though a blighter cannot spontaneously

cast *summon* spells).

The blighter gains access to her daily spells through *deforestation*

(see below). If she goes more than 24 hours without

deforesting a wooded area, she cannot cast spells until she

does so.

The default divine focus for any spell cast by a blighter is

a desiccated sprig of holly or mistletoe. Any material component

for a blighter’s spell must have been dead for at least

a day before use.

*Deforestation* (Sp): A blighter can kill all nonsentient plant

life within a radius of 20 feet per blighter level

as a full-round action once per day. If

a potentially affected plant is under

the control of another (such as a

druid’s *liveoak* or a dryad’s home

tree), the controller can make a

Fortitude save (DC 10 + blighter

level + blighter’s Wis modifi er)

to keep it alive. Affected plants

immediately cease photosynthesis,

root tapping, and all

other methods of sustenance.

Like picked fl owers, they appear

vibrant for several hours, but

within a day, they turn brown and

wither. Except for plants selected by

a controller, nothing can grow in a

deforested area until it has a *hallow*

spell cast upon it and it is reseeded.

Deforestation enables a blighter to cast

her daily allotment of spells. This ability

works in any terrain, but deforesting a

sandy desert, ice fl oe, or other environment

with only sparse vegetation does not empower the

character to cast spells.

Blightfi re (Su): Starting at 2nd level, as a standard

action, a blighter can unleash a scorching blast of fi re. This

effect deals 5d6 points of fi re damage to all creatures within

10 feet (Refl ex half; save DC is 10 + blighter’s class level +

blighter’s Wis modifi er) and ignites fl ammable objects it touches. Blighters delight in starting wildfi res and often

use this ability to do so.

Sustenance (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a blighter no

longer needs food or water to survive.

*Undead Wild Shape* (Sp): At 3rd level, the blighter gains a

version of the wild shape ability. *Undead wild shape* functions

like the druid’s wild shape ability, except that the blighter

adds the skeleton template to the animal form he chooses

to transform into. The blighter’s animal form is altered as

follows:

— Type changes to undead.

— Natural armor bonus is +0 (Tiny animal), +1 (Small),

+2 (Medium or Large), or +3 (Huge).

— +2 Dexterity, no Constitution score.

— Immunity to cold.

— Damage reduction 5/bludgeoning.

The blighter gains one extra use per day of this ability

at every even blighter level after 3rd. In addition, she gains

the ability to take the shape of a Large skeletal animal at 5th

level and a Huge skeletal animal at 9th level.

*Speak with Dead Animal* (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a

blighter can converse with dead animals. This ability functions

like a *speak with dead* spell cast by a cleric of a level

equal to the total of the character’s druid and blighter levels,

except that it affects only corpses of animal creatures. It is

usable once per day.

Contagious Touch (Su): At 5th level and higher, a

blighter can produce an effect like that of a *contagious*

*touch* spell once per day. She gains one extra use per day

of this ability for every two additional blighter levels she

acquires.

*Animate Dead Animal* (Sp): This ability, gained at 6th level,

functions like an *animate dead* spell, except that it affects

only corpses of animal creatures and requires no material

component. It is usable once per day.

*Unbond* (Sp): Beginning at 8th level, a blighter can temporarily

separate a bonded animal or magical beast (such as

an animal companion, familiar, or mount) from its master

once per day. The target creature must be within 40 feet of

both its master and the blighter. If the master fails a Will

save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighter’s Wis modifi er), the

bond terminates as if the servitor had died, though this

does not cause experience loss in the case of a familiar.

Normally hostile creatures attack their masters but are

otherwise unaffected. The bond returns after 1 minute

per blighter level, restoring all benefi ts. Alternatively, the

master can regain the servitor through the normal methods

of acquisition.

Plague (Su): At 10th level and higher, a blighter can

spread disease over a large area. This ability functions like

the contagious touch ability, except that no attack roll is

required and it affects all targets the blighter designates

within a 20-foot radius. Plague is usable once per day.
