# Leomund's Temperate Hut (WondArch)
## Overview
**Leomundâ€™s Temperate Hut:** This wondrous architecture is at its heart a permanent version of *[[Tiny Hut (Spell)|tiny hut]]*. Despite the name of the original spell, the hemisphere of force it creates is actually large enough to fill nearly four full stronghold spaces (a 20-foot-radius hemisphere). The temperate hut maintains a nice, steady temperature in all but the most extreme climates. It provides solid protection from the elements and can withstand up to a hurricane-force wind (75+ mph) before it is blown away.

The dome of the hut is opaque from the outside, but people and creatures can pass through it easily. Ranged weapons can be fired into the hut as well, but since the shell is opaque from that direction, those inside have total concealment. Those inside the hut can see out clearly. In addition, the hut can be illuminated or darkened from within with but a word.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Tiny Hut (Spell)|tiny hut]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
