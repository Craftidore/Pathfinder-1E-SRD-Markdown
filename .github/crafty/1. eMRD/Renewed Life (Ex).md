# Renewed Life (Ex)
## Overview
*Renewed Life (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of one temporary negative level per four barbarian levels she has (maximum 5). Once per day, when a barbarian with temporary negative levels ends her rage, she can attempt saving throws to remove a number of negative levels equal to the number of levels she could ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the [[Renewed Vitality (Ex)|renewed vitality]] rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
