# 4c - Khanate of the Khazzaki
## Overview
The plains are filled with human nomads, and most call themselves Khazzak or Khazzaki. They are followers of Svarog and Khors and Perun and Sweet Golden Lada, though Svarog is their patron. Their cities are built of tents and flesh and rope and the people are often driven from their chosen site before the wind, but they are no less formidable for that. Their master, the Khan of the Khazzaki, rules from the City of Wheels. His nation stretches wherever hoof beats thunder, from the Cloudwall to Far Cathay.

The riders, tribes, and khans of the Khazzaki are a mixed lot: adventurers and raiders, gypsies and centaurs. Anyone who swears fealty to the khan is welcome in their tents, and guests are honored for a night even in deepest winter. They ride to war over frozen fields, their ponies small but fast and incredibly tough, like their riders. Indeed, the horses of the Khazzaki are never shod except when they must leave the plains, and they rarely do.

## Khan of the Khazzaki
**Khan of the Khazzaki**

The current Khan of the Khazzaki is Bodhan Zenody, an archer, a rider, a scholar, and a man of infinite cunning and artful compromise, that last the only reason he has ruled for almost 20 years. He is now ready to consider a great toss of the dice, a run at looting one of the great nations such as Cathay or Khandiria in the East, the Mharoti in the South, perhaps the rabble of Krakova or the Magdar in the west. He commands an army, his generals are tested and loyal, and the shaman and outriders tell him that the Khazzaki are perhaps a bit lazy, in need of a test.

Bodhan Zenody does not rest easy. If he gambles and fails, one of his three sons will surely take the title of Khan of Khans. The adventurous life of the Khazzaki is a sword dance away from complete collapse, and yet his people trust him to lead them to glory.

## Unnamed
**Plains of Rhos Khurgan**

The northern section is the Plains of Rhos Khurgan, land of the red mounds, burial sites of an ancient race. The Khazzaki are common in these rolling hills and grasslands east of the Nieder Strait, and south to the Ruby Sea. Here wild horsemen pour libations of blood and wine over ancient barrows, honoring dead heroes and Svarog the Rider, their patron god.

The chief inhabitants of Rhos Khurgan are the Khazzak Brotherhoods, nomads descended from an unlikely mix of Northern raiders, ancient steppe dwellers, and Kariv gypsies. They have no cities and live as roving horse and ox herders, and occasionally as farmers. They are freemen and adventurers, unlike the serfs and slaves of Reth-Saal or Vidim, or even the sheltered folk of Domovogrod.

The southernmost section of the Rothenian Plain is a larger region where the Khazzaki come to get away from the “settled” region of Rhos Khurgan. The open lands of Khanate include a few small taiga forests, many rolling hills and gently sweeping rivers, and an endless supply of grass. They end to the south at the foothills of the Dragoncoil Mountains, where the Mharoti city of Kaa’nesh is a home of ogres and dragonkin who despise the freeriding Khazzak bands.

The Khan has repeatedly tried to capture the city, and repeatedly failed. The Mharoti have sent one army out into the grasslands against the Khazzak. The tribesfolk consider it a point of pride that Kharalang the Wind Dragon slew the army’s drakes, and the horsemen harried the Mharoti infantry all the way back to Kaa’nesh, shooting the last few retreating edjet within sight of the city walls.

No second army has yet been assembled to tread upon the Khanate’s tall grass.

**The Black Wagon:** Khazzak and Kariv alike tell tales of the black wagon, a Kariv caravan painted entirely black. It’s never seen on the move, only encountered camped, no horses to be seen. The wagon’s sole occupant is Akka the Old One, a broken-toothed oracle who foretells only doom. Meeting her means an encounter with the Ebon Mare of death cannot be far off.

**Yurt Monasteries:** Scattered across the plains are tent monasteries where monks, wizards, and sorcerer-priests live in studious seclusion. Many seek them out when Kariv wise-women and hedge magic cannot solve a Khazzaki’s problems. The steppes are home to many strange gods and spirits however, so it’s wise to know into exactly whose yurt one is walking. The most famous yurt monastery is that of the Krasni Yurta, a red tent that only arcanists can find. It is carried on the winds by Yakev Illyonevik, wizard and rival to the Master of Demon Mountain. Other famous yurt monasteries include the yurt of Pylyp Faddovik, a pit fighter who became a master of the mind and hand, and that of Black Mother Yeva, the mother sorcererpriestess of Chernovog.

**Khazzaki Camps:** A typical encampment of the Khazzaki includes 100 to 300 men, women, and children, and with a family of friendly centaurs as allies and auxiliaries. These centaurs are called the Kin Ludi, or the horse friends, of the clan. The Khazzaki believe that Svarog creates centaurs out of his most deserving human followers. These camps are entirely mobile and rarely stay in one place long (even in winter, the steppes ponies can survive on forage from beneath the snows). They wander widely in the summer grazing and raiding season, and journeys of 100 or 300 miles are considered no great hardship, a matter of a few days ride.

At the end of summer, all Khazzaki camps send at least a few emissaries to pledge their fealty to the khan at Misto Kolis, and to prepare for winter and spring raids. Their ability to fight in the snows makes them extremely dangerous, and all the Khazzaki’s neighbors know better than to relax their watch at the first snowfall of winter.

## Misto Kolis, the City of Wheels
**Misto Kolis, the City of Wheels**

Moving across the plains on the back of creaking carts, the City of Wheels is the Khanate’s nominal capital and main trading center, as nomadic as the people it serves. Most of the city is made up of palatial orgoo (massive pavilions) and collapsible buildings of light wood that can be packed onto wagons or pack horses when the city roves.

Famed for its wrestlers, jugglers, jesters, and other entertainers, the city frequently appears to be one giant drunken party—although much trade and diplomacy goes on quietly amid the drink and games. Families come and go, but the city is heavily influenced by the Khanate’s Woolen Palace and by the Kariv Leanti family, ruled by Clan Mother Lumenita Leanti (N female human bard 3/diviner 6) in the Kariv style, especially when the khan is raiding. There are more Kariv gathered here than anywhere else, although the city’s population fluctuates wildly.

## The Three Great Treasures of the Khan
**The Three Great Treasures of the Khan**

The Khan of the Khazzaki has three great treasures: a magical horse, a magical bow, and a suit of armor.

*Draugir*, a night-black undead mount, breathes a killing fog and its hooves leave a trail of fire (treat as nightmare with a cloudkill 3/day). Only the true khan can mount this steed; it has killed some contenders for the title by throwing them from its back into a chasm or pit of fire. 

*Seeker* is a +3 humanbane bow carved from the heartwood of a World Tree, built by centaur bowyer as a gift for the khan. Some say that Seeker is the symbol of unity between Khazzaki and centaur, the physical manifestation of their long alliance.

The *Dragoncoat* is a suit of golden and silver +4 scale armor taken from the heart scales of a wind dragon. In addition to its powerful protective enchantments in battle, it provides immunity to poison, enchantments, and evocations of all kinds. Some even claim it provides a *heal* spell 1/week for the wearer; the khans have, over many years, acquired a reputation for leaving a battlefield half-dead and returning to their armies in the morning, unscratched and ready for more.
