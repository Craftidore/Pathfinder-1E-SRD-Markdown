# Possessed (Trait)
## Overview
**Possessed:** You were, or are, possessed in some way by another entity that grants you occasional access to its knowledge. Once per day, you can attempt a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check of your choice even if you are not trained in that skill and it is not usually possible to use that skill untrained. If you can normally use that skill untrained, you gain a +2 trait bonus on the check.
