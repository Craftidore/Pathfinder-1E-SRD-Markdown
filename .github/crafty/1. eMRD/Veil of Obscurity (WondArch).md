# Veil of Obscurity (WondArch)
## Overview
**Veil of Obscurity:** This wondrous architecture disguises up to twenty contiguous stronghold spaces (or two levels of ten contiguous stronghold spaces each) with a *[[Mirage Arcana (Spell)|mirage arcana]]* effect, making the structure appear as something other than it is. It includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, though it canâ€™t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

*Caster Level:* 10th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mirage Arcana (Spell)|mirage arcana]]**; Market Price:* 25,000 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 85
