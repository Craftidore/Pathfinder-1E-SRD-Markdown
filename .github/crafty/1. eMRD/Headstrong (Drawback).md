# Headstrong (Drawback)
## Overview
**Headstrong:** You feel compelled to correct every action and argument that contradicts your worldview. Whenever you witness an action or hear an argument that contradicts your alignment, you must attempt to stop or correct that action or argument. If you either don't try to stop it or fail in your attempt to stop it (as adjudicated by the GM), you are [[Shaken|shaken]] for 1 hour.
