# Outcast's Intuition (Trait)
## Overview
**Outcast's Intuition:** You are able to sense the motives of others and use that sense to bolster your magic against dispelling. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks, and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] is always a class skill for you. In addition, your caster level is treated as 1 level higher for the purposes of any attempts to dispel your magic.
