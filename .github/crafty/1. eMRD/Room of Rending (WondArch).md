# Room of Rending (WondArch)
## Overview
**Room of Rending:** All magic items (not including artifacts) and magical effects entering this stronghold space are affected as if by *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]]*. Permanent magic items must make a Will save (DC 23) or be turned into normal items. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or that of its possessor, whichever is higher. An *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* has only a 17% chance of being affected.

*Caster Level:* 17th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]]**; Market Price:* 76,500 gp.
