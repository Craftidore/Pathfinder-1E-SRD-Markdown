# Ship Construction (Spelljammer)
## Overview
**Materials**

A wide variety of materials are used in ship construction, and

some are quite rare and wonderous. The most typical are detailed

here and used throughout these rules. For other materials the

DM will need to determine its properites and costs.

**Bone:** The bones of large creatures, such as kindori, are

often used as ship materials by the desperate and poor. Bones are

not particularly sturdy, but they do work.

**Wood:** This is normal terrestrial wood, typically a hardier variety such as oak.

**Iron Wood:** Iron wood is normal wood that has been

treated with iron wood solution, which is an alchemical

concoction. Normal wood can be treated with iron wood

solution after a ship is built, and so is a popular upgrade.

**Dark Wood:** There are a number of different tree types

whose wood is collectively known as dark wood, and all of them

grow in spheres whose primary gives off less light than normal.

Dark wood is stronger, but because it is found on fewer worlds

and individual trees tend to be smaller, it is more expensive than

normal wood. Dark wood cannot be treated with iron wood

solution; the dark wood does not absorb it.

**Stone:** This is some form of durable stone, such as granite

or marble, often mined from asteroids.

**Crystal:** Crystal is a type of stone, but it resists attacks

better and is more durable. Crystal is hard to mine in sufficient

sizes and quantities, and so few ships use it. The neogi are fond

of crystalline hulls for their ships, mined with the help of their

umber hulk servants.

**Ætherstone:** There are places in wildspace where the

barriers between the material plane and the ethereal plane

break down, and streams of ethereal matter stream into our

world. This matter calcifies quickly and becomes ætherstone. It

is rare, but treasured by those who use stone to build ships, due

to its durability. It is also surprisingly light, weighing one-third

as much as granite.

**Iron:** This is normal iron.

**Flowsteel:** The odd medium of the phlogiston has strange

effects on many things that remain in it for long periods of time,

and this includes iron ore within asteroids that find their way

into the Flow. Over the centuries this iron ore becomes what is

referred to as flowsteel, and is highly coveted by the dwarves,

who often drag asteroids into the flow, so as to “farm” the

flowsteel at a later time. The drawback to flowsteel is that it

does not resist fire as well, and fire attacks against ships that use

it do not halve their damage.

**Pyre Iron:** While most all fire bodies have a connection to

the elemental plane of fire, some sphere primaries have a

“deeper” connection, and give off elemental energies that have

nearly a spiritual component. Asteroids with iron ore that orbit

these primaries at just the right distance manage to absorb this

energy without boiling away. Once smelted, pyre iron glimmers

oddly, even without light, appearing as if flames danced across

its surface. Getting to these asteroids typically requires magical

protection, but because of the durability of pyre iron the

dwarves are willing to pay the expense (and pass it on to their

customers). Pyre iron has the added bonus of being very

resistant to fire and heat (DR 50), though it also means it

requires impressive magics to shape it.

**Mithral:** This is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is

lighter than iron but just as hard. Few ships bother with mithral

because its primary advantage is its lightness, and this isn’t that

important for most ships.

**Adamantine:** Found only in meteorites or asteroids and the

rarest of veins in magical areas, this ultrahard metal is the

ultimate shipbuilding material. Ships whose hull or plating is

composed of adamantine gains a natural enhancement bonus to

AC. This bonus does not stack with other enhancement

bonuses. If the hull is adamantine, this bonus is +2. If the

plating is adamantine, it is +1. If the ship has both an

adamantine hull and plating, the total bonus is +3. These

bonuses are not included in the AC indicated on Table XX, but

rather are added on top of them.

Step One: Choose Form

The form of a spelljamming vessel is its shape and design, and

plays a role in how maneuverable the ship is. A ship designed by

a spacefaring shipwright is shaped to work with the way a helm

functions, so the ship moves with the helmsman, rather than

fighting him. Ships not designed to take advantage of the

freedom and three dimensional aspects of space are less

maneuverable.

There are three broad categories of ship form: space,

terrestrial, and poor. There is no cost difference between then,

nor does it take longer to build; what determines the difference

1.b.12

*3e Spelljammer:*

*Ship Construction*

is who designed the ship. Spacefaring shipwrights create space

ships, while groundling shipwrights without knowledge of the

workings of spelljamming create terrestrial ships.

*Space* form ships are designed to take advantage of the free

and open nature of space, to work with the motivational force

of the helm and the steering mechanisms used to maneuver. It

is misleading to think that an overall shape is the only factor in

space design. The truth is that a good spacefaring shipwright

understands the subtleties requires to make a design work. For

example, the whaleship looks far more bulky than a terrestrial

galleon, but is still considered a space design. This is because the

designers of the whaleship understood the science of spacefaring

ship engineering, and used this knowledge to make the ship as

maneuverable as possible for its size.

*Terrestrial* form ships are primarily planet-based ocean-going

vessels that have been retrofitted with a helm, which gives this

form its name. Examples include the galleon and the cutter.

Despite the name, though, the terrestrial form can also include

non-planet-based ships. It can include space form ships that

were altered, ships designed by less experienced shipwrights, or

ships that require they be a certain shape.

*Poor* form ships are vessels whose design almost actively

defy the free nature of space and maneuverability. Their shape

and poor steering mechanism layout make the ship rather

unwieldy, and hard to maneuver. Ships with the poor form are

usually created when the designer of the ship has little actual

knowledge on what it takes to build any kind of ship. They can

also be created by clumsy ship modification. The most common

examples of poorly designed ships are those built and used by

gnomes.

Ultimately, the DM has final say on what the form of a ship

is. In most cases the skills of the shipwright will determine its

form, but in some cases the required shape will determine the

form. It doesn’t matter how skilled the shipwright is, a

rectangular, box-like ship is not going to have a space form.

To illustrate how the system works, we will build a ship as

an example.

*A successful band of mercenaries and privateers have recently*

*come into a lot of money and three Huge helms, and so wish*

*to purchase some ships that can make better use of the more*

*powerful helms. They look at the standard designs, but decide*

*to have three custom built ships, better designed for warfare.*

*They decide to call the ship class the Tiger Shark, since they*

*will base it on the Hammerhead.*

*The ship will be designed and built by spacefaring shipwrights,*

*and so will be a space design.*

Step Two: Choose Tonnage

Tonnage is a measure of the ship’s volume. One ton is equal to

1,350 cubic feet (50 cubic yards). The actual dimensions of the

ship is considered unimportant in this system; a 60 ton ship

(81,000 cubic feet) could be a cube of approximately 43.25 feet

per side, a 52’ x 52’ x 30’ rectangle, or any other dimensions that

total to a volume of 81,000 cubic feet. Tonnage is normally a

whole number, for ease of use, but there is no technical reason

you can’t have a

ship with a

fractional tonnage

(e.g. 10.5 tons).

Round fractions up

when determining

size.

The minimum

tonnage for a ship is

one ton. There is no

real maximum ship

tonnage, although helms that can move ships above 128 tons

are rare and expensive. This system can also be used to create

structures that aren’t exactly ships, such as floating drydocks or

space stations.

Once you have a ship’s tonnage, you can then determine its

size; ships have a size, just as creatures do. The size of the ship

modifies a number of things, such as the ship’s Armour Class

and how hard it is to attack from it with heavy weapons. It also

determines how maneveuverable the ship is. Consult Table XX

to find the ship’s size. The effects of size can be found in sections

XX, and Chapter XX: Ships and Ship Combat.

Note that while ships use the same names for size, these size

categories are not the same as creature sizes. A small ship is

much larger than a small creature. See Chapter XX: Ships and

Ship Combat on how the these categories correlate.

**Table XX: Ship Size By Tonnage**

**Ship Size Tonnage**

Tiny 1-2

Small 3-6

Medium 7-14

Large 15-30

Huge 31-62

Gargantuan 63-126

Colossal 127+

*Advanced Form*

Spacefaring shipwrights have refined their craft over

centuries, with the results being superb ship designs that take

advantage of the nature of space. In the last few years,

though, some radical thinkers have been taking new

approaches to ship design, using magic to more closely study

the interaction of the ship with the field created by a

spelljamming helm. The end result has been the triop, an

odd looking ship that is inherently more maneuverable. The

triop has a new form, termed *advanced*. Because so few

shipwrights understand the nuances of the advanced form,

the triop can be built in only a few major ports, such as Bral

The advanced form increases the cost of the hull, frame,

plating, and rigging by 50%. It must have a heavy frame or

better, due to the stresses put upon it by the optimized shape.

Finally, the interior of an advanced form ship has a large

number of low nooks and spaces that are ultimately unusable

in most situations, dropping available internal tonnage by 10%.

The triop is currently the only known ship design that

uses the advanced form. Coming up with additional designs

using the advanced form would take several years of

expensive research.

*After some consultation, the mercenaries decide on a tonnage*

*of 50, since this allows them to tow a few smaller ships*

*(fighters) if necessary, and stay within the Huge ship size.*

Step Three: Design the Frame

The frame is the internal structure of the ship, the skeleton

upon which all other components are built. It is the really the

only component a ship must have to be considered a ship. It is

also one of the most important, since it determines how big the

ship is, and thus how many people and weapons it can carry, and

is the primary factor in determining how much damage it can

take.

There are two factors in frame design. The first is the

materials that make up the frame; better, stronger materials

make a ship more durable. They also cost more gold. Table XX

has the costs by tonnage.

The second factor in frame design is how much of the

material goes into the frame: the more materials you use the

stronger the frame becomes, at the expenditure of gold and

space. The more space used to build the frame, the less space

you have in the ship to house people or cargo. There are five

types of frames: light, standard, heavy, extra-heavy and superheavy.

Each frame type is

generally found on ships serving

a particular purpose.

A *light frame* is the lightest

type, and is found mostly on

ships designed to carry large

amounts of cargo or on shuttles

and small pleasure craft. The

frame is basically just enough

structure to mount a hull upon

and support cargo. The lack of

material saves both money and

space, but drops the durability

of the ship severely.

A *standard frame* is the

most common type, used for

most ships excepting those expecting to see a large amount of

combat. This includes most traders and groundling ships.

*Heavy frames* are used on ships designed to be combat

capable, but whose primary use is not always combat. They are

often used as trading ships in rough territories, or as secondary

trade ships providing protection to a caravan. Heavy-framed

ships are also popular with adventurers and freebooters. Some

examples of heavy framed

ships are the hammership

and squidship; both can

hold their own in a fight,

but they also are multifunctional

enough to see

non-combat use.

*Extra-heavy* frames

are almost always found on

ships whose primary

purpose is warfare. Their lack of space and high cost make them

impractical for most other purposes.

*Super-heavy* frames are found mostly on ships made from

hollowed out objects, such as the asteroid-carved citadels of the

dwarves. Super-heavy frames have very thick walls, often close

to a foot. For walls beyond this thickness, such as asteroids that

have only a small percentage of their interior hollowed out, see

the option Asteroid Ships in Section XX. Note that the cost for

the super-heavy frame assumes that the materials are being

assembled like any other ship. For hollowed out objects the price

may drop or rise, depending on the extent of work that needs

done.

The type of frame used will affect the cost, figured as a

multiplier to the base cost from material type. This is shown on

Table XX.

The type of frame will affect how much internal space it

uses; a heavier frame uses more space. See Section XX for more

on internal space usage.

*Looking over the materials available, they find that metal is far*

*too expensive, and the various types of stone are expensive and*

*impractical, so they stick with the standard of wood. An extra*

*heavy-frame seems a natural, but since they tend to carry a*

*large number of mercenaries and supplies for them, they decide*

*to go with heavy, so they don’t have to give up on space.*

*At 300 gp per ton for wood, the 50 ton frame will cost 15,000*

*gp. Modified by the x2 multiplier for a heavy frame, the total*

*cost is 30,000 gp.*

Step Four: Design the Hull

Whereas the frame is the skeleton of the ship, the hull can be

considered the skin. It provides protection to the crew and

cargo of the ship, both from attacks and the elements. The cost

for the hull, per material type and per ton of the ship, is shown

on Table XX.

A ship is not required to have a hull, which will reduce the

cost and construction time, but reduces durability and the

Armour Class, as well as allowing attackers to target specific

internal sections of the ship. It also prevents the ship from being

able to land in water.

It is possible to add

additional materials and bracing

to the hull, which makes the

ship more durable (i.e. adds hit

points). This doubles the cost of

the hull, but multiplies the hit

points from the hull by 1.5. See

Section XX for more on

determining the ship’s hit

points.

*Again, the mercenary company*

*would like metal, but the cost is*

*prohibitive for the full hull.*

*doubles the price to 10,000 gp.*

Step Five: Decks and Enclosure

Most ships in space have an open top deck, much like any

groundling sailing vessel. This makes the mounting of weapons

and rigging much easier and more space efficient. Some ships

instead opt to have their ship partially or fully enclosed,

reducing their deck space but increasing the ship’s level of

protection, and thus Armour Class. The drawbacks of a

reduction of deck size is a reduction of the amount of weapons

and rigging a ship can mount without complication. Enclosure

of any kind is fairly uncommon. It is most often seen on ships

designed either for warfare or vessels that try to avoid warfare,

or ships that depend on other ships for protection, such as large

cargo ships and passenger liners.

To have either partial or full enclosure the designer simply

decides; there is no change in cost or construction time. Partial

enclosure reduces the number of weapons a ship can carry by

half. Full enclosure drops it to zero; all weapons must be

mounted internally or on the hull of the ship. See Section XXX

for how enclosure affects rigging choices and Section XX for the

affects of enclosure on Armour Class.

It is also possible to have more deck space, which also costs

nothing. This is simply a function of widening the deck while

making the ship more shallow, or adding decks to other parts of

the ship, such as the underside. The benefit of this is that it

increases the amount of weapons that can be added. The

drawback is that it decreases the Armour Class, as flat surfaces

are much worse at deflecting shots, and bigger deck makes it an

easier target. See Section XX for the affect on Armour Class.

There are two levels of deck expansion: partial and full.

Partial increases the number of weapons that can be added by a

third, and full increases it by two thirds. This extra deck space

can also count as a second deck, usually on the other side of the

ship, but this will likely preclude the ship from landing in water.

Expanded decks and enclosure are mutually exclusive.

*The Tiger Shark will not have more than standard rigging, so*

*they opt for partial enclosure. This will reduce the number of*

*weapons they can mount, but they expect to mount some of*

*their weapons internally anyway. This costs nothing.*

Step Six: Calculate Hit Points

At this point the hit points of the ship can be calculated. Hit

points are based on the ship’s tonnage and the materials used for

the frame and the hull. Table XX below lists the hit points per

ton for the frame and the hull, based on materials; simply

multiply the ship’s tonnage by the listed hit points. The strength

of the frame will modify the frame hit points: multiply the frame

hit points by the frame strength multiplier from Table XX.

Bracing will multiply the hull’s hit points by 1.5. Once you have

the frame’s hit points and the hull’s hit points, add them

together, rounding

up to the nearest

multiple of 5. This

is the ship’s total

hit points.

*The Tiger Shark*

*has both a*

*wooden frame*

*and a wooden*

*hull. It has a*

*heavy frame and*

*a braced hull.*

*Frame hit points*

*is 750 (12 hit*

*points per ton,*

*multiplied by 50 tons,*

*then multiplied by 1.25*

*for the ship’s frame*

*strength multiplier). Hull*

*hit points is 300 (4 hit*

*points per ton, multiplied*

*by 50 tons, then*

*multiplied by 1.5 for the*

*hull bracing). Adding*

*these together gives the*

*ship a total of 1,050 hit points.*

Step Seven: Choose Rigging Type

Because the helm’s primary purpose is propulsion, it makes a

relatively poor steering device on its own. Nearly all ships rely

on other steering devices to help maneuver the ship. Although

some ships use rudders and fins rather than sails, they are all

referred to as rigging. There are five types of rigging: none,

minimal, standard, terrestrial and topped-out, all of which can

have an effect on the

Maneuverability Class of

the ship.

No rigging is just what

it sounds like: a ship that

does not use any sort of

additional steering device

beyond the helm. Few

ships are designed this way

intentionally, since it

makes the ship extremely sluggish while maneuvering. Of those

few that are, most tend to be small in order to offset the

penalties, or extremely large, at which point maneuverability

becomes nearly a moot point anyway. On the other hand, any

ship can end up without rigging if it is destroyed or the rigging

crew are all dead.

Minimal rigging uses just barely enough steering devices to

allow the helmsman to put most of the maneuvering work into

the hands of the riggers. It is fairly rare, mostly found on ships

that depend on other ships for defense, such as large cargo ships

and transport ships, or on small pleasure and shuttle craft,

which are designed to stay close to a larger base or craft.

Standard rigging is found on the majority of ships in Arcane

Space, representing what is considered by most the optimal ratio

of maneuverability and manpower requirements.

Topped-out rigging adds additional steering devices, but

also increases the manpower to use them properly. The

additional rigging allows the crew to use more specific steering

devices for certain situations, which increases the

Maneuverability Class of the ship. There are two drawbacks to

topped-out rigging. First, it requires twice as many riggers to

operate. Second, if all of these men aren’t available, the ship

drops to minimal class rather than standard. This is due to the

fact that the rigging has been thoroughly optimized, and a lack

of a few men throws the system off.

Terrestrial rigging is required for any ship of terrestrial

origins (i.e. galleons, cogs). This will be most ships with the

terrestrial design form, but there are exceptions (e.g. a ship built

by a spacefaring shipwright, but has a terrestrial from due to an

oddly shaped forecastle would not need terrestrial rigging).

Seafaring ships require far more rigging and men to maneuver

than spacefaring, as such ships have rigging designed for water

travel rather than space travel, which needs more sails to

function. It takes all of those sails used at their maximum

potential just to maneuver in space as well as they do. Anything

less and they are considered to have minimal. Ships that require

terrestrial rigging cannot have topped-out rigging, and standard

rigging functions as minimal, but has the standard crew

requirements.

A ship that has either full or partial enclosure is limited by

the amount of rigging it can have, since decks space is the

primary location for steering devices. A ship with partial

enclosure can not have more than standard rigging, and one

with full enclosure cannot have more than minimal rigging. The

only way around this is by installing the rigging internally, which

takes up space. The space requirements are all a percentage of

the ship’s tonnage, based on the type of rigging: 5% for minimal,

10% for standard, and 20% for topped-out. Terrestrial rigging

cannot be mounted internally. This internal space usage

represents the spatial requirements for crew and the portion of

the steering device they directly handle. The fins, rudders and

sails still stick out of the ship and can be attacked. On the other

hand, the crew cannot be directly attacked, although they can

potentially be damaged by attacks to the area they occupy.

The cost of rigging depends on the type and size of the ship,

as shown on Table XX. Mounting rigging internally doubles the

cost. It is possible to have minimal, standard or topped-out

rigging made of solid materials, such as wood, rather than sails.

Such rigging is more expensive, but it has the benefit of being

harder to damage. Solid rigging costs three times as much as

normal rigging.

Standard and topped-out rigging have a number of hit

points equal to five times the the tonnage of the ship. Minimal

rigging has half of this (x2.5). Double these numbers for solid

rigging. Terrestrial rigging has hit points equal to seven times the

tonnage of the ship. Rigging has AC 20, modified by size (see

Table XXX), and rigging is smaller than the ship it is on.

Minimal is three sizes smaller, standard is two sizes smaller, and

terrestrial and topped-out are one size smaller. Solid rigging adds

+5 to this. Sails have no hardness and solid rigging has the same

hardness as the hull material (or frame material if it has no hull).

*The mercenaries have no desire to pack around extra riggers*

*for topped-out rigging, and so go with standard. This costs*

*2,500 gp. They don’t want to be vulnerable to rigging shears,*

*and so pay the extra cost for solid rigging, for a total of*

*7,500 gp. Their rigging will have 500 hit points (50 tons*

*multiplied by 5 for 250, multiplied by two for solid rigging),*

*and will have AC 25*

Step Eight: Calculate

Maneuverability Class

Now that the various factors involved with maneuvering a ship

have been decided, we can calculate it’s Maneuverability Class.

A ship’s Maneuverability Class is based on it’s size, its type of

rigging and its form. Table XX indicates Maneuverability Class

based on size, then Tables XX and XX show how rigging and

form modify it. The best a ship can have is MC A, and the worst

is MC X.

*The Tiger Shark is a Huge ship, which is MC E. They are of*

*a space design and have standard rigging, neither of which*

*modifies Maneuverability Class.*

Topped Out +1

Terrestrial none

Step Nine: Choose Armour

Although the term “armour” tends to conjure images of things

such as knights in plate mail or tanks covered in slabs of steel,

all ships with a hull are considered to be armoured. The hull

serves to protect the internal frame of the ship, as well as crew,

passengers and cargo. A ship can also have additional materials

plated over the hull, improving its Armour Class.

It is uncommon to find most merchant vessels or cargo ships

with any additional plating, simply relying on their wood hulls to

protect them. Ships that expect to see combat but are generally

designed to be useful in other situations, such the hammership

and the squidship, add additional wood plating. Metal plating is

typically reserved for ships either designed completely for

combat, or as an upgrade for other ships (see the Ship

Modification system for more on upgrading a ship). Note that

plating is different from hull bracing; a ship can be both braced

and plated with the same material, or have one or the other.

Another factor in a ship’s Armour Class is its size. Smaller

ships are harder to hit, while larger ships are the opposite.

All ships have a base AC of 10. Their hull type adds a

bonus to this (Table

XX), as does

additional plating

(Table XX) and the

ship’s size (Table

XX). The cost of

plating is shown on

Table XX.

Finally, ships with

enclosure have a

bonus to AC: +1 for

partial, +2 for full. Ships with expanded decks will have

penalties: –1 for partial, –2 for full.

In addition to Armour Class, all ships have a hardness

rating. This measures the ability of the ship’s frame, hull or

plating to absorb damage. Hardness for the different types of

materials is shown below. Hardness is based on either the

materials used in either the frame, hull or plating, whichever is

better.

*Although it is expensive, the mercenaries decide that iron*

*plating is worth the price. This will cost them 15,000 gp (50*

*tons multiplied by 300 gp). Adding the bonuses for a wood hull*

*(+5), iron plating (+6), partial enclosure (+1) and Huge*

*size (-2) gives them an AC of 20.*

*The hardness of the metal plating (10) is better than that of the*

*wood frame and hull (5), so the ship’s final hardness is 10.*

Step Ten: Add a Ram and Shears

Rams are common weapons on warships in space, and adding

one is fairly simple. To mount a ram a ship must have at least a

standard frame, since a light frame is not up to taking the shock

from ramming, making it likely to break off and take a sizable

chuck of the ship with it. Even with a standard frame a certain

amount of reinforcement needs to be done. Heavy, extra-heavy

and super-heavy ships are considered reinforced.

There are three types of rams: piercing, blunt and grappling.

The cost of piercing and blunt rams is based on the frame material

and the ship’s tonnage, as shown

on Table XX. If the frame is

standard and needs reinforced,

add 25% to the final cost.

Grappling rams allow a ship

to latch onto another ship, and

is popular with pirates and

slavers. It uses some sort of

clamping mechanism to entrap

the ship. The most common

example of a ship with a

grappling ram is the

deathspider, used by the neogi.

To find the cost of the

grappleing ram determine how

large of a ship the ram can

grapple. Then determine the

materials the grappling ram is made from; stronger materials are

harder to break free from. Use Table XX to find the cost per ton

it can grapple based on its materials.

Grappling rams require internal space to house its

operational mechanics and crew, equal to 10% of the maximum

ship size it can entrap. For example, a ship that can entrap up to

a 50 ton ship would require 5 tons for the operational mechanics

and crew. See Internal Facilities for more on this.

Many ships designed for combat mount rows of blades

along the bottom of the ship’s hull. Called rigging shears, these

blades are used to cut away rigging on enemy ships. To function

properly it takes a quantity of blades proportional to the ship’s

size; less than this and it becomes too difficult to manuever into

a shearing attack. Rigging shears cost 25 gp per ton of the ship.

This price is doubled if the ship has a stone (stone, crystal,

ætherstone) or metal (iron, flowsteel, pyre iron, mithril,

adamantine) hull, due to increased cost of mounting. This does

not include plating. If the ship has no hull the cost is based on

the frame.

Step Eleven: Choose

Internal Space Usage

A ship is not particularly useful without passengers and crew,

and those passengers and crew require space to live and work in.

So does everything else that goes inside of a ship, from space for

cargo to facilities for dining. This space is rated in tons, and a

ship has internal tonnage equal to its actual tonnage. See

Section XX for more on tonnage. Note that fractions are not

rounded in the internal space section, as fractional tons are still

useful.

A ship’s frame will take up a portion of this space. The

amount depends on its type. Standard and heavy frames take up

10% of a ship’s internal space. Light uses 5%, extra-heavy uses

20%, and super-heavy uses 30%. Beyond this, the designer must

decide to do with this free space. Space for the crew to rest, and

eat in, as well as space to prepare food, is generally considered

minimal.

Below are the descriptions of rooms and their uses. How

much space they use and the cost is shown on Table XX. It does

not include internal weapon bays, the rules for which are found

in Section XX. Note that these numbers all include the various

hallways used to access rooms, and thus the space allocated does

not necessarily translate into exact room size for most rooms.

Allocating one ton to an officer’s room does not mean the room

itself is exactly 1,350 cubic feet, as the one ton includes hallway

space. The Dungeon Master will have to determine the actual

space of a room, should it be deemed necessary, but the basic

rule of thumb is that a room is 75% of the space allocated to it.

Cargo is an exception to this; the space allocated to cargo is the

actual space available.

Keep in mind the minimum crew requirements when

assigning internal space, and remember to include space for

additional men that might be needed, such as cooks,

astrogators, helmsmen, weaponeers, marines and passengers.

Note that these rooms are just examples, and the numbers

can be tweaked with the approval of the DM. In particular, the

space devoted to any of these rooms can be increased. If the

designer is the captain and wants a 4 ton room, he can have it.

Anything not specifically allocated to a room becomes

cargo space, which costs nothing, unless the designer of the ship

expressly wants to keep the space open. Open space is just that;

there is no floor, no walls, just the support beams of the frame.

*Rooms*

*Standard Crew Quarters*

These are the standard quarters for most members of the crew.

It includes space for a bunk, personal storage and room to dress

and move about in, as well as space for a chair.

Quarters are typically grouped together in one or

more rooms. Includes: bunk, chair, storage

cabinet.

*Cramped Crew Quarters*

These are the same as Standard Crew quarters, but

with less personal space. There is enough room for

a moderate size chest for personal belongings, plus

room to dress, but little else. Includes: bunk.

*Bunk Only*

This is simply a bunk in a wall, and includes no

space for anything but sleeping. Storage is above

the person in nets or bags hung from corners.

Privacy is through a curtain, and there is no room

to stand; dressing is done in the hall or room

where the bunk is. Includes: bunk.

*Standard Room*

A standard room differs from standard quarters in

size, giving additional room for a dresser and a

small desk. Like quarters they can be grouped

together, but are just as often their own rooms.

Includes: bunk, storage cabinet, dresser, small

table, chair.

*Spacious Room*

A spacious room is like a standard room, with

more space for additional chairs and a table, or for

**Table XX: Space and Cost of Internal Facilities**

other larger furniture. It has enough room that it could be

considered a berth or dorm room. It is often used as a captains

quarters on larger ships, or as a room on passenger liners.

Includes: bunk, storage cabinet, dresser, small table, chair.

Other furniture items will have to be provided.

*Luxurious Room*

A larger version of the spacious room, it has enough space for

both additional furniture such as a couch and large stuffed chair

plus a table with several chairs around it. Includes: bunk,

storage cabinet, dresser, large table, chair. Other furniture items

will have to be provided.

*Suite*

Basically a fair sized room you would find in a house; space

enough for everything in a Luxurious room, plus space for

luxuries like more couches, stuffed chairs and self-serve bars. It

has a separate room for the sleeping chambers. Includes: bed,

storage cabinet, dresser, large table, several chairs, bar. Other

furniture items will have to be provided.

*Facilities*

*Mess Hall*

Simply space for people to eat. It is a room with tables and

chairs. Most ships only allocate enough room for half or less of

its normal crew to eat, since others will be asleep or working.

Some let men eat on deck or in their rooms, and assign no room

to dining facilities. Three times as many people can be packed

in if they are simply there to talk, and it is often used for ship

meetings. Included: benches and tables.

*Fine Dining Facilities*

The same as Standard Dining Facilities, except designed for

more spacious accommodations. Almost never used for

anything other than luxury passenger liners. Includes: tables

and chair

*Galley*

This is the cooking facilities for the ship. The amount of space

depends on how many people they expect to serve in an hour. It

has space for storage for pots, pans and utensils, plus standard

cooking ingredients (i.e. spices, barrels of water, flour, and so

on). Includes: stove(s).

*Laundry Facilities*

Most ships will not have any sort of laundry facilities, as most

spacefarers tend to do little in the way to wash their clothes, and

will generally do it themselves. On some larger ships, usually

capital ships or luxury lines, there are facilities to do laundry.

These facilities are generally not as capable as a land-based

laundry, as water is used sparingly. It includes the tubs and other

equipment used for cleaning.

*Saloon/Lounge*

This is a place for the crew or passengers to relax, and possibly

have a drink. It is generally more spacious than the mess hall,

and may have a bar in it. It is essentially the same thing as Fine

Dining Facilities, the main difference being quality of the tables

and chairs. Includes: bar, tables and chair

*Basic Engineering Room*

Enough space for a one-man shop. Includes: shelves and

workbenches. Tools are separate.

*Advanced Engineering Room*

Like the basic version, but supports a three-man shop and more

equipment. Includes: shelves and workbenches. Tools are

separate.

*Helm Room*

Ships will usually have a separate room for the helm. Size can

vary, as low as .25 tons, but 1 is the standard, as few ships have

separate chart rooms for the astrogators, and it allows the

captain, first officer and the helmsmen to hold private meetings.

The cost is essentially nothing if it is nothing but a room for the

helm. If it is used for astrogation and charts, use the cost for that

room.

*Chart/Astrogation Room*

Uncommon except on larger or exploration ships, this room is

designed to hold the charts and equipment need to astrogate.

Includes: shelves, desk, chairs. This can also be used to

represent offices or libraries.

*Storage*

*Cargo Space*

Simply open space to store goods. Includes: a variety of rings and

pinions mounted on walls, floors and beams to tie cargo off to.

Note that cargo space can be used for a variety of things

besides cargo. People can sleep in the cargo bay, food can be

eaten or courses can be astrogated. It is just that the cargo area

does not fully support such actions (i.e. no walls for privacy, no

shelves or desks for working at, and so on).

Included free of charge is a basic hatch or door to move

cargo in or out.

*Weapons Locker*

Any cargo space can be used as weapon storage, but a weapons

locker includes cabinets and racks for weapons and armour. One

ton can generally hold weapons and armour for up to 50 men,

or weapons only for up to 100 men. Includes: racks and

cabinets.

*Larder*

A larder is simply a room with a large number of shelves and

slots for barrels, to hold food and water for the kitchen.

Kitchens on smaller vessels won’t need one; generally a half-ton

of larder per 3 tons of kitchen works fine. Includes: shelves and

barrel holders.

*Docking Bays*

*Internal, Specific*

This is a docking bay that is designed for a specific type of ship.

Other ships will have a very hard time fitting it, often not fitting

at all, unless they are of a very similar design or much smaller. It

includes a door, plus space around the ship to access most of its

surfaces above its deck (or rough approximation thereof).

*Internal, General*

This is a docking bay that is designed to fit a variety of ships

within a certain size. The dimensions of the bay are used to

figure the cost, and the additional twenty percent in size is for

the docks and accesses to the ship. Thus if a bay was 100 feet

long by 50 feet wide by 50 feet tall it would be a 90 ton bay. With

the additional 20% it would take up 111.1 tons. The GM will

have to decide if a given ship can land in the docking bay based

on the ship’s dimensions and shape and the docking bay’s

dimension and shape. The cost includes a sliding door if the GM

deems it feasible, based on size.

The general internal docking bay assumes the docking ship

will use the gravity plane of the larger ship. This can cause

problems if the larger ship enters the gravity of an even larger

ship or a planet. To get around this the bay can be outfitted with

a drydock system. This is more expensive, raising the price to

200 gp per ton.

*External, Passenger*

This is a docking bay designed to allow a ship to come along side

and dock. The size of the docking ship isn’t really important, as

it won’t be actually entering the ship it docks. The passenger

external docking bay is designed primarily to allow passengers

and small parcels to be passed from one ship to another. It

includes mooring points, a basic dock extension, a sliding door

over the bay and space for a group of people to wait for boarding.

*External, Cargo*

This is the same as the Passenger docking bay, except it is

designed to allow the transfers of larger objects. The actual size

of the docking bay can vary upwards from two tons, depending

on the size of the cargo that is expected to be moved. Two tons

will work for most barrels and smaller crates, while stuff like

lumber or ore might require from four to six tons. Half of the

space can be used as temporary cargo space when no ship is

present. It otherwise comes with the same stuff as a passenger

bay.

*Example One: The Tiger Shark*

*The Tiger Shark is a ship designed to carry mercenaries, either*

*to transport them or to use them as marines. It requires only*

*limited cargo space, enough for the standard stock of food,*

*water, and extra shot for the ship weapons.*

*It has a heavy frame, which requires 10% of the its internal*

*space. At 50 tons, this would be 5 tons.*

*They set aside 10 tons for cargo, which they feel is the*

*minimum. They also plan on using 8 tons for internally*

*mounted weapons, and so set that aside, This leaves them 27*

*tons for other things.*

*They will have two helmsman, plus two war wizards, and a*

*priest, and give each a Standard room. The Captain and first*

*Officer get their own Standard room as well. At .5 ton each,*

*this is 3.5 tons.*

*A mess hall that can serve 32 men at a time takes 4 tons. The*

*cooking facilities to feed 30 men per hour takes 1.5 tons.*

*They give 1 tons to a helm room, which is also used as a*

*meeting room for senior staff. They also designate a Basic*

*Engineering Room, at 1.5 tons.*

*The remainder of the tonnage, 15.5 tons, is used for standard*

*crew quarters. Anything not used for riggers and the cook are*

*used for weaponeers and marines, allowing for 62 men. With*

*the captain, first officer, two helmsman and the three*

*spellcasters, this works out to 69 men when full manned.*

*Example Two: A Cargo Cruiser*

*This 100 ton ship is designed to carry as much cargo inside an*

*enclosed ship as possible. It depends on its size for its durability,*

*and has a light frame. The frame takes up 5 tons of space.*

*The ship has minimal rigging, and so requires 9 men. The ship*

*carries 13 riggers, plus a cook. The ship has only bunks for*

*these men, taking up .7 tons. While these bunks are hardly*

*spacious, the ship is rarely completely full, and men typically*

*find other space to lay out a bed roll, so the space isn’t a*

*problem.*

*The two helmsman share a spacious room, taking .75 ton for*

*the both of them. The captain and first officer each have their*

*own spacious room, at 1.5 tons. The ship has a 1 ton*

*helmroom.*

*The ship has enough cooking facilities to feed 10 men per hour,*

*taking .5 tons, but no dining*

*facilities; the men eat wherever*

*they can.*

*All of this takes 9.45 tons, leaving*

*90.55 tons for cargo.*

Step Twelve:

Internal

Weapon Bays

Typically, little consideration is

given to weapon design when

designing a ship, since most

weapons are mounted on the deck

of the ship, and is easily done postconstruction.

See the Ship

Modification system for

information on mounting weapons

on decks or the hull of the ship.

Ships designed for warfare

tend to carry many weapons, and

the most common way of carrying

weapons beyond what can be

mounted on the deck is through

internal weapon bays. These are

simply rooms with windows and

shutters that the weapon can fire

through. The cost for internal

weapon bays is based on the hull

material of the ship; the actual

space is free, since it is little more

than cargo space, but the

window and shutters cost gold.

The amount of space required

for the weapon is shown on Table

XXX. The cost per ton per hull

material is shown on Table XXX.

These prices do not include

the weapon itself; it is merely a

specific room for weapons. It is

possible to mount smaller weapons in rooms meant for larger

weapons, though not vice versa. It is also possible to mount

weapons of different types in space meant for other weapons, as

long as it is at least 1 ton less in space requirements.

*Having set aside space for 8 tons worth of internal weapons,*

*they decide to add rooms for two medium catapults, port and*

*starboard, a medium catapult in the aft and a medium ballista*

*in the fore. With their thick wood hulls, costing 25 gp per ton,*

*8 tons of weapons would be 400 gp.*

Step Thirteen:

Landing Capabilities

By default, a ship is only capable of docking on a gravity plane

or a special dry-dock; the capability of landing on either water

or ground requires additional construction.

Water-landing capability requires that the hull be sealed,

which can only be done for wooden or ceramic ships, unless

magic is used. The cost of this is

50 gold per ton. It also requires

approval of the Dungeon

Master, based on its shape.

Some ships are not shaped

properly and will capsize even if

the hull is sealed. Some

examples of these are the cuttle

command and the dolphin.

There are two forms of

ground-landing capability:

partial and full. The difference

is in the type of ground they can

land on. With partial groundlanding

a ship can land on any

clear, mostly flat surfaces

without trouble. Any other

kinds of surfaces can cause problems such as tipping over (as

determined by the DM). Partial landing is mostly a function of

reinforcing the hull and frame to support the weight of the ship.

The cost depends on the frame’s materials and type, as shown

on Table XX.

Full landing allows a ship to land on most fairly clear land

surfaces, including hilly or mountainous areas. Full ground

landing typically requires the addition of landing struts, like

those seen on the wasp. See Table XX for costs.

*The DM decides that it would be feasible for the craft to land*

*in water, and so the mercenaries have it sealed, which costs*

*500 gp.*

Step Fourteen:

Figure Base Repair Cost

Each ship has a base repair cost (BRC), which is used to

determined how much it costs to repair damage. To figure a

ship’s BRC, take the cost of one ton of the frame material,

modified by frame strength, and add it to the cost of one ton of

the hull material, modified by bracing, and and one ton of the

plating material, if any. Note this down. Then, take the ship’s

tonnage and divide it by the ship’s total hit points. This

represents how many tons it takes to make up one hit point.

Multiply this number by the unit cost noted earlier. This is the

base repair cost.

*The tiger shark has a heavy wooden frame (300 gp, multiplied*

*by two for the heavy frame, for a cost of 600 gp), a braced*

*wooden hull (100 gp multiplied by two for the bracing, for a*

*cost of 200 gp) and metal plating (300 gp). This totals to*

*1,100 gp. The ship is 50 tons, divided by 1,050 hit points,*

*which equals .048. Multpliying this by the cost per ton of*

*1,100 gp gives a base repair cost of 52.8 gp, rounded up to*

*53 gp.*

Step Fifteen: Other

Important Statistics

At this point the ship itself is complete. The only thing left is

figuring out a few other important statistics.

*Minimum Riggers*

The minimum number of riggers needed to run the ship is based

on its rigging. This does not include people such as the captain,

officers, support crew,

weaponeers or other

crew not necessary to

flying the ship, nor does

at include the

helmsman. Table XX

indicates the minimum

number of riggers

needed, based on ship size and rigging.

These numbers are how many riggers are needed to fly the

ship at any one moment, but almost all ships carry extra men as

back up, or for extra shifts.

*Air Supply*

Air supply is the number of man-days of air the ship carries

within its gravity. A ship can support one man for two months

with fresh air for every ton of the ship. To find out the number

of man-days this equals, multiply the ship’s tonnage by 60 (days

in two months). Every day a ship has to rely on its own air

envelope, subtract the total number of air-breathing crew from

this. If this number drops to zero, the air is considered stale. The

ship then has the same number of stale man-days of air. After

that the air turns deadly.

*The Tiger Shark is a 50 ton ship with standard rigging, and so*

*needs 9 riggers.*

*At 50 tons, the Tiger Shark can carry 3,000 man-days of air.*

*If they are carry a full crew with all their mercenaries, typically*

*69 men, they could go 43 days before their air became stale.*

Advanced Options

These are various options that can be used during ship

construction. They tend to be either options that add a layer of

complexity, or things that the DM might not want to allow in

his games.

*Composite Hulls*

It is possible for a ship to have a composite hull, where different

sections are made from different materials, such as a metal aft

and a wooden fore, rather than one material over another. This

can be used to protect specific portions of the ship, or to add a

bit more durability. To do this simply decide how much of the

ship’s tonnage each material covers, finding the appropriate cost

of each. Add these two together, plus 10%, for the final cost.

To calculate hit points for a ship with a composite hull, add

up the hit points for each section, adding the results together.

For example, a 60 ton ship with 20 tons of stone and 40 tons of

wood would have 320 hit points from the hull, 160 hit points

from the stone section (20 x 8) and 160 hit points from the

wood section (40 x 4).

A ship with a composite hull will have two Armour Classes,

one for each section, based on its size, hull material and plating.;

each section can have its own plating as well. Whenever a ship

with a composite hull is targetted with a weapon, the weapon

crew will have to decide if they are going to target individual

portions of the ship—typically targetting the weaker

materials—or if they will just target the ship as a whole. See the

rules for ship combat for further details.

*Composite Frames*

While ships with composite hulls, made up of more than one

material, are not uncommon, ships with composite frames are

more rare. There are two types of composite frames.

*Split Frames*: These are ships that have two or more

materials making up distinct sections of the ship, such as a metal

aft and a wooden fore. The drawback of such a design is that the

place where the two materials join tends to be a weak spot. Find

the hit points for each section and add them together for the

total, but subtract 10%. To find the cost for split frames simply

find the cost of each section, then add them together, plus 10%.

Each section of a split frame ship has its own hardness. See the

combat rules for details on how this affects combat.

*Shell Frames*: More common than split frames, a shell frame

is a frame of one type of material wrapped around a frame of

another material, completely or mostly enveloping it. This is

done to protect certain key areas of the ship, such as cargo

vaults or the helm room. The hit points are figured the same as

for the split frame, but it does not have the drawbacks. The cost

is figured the same, except add 20% to the total. The hardness

of the frame is based on the materials enveloping the inner

materials.

*Shell Ships*

Despite the name, this is not ship made from a giant seashell,

but rather a smaller ship than somehow fits into a larger ship, in

some sort of mooring cradle, and becomes its motive force. For

**Table XX: Required Riggers**

**Rigging Riggers**

None none

Minimal 1 per 12 tons

Standard 1 per 6 tons

Topped Out 1 per 3 tons

Terrestrial 1 per 1.5 tons

example, a small 10 ton all metal ship could be built and

outfitted with a helm. Then a 90 ton ship with a sort of socket

that the smaller ship fits in and is moored to could be built. As

long as the smaller ship was firmly attached to the larger, and

the helm could move a ship of that total size, it could propel and

maneuver the entire ship as one. Then, if the larger ship

becomes severely damaged, the smaller ship can be used as an

escape craft.

To design such a craft build both ships, but the larger ship

must designate a portion of its volume to holding the smaller

ship. How much space is up to the designer, but the less space

devoted, the more of the smaller ship’s volume will be revealed,

and the less sturdy the connection will be. The percentage of

the smaller ship’s tonnage that is devoted to the smaller ship is

used to determine the smaller ship’s level of cover in combat.

For example, a 60 ton shell ship designates 3 tons to hold a 6 ton

ship. This is 50% of the smaller ship’s tonnage, giving it half

cover.

The cost of creating shell ships is minimal: each ship must

have the mooring equipment, which costs 50 gp per ton of the

smaller ship. Mooring one ship to another takes 2d4 rounds,

though if the head of the team makes a successful Rope Use roll

against DC 20 this time is cut in half.

The larger ship does not count the mooring space in its

volume when it calculates hit points. The designer could even

allocate no tonnage, but the ship would then simply be lashed

on, which is precarious at best. It is possible to build two equal

sized ships this way, with one being the propulsion unit.

Note that the shell ship is different from the shell frame in

that it is actually considered two different ships, and do not

combine their hit points. See the combat rules for more on shell

ships in combat.

**Solid Mass**

There are times when a ship wishes to add a large amount of bulk to a ship, without actually adding any usable space, to reduce the cost. The most common reasons for this are to increase a ship’s gravity field, and thus air supply, or to achieve a certain appearance or motif. A good example of such is the octopus, whose tentacles add a fair amount of mass, but no space.

This option is rarely used in ship construction, as it is not deemed particularly useful. While it would seem that the solid mass would add a fair amount of hit points, the truth is that on most ships the parts that are not solid mass are large enough to be targeted without penalty, and most ship crews of any appreciable experience can recognize this, and simply target the normal mass of the ship. See the combat rules for more on this.

Table XX shows the cost, hit points, Armour Class and hardness for solid mass sections of a ship. So, a 10 ton section of solid wood would have 1,800 hit points. These hit points are calculated and kept separate from the rest of the ship’s hit points. Solid mass has no internal space to be used, but decks can be built upon it, so the space does count towards weapon capacity.

**Asteroid Ships**

Although some dwarven Citadels and similar ships can be created through the use of the super-heavy frame, there are times when only a small percentage of the internal “space” of an asteroid or similar body is used. For example, a 20 ton rock that has a 2 ton helm room and a 3 ton cargo room, with all other facilities being on the surface.

In cases like these, instead of bothering with the frame at all calculate all non-used space as solid mass (as per the option, above) for calculating hit points, adding the total together, unlike normal solid mass sections. Figure armour and hardness as for solid mass as well. Most such ships are also at least partially enclosed, and often fully enclosed.

These type of ships typically have no rigging, but it can be added. The cost is doubled, since adding masts and such will require extra work. Unless extensive work is done, an asteroid ship is going to be of poor design, and thus not particularly maneuverable. It might be possible to find a rock that could be classified as terrestrial, but they are going to be quite rare.

Anything beyond this will take radical redesign work. Cost for such asteroid ships will be based more on mining costs than actually ship building costs, and is likely to be more expensive, especially if nice, flat walls and squared rooms are used. This should also be taken into consideration for other aspects of ship building and modification. For example, adding internal weapon may require some additional mining work to open a hole to fire through. Another example is landing capabilities: many asteroids will be fully capable of landing on the ground without paying for it, but are unlikely to land straight, due to odd their shape.

**Weapons**

*The following information is copied from the Ship Combat System for reference during ship construction. Standard Turret*

Turrets are used to rotate a weapon into a new firing arc. It takes one man one round to rotate a light weapon into a new arc. It takes one man two rounds, or two men one round for medium and ship weapons. This can be done during reloading, but men rotating the turret cannot also assist in reloading. A standard turret costs 750 gp.

**Free Turret**

Invented by the gnomes, a free turret is a framework that a weapon is set in that allows the weapon to be pivoted into a wide range of positions, and includes counterbalances for the weight of the weapon, making it fairly easy to move even large weapons. When mounted in a free turret the weapon is considered to be on a ship two sizes smaller when determining attack penalties due to ship size. They also have the benefits of a normal turret, without the drawbacks of requiring extra men or time to reposition; a free-turreted weapon can be postioned to any available firing arc as a free action.

The downsides of a pivot turret are price and fragility. Free turrets add 5,000 gp to the cost of a weapon, and must be built into the weapon; you cannot add a free turret to a weapon later. Second, if the weapon takes half or more damage it is nonfunctional; the counterweight system is quite fragile and easy to

throw off.

Free turrets will only work with ballsita, stonethrowers, bombards and accelerators.

**Stonethrowers**

These are a cross between a ballista and a catapult. They use the

same firing mechanism as a ballista, but have a cup for holding

a stone, like a catapult. Because of the weight of the stone they

are not as fast and as accurate as a ballista, but do more damage.
