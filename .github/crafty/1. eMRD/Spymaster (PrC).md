# Spymaster (PrC)
## Overview
Some adventurers glory in their reputations—the

wider their exploits are known, the happier they are.

By contrast, the spymaster prefers to avoid attention.

She does her work quietly and in private, keeping well

away from public scrutiny. To allay suspicions, she often

maintains a cover identity by pretending to be a member

of some other class—typically the one in which she

began her career.

Spymasters are rarely popular, but so long as nation

distrusts nation there will be work for those who can

gather information that others wish to keep hidden.

Many a ruler who publicly claims to abhor spymasters

secretly employs a stable of them, if only to protect his

own secrets from the spymasters of other nations. This

set of circumstances, plus the secrecy inherent in the

profession of spymaster and its high mortality rate, makes

it impossible to determine how many spymasters are

active in a setting at any given time.

Rogues make excellent spymasters because of their

generous skill allotments and their propensity for sneakiness.

Likewise, rangers have an edge when operating

as spymasters in outdoor surroundings. However, a

character of any class can become a spymaster—the more

unlikely the combination may seem, the better the cover

it provides. Some wizards and sorcerers use their spell

ability as a cover for subterfuge, and some barbarians are

far more subtle than they seem. Spymasters can be of any

alignment. They range from self-serving information

brokers who sell their services to the highest bidder to

high-minded moles who penetrate and destroy corrupt

organizations.

It’s important for a spymaster to keep her personal

emotions distinct from her professional attachments.

She must be ready to liquidate someone she has come

to like without a moment’s thought if so ordered.

Betrayal is her business, and her loyalty is always to

her mission, not to the people she encounters while

carrying it out.

Occasionally, a spymaster may fi nd it expedient to

infi ltrate an adventuring party heading for the area where

her real mission lies. In such a case, she behaves in all

ways as a loyal party member until her goals and those

of her companions diverge.

Adaptation: Nearly undetectable and constantly

covering their tracks, spymasters are easily included in

a campaign as single NPCs or villains. Spymasters work

best on their own or with a small group of adventuring

companions of other classes, so incorporating them

into a campaign doesn’t usually involve creating spymaster-

specifi c organizations. Rather, spymasters serve

as the eyes and ears of many organizations. Several of

the organizations described in Chapter 6 of this book

might make use of one or more high-level spymasters

to train other members, keep tabs on rival organizations,

and undertake special missions not suitable for

the talents of their regular members. Every kingdom

has or wants as many spymasters in its employ as

possible, and many who have the talent for such work

fi nd themselves carefully watched and encouraged by

agents of the crown.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of

the spymaster prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Spymasters are

profi cient with all simple and martial weapons and with

light and medium armor.

Cover Identity (Ex): A spymaster has one specifi c cover

identity (such as “Murek, the tailor from Sumberton”).

While operating in that identity, she gains a +4 circumstance

bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance

bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks.

A spymaster can add an additional cover identity to her

repertoire at 4th level and another at 7th level.

Should a spymaster wish to “retire” a cover identity and

develop a new one, she must spend one week rigorously

practicing subtle vocal intonations and body language

before she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not

in themselves provide the spymaster with additional

skills, profi ciencies, or class features that others might

expect of the professions pretended. Thus, a spymaster

must be careful to choose identities that can withstand

ordinary scrutiny.

Undetectable Alignment (Ex): The web of different

identities and agendas inside a spymaster’s mind makes

it impossible for others to detect her alignment by means

of any form of divination. This ability functions like

an *undetectable alignment* spell, except that it is always

active.

Quick Change (Ex): By 2nd level, a spymaster has

become adept at quickly switching from one identity to

another. She now can don a disguise in one-tenth the

normal time (1d3 minutes) and don or remove armor in

one-half the normal time.

Scrying Defense (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a spymaster

adds her class level to Will saves against divination

(scrying) spells, as well as to Spot checks made to notice

the sensors created by such spells.

Magic Aura (Sp): At 3rd level, a spymaster gains the

ability to use *Nystul’s magic aura* at will with a caster

level equal to her class level. Most spymasters use this

ability to shield their own magic items from detection.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a spymaster

deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking

an opponent or any time the target would be denied its

Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged

attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases

to 2d6 points at 6th level. See the rogue class feature,

page 50 of the *Player’s Handbook*. If a spymaster gets a

sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels

of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.

Slippery Mind (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a spymaster

has a second chance to wriggle free from any enchantment

spells and effects. See the rogue class feature, page

51 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Dispel Scrying (Su): At 5th level and higher, a spymaster

can dispel a scrying sensor as if casting a targeted

*greater dispel magic*. Her caster level is equal to her class

level + 10. She can use this ability a number of times per

day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier.

Deep Cover (Ex): At 7th level, a spymaster becomes

able to quiet her mind and completely immerse herself in

her cover identity. While she operates under deep cover,

divination spells detect only information appropriate to

her cover identity; they reveal nothing relating to her

spymaster persona.

Hand +16, Spot +4 (+7 to notice scrying sensors), Tumble

+14; Improved Initiative, Skill Focus (Bluff), Weapon

Finesse.

*Languages:* Common, Elven.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Gilifar deals an extra 4d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. She

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Cover Identity (Ex): Gilifar has adopted a cover

identity of Falimet, a pitiful beggar who asks for coins

near the city gate.

Evasion (Ex): If Gilifar is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic

sleep effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is

considered an elf.

Magic Aura (Sp): Gilifar can use *Nystul’s magic aura* at

will.

Quick Change (Ex): Gilifar can don a disguise in 1d3

minutes and don or remove armor in one-half the normal

time.

Scrying Defense (Ex): Gilifar gains a +3 bonus on

Will saves against divination (scrying) spells and a +3

bonus on Spot checks made to notice the sensors created

by such spells.

Trapfinding (Ex): Gilifar can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Gilifar retains her Dexterity

bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

Undetectable Alignment (Ex): Gilifar’s alignment

is concealed as by an always active *undetectable alignment*

spell.

*Possessions: +2 leather armor, ring of protection +1, +1 rapier,*

*cloak of resistance +1.*
