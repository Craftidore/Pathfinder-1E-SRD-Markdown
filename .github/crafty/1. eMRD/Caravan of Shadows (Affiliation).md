Symbol: Once affi liated, you receive a tattoo of a game

token on the back of your left hand in a solemn ceremony.

When other members see the tattoo, they’re more likely to

talk to you and believe what you say.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: On the surface, the

Caravan of Shadows is a prosperous halfl ing clan. But as with

many halfl ing affairs, there’s more going on beneath the

surface. Halfl ing characters with a connection to the Caravan

of Shadows are part of a network of thieves, spies, and con

artists that stretches across a wide swath of civilization.

The Caravan of Shadows travels from city to city in a long

wagon train, staying at each major settlement for a few days.

The caravan’s bards, acrobats, and other entertainers hold a

series of performances, and the clan’s merchants buy and

sell spices and other valuable but easily portable goods. Less

savory members of the caravan pick the pockets of the larger

folk, commit burglaries on a nightly basis, or fl eece the naïve

in games of chance or shady business deals.

Type: Business (racial).

Scale: 7 (city and outliers).

Affi liation Score Criteria: Only halfl ings are eligible

to join the caravan. Nonhalflings are sometimes allowed

to travel with them—especially on dangerous roads—but

fellow travelers don’t get a glimpse of the inner workings of

the caravan.
