# Wind Platform
## Overview
**Price:** 5,000 gp

**Weight:** 1,600 lbs.

This light, airborne device is held aloft by a huge buoyant balloon which is attached by chains to an open-air wicker basket.

A wind platform is so-called because it remains at the mercy of the winds, as it has no propulsion system of its own and can therefor not be used as much more than an airborne watchtower or platform for the deployment of siege engines.

The basket of a wind platform can hold as many as six Medium creatures and two Large direct-fire siege engines, or any combination of smaller creatures and siege engines occupying the same space. The platform cannot withstand a carried weight of more than 3,000 lbs.

A wind platform has AC4, hardness 5, and 250 hp, and takes double damage from acid and fire attacks. When reduced to half its total hit points (125 hp) the platform begins to descend at a rate of 20 ft. per round. When reduced to one-quarter its total hit points (62hp), the rate of descent increases to 60 ft. per round. When destroyed, all creatures and items on the wind platform simply fall as normal.
