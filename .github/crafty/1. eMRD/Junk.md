# Junk
## Overview
**Junk:** Having square sails set on masts that are often stepped off the centerline of the ship, a high stern, and a flat bottom, junks are slow, sturdy craft employed as cargo vessels and warships by most nations.

**Description**

This flat-bottomed sailing ship has two or three masts with junk-rigged sails, allowing it to be easily sailed by a small crew. Junks typically have a high poop deck and a flat bottom with no keel, and so rely on daggerboards, leeboards, or large rudders for stability. A junkâ€™s hull is divided into several watertight compartments, like a stalk of bamboo, which strengthen the hull and slow flooding. Junks are capable of ocean travel, and have a waterborne speed of 2 miles per hour or 48 miles per day.

**Weapons:** Up to 12 Large direct-fire or indirect-fire siege engines in banks of six positioned on the port and starboard sides of the ship, or up to four Huge direct-fire siege engines in banks of two on the port and starboard sides of the ship. These siege engines may only fire out the sides of the ship that they are positioned on and cannot fire toward the forward or aft sides of the ship.

In addition, up to two Large direct-fire or indirect-fire siege engines may be positioned one each on the forward and aft sides of the ship (one Huge direct-fire or indirect-fire siege engine may be positioned on the aft side of the ship instead, but the forward side can only fit a Large siege weapon). These siege engines can be swiveled to fire out either side of the ship, or either forward or aft, depending on their position.

### Junk

**1. Main Deck**

This area stands open on the front half of the ship. Here can be found the capstan for raising and lowering the anchor, along with the hatch to the cargo hold (Area 7), the door to this deck's private cabins (Area 2) and stairs leading below as well as to the quarterdeck (Area 4).

**2. Private Cabins**

Passageways from the main deck and quarterdeck provide access to these quarters. They are used for important personages such as crew officers and special passengers. Lightwells provide illumination in the passageways.

**3. Special Cabin**

A really important crew member or passenger might be quartered here, a private room with more space and more light than the other cabins.

**4. Quarterdeck**

This area is raised above the main deck (Area 1), and has steps leading down to it as well as up to the poop deck (Area 6). Note that both of those terms, quarterdeck and poop deck, are Western labels being applied to this ship.

**5. Captain's Cabin**

The other stately cabin aboard the junk, located just aft of the quarterdeck (Area 4) and more private cabins (Area 2), is here.

**6. Poop Deck**

With the highest elevation at the stern of the vessel, it is here that the helmsman steers the ship via the rudder.

**7. Lower Deck**

This is the ship's cargo hold, accessible via stairwells and the main hatch. It is not only used for storage, however, and can easily be fitted with bulkheads to provide more cabins for passengers or crew.

### Junk

Few sights capture the exotic feel of the East, from a Western point of view, better than the ships known as junks. Their distinct type of sails make them stand out from other sailing vessels, while their unusual crews and cargoes hint at the exotic lands from which they hail. The term junk is something of a catch-all, and can refer to many different configurations of vessels. Some people adapt them to serve as houseboats, and in Canton they are even used as floating brothels known as "flower boats."

Junks first came into use during the Han Dynasty (ca. 206 BCE - 220 CE) and were probably first used for voyages at sea during the latter part of that period. Their most notable shared features are sails reinforced by battens, which give them their strength and distinctive shape. They also lack the bowsprit that is common on ships of Western design. Note that the stats and deck plan presented below reflect a moderately sized craft; both smaller and larger variations are certainly possible. Indeed, rivers and ports in China and the surrounding countries are often filled with one- or two-masted vessels, while the fleet of the noted explorer Zheng He included massive seven-masted ships.
