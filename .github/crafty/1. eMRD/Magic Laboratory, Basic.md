# Magic Laboratory, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 500 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This simple wood- or stone-floored laboratory contains a small mystical library, a writing desk, and a lab table for various magical experiments. The crude furnishings are made of rough wood. A basin sits in one corner, next to an open barrel of water. A fireplace squats against another wall, ready to provide heat as well as any fire that may be necessary.

Any character using of this laboratory can add a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks made to determine whether a new spell is viable.
