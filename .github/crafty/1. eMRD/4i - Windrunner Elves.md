# 4i - Windrunner Elves
## Overview
**Windrunner Elves**

Unusual among the nomadic peoples, the windrunner or dry grass elves (kiliikhigormes in Steppes Elvish) are plainsdwelling nomads thought to hail from the elven capital of Sephaya, which they abandoned during the Great Retreat. Some suspect they were the hunters and herdsmen of that city. The elven nobles of Sephaya all retreated to the Arbonesse along the fey roads, and the windrunners are what is left. Others claim they came from the mountains of Beldestan or points further East.

The windrunners have little or nothing to do with the remnants of the Elven Empire, and they pay no allegiance to the Imperatrix of the Grand Duchy or the River Lords of the Arbonesse.

## The Eight Great Clans
**The Eight Great Clans**

The windrunner elves wander the plains with large herds of cattle and packs of highly trained dogs, and are divided into eight great tribal groups: the Antelope, Dragon, Eagle, Grass, Kite, Spirit, Thunder, and Wind clans. Each has many bloodlines and lineages within it, and each great clan is answerable to a single chieftain.

**Antelope Clan:** Unusual in their ability to keep herds of saiga antelope together in a useful grouping, the Antelope clan is devoted to the animalrevering side of Porevit, whom they call Inara, goddess of wild animals. Many among this clan are believed to be werewolves or at least druids and shapeshifters. Their dogs are among the swiftest and best-trained, and even some blink dog clans wander with the Antelope families.

**Dragon Clan:** The Dragon clan keeps tor drakes and arachnidrakes rather than dogs as companion animals, and it is said to be on good terms with wind dragons. They fly few kites, instead asking their drakes to scout on high for them. The Dragon clan is on excellent terms with the Mharoti Empire, and other clans suspect their motives and allegiances are drifting into dangerous territory.

**Eagle Clan:** Proud and high-flying warriors, the Eagle clan stays close to the Cloudwall Mountains in winter and the nesting season, and wanders the length and breadth of the plains at other time. They build no kites, preferring to send their smallest and youngest warriors aloft on eagle-back, since they are smaller and thinner than other windrunner elves. Their herds of sheep and goats are nimble enough to overwinter in sheltered mountain valleys.

**Grass Clan:** The Grass clan has the largest and fattest herds of aurochs and cattle on the plains, with groups numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands. These animals consume their attention and are their pride. They fly no kites but pay others to carry written prayers to the heavens for the attention of Ellel, Teshub, or other gods and spirits. Some Grass clan groups are on good terms with taiga giants and centaurs.

**Kite Clan:** Known for the enormous wood and silken kites they fly, the Kite clan is thought to be especially spiritual and in tune with the gods of the sky, such as Ellel (Wotan), the protector of oaths. They can see for long miles from their aerial perches, which are virtually invisible from the ground. Some believe they hold the secret to a floating sky-city somewhere above the plains.

**Spirit Clan:** The Spirit clan is known for keeping some of their ancestors for a year or more after their death, during which time their spirits are said to dispense wisdom to the next generation. The Spirit clan has priests of every god of the plains, and flies kites as elaborate as those of the Kite clan.

**Thunder Clan:** Warriors and cattle raiders, the Thunder clan has little patience with the slow or the weak. Ruled by its women, it is among the greedier and more violent clans of steppe elves. Its young men are required to steal cattle, horses, or antelopes from another clan or from humans. They follow Teshub, the god of sky, weather, and storms, and their kite-flying is focused on climbing the Sky Stairs of Beldestan to the heavens.

**Wind Clan:** Least known of the windrunner clans, the Wind clan disdains all contact with non-elves, and even elfmarked are not treated with particular courtesy. They fly kites faster and higher than any other clan, though theirs are more often war-kites than the prayer kites of the Spirit clan or Kite clan.

## Flying a Windrunner Kite
**Flying a Windrunner Kite**

The elven kites are simple constructions of linen or silk sail and keel panels, held together with braided horsehair or spidersilk ropes and frames of the lightest horn and stiffened hides. Many are blessed by priests of Ellel (Wotan), the sky god, and some are heirlooms, their designs unique to a particular clan.

They are painted gray or blue, to make them difficult to see among the clouds, and all of them are flown the same way: hauled up into the sky on their static line with the aid of one or several elves or cattle, able to shift the line into tension or slack as needed, they are then pegged in place and used as aerial observation posts for hours, until the rider’s stamina wears out or until inclement weather forces a descent. They can either be hauled down (safer but slow) or the flyer can release a latch and sail the kite to the ground in a controlled descent (much more dangerous, but also more mobile).

Flying a windrunner kite requires the Flying skill checks as shown in Table 4-1: Kite Flying. The kites themselves are not sold to outsiders, but within a clan can be made and sold for roughly 1,500 gp for a fully working set of lines, frame, sails, harness, and release mechanism.

**Table 4-1: Kite Flying**


-tx-
| **Action Attempted** | **Flying check DC** |
|---|---|
| Ascent | Automatic |
| Ascent in Low Wind | 10 |
| Holding Position Aloft <sup>1</sup> | 15 |
| Controlled Descent, No Line <sup>2</sup> | 30 |
| <sup>1</sup> Check required 1/hour or when weather conditions change (a front moves in, rain starts). Failure to hold position means that the kite shifts to face another direction, loses altitude, or otherwise requires correction. The flyer gains a second check to correct the problem. ||
| <sup>2</sup> Failure in a controlled descent counts as a fall of 10 ft. per every 1 point less than the required DC. Thus, a Flying check of 22 would mean a fall of 80 ft., and equivalent damage. ||

**Rothenian Weapons**

Archers on the plains use blunt, smoke, slow burning, or other special arrows, as well as nets and other tools to capture prisoners, slaves, or chieftains, or to surprise a foe.

**Arrow, Reeking:** An arrow enchanted with a *stinking cloud* spell that is released on impact (Fortitude DC 11).

**Arrows, Siege:** These arrows soften earth and warp wood when they strike structures (as *warp wood,* CL 6th). If enough strike a berm, wall or barricade, they can make it collapse.

**Arrow, Signal:** Their light is used at night to signal a raid or location.

**Arrow, Sleep:** When this arrow hits an opponent, it causes any non-fey creature 4 HD or less to sleep (Will DC 11).

**Bolas, Windrunner:** These weighted loops of rope can do 1d4 lethal or non-lethal damage and can be used to make a ranged trip attack. If the attack succeeds, the victim is considered pinned, per the PF grapple rules.

**Centaur Nets:** Large nets with rope loops used as handles, these plains nets can be held between two centaurs. If the centaurs charge on either side of an opponent with the net between them (one readies an action triggered by the second one), one may make a touch attack against the opponent with a +4 bonus (+2 for flanking, +2 for equipment bonus).

If the attack succeeds, the victim is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If the attackers control the net by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature is knocked prone and can move only within the net. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell’s level or be unable to cast the spell.

When either net wielder takes a movement action with a full net, the caught creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage each round it is dragged and drops held items. The centaurs may make this attack against three Medium-size or smaller opponents in a row, then the net is full.

**Longbow, Taurian:** These 7- or 8-foot long, recurved bows are meant for use by centaurs; no one else can make them, and finding one anywhere but in centaur hands is cause for a fight. They are made of layered woods, sinew, and horn and have a draw of at least 200 pounds. For this reason, their 4 foot-long arrows have exceptional range and penetrating power, able to punch through even the thickest armor. You must be over 6 ft. tall and at Strength 16 or higher to wield a taurian longbow.

**Poniard Sword:** This standard looking longsword or rapier has a spring-loaded poniard concealed in the hilt, which quickly extends out when the hilt is gripped in a particular way. When the poniard is revealed in a combat round, it can be used for a rogue’s sneak attack in that same round. The sword can be used as a one-handed double weapon once extended, with all the usual restrictions and penalties. The poniard can be used against a grappling opponent. Kariv of a crueler bent have been known to poison the secondary blade.

**Sundering Whip:** Some cunning Kariv affix diamond powder along the length of their heavy bullwhips. This creates a lethal weapon that affects armored opponents and can sunder opponents’ weapons.

**Taurian Strength Bows**

These masterwork compound recurved longbows are between five and a half and six and a half feet tall when strung. They are the specialty weapon of centaur and minotaur archers, made with a combination of bone, yew, horn and sinew. The arrows themselves can be over three feet long and weigh a pound each. One must be at least six feet tall and have a Strength 12 or higher to wield these exotic weapons. These heirloom weapons are handed down from one generation of warriors to the next, and the most famous have name names, histories and magical powers acquired over many years.

**Benefit:** Each bow has a minimum Strength rating (12, 14, 16, 18 and so forth), or “pull,” and adds the damage modifier associated with its Strength rating to all damage rolls, unlike normal bows. For example, a Rothenian centaur archer with a Strength score of 21 using an 18 Pull longbow would do +4 damage. If the bow had a 20 Pull rating, he would do +5 damage. If the archer only had a 16 Strength he could not use the bow at all. Nonweapon proficiency penalties with this exotic weapon apply normally.

**Special:** Unlike normal masterwork enhancement bonuses, these damage modifiers can stack with magical bonuses and be multiplied by critical or feat effects.

## Food, Poison, and Other Gear
**Food, Poison, and Other Gear**

**Blood Sickness:** Though most think of centaur blood sickness as a disease, it is a special poison made with centaur blood and infusions of harmful spirits. Its ability to reduce movement of a target makes it especially valuable for capturing prey or prisoners.

**Dragon Blood:** This poison is common among the Kariv, who infuse it with foul earth and the blood of stillborn foals. Their own curse gives it extra potency; none but the Kariv have ever brewed it.

**Fire Powders:** The Kariv have been known to use special black and yellow powders to create smoke and spark effects. The black powder creates a large puff of smoke when lit or thrown in a fire, similar in effect to the puff of smoke cantrip. The yellow powder creates a large shower of sparks when lit or thrown in a fire, similar in effect to the daze cantrip. They are typically used for dramatic effect during dances or rituals, or for daring escapes.

**Hag-Bane Wreaths:** These wreaths or bags are filled with herbs and spices. They confuse the scent ability of wolves, hags, bugbears, and other predators (gnomes with trained wolves?) looking for prey (particularly bedroom windows where sleeping babies and children might be snatched).

Special: The wreaths prevent predators from using the Scent ability in a 30 ft. radius.

Construction: 5 sp Craft Alchemy or Profession Herbalist DC 15.

**Kariv Climbing Cymbals:** Common in Kariv dances are their little finger cymbals, used for rapid percussive accompaniment. When smeared with the gummy sap of the guar tree, however, they become sticky suction cups useful for climbing walls and other smooth surfaces (+2 equipment bonus to all Climb rolls for 10 minutes until the gum dries).

**Kariv Sashes:** The Kariv are known for their colorful scarves and sashes, but many non-Kariv do not realize they serve utilitarian purposes as well. They can conceal small messages and scrolls, as well as small, flat knives and lock-pick sets. They can also be knotted to make small ropes for climbing or tying up portals or prisoners. Sashes and scarves have coins sewn or knotted on them, which look and sound impressive when twirling and shimmying during Kariv dances, but they also serve a second purpose: when rolled up, they make a effective sap for silencing guards and quieting kidnap victims.

**Puzzle Boxes:** Many Kariv clans, especially the Lovari, are well known for horseshoeing and metalwork, but others are known for their woodworking, and in particular for intricate puzzle boxes and boxes with concealed compartments. A Perception roll is required to find a secret panel, and a Disable Device roll is required to unlock a puzzle box or locked secret panel. (DCs typically range from 15 to 30, depending on the cost and intricacy of the puzzle box). These boxes are popular with minotaur customers, especially the sliding maze puzzle boxes.

**Ridegrass:** Centaurs dose themselves with painkilling, hypnotic ridegrass before long journeys when a courier must travel without pauses for food or sleep. Ridegrass has no effect whatever on two-legged creatures, though horses, mules, oxen, griffons, hippogriffs, and pegasi can all benefit from it, gaining a +4 bonus to Endurance checks for a day after consuming it and being able to hustle without ill effect for 4 hours.

**Sbiten:** Also called the “wine of the raven,” this potent drink has medicinal value. Drinking a single cup of sbiten provides the drinker with a +1 equipment bonus on his Fortitude checks against cold and exposure, and subtracts 1d4 points nonlethal damage provoked by such conditions for one hour.

**Steppe Pears:** These rare flowering plants are rare, and have only a passing similarity to true pears. They don’t taste good, but they are nourishing and contain water. (Two are equivalent to a day’s rations.)
