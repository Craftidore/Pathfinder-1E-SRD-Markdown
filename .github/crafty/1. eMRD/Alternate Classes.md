# Alternate Classes
## Overview
These are standalone classes whose basic ideas are very close to established [[Base Classes|base classes]], yet whose required alterations would be too expansive for an archetype. In this case, that’s the [[Samurai|samurai]] and the [[Ninja|ninja]]—specifically Asian-themed classes that have long and unique histories, as well as great cultural cachet, but which are similar in concept to the established cavalier and [[Rogue|rogue]], respectively. An alternate class operates exactly as a base class, save that a character who takes a level in an alternate class can never take a level in its associated class—a [[Samurai|samurai]] cannot also be a cavalier, and vice versa. The antipaladin from *Advanced Player’s Guide* is also an alternate class.
