There are hundreds of spells available to spellcasters in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game—this chapter begins with the spell lists for all of the game’s spellcasting classes. An **<sup>M</sup>** or **<sup>F</sup>** appearing at the end of a spell’s name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**Order of Presentation**: In the spell lists and the short descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell’s name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice**: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, still have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level**: A spell’s power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster’s class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters**: The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the short descriptions.
