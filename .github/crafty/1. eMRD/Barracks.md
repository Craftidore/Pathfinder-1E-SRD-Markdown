# Barracks
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 400 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This open room contains up to ten simple wooden beds with straw mattresses. A small footlocker sits at the end of each bed for personal belongings. This component includes a privy, though it need not be attached or adjacent to the barracks itself.

A barracks can hold ten people (usually guards or soldiers). If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times. (Each of the sample barracks depicted is actually a double-size barracks representing two components.)

If you want a higher class of quarters for officers, purchase bedroom components instead.
