# Torpid (Trait)
## Overview
**Torpid**

You are sluggish and slow to react to danger, but also resistant to others' commands.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on saves against enchantment (compulsion) effects.

**Drawback:** You take a -2 penalty on initiative checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Torpid characters may be seen as lazy, or as methodical and measured in their actions.
