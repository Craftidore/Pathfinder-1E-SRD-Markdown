# Elemental Rage (Su)
## Overview
*Elemental Rage (Su)*: While raging, all of the barbarianâ€™s melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the [[Elemental Rage, Lesser (Su)|lesser elemental]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her [[Elemental Rage, Lesser (Su)|lesser elemental]] rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.
