# Critical Feats
## Overview
**Critical Feats**

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim of the critical hit. Characters without the [[Critical Mastery (Feat)|Critical Mastery]] feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after the critical hit has been confirmed.
