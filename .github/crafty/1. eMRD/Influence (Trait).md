# Influence (Trait)
## Overview
**Influence**: Your position in society grants you special insight into others, and special consideration or outright awe from others. Choose one of the following skills: [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]]. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.
