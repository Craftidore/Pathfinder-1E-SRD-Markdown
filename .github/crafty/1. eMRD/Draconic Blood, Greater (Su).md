# Draconic Blood, Greater (Su)
## Overview
*Draconic Blood, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains a breath weapon that she can use once per day. For every 2 barbarian levels, this breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of the energy type she chose for the draconic blood power, either in a 30-foot cone (if cold or fire) or a 60-foot line (if acid or electricity). Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarianâ€™s level + her Constitution modifier.
