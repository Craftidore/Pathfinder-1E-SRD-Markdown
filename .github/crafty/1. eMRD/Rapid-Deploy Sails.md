# Rapid-Deploy Sails
## Overview
**Rapid-Deploy Sails**

The shipâ€™s rigging undergoes a wholesale change as improvements in engineering enable the sails to be raised and lowered much faster than normal.

**Benefit:** Any sail adjustments can be made in half the normal time, granting a +1 bonus on all sailing checks.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (sails) or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) DC 25; Cost: 10% of base ship cost
