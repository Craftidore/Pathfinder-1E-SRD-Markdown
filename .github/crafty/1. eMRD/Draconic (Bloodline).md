# Draconic (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Draconic**

At some point in your family’s history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline, and now its ancient power flows through your veins.

**Class Skill**: [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]].

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* (3rd), *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]* (5th), *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* (7th), *[[Fear (Spell)|fear]]* (9th), *[[Spell Resistance (Arm_ShldSpcAb)|spell resistance]]* (11th), *[[Form of the Dragon I (Spell)|form of the dragon I]]* (13th), *[[Form of the Dragon II (Spell)|form of the dragon II]]* (15th), *[[Form of the Dragon III (Spell)|form of the dragon III]]* (17th), *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* (19th).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline’s energy type, that spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.

**Bloodline Powers**: The power of dragons flows through you and manifests in a number of ways. At 1st level, you must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). This choice cannot be changed. A number of your abilities grant resistances and deal damage based on your dragon type, as noted on the following table.


| **Dragon Type** | **Energy Type** | **Breath Shape** |
|---|---|---|
| Black | Acid | 60-foot line |
| Blue | Electricity | 60-foot line |
| Green | Acid | 30-foot cone |
| Red | Fire | 30-foot cone |
| White | Cold | 30-foot cone |
| Brass | Fire | 60-foot line |
| Bronze | Electricity | 60-foot line |
| Copper | Acid | 60-foot line |
| Gold | Fire | 30-foot cone |
| Silver | Cold | 30-foot cone |

*Claws (Ex)*: Starting at 1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier (1d3 if you are Small). At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming DR. At 7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small). At 11th level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of your energy type on a successful hit. This is a supernatural ability. You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Dragon Resistances (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist 5 against your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus. At 9th level, your energy resistance increases to 10 and natural armor bonus increases to +2. At 15th level, your natural armor bonus increases to +4.

*Breath Weapon (Su)*: At 9th level, you gain a breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of your energy type per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area of the breath receive a Ref lex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. The shape of the breath weapon depends on your dragon type (as indicated on the above chart). At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day.

*Wings (Su)*: At 15th level, leathery dragon wings grow from your back as a standard action, giving you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. You can dismiss the wings as a free action.

*Power of Wyrms (Su)*: At 20th level, your draconic heritage becomes manifest. You gain immunity to paralysis, sleep, and damage of your energy type. You also gain blindsense 60 feet.
