# Major Healing (Hex)
## Overview
*Major Healing (Su)*: By calling upon eerie powers, the witch’s touch can mend even the most terrible wounds of those she touches. This acts as *[[Cure Serious Wounds (Spell)|cure serious wounds]]*, using the witch’s caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the major healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts like *[[Cure Critical Wounds (Spell)|cure critical wounds]]*.
