# Apostle of Peace (PrC)
## Overview
In a world where conflict usually means violence, where good

and evil meet regularly on the field of battle, where might too

often makes right and power is measured in gold peaces, the

apostle of peace is a lone voice crying in the wilderness, calling

for a change of heart. Having completely forsworn violence in

any form, the apostle of peace is an advocate for nonviolent resolution

of conflict. He is a powerful font of divine magic, but his

spells are all aimed toward healing, calming hostility, and aiding

his allies.

Members of all classes can qualify to become apostles of

peace, though barbarians, fighters, and rogues have difficulty

meeting the skill prerequisites and are usually too oriented

toward martial exploits to be interested. Clerics, bards, and

druids often develop pacifistic philosophies and gravitate

toward this class, but any character can experience a conversion

of sorts and become an apostle of peace.

Apostles of peace are usually solitary wanderers or even hermits.

Many nonplayer character (NPC) apostles are far removed

from the violent struggles of the adventuring life, but may serve

as resources of knowledge, spells, or spiritual guidance for

adventuring PCs. Apostle of peace PCs are unusual but not

impossible; see Waging Peace in Chapter 2 for advice about

using such characters in the game.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the apostle of peace

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Apostles of peace gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the

use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect

them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of

peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of

peace spells or use any of his supernatural

class abilities while doing so and for 24

hours thereafter.

Spells: An apostle of peace has the ability to

cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle

of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom

score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so an apostle

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast

these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are

based on Wisdom, and saving

throws against these spells have a

DC of 10 + spell level + the

apostle of peace’s Wisdom

modifier. When the apostle of

peace gets 0 spells per day of a

given spell level (for instance,

2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level

apostle), he gains

only the bonus

spells he would

be entitled to

based on his

Wisdom score for

that spell level. The

apostle of peace’s spell list appears below. An

apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a

cleric does.

To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace,

add the character’s apostle levels to one-half of his caster

levels in other spellcasting classes.

Spontaneous Casting: An apostle of

peace can channel stored spell energy

into healing spells that the apostle did

not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can

“lose” any prepared apostle spell in

order to cast any cure spell of the

same spell level or lower (a cure spell

is any spell with “cure” in its name).

Turn Undead (Su): An apostle of peace can turn

undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level

would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels

to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.

Pacifying Touch (Su): At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains

the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The

effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect

only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch

the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and

spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not

suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The

apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic,

using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain

mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch

can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target,

such as fear or rage.

Censure Fiends (Su): A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure

fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy

power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils,

and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a

Charisma check for the apostle and consult

Table 8–9 in the Player’s Handbook,

using the apostle’s character

level to determine the most

powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6

+ the apostle of peace’s level + his Charisma

modifier for censuring damage. Using both

the apostle’s character level and his class level

in this manner means that he is more likely to

affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to

censure more than one of them.

A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle’s

holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle

of peace attacks a censured fiend, the

stunning ends immediately and the fiend

can act normally on its next turn.

If the apostle of peace’s character level is

at least twice the fiend’s Hit Dice, he banishes

the affected fiend back to its home

plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of

censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his

Charisma modifier.

These attempts

are separate from any attempts to

turn undead.
