# Holt Warden (PrC)
## Overview
*“It never ceases to amaze me how wise trees can become simply by*

*standing still for years at a time. No matter how long I study and*

*ponder and fi ght, I will never be their equal.”*

—Hasayla, holt warden

Holt wardens are the highest spiritual leaders in

the Guardians of the Green (see page 68).

They provide the religious inspiration for

the organization’s ongoing struggles, and the

Guardians of the Green choose their leaders

from this august circle.

BECOMING A HOLT WARDEN

Among the standard classes, those most

likely to pursue the path of holt warden

are druids and clerics of Ehlonna

or Obad-Hai. Druids appreciate a holt

warden’s spiritual connection with the

earth—particularly with plants and trees—

while clerics pursue this path to fi nd

a more intimate communion with

nature and its mysteries.

**Entry Requirements**

**Alignment:** Any

neutral.

**Skills:** Knowledge

(nature) 8 ranks,

Survival 4 ranks.

**Spellcasting:** Able to

cast 3rd-level divine

spells, including the

three lowest-level spells of

the Plant domain.

**Special:** Must be chosen as a holt

warden by the leaders of a band of

Guardians of the Green, then serve a

one-year apprenticeship to a Guardian of

the Green who has at least five holt warden levels.

**Hit Die: d6**

**Class Skills (4 + Int modifier per level):** Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, Hide, Knowledge (nature),

Knowledge (religion), Listen, Move Silently, Spellcraft, Spot, Survival.

CLASS FEATURES

As a holt warden, you draw on the inherent spiritual power

of nature and make that power accessible to the larger

spiritual community. Above all else, you are a spiritual

seeker and guide.

Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per

day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you

had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming

a holt warden, you must decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster

level, and spells known.

Nature Sense (Ex): You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge

(nature) and Survival checks. If you already have nature sense,

the bonuses double.

Plant Affi nity (Ex): You are magically attuned to plants. If

you prepare your spells in advance and do not have the spontaneous

casting ability (as the cleric and druid spellcasting

feature, see *PH* 32 and 35), you can now spontaneously trade

prepared spells for spells of an equal or lower level from the

Plant domain. If you do have a spontaneous casting ability,

you can exchange that one for the ability to cast spontaneously

from the Plant domain. Once you make that decision, it

cannot be reversed. If you do not already have bonus domain

spells, you now gain bonus spells from the Plant domain (see

the cleric spellcasting feature, *PH* 32) as if you were a cleric

with access to that domain. If you already have domain spells,

they are unaffected by this power.

Rebuke Plants (Su): Beginning at 2nd level,

you can channel the power of your faith through

your holy symbol to rebuke or command

plant creatures as though you were a cleric

of your holt warden level rebuking undead.

See the cleric class feature rebuke undead

(*PH* 33), and the Plant Domain granted power

(*PH* 188).

Woodland Stride (Ex): Beginning

at 2nd level, you can move

through natural overgrown

areas at normal speed without

damage. See the druid class

feature (PH 36). If you already

have woodland stride, you

gain a +10 bonus to your

land speed.

Earth’s Communion

(Sp): At 3rd level, you learn

to heal and replenish yourself

and others by communing

with the earth once per day. At

the end of 10 full minutes of

concentration (as the skill), you are

affected as if by a *heal* spell (*PH* 239*)*. If

you so choose, you can allow others to sit with

you in a circle, holding hands, during your

communion. In that case, you can choose to

divide the hit points and other benefi ts provided by your

communion among the people in the circle. You can divide

hit points as if you were using the paladin class feature lay

on hands (*PH* 44). Each other benefi t of the *heal* spell can

affect only one person in the circle, at your direction. Thus,

only one person can be cured of blindness, and so forth. You

do not gain the advantages of any healing benefi ts that you

distribute to others. You can use this ability twice per day

at 5th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times

per day at 9th level.

Trackless Step (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you cannot

be tracked in natural surroundings. See the druid class feature

(*PH* 36). If you already have trackless step, you instead

gain a +4 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks while

in natural surroundings.

Venom Immunity (Ex): At 5th level, you gain immunity

to all poisons.

Whispers of the Forest (Su): When you attain 6th level,

the plants, trees, and rocks begin to speak to you, bringing

you news wherever you are. Once per day for every three holt warden levels you possess, the voices of the forest give you

a short answer to any simple question you pose pertaining

to current events in any wilderness area on your land mass.

Questions about distant lands require 1 minute per mile of

distance to answer. At the DM’s discretion, when the forest

deems an issue particularly important, the whispers bring

you news without your request.

When you attain 10th level, the spiritual energy of the forest

can give you insights into other beings as well. Once per day,

you can ask the voices of the forest about a single creature. For

the rest of that day, you gain a +8 insight bonus on all Bluff,

Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks pertaining

to that creature. Again, at the DM’s discretion, the forest might

occasionally volunteer information about a person or creature,

but only if it considers the being remarkable in some way.

Web of Life (Sp): At 7th level, you can lead your community

in spiritual union with the interconnected web of all

life. Once per day, when you sing, chant, or speak inspiringly

for at least 1 full minute, every living creature that hears your

voice gains a +2 bonus to Wisdom for the next 1d4 hours. In

addition, each divine spellcaster who hears you, including

yourself, gains back 1d4 levels of spells (up to four 1st-level

spells, two 2nd-level spells, one 3rd-level and one 1st-level,

or one 4th-level spell). These regained spells must be spells

you’ve cast since you last prepared spells. No spellcaster can

be affected by this spell-regaining ability more than once per

day, even if it is activated by multiple holt wardens.

Timeless Body (Ex): Beginning at 9th level, you no longer

age. See the druid class feature (*PH* 37). If you already have

timeless body, you can choose an extra feat instead.

PLAYING A HOLT WARDEN

As a holt warden, you might be a militant fanatic, a bohemian

revolutionary, a naïve idealist, or even a vengeful terrorist.

But whatever else you may be, you are, fi rst and foremost, the

guardian and guide of all the living creatures around you.

The Guardians of the Green are all servants and defenders of

nature, and it is you who must guide, aid, and inspire them

to continue with their work.

Combat

Your abilities put you in an ideal position to coordinate the

combat tactics of those around you. Before combat begins,

assess the capabilities of the party or band with which you

will be fi ghting. If they need more ranged support, prepare

spells that can deal damage at a distance. If they fall short in

melee, support them with summoning spells, healing, magical

augmentations to their abilities, or means of sabotaging

their opponents. As a spiritual leader, you aren’t likely to fi ght

alone, so match your tactics to the strengths and weaknesses

of your allies.

Sample Encounter

Hasayla is encountered with Denon (page 83) and Sorag

prepared at the beginning of the day.

**Whispers of the Forest (Su)** Three times per day, the voices

of the forest give Hasayla a short answer to any simple

question she poses pertaining to current events in any

wilderness area on her land mass. Questions about

distant lands require 1 minute per mile of distance to

answer. In addition, once per day, she can ask the voices

of the forest about a single creature, gaining a +8 insight
