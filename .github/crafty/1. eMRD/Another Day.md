# Another Day
## Overview
*Another Day (Ex):* Once per day, when the rogue would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. If the movement takes her out of the reach of the attack, she takes no damage from the attack. At 15th level and 20th level, she can use this talent one additional time per day (to a maximum of 3 uses per day). The rogue must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.
