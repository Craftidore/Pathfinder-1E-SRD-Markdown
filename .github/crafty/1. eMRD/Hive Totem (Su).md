# Hive Totem (Su)
## Overview
*Hive Totem (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian takes half damage from attacks by swarms of vermin, including spells and effects that act like a swarm of vermin (like *[[Summon Swarm (Spell)|summon swarm]]* used to summon spiders or *[[Insect Plague (Spell)|insect plague]]*). She also gains a +1 bonus on Strength ability checks and to CMD against bull rush, drag, and trip attacks for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5). A barbarian must have the [[Animal Fury (Ex)|animal fury]] power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.
