# Virtuoso (PrC)
## Overview
The roar of the crowd, the praise of spectators after a truly

great performance, the showers of gifts from attractive

admirers—why would anyone trade all that for sleeping

in the woods or poking around in smelly old dungeons?

The virtuoso leaves creeping down dark corridors and

matching wits against deadly traps to others. His place

is on the stage, surrounded by adoring fans. Fortunately

for him, every place he goes becomes a stage, and so

long as there’s anyone around for him to impress, he’s

in the spotlight.

The typical virtuoso is outgoing, charismatic, and

gregarious. He loves to be around people and is quick

to win friends with his charming manner. Some might

call him a temperamental egomaniac, yet everyone

feels a little better in his presence. Many virtuosos

are musicians; others are accomplished dancers or

actors. Still others choose to specialize in obscure and

unusual forms of entertainment, such as stage magic

or juggling.

Bards are most often drawn to this prestige class,

although multiclass rogue/sorcerers or rogue/clerics

can also excel in it. Bards tend to perform as musicians

or actors, rogues as either dancers or sleight-of-hand artists,

sorcerers as stage magicians, and clerics as orators.

Characters of most other classes are either not outgoing

enough to enjoy being virtuosos, or they find other outlets

for their extroverted tendencies.

Since entertainers are often on the road, an NPC

virtuoso can be encountered anywhere, incorporating

as much adventuring into his journeys as he wishes.

Because of his talent for winning admirers, he usually

remains above suspicion should anything underhanded

take place in a town he is visiting on tour.

Adaptation: The virtuoso prestige class can play many

different roles in a campaign. In one world, members of a

specific bardic college might all be members of the class.

In another, virtuosos might be dedicated to magic, not

music.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the virtuoso

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Virtuosos gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Bardic Music: Virtuoso levels stack with bard levels

for the purpose of determining the virtuoso’s daily uses

of his bardic music abilities (if any) and the value of

the bonus granted by inspire courage (if the virtuoso has that bardic music ability). For example, a 10th-level

bard/4th-level virtuoso could use bardic music fourteen

times per day, and his inspire courage ability would grant

a +3 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls.

A virtuoso also gains the *fascinate* bardic music ability,

if he doesn’t already have it. He can use his performance

to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with

him. See the bard class feature, page 29 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.*

Virtuoso Performance (Su): A virtuoso can use his

Perform skill to create magical effects on those around

him. He can use this ability once per day per virtuoso

level. He can use any form of performance as part of this

ability. Although many of the names refer to musical

performances, a virtuoso isn’t actually so limited—for

example, an actor could perform a “sustaining soliloquy”

or “sustaining dance” rather than a sustaining song. Each

ability requires both a minimum virtuoso level and a

minimum number of ranks in any Perform skill

to qualify. If a virtuoso does not have the required

number of ranks in at least

one Perform skill, he does not

gain the virtuoso performance

ability until he acquires the

needed ranks.

Starting a virtuoso

performance effect

is a standard action.

Some virtuoso performance

abilities

require concentration,

which

means that the

virtuoso must

take a standard

action each

round to maintain

the ability.

Unlike with

bardic music,

virtuoso performance

doesn’t

restrict a virtuoso’s

spellcasting

or magic item

activation. If a

virtuoso’s performance

requires

sound, a deaf virtuoso

has a 20%

chance to fail

when attempting

to use virtuoso

performance. If he

fails, the attempt

still counts against

his daily limit.

If a virtuoso has

the bardic music class feature, he can spend two daily uses of bardic music to

deliver a virtuoso performance.

*Persuasive Song (Ex):* A virtuoso with at least 11 ranks in

a Perform skill can deliver a performance that sways the

attitude of his audience. Treat this as a Diplomacy check

made to infl uence NPC attitudes (see pages 71–72 of the

*Player’s Handbook*), but replace the Diplomacy check with

a Perform check. Viewers must be within 30 feet of the

virtuoso, be able to see and hear him clearly, and be willingly

paying attention to his actions. This ability requires

at least 10 consecutive rounds of concentration to take

effect, and it can affect a particular creature only once

per day. Hostile audience members can’t be infl uenced

with this ability.

*Sustaining Song (Su):* A virtuoso of 3rd level or higher

with at least 13 ranks in a Perform skill can sustain his

dying allies, assisting their recovery. Each round that

the song continues, all allies within 30 feet of him

automatically become stable (if dying) or regain 1 hit

point (if stable and between –1 and –9 hit points). A

sustaining song has no effect on enemies or on allies

with 0 or more hit points. A virtuoso can keep up his

sustaining song for 5 minutes. This is a mind-affecting

ability.

*Jarring Song (Su):* A virtuoso of 5th level or higher with

at least 15 ranks in a Perform skill can inhibit spellcasting.

Any enemy within 30 feet attempting to cast a spell

during a jarring song must make a Concentration check

with a DC equal to the virtuoso’s Perform check to avoid

losing the spell. A virtuoso can keep up his jarring song

for 10 rounds.

*Song of Fury (Su):* A virtuoso of 7th level or higher with at

least 17 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance

to turn his allies into furious berserkers. Each ally within

30 feet who can see and hear the virtuoso can choose to

enter a rage on her turn. This functions identically to a

barbarian’s rage, except that it ends automatically if the

virtuoso stops performing. If the ally already has the

ability to rage, she can choose to apply the full effect of

her own rage, without spending one of her daily uses of

rage. A virtuoso can’t use song of fury on himself. This

is a mind-affecting ability.

*Mindbending Melody (Sp)*: A virtuoso of 9th level or

higher with at least 19 ranks in a Perform skill can

dominate a humanoid that he has already fascinated*.*

This ability functions like a *dominate person* spell with a

caster level equal to the virtuoso’s class level. The target

can make a Will save (DC 10 + virtuoso’s class level +

virtuoso’s Cha modifi er) to negate the effect. A mindbending

melody is a mind-affecting, language-dependent,

enchantment (compulsion) ability.

*Revealing Melody (Su):* A 10th-level virtuoso with at least

20 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance to

reveal all things as they actually are. All allies within 30

feet who can see and hear the virtuoso’s performance

are affected as if by a *true seeing* spell with a caster level

equal to the virtuoso’s class level. The effect lasts as long

as the virtuoso performs.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd

level, a virtuoso gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in

an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before

adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain

any other benefi t a character of that class would have

gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a virtuoso, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day and spells known.
