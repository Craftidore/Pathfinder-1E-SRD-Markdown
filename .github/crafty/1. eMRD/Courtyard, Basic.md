# Courtyard, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Sometimes called a bailey, this large open space is surfaced either with gravel or patches of grass. It has no roof. Some flowers might appear around the edges of the area. Paths are worn through the center by people walking around the place. A rough bench or two sits here too.

Purchase this component multiple times if you want a larger courtyard.
