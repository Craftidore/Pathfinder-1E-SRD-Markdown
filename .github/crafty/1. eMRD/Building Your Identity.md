# Building Your Identity
## Overview
Your character is more than just a race, class, and level stapled together. At their best, D&D® characters are on par with characters in the best movies and novels, almost as complex as real people. You have many options at your disposal when crafting your character’s personality. You could invent an intriguing history for your character and allow his or her personality to follow naturally from that. You could imitate characters (or aspects of characters) from books you have read, movies you have seen, or real people you know. With some attention on your part to his or her background, personality type, and signifi cant traits, your character can possess realistic depth and motivation. This chapter offers tools to create well-rounded characters with memorable personalities, as well as advice on being a good player at the table.
