# World Serpent Totem Unity (Su)
## Overview
*World Serpent Totem Unity (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian doubles her fast movement bonus to land speed and cannot be knocked prone. She also doubles her [[World Serpent Totem (Su)|world serpent totem]] insight bonus to AC against attack rolls made by an outsider or aberration to confirm a critical hit against her. A barbarian must have the [[World Serpent Totem (Su)|world serpent totem]] and [[World Serpent Spirit (Su)|world serpent totem spirit]] rage powers and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.
