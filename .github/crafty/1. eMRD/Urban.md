# Urban
## Overview
None would deny that opportunities for great adventure lie within the dank dungeons, winding caves, and sprawling wildlands of the world. However, the place where the PCs come back to sell their treasures, rest, and live their lives can hold excitement as well. Urban settings shouldn’t be overlooked as a place of adventure. Filled with people, businesses, intrigue, and secret locations, cities can provide adventure hooks on literally every street corner.

This section looks at how settlements are put together, how the PCs move around them, what business can be conducted there, and how to craft your own adventures within a city, taking into account both real life elements and the incredible possibilities that magic affords to fantasy settings.

## The Shape of Civilization
**The Shape of Civilization**

If you’re building a settlement from scratch, you’ll first need to determine how many people live there. Is it a tiny collection of houses along a lonely stretch of road? Is it a bustling village that sits at the crossroads of several major thoroughfares? Or is it a full city that serves as the hub for an entire region? Chapter 6 of this book contains a wealth of advice on how societies and civilizations function, but what happens when your PCs actually want to adventure in the city?

Before running an adventure in your city, you must decide what it looks and feels like. The first thing your PCs see as they approach a new city is its skyline. Unless you have a reason to avoid it, consider giving your city’s skyline at least one notable landmark. If a city’s skyline is shown in silhouette, a knowledgeable traveler should be able to recognize it. The landmark could be an unusually shaped building, a huge tower (such as a cathedral’s bell tower), a castle atop a hill, an immense statue of a dragon, a decommissioned warship protruding from a too-small waterfront, or anything else you can imagine, but being able to remind the PCs what city you’re talking about by mentioning this unique landmark gives you an incredibly useful resource.

The bulk of the buildings within any settlement are the homes of the people that live there. Many businesses merely present a storefront, with the rooms above or behind it serving as the owner’s home. If you’re following a medieval model for your city, then the typical home is host to a large number of people crammed into a relatively small space. The average peasant or freeman might only be able to afford a single room or two within a house, living cheek-to-jowl with his neighbors to either side and possibly above and below.

Buildings themselves are products of their environments and are built from materials readily available in the area. The terrain and climate of the land surrounding a city determines what that city is made of. A city in a temperate coastal area might have mostly wooden buildings with some stone structures. A desert town would have adobe or stone buildings, or even structures dug into the earth itself to create dark, cool places for people to live. Cities built in swamps or wetlands might have massive levees and dams to keep the water at bay.

If you’re having trouble visualizing the size and population of a village, town, or city, compare it to real-life locations and gauge accordingly. For example, at its height at the end of the 2nd Century, Rome boasted over a million people (although census records were sketchy—some report nearly 10 times that number!). During the 14th Century, Rome’s population had declined drastically to around 50,000 people. Although these numbers might not seem particularly impressive compared to modern cities, Rome was considered massive and teeming with people.

A heavily populated city does not necessarily translate to urban sprawl. For example, when London reached the 80,000 mark in the 14th Century, the populace was still squeezed within the confines of the ancient walls built by the Romans several centuries earlier, resulting in atrocious living conditions.

Another way to help conceptualize such huge numbers of people is to look at sports arenas, some of which can hold the population of a small or medium-sized town within a single vast structure. The famous Coliseum in Rome could hold 50,000 people at a time. Modern Yankee Stadium can hold nearly 60,000 people.

You should also consider the settlement’s level of sanitation and the presence of sewers. A city with decent sanitation copes with disease considerably better than those where people simply dump sewage in the streets. Settlements with sewers and other sanitation infrastructure also provide ready-made locations for your players to explore, hunting down criminals and cultists or searching for lost treasure, all beneath the feet of the unaware citizens walking the streets above.

**Streets and Traffic**

How do people get around in the town where they live? What are the streets and avenues of your settlement like? Is the town open, with wide avenues, or is it cramped, with houses crammed together, casting the streets and alleyways below into perpetual shadow?

Assuming that the settlement doesn’t contain some sort of wide-ranging magical transport network, most people get around the old-fashioned ways—by foot, mount, or carriage. In most cities, these are the only options available. However, depending on the city and the level of technology and/or magic available, how the populace gets from Point A to Point B could be far more interesting.

Adult humans have a walking speed of around 3-1/2 miles per hour. Thus, walking across a small, open town may take only a matter of minutes. Yet as cities grow in size, they become more difficult to swiftly navigate because of the density of people, animals, and vehicles on their winding streets. In large cities or metropolises with moderate-to-high population density, people on foot move at the rate of a single mile per hour.

Rather than walking, those who can afford the fare may also travel in animal-drawn vehicles, such as wagons, carriages, or hansom cabs. They might also travel in rickshaws or something equivalent. This method is probably more common in places where people are plentiful and horses, mules, and other beasts of burden are either rare, expensive, or both. Does your city sit on a river, or is it interlaced with canals? If so, then gondolas, barges, canoes, or other flat-bottomed boats are probably used as a major form of transportation. Cities and towns built in confined spaces may be far more vertical than less densely-built cities; the populace might make use of bridges, ladders, and even lifts to haul people up and down the several stories they need to traverse.

Beyond these mundane methods of movement, magic and technology can create truly bizarre or fantastic conveyances. In a high-magic game, magic carpets or the equivalent may be employed by the wealthy to travel within a city. Alternately, the city (or independent entrepreneurs) may possess its own “fleet” of specially trained griffons or other flying creatures capable of carrying one or more people to specific locations. In extreme cases, teleportation may even be relatively common, with special booths or “stepping portals” scattered throughout the city, allowing instantaneous transportation within the confines of the settlement or beyond. Take care to limit these magical methods in your game, though, unless you want a game where the wondrous becomes commonplace.

Keep in mind that the PCs can encounter danger and excitement even as they travel through a town or city. Besides the occasional assault by thieves, gangs, or other ruffians, the PCs may have to deal with animals run amok, riots, duels (mundane or magical) in the streets, fires, agitators, and any number of other interesting events. If a pickpocket manages to snag an item from one of the PCs, a rooftop chase might ensue as the PCs pursue the thief. A procession of nobles may stop and question the presence of the adventurers in their fair city. A random corpse in the gutters bearing the signs of a ritual murder may open up an investigation or mystery.

The city’s streets themselves bear consideration as well, for it is here that many of your urban-themed encounters will begin or end. A typical city street should be wide enough to allow two horse-drawn carriages to pass each other, with a little bit of additional room for foot traffic—as a result, well-traveled city streets should never be less than 30 feet wide, with major thouroughfares being 60 feet wide or wider. Back streets might be only 15 or even 10 feet wide—anything narrower than 10 feet will be diff icult to navigate on horseback or via carriage. These narrow lanes are usually your city’s alleyways, only 5 to 10 feet across and often taking complex, winding routes between buildings.

Additional rules for city streets, for moving through crowds or across rooftops, and for cities in general can be found on pages 433–437 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*.

## Settlements in Play
**Settlements in Play**

The best way to handle a settlement in your game, of course, is to plan it out, placing every shop and every home, naming every NPC, and mapping every building. Yet settlements are the most complicated locations you’re likely to ever feature in your game, and the prospect of fully detailing one is daunting, especially if your PCs are likely to visit multiple settlements.

Presented on the following pages are basic rules for a more streamlined method of handling settlements in your game. Essentially, these rules treat settlements almost as characters of their own, complete with stat blocks. Using these rules, you can generate the vital data for a settlement quickly and efficiently, and with this data you can handle the majority of your players’ interactions with the settlement.

Note that for particularly large cities, you can use multiple settlement stat blocks to represent different districts within a city. This allows you to have neighborhoods with distinct characteristics inside one city’s walls. GMs should feel free to add other new elements to create the cities they desire. A Settlement Sheet is included in the back of this book to record the details of your own settlements.

**Settlement Population Ranges**

A settlement’s population is left to the GM to assign, but you can use a settlement’s type to help you determine just how many folks live in the city. Since the actual number of people who dwell in a settlement has no impact on game play, the number you choose is largely cosmetic—feel free to adjust the suggested values below to fit your campaign.


| **Settlement Type** | **Population Range** |
|---|---|
| Thorp | Fewer than 20 |
| Hamlet | 21–60 |
| Village | 61–200 |
| Small town | 201–2,000 |
| Large town | 2,001–5,000 |
| Small city | 5,001–10,000 |
| Large city | 10,001–25,000 |
| Metropolis | More than 25,000 |

### The Settlement Stat Block
**The Settlement Stat Block**

A settlement stat block is organized as follows.

**Name**: The settlement’s name is presented first.

**Alignment and Type**: A settlement’s alignment is the general alignment of its citizens and government—individuals who dwell therein can still be of any alignment, but the majority of its citizens should be within one step of the settlement’s overall alignment. Alignment influences a city’s modifiers (see page 206 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*). The type is the size category the settlement falls into, be it thorp, hamlet, village, town (small or large), city (small or large), or metropolis. In most cases, rules play off of a settlement’s type rather than its exact population total. A settlement’s type determines many of its statistics (see Table 7–36: Settlement Statistics).

**Modifiers**: Settlements possess six modifiers that apply to specific skill checks made in the settlement. A settlement’s starting modifier values are determined by its type. This value is further adjusted by the settlement’s alignment, government, qualities, and disadvantages. Note that introducing settlement modifiers to your game will somewhat increase the complexity of skill checks by adding a variable modifier each time the PCs visit a new town or city—consider the use of these modifiers an optional rule. For a list of modifiers, see page 205 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*.

**Qualities**: All settlements have a certain number of qualities that further adjust their statistics—think of qualities as feats for settlements. A settlement’s type determines how many qualities it can have. For a list of qualities, see page 207 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*.

**Danger**: A settlement’s danger value is a number that gives a general idea of how dangerous it is to live in the settlement. If you use the urban encounters charts on pages 212–213 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide* for random encounters in your city (or any similar wandering monster chart that uses percentile dice and ranks its encounters from lowest CR to highest CR), use the modifier associated with the settlement’s danger value to adjust rolls on the encounter chart. A settlement’s base danger value depends on its type.

**Disadvantages**: Any disadvantages a settlement might be suffering from are listed on this line. A settlement can have any number of disadvantages you wish to inflict on it, although most settlements have no disadvantages. For a list of several possible disadvantages, see pages 207–208 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*.

**Government**: This entry lists how the settlement is governed and ruled. The type of government a settlement follows affects its statistics (see pages 206–207 of the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*).

**Population**: This number represents the settlement’s population. Note that the exact number is flexible; a settlement’s actual population can swell on market days or dwindle during winter—this number lists the average population of the settlement. Note that this number is generally used for little more than flavor—since actual population totals f luctuate, it’s pointless to tether rules to this number. After the settlement’s total population, a breakdown of its racial mix is listed in parentheses.

**Notable NPCs**: This section lists any notable NPCs who live in the city, sorted by their role in the community, followed by their name and then their alignment, gender, race, class, and level in parentheses.

**Base Value and Purchase Limit**: This section lists the community’s base value for available magic items in gp (see pages 460–461 of the *Core Rulebook*). There is a 75% chance that any item of this value or lower can be found for sale in the community with little effort. If an item is not available, a new check to determine if the item has become available can be made in 1 week. A settlement’s purchase limit is the most money a shop in the settlement can spend to purchase any single item from the PCs. If the PCs wish to sell an item worth more than a settlement’s purchase limit, they’ll either need to settle for a lower price, travel to a larger city, or (with the GM’s permission) search for a specific buyer in the city with deeper pockets. A settlement’s type sets its purchase limit.

**Spellcasting**: Unlike magic items, spellcasting for hire is listed separately from the town’s base value, since spellcasting is limited by the level of the available spellcasters in town. This line lists the highest-level spell available for purchase from spellcasters in town. Prices for spellcasting appear on page 159 of the *Core Rulebook*. A town’s base spellcasting level depends on its type.

**Minor Items/Medium Items/Major Items**: This line lists the number of magic items above a settlement’s base value that are available for purchase. In some city stat blocks, the actual items are listed in parentheses after the die range of items available—in this case, you can use these pre-rolled resources when the PCs first visit the city as the magic items available for sale on that visit. If the PCs return to that city at a later date, you can roll up new items as you see fit. See page 461 of the *Core Rulebook* for the number ranges determining how many items can be found in a community.

**Table 7–36: Settlement Statistics**


| **Type** | **Modifiers** | **Qualities** | **Danger** | **Base Value** | **Purchase Limit** | **Spellcasting** | **Population** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Thorp | –4 | 1 | –10 | 50 gp | 500 gp | 1st | Fewer than 20 |
| Hamlet | –2 | 1 | –5 | 200 gp | 1,000 gp | 2nd | 21–60 |
| Village | –1 | 2 | 0 | 500 gp | 2,500 gp | 3rd | 61–200 |
| Small town | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1,000 gp | 5,000 gp | 4th | 201–2,000 |
| Large town | 0 | 3 | 5 | 2,000 gp | 10,000 gp | 5th | 2,001–5,000 |
| Small city | +1 | 4 | 5 | 4,000 gp | 25,000 gp | 6th | 5,001–10,000 |
| Large city | +2 | 5 | 10 | 8,000 gp | 50,000 gp | 7th | 10,001–25,000 |
| Metropolis | +4 | 6 | 10 | 16,000 gp | 100,000 gp | 8th | More than 25,000 |

**Table 7-37: Available Magic Items**


| **Community** | **                       Base** | **Minor** | **Medium** | **Major** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Size** | **                        Value** |
| Thorp | 50 gp | 1d4 items | — | — |
| Hamlet | 200 gp | 1d6 items | — | — |
| Village | 500 gp | 2d4 items | 1d4 items | — |
| Small town | 1,000 gp | 3d4 items | 1d6 items | — |
| Large town | 2,000 gp | 3d4 items | 2d4 items | 1d4 items |
| Small city | 4,000 gp | 4d4 items | 3d4 items | 1d6 items |
| Large city | 8,000 gp | 4d4 items | 3d4 items | 2d4 items |
| Metropolis | 16,000 gp | \* | 4d4 items | 3d4 items |

  \* In a metropolis, nearly all minor magic items are available.

**Optional Rule: Maximum Danger**

Several qualities presented in *Cityscapes: New Settlement Options for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game* can raise a Settlement’s danger rating dramatically, especially when combined. The Eldritch and Under-City qualities alone can raise a settlement’s Danger +33%, making encounters in that unfortunate city unfairly lethal. Therefore, the gamemaster might decide to cap a settlement’s Danger rating at +20%, +30% or some other modifier he or she feels comfortable with. That way, a band of 2nd level adventurers walking down the street don’t end up fighting rakasha and elder dragons every time they roll on the local random encounter chart.

**Source:** Cityscapes: New Settlement Options for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, pg. 6

**Guards! Guards!**

It’s inevitable—sooner or later, the PCs will want to call upon the town guard or cause a situation where citizens do so instead. Calling for the guard requires a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check modified by the settlement’s law modifier. It’s only a DC 5 check to call for the guard—with a success, the guards generally arrive on the scene in 1d6 minutes. Every 5 points by which the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check exceeds DC 5 (rounding down) reduces the arrival time by 1 minute—if this reduces their arrival time below 1 minute, the increments of reduction instead change to 1 round. For example, Ezren is being mugged by thugs and calls for the guard. The result of his [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check is a 23, and the GM rolls a 2 on 1d6 to determine how long it’ll be before the guards arrive. Since Ezren rolled three times the amount he needed, the 2-minute wait time is reduced to 8 rounds.

### Plunder and Loot
**Plunder (Loot)**

There’s a difference between plunder and the gold pieces in a pirate’s pocket. While gold doubloons and fabulous jewelry can be plunder, pirates are rarely lucky enough to encounter a ship with a hold full of such treasures. Typically, there are trade goods, foodstuffs, spices, and valuables of a more mundane sort. Such takes can fetch significant prices, but for scallywags more interested in looting than the specifics of what they loot, this system provides a way for parties to track their plunder without getting bogged down by lists of commonplace cargo and their values down to the copper piece. Aside from streamlining the collection of riches, this system also allows characters to increase their infamy, paying off crew members and spreading their wealth with more appealing dispensations of loot than what was aboard the last merchant ship they robbed. 

**Winning Plunder**: What gains a group plunder is largely decided by the GM or is noted at the relevant points throughout the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path. Typically, at any point the PCs claim a ship’s cargo, conquer an enemy’s hideout, or find a significant treasure, there’s the potential for a portion (sometimes a significant portion) of that wealth to translate into plunder. Plunder means more than five wicker baskets, a barrel of pickled herring, three short swords, and a noble’s outfit; it’s a generalization of a much larger assortment of valuable but generally useless goods (and serves to help avoid bookkeeping on lists of random goods). Rather, a cargo ship carrying construction timber, dyed linens, crates of sugar, animal furs, and various other goods might equate to 4 points of plunder. Just as when awarding more standard forms of treasure, a GM doling out plunder should consider the challenge of winning the plunder and the actual value of the plunder if the PCs cash it in (see below). As a rule of thumb, GMs seeking to give the characters a minor reward might give them 1 point of plunder, while a major reward would be 5 points of plunder. 

Plunder is not meant to serve as a replacement for more standard forms of treasure. GMs should still award characters gold and magic items to keep them prepared to face new challenges, whereas plunder serves as a useful shorthand for what varied mundane treasures are discovered and can be sold for values in gold. Characters can also buy plunder if they wish, though those who do so risk becoming known as merchants rather than pirates. 

**Value of Plunder**: Plunder is valuable for two reasons: It can be sold for gold pieces, and it helps you increase your Infamy (Infamy is further detailed below). In general, 1 point of plunder is worth approximately 1,000 gp, whether it be for a crate full of valuable ores or a whole cargo hold full of foodstuffs. Regardless of what the plunder represents, getting the best price for such goods is more the domain of merchants than pirates, and just because cargo might be worth a set amount doesn’t necessarily mean the PCs can get that much for it. Exchanging 1 point of plunder for gold requires a PC to spend 1 full day at port and make an applicable skill check. Regardless of how much plunder the PCs have, one PC must spend a full day trading to exchange 1 point of plunder for gold. The PC trading also must be the same PC to make the skill check to inf luence the trade. The larger the port and the higher the skill check, the better price the PCs can get for their plunder. At smaller ports there’s little chance of getting more than half value for plunder, unless a PC can employ a skill to make a better deal. At larger ports, the chances of finding a buyer willing to pay a reasonable price for cargo increases, and PCs can still employ skill checks to make even more lucrative bargains. PCs seeking to win a higher price for their plunder can make one of the following skill checks and apply the results to the table below: [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or any applicable [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill, like [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (merchant). A poor result on a skill check can reduce the value of plunder. If the PCs are not satisfied with the price they are offered for their plunder, they need not take it, but a day’s worth of effort is still expended. They can try for a better result the next day. 

The table below explains how much PCs can expect to get for their plunder in communities of various sizes, the skill check DC required to increase this amount by a set percentage, and the maximum amount buyers in a community can be convinced to buy plunder for. Each column is explained in brief here. 

**Community Size**: The size of a community is determined by its population, noted in every community stat block and further detailed in the *Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide*. 

**Base Sale %**: Every community is willing to buy plunder from the PCs, but not necessarily at its full value. This column lists the percentage at which a community is willing to buy 1 point of plunder (along with that percentage’s expression in gold pieces). 

**DC to Increase Sale**: This is the skill check DC required to increase the sale percentage a community offers for plunder. Every community can be convinced to offer more for plunder (to a maximum sale percentage listed in the final column of the table below), but this requires the PCs to make a skill check. The DC of this skill check is 10 + an amount determined by how much the PCs are trying to increase the sale percentage. For example, if a PC is unwilling to accept a mere 20% of the value of his group’s plunder when attempting to sell it in a hamlet, he can attempt to increase this percentage by 5% by making a DC 15 skill check. If he wants to attempt to increase the percentage to 30% (the maximum amount the hamlet can possibly pay), he must make a DC 20 skill check. Failure results in no increase, and this skill check can only be made once per day. In larger communities, the DC to increase these percentages rises, but the percentage also increases, as does the maximum percentage buyers can be talked up to. 

**Maximum Sale %**: This is the highest percentage at which a community can be talked into buying 1 point of plunder. Merchants in a community will never buy plunder for a higher price than this. Additionally, this column lists the skill check DC required to haggle buyers up to this percentage, and how much the percentage is worth in gold pieces. 

**Spending Plunder**: In addition to its value in gold pieces, plunder is vital to increasing a pirate crew’s Infamy. See the Infamy subsystem for more details. 

**Buying Plunder**: Although gold typically proves more valuable and versatile than plunder, some parties might wish to exchange their traditional wealth for plunder. In any community, a party can buy 1 point of plunder for 1,000 gp. What form of goods this plunder takes is determined by the GM. 


| **Community** | **Base Sale %** | **DC to Increase** | **Maximum Sale %** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Size** | **(GP for Plunder)** | **Sale** | **(Max DC & GP for Plunder)** |
| Thorp | 10% (100 gp) | 10 + 5 per 5% | 20% (DC 20; 200 gp) |
| Hamlet | 20% (200 gp) | 10 + 5 per 5% | 30% (DC 20; 300 gp) |
| Village | 30% (300 gp) | 10 + 5 per 5% | 40% (DC 20; 400 gp) |
| Small town | 40% (400 gp) | 10 + 5 per 5% | 60% (DC 30; 600 gp) |
| Large town | 60% (600 gp) | 10 + 5 per 5% | 80% (DC 30; 800 gp) |
| Small city | 80% (800 gp) | 10 + 10 per 5% | 90% (DC 30; 900 gp) |
| Large city 9 | 0% (900 gp) | 10 + 10 per 10% | 120% (DC 40; 1,200 gp) |
| Metropolis | 100% (1,000 gp) | 10 + 10 per 10% | 140% (DC 50; 1,400 gp) |

### Settlement Modifiers
**Settlement Modifiers**

Life in a settlement is represented by six modifiers, each of which adjusts the use of specific skills within the city.

**Corruption**: Corruption measures how open a settlement’s officials are to bribes, how honest its citizens are, and how likely anyone in town is to report a crime. Low corruption indicates a high level of civic honesty. A settlement’s corruption modifies all [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks made against city officials or guards and all [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks made outside (but not inside buildings or underground).

**Crime**: Crime is a measure of a settlement’s lawlessness. A settlement with a low crime modifier is relatively safe, with violent crimes being rare or even unknown, while a settlement with a high crime modifier is likely to have a powerful thieves’ guild and a significant problem with violence. The atmosphere generated by a settlement’s crime level applies as a modifier on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks to avoid being bluffed and to [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks made to pick pockets.

**Economy**: A settlement’s economy modifier indicates the health of its trade and the wealth of its successful citizens. A low economy modifier doesn’t automatically mean the town is beset with poverty—it could merely indicate a town with little trade or one that is relatively self-sufficient. Towns with high economy modifiers always have large markets and many shops. A settlement’s economy helps its citizens make money, and thus it applies as a modifier on all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], and [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] checks made to generate income.

**Law**: Law measures how strict a settlement’s laws and edicts are. A settlement with a low law modifier isn’t necessarily crime-ridden—in fact, a low law modifier usually indicates that the town simply has little need for protection since crime is so rare. A high law modifier means the settlement’s guards are particularly alert, vigilant, and well-organized. The more lawful a town is, the more timidly its citizens tend to respond to shows of force. A settlement’s law modifier applies on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks made to force an opponent to act friendly, [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks against government officials, or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made to call on the city guard (see sidebar).

**Lore**: A settlement’s lore modifier measures not only how willing the citizens are to chat and talk with visitors, but also how available and accessible its libraries and sages are. A low lore modifier doesn’t mean the settlement’s citizens are idiots, just that they’re close-mouthed or simply lack knowledge resources. A settlement’s lore modifier applies on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made to gather information and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks made using the city’s resources to do research when using a library.

**Society**: Society measures how open-minded and civilized a settlement’s citizens are. A low society modifier might mean many of the citizens harbor prejudices or are overly suspicious of out-of-towners. A high society modifier means that citizens are used to diversity and unusual visitors and that they respond better to wellspoken attempts at conversation. A settlement’s society modifier applies on all [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks, as well as on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made to alter the attitude of any nongovernment official.

### Settlement Alignment
**Settlement Alignment**

A settlement’s alignment not only describes the community’s general personality and attitude, but also influences its modifiers. A lawful component to a settlement’s alignment increases its law modifier by 1. A good component increases its society modifier by 1. A chaotic component increases its crime modifier by 1. An evil component increases its corruption modifier by 1. A neutral component increases its lore modifier by 1 (a truly neutral city gains an increase of 2 to its lore modifier). Alignment never modifies a settlement’s economy modifier.

### Settlement Government
**Settlement Government**

Just like nations, towns and cities are ruled by governments. A settlement’s government not only helps to establish the flavor and feel of the community but also adjusts its modifiers. Choose one of the following as the settlement’s government.

**Autocracy**: A single individual chosen by the people rules the community. This leader’s actual title can vary—mayor, burgomaster, lord, or even royal titles like duke or prince are common. (*No modifiers*)

**Council**: A group of councilors, often composed of guild masters or members of the aristocracy, leads the settlement. (*Society +4; Law and Lore –2*)

**Magical**: An individual or group with potent magical power, such as a high priest, an archwizard, or even a magical monster, leads the community. (*Lore +2; Corruption and Society –2; increase spellcasting by 1 level*)

**Overlord**: The community’s ruler is a single individual who either seized control or inherited command of the settlement. (*Corruption and Law +2; Crime and Society –2*)

**Secret Syndicate**: An unofficial or illegal group like a thieves’ guild rules the settlement—they may use a puppet leader to maintain secrecy, but the group members pull the strings in town. (*Corruption, Economy, and Crime +2; Law –6*)

These new ways to run a settlement join the basic options presented in the *Pathfinder Game Mastery Guide.*

**Colonial:** The settlement’s ruler is a figure-head for a distant colonial power: a magistrate, governor, or minor landed noble. He or she may have limited autonomy in running the colony, but ultimately answers to the colony’s founding power. Colonies are typically seen as resources for their founding government, not having much political power or influence. The colony’s government is more concerned with making sure trade with and taxes paid to the homeland flow efficiently then the welfare of the colony’s inhabitants. *(Increase Corruption +2, Economy +1, Law*

*+1)*

**Dynasty:** Power is concentrated in the hands of a single family or a small group of closely related, inter-married families. These elites have ruled the settlement since its inception, and manipulated the power structure to ensure they remain in power. *(Increase Corruption +1, Law +1. Decrease*

*Society -2)*

**Military:** The settlement is an armed garrison that exists solely to serve the military forces deployed there. It may be a massive military base and training complex, a wilderness fortress or a keep that patrols a major trade route, depending on its size. The settlement may even be an ordinary town or city that recently fell under military rule after a coup or uprising that led to the declaration of martial law. *(Decrease Corruption -1, Society -1. Increase Law +3)*

**Theocracy:** The settlement is ruled by its patron faith: secular and theological power are one and the same here. Priests, clerics and oracles decide every facet of life in the settlement.

Double the modifiers for the settlement’s alignment. The settlement gains any one of the following qualities as a ‘bonus’ quality: Desecrate/Hallow, Holy Site, Pious, Racial Enclave, Racially Intolerant, Unholy Site.

**Plutocracy:** The wealthiest and most influential merchants rule this settlement. Wealth is seen as a sign of good character, ethics and even divine favor. The poor have few, if any rights that the wealthy are bound to respect. *(Increase Corruption +2, Crime +2, Economy +3. Decrease Society -2)*

**Utopian Experiment:** This idealistic settlement was founded upon lofty ideals. In theory at least, all members of the community have a voice in its government, and a settlement council meets to ensure the ideals of the community are followed. *(Increase Society +2, Lore +1. Decrease Corruption -2, Crime -1)*

### Settlement Qualities
**Settlement Qualities**

Settlements often have unusual qualities that make them unique. Listed below are several different qualities that can further modify a community’s statistics. A settlement’s type determines how many qualities it can have—once a quality is chosen, it cannot be changed.

Note that many of the following qualities adjust a town’s base value or purchase limit by a percentage of the town’s standard values. If a town has multiple qualities of this sort, add together the percentages from modifiers and then increase the base value by that aggregated total—do not apply the increases one at a time.

**Academic**: The settlement possesses a school, training facility, or university of great renown. (*Lore +1, increase spellcasting by 1 level*)

**Holy Site**: The settlement hosts a shrine, temple, or landmark with great significance to one or more religions. The settlement has a higher percentage of divine spellcasters in its population. (*Corruption –2; increase spellcasting by 2 levels*)

**Insular**: The settlement is isolated, perhaps physically or even spiritually. Its citizens are fiercely loyal to one another. (*Law +1; Crime –1*)

**Magically Attuned**: The settlement is a haven for spellcasters due to its location; for example, it may lie at the convergence of multiple ley lines or near a well-known magical site. (*Increase base value by 20%; increase purchase limit by 20%; increase spellcasting by 2 levels*)

**Notorious**: The settlement has a reputation (deserved or not) for being a den of iniquity. Thieves, rogues, and cutthroats are much more common here. (*Crime +1; Law –1; Danger +10; increase base value by 30%; increase purchase limit by 50%*)

**Pious**: The settlement is known for its inhabitants’ good manners, friendly spirit, and deep devotion to a deity (this deity must be of the same alignment as the community). (*Increase spellcasting by 1 level*; *any faith more than one alignment step different than the community’s official religion is at best unwelcome and at worst outlawed—obvious worshipers of an outlawed deity must pay 150% of the normal price for goods and services and may face mockery, insult, or even violence*)

**Prosperous**: The settlement is a popular hub for trade. Merchants are wealthy and the citizens live well. (*Economy +1; increase base value by 30%; increase purchase limit by 50%*)

**Racially Intolerant**: The community is prejudiced against one or more races, which are listed in parentheses. (*Members of the unwelcome race or races must pay 150% of the normal price for goods and services and may face mockery, insult, or even violence*)

**Rumormongering Citizens**: The settlement’s citizens are nosy and gossipy to a fault—very little happens in the settlement that no one knows about. (*Lore +1; Society –1*)

**Strategic Location**: The settlement sits at an important crossroads or alongside a deepwater port, or it serves as a barrier to a pass or bridge. (*Economy +1; increase base value by 10%*)

**Superstitious**: The community has a deep and abiding fear of magic and the unexplained, but this fear has caused its citizens to become more supportive and loyal to each other and their settlement. (*Crime –4; Law and Society +2; reduce spellcasting by 2 levels*)

**Tourist Attraction**: The settlement possesses some sort of landmark or event that draws visitors from far and wide. (*Economy +1; increase base value by 20%*)

From the mundane to the magical, these new settlement qualities join those found in the *Pathfinder Game Mastery Guide.*

**Abundant:** The settlement has access to extraordinary natural resources: rich farmland, a deep lake, excellent hunting grounds nearby or even a convenient source of magical sustenance. The local food surplus makes the settlement a major exporting hub, and increases the standard of living for its inhabitants. *(Increase Economy +1. Reduce the purchase price of most forms of locally-grown food and livestock by 25% or more.)*

**Abstinent:** *Special Restriction:* Lawful communities only. The settlement religious or moral convictions force it to deny some of the world’s more common vices. The settlement prohibits a common vice: usually alcohol is prohibited, but other abstinent settlements might ban stronger drugs, tobacco, prostitution, or even ‘indulgent’ foods like fine pastries, meat, or similar. *(Increase Corruption +2, Law +1, Decrease Society -2)*

**Animal Polyglot:** Similar to the Magical Polyglot effect, a magical aura hangs over the settlement. All creatures of the Animal type gain the ability to speak and think while within the settlement’s borders. Animals act as if their INT scores were 6, and gain ability to speak Common; they lose these benefits as soon as they pass the settlement’s borders. There are likely to be few butcher shops within the settlement’s borders…

*(Decrease Economy -1, Increase Lore +1. Increase spellcasting by 1 level. Add the settlement’s Lore modifier to* *[[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]]** checks made within the settlement.)*

**Anthropomorphizing:** *Requires the use of Fursona: The Complete Guide to Creating Anthropomorphic Characters (Otherverse Games, 2011)*

*Special Requirement:* Racial Enclave (creatures with the Anthro subtype).

This settlement is a haven for those with fur and feathers. Fascinatingly inhuman Anthros walk the streets; the settlements are powerful boar-men or lion anthros; its prostitutes are glamourous bird or cat-women, its wizards a hybrid between ferret and man, and so on….

Non-anthro characters can become both Anthros and citizens by undergoing a day-long religious ritual led by the settlements druids or clerics. The ritual requires the donation of goods or treasure to the community worth at least 5,000 GP. At the end of the ritual, the supplicant loses his or her original racial traits and becomes an Anthro. Select an Order and spend build points as normal to build an Anthro character.

*(Decrease Society -1. Increase Lore +1. Increase spellcasting by +1 levels when casting Transmutation spells only.)*

**Artist’s Colony:** The settlement is renowned for the excellence of its local artists, performers and craftsfolk. *(Increase Economy +1, Society +1. Add the settlement’s Economy modifier on all* *[[Craft (Skill)|Craft]]** checks, not just those made to earn a living.)*

**Asylum:** The settlement is host to an infamous madhouse or asylum (or perhaps a prison, gaol or notorious workhouse). The presence of these dangerous, mad souls has hardened the townsfolk, making them suspicious of strangers and paranoid about the possibility of an escape or other tragedy. *(Increase Lore +1, Decrease Society -2)*

**City of the Dead:** The settlement abuts a massive, historically significant graveyard, massive tomb or mausoleum complex. Its monuments are well maintained, and a powerful ancestor cult exists within the city, either in replacement or addition to traditional religions.

Add the settlement’s Lore modifier to [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (history) and [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (nobility) checks.

*(Decrease Economy -2, Increase Lore +2, Law +1)*

**Cruel Watch:** *Special Restriction:* Lawful communities only. The settlement’s civic watch or police force is infamous for its brutality, effectiveness, cruelty and corruption. *(Increase Corruption +1, Law +2. Decrease Crime -3, Society -2)*

**Decadent:** *Special Restriction:* Evil communities only. The settlement’s vast wealth and proud, ancient heritage has made it a haven for corruption and sin. *(Increase Corruption +1, Crime +1, Economy +1, Society +1, Danger +10. Increase Base Purchase Limit by +25%)*

**Defensible:** The settlement is strategically situated to make it easier to defend, giving its inhabitants confidence and making the settlement a major local trade hub. *(Increase Corruption +1, Crime +1, Economy +2. Decrease Society -1)*

**Desecrate/Hallow:** *Special Restriction:* Good or Evil communities only. The entire settlement is under the effects of a permanent *[[Desecrate (Spell)|Desecrate]]* or *[[Hallow (Spell)|Hallow]]* effect (choose only one) of incredible power. This effect can be suppressed in small areas within the settlement. The caster level for the effect is equal to 20 + the settlement’s size modifier, for the purpose of dispelling.

**Eldritch:** The town has a strange and unnatural air, and is a haunt for sorcerers and oracles. *(Increase Lore +2, Danger +13. Increase spellcasting by +2 levels when casting Divination or Necromancy spells only.)*

**Famed Breeders:** The settlement is known for the excellent quality of the animals bred there, from the mundane (horses, mules, cattle, pigs) to the exotic (talking tigers, pegasi, griffons). People come from far and wide to purchase livestock, draft animals, mounts and animal companions. *(Increase Economy +1. Increase Base Value and Base Purchase Limit by +20% when dealing with mounts and associated gear. Characters can purchase mounts or live stock in the settlement at a +10% discount.)*

**Financial Center:** *Special Restriction:* Non-chaotic communities only. This settlement is home to powerful banks, mints, trading houses, currency exchanges and other powerful financial and mercantile organizations. *(Increase Economy +2, Law +1. Increase Base Value and Purchase Limit by +40%.)*

**Free City:** *Special Restriction:* Chaotic communities only. The city’s libertarian laws make it a haven for fugitives and outcasts of all kinds, from runaway children, serfs who escaped their lord’s lands, criminals and escaped slaves alike. Foreign adventurers and bounty hunters cannot arrest or capture fugitives within the settlement’s borders. *(Increase Crime +2, Danger +5. Decrease Law -2)*

**Gambling:** The settlement caters to vice and greed. Casinos, gaming houses, opium dens and bordellos are all common here, and serve as the town’s major industry. *(Increase Crime +2, Corruption +2, Economy +2, Law -1. Add +10% to the settlement’s Purchase Limit.)*

**God Ruled:** *Special Requirement:* Theocracy or Utopian Experiment governments only. The settlement has no real government; instead it is ruled by religious codes and omens. Gods or other powerful spiritual beings or outsiders intervene directly in the settlement’s politics and daily life. Ordinary citizens are possessed by spirits to speak decrees, unmistakable oracles appear as flaming messages written on walls or in the sky, or perhaps each and every citizen has prophetic dreams that tell them what they must do in the coming day for the settlement to thrive. *(Decrease Corruption -2, Society -2. Add one dice to the number of medium magic items for sale in the settlement.)*

**Good Roads:** The settlement has an extensive road network. These roads are well-maintained and allow for quick movement of troops and merchandise. *(Increase Economy +2)*

**Guilds:** A variety of trade and mercantile guilds control the town’s industry and trade. These guilds are highly specialized (a printer’s guild, an eggler’s guild, a swordsmith’s guild, a diamond cutter’s guild,ect), and usually semi-hereditary, with children following their parents into the guild. *(Increase Corruption +1, Economy +1. Decrease Lore -1)*

**Legendary Marketplace:** The settlement is justly famed for its markets: almost anything may be for sale here! The settlement’s Base Value and Purchase Limits are treated as if the settlement was one size category larger. In the case of a Metropolis with the Legendary Marketplace quality, double the settlement’s Base Value and Purchase Limit. *(Increase Economy +2, Crime +2)*

**Living Forest:** This settlement is a magical place, carved from the living heart of an ancient forest. The trees form themselves into homes, and branches bend to provide the settlement’s inhabitants with food, in the form of magical, druid-tended fruits and berries. *(Increase Lore +1, Society +2, Decrease Crime -2, Economy -4. Increase Spellcasting by 4 levels (druidic spells only).*

**Magical Polyglot:** The settlement is blessed with a magical aura that allows all sentient creatures within its borders to understand one another as if they shared a common language. This permanent magical effect is similar to the *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]* spell, and has no effect on written language, only the words spoken by the settlement’s inhabitants. *(Increase Economy +1, Lore +1, Society +1)*

**Majestic:** The settlement is known for its dramatic, sweeping architecture, monumental statuary and is built to a scale alien to most medium size humanoids. Perhaps the settlement was once a domain of giants, or simply a human metropolis hewn to an epic scale for the sake of grandeur. *(Increase spellcasting by +1 level. Add +1d8 to the number of the most expensive category of magic items the settlement offers for sale, as determined by its size.)*

**Mobile (Frontlines):** The entire settlement can move, albeit slowly, not much faster than an average man could walk. Perhaps it floats on a cushion of magical air, hundreds of feet above the landscape, is a fortress castle growing from the back of some impossibly large creature, or is some kind of enormous steampunk or magi-tech tank.

This city is designed to patrol its kingdom or territory, responding to threats and offering the city’s defenses to those in need. *(Reduce Corruption -1, Economy -1, Society -1. Increase the Base Value and Purchase Limit of the settlement by 25% when trading weapons and armor.)*

**Mobile (Sanctuary):** This mobile settlement is designed to retreat from danger, moving to a safer location when threatened by natural disasters, invasion or famine threatens. *(Increase Economy +1, Decrease Society -1)*

**Morally Permissive:** Divine indulgence or perhaps just a corrupt church selling indulgences has made this settlement famous (or infamous) for its lax morals. Select 1d4+1 acts that would normally be considered sinful or immoral; these acts are not crimes or sins within the settlement, and committing these acts does not violate a paladin or cleric’s moral code, so long as the offense is limited to within the settlement’s borders. *(Increase Corruption +1, Economy +1. Decrease divine spellcasting by -1 level)*

**Peacebonding:** By local law, any weapon larger than a dagger and all wands and rods must either be peacebound or stored at the local sheriff’s office or jail (at the settlement’s option) for the duration of the visit. Peacebonding a weapon involves winding a colored cord tightly around the weapon and its scabbard, and then impressing the local seal in wax. Removing the peacebond requires a full round action before the item can be drawn. ([[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] DC 12 to untangle the bond as a move equivalent action; bond HP 5, no hardness) *(Increase Law +1, Decrease Crime -1)*

**Phantasmal:** The settlement simply isn’t always there! This magical settlement might only appear in the moonlight, appear out of the mist on particularly holy or infamous dates, or only appear in this plane during thunderstorms or on particularly hot days. At other times, the settlement simply doesn’t exist on this plane; powerful, plane-crossing magic is required to access the settlement outside of the ‘proper’ time. The highly magical settlement is insular and clannish as a result of its isolation from the outside world. *(Decrease Economy -2, Society -2. Increase spellcasting by two levels when dealing with planar magic or Conjuration \[summoning or teleportation] spells only.)*

**Planar Crossroads:** Natural or artificial planar gates near the settlement make it a cross-roads for planar travel. Creatures from across the multiverse, both malevolent and benign, can be found here, as can their artifacts.

Increase spellcasting by two levels, and the Base Purchase Limit by +25%. In addition, the Planar Crossroads settlement is the point of origin for many breed of monstrous player characters. Reduce the ECL of any monstrous player race if that race has its origin in this settlement, making heroic versions of these creatures more common in the region. *(Increase Crime +3, Economy +2, Danger +20)*

**Planned Community:** *Special Restriction:* Lawful communities only. The community’s design was determined in advance, every detail planned out before the first keystone was laid. Streets are wide, straight and laid out on an orderly grid, neighborhoods and districts are segregated by purpose, as are the living quarters of the city’s inhabitants. *(Decrease Crime -1, Society -1. Increase Economy +1)*

**Pocket Universe:** Thanks to a magical fold in space and time, the settlement exists in a place far too small to sustain it. A sleepy hamlet might be found in an old mansion’s disused pantry, a huge fortress might hide the space between two old oaks, or a planar metropolis might be contained within a single cramped alley of a much less important city-state.

Depending on the nature of the settlement and its relationship with the outside world, the settlement might be impossible to find. It may require skill checks to even find the entrance to the settlement: usually a DC 20 [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (local) or [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (the planes) check. The settlement’s size modifier is applied to this check, albeit inverted. After all, it’s easier to find a Metropolis (DC 16) than a Thorp (DC 24). *(Decrease Economy -2. Increase spellcasting by +2 levels)*

**Population Surge:** This settlement is home to a greater than usual percentage of children, making it energetic and lively. *(Increase Crime +1, Society +2)*

**Racial Enclave:** The settlement is dominated by a single race: a pleasant Halfling farming community, an Elven capitol, a collection of Half-Orc yurts on the open plains, ect.

Members of one or more races, chosen when the settlement is founded, is especially welcome in the tightknit and homogenous settlement. Members of this race can purchase goods and services in the settlement at a 25% discount. *(Decrease Society -1)*

**Resettled Ruins:** The settlement is built amid the ruins of a more ancient structure. The settlement might be little more than a collection of tents and yurts erected in ruined plazas, or a thriving metropolis whose stones were recycled from long-forgotten temples and fortresses. While ruins provide a ready source of building materials, near-by dungeons to plunder and ancient artifacts to explore, they might also provide a hiding place for modern dangers or old curses.

Add +1d3 to the amount of magic items in any category the settlement’s size would allow it to normally offer. If the settlement’s size would not normally allow it to have magic items of a particular category, it always has at least one randomly chosen item of that category for sale. However, if a buyer rolls a natural one on any [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check made to examine or purchase a locally bought magic item, that item is always cursed. *(Increase Economy +1, Lore +1)*

**Religious Tolerance:** The settlement is known for its widespread religious tolerance, and many faiths have temples, cathedrals or monasteries here. Religious debates in the public square are common. *(Increase Lore +1, Society +1. Increase divine spellcasting by +2 levels.)*

**Romantic:** The settlement’s inhabitants are renowned for their stunning beauty and charm, and the location has been made famous in dozens of romantic songs, poems and bawdy limericks. Affairs of the heart are common here, among the town’s hotblooded, lusty inhabitants. *(Increase Society +1. Double the amount of minor magic items available for sale in the marketplace. Such trinkets are a popular, if expensive, token of affection here.)*

**Royal Accommodations:** One or more members of a royal dynasty call the settlement home. As such, security is extremely tight, and the local economy has taken flight, as merchants catering to the nobility have sprung up.

Increase the purchase price of high quality or luxury items, such as jewelry, fine clothes or food, entertainment, weapons and all magical items purchased in the settlement by +10% due to widespread inflation. *(Increase Economy +1, Law +2. Decrease Society -1)*

**Rural:** The settlement, no matter its size, has never lost its sleepy, small-town atmosphere. The settlement sprawls across a wide, mostly open area, and despite the distances between homes and buildings, neighbors look out for one another. *(Decrease Economy -1, Crime -1, Danger -5)*

**Sacred Animals:** In this settlement there is a great taboo (punishable by death, exile or other severe penance) about killing a particular breed of beast. Depending on the settlement, the sacred animal might be innocuous (house cats, ravens), irritating and mischievous (monkeys) or a stubborn hazard on the roads (horses, cattle). The animals have free run of the settlement. *(Decrease Corruption -1, Economy -1. Increase Lore +1)*

**Sexist:** The settlement’s laws have completely disenfranchised one gender or the other: the oppressed sex has no more legal rights than a pet or a slave, and cannot buy property. While within the settlement, members of the oppressed gender cannot legally make purchases of items worth more than 5 GP, and are usually ignored by the settlement’s inhabitants, and may suffer mockery, violence or legal persecution. *(Decrease Society -2)*

**Slumbering Monster:** The settlement is home to some form of powerful and ancient monster-a slumbering behemoth, a dark god imprisoned by magical means, an ancient war-robot kept in stasis, or some other, currently inert threat. The inhabitants of the settlement expend vast effort keeping their monstrous prisoner contained, and by doing so, they have developed an impressive mastery of arcana.

At the gamemasters option, the slumbering monster might be awakened. Doing so removes this quality, and afflicts the settlement with the Hunted disadvantage instead. The slumbering monster must either be destroyed or re-imprisoned by PC actions to restore this quality to the settlement. *(Increase Lore +2, Society +1, Increase Spellcasting by 2 levels.)*

**Small-Folk Settlement:** This settlement is designed for the comfort of a mostly Gnome or Halfling population. Its doors and ceilings are built for the comfort of the smaller races, and can be absolute murder on the foreheads of taller humanoids. Everything in the settlement, from furniture to forks, is sized for small creatures.

Medium-sized and larger creatures treat the Settlement’s Crime and Society statistics as a penalty due to their difficulty in maneuvering or sneaking around in the miniature Settlement. Small or smaller creatures treat the Settlement’s Crime and Society statistics normally. *(Increase Law +1, Lore +1)*

**Therapeutic:** The settlement is known for its minor healing properties-medicinal hot springs, clean, invigorating mountain air, a plethora of locally grown healing herbs and fruits, or perhaps some divine blessing. Whatever the reason, hospitals, nurseries, retreats and sanitariums are common within the settlement. *(Increase Economy +1, Lore +1.* *[[Heal (Skill)|Heal]]** checks made within the settlement’s borders also receive the settlement’s Lore modifier if positive.)*

**Trading Post:** The settlement’s primary purpose is trade. Merchants and buyers from all over the world can be found within the settlement. *(Double the Purchase Limit for the settlement.)*

**Unaging:** The settlement’s magical aura prevents those within its borders from aging. They do not suffer the ravages of time, and do not physically age. Usually, several kibbutz or schools near the settlement, but not within its borders are established, to allow the community’s children to age to adulthood before they take their unchanging place in the settlement’s immortal society. *(Increase Lore +4, Decrease Society -3. Increase spellcasting by +1 level, when casting spells of the Necromancy school only.)*

**Under-City:** The settlement is built atop a dangerous subterranean structure, filled with monsters and a haven for criminals and outcasts. This under-city might be a massive sewer system, disused railway or subway tunnels, ruined and forgotten basements or dungeons, or a nearby mine or natural cavern system, perhaps even one that descends miles beneath the earth. *(Increase Lore +1, Danger +20)*

**Unholy Site:** The settlement serves as an unholy site for an evil god or philosophy. Worshippers of the evil deity flock to this settlement. *(Increase Corruption +2. Increase spellcasting by +2 levels.)*

**Untamed:** The area around the settlement is still mostly untainted, unclaimed wilderness. This settlement may be a remote logging village, a trading post sprung up around a desert oasis or a small mountain keep, for instance.

When rolling for random encounters within the settlement, instead of using an urban random encounter chart solely, alternate between the urban encounter chart and the wilderness encounter chart (or chart) most appropriate to the surrounding terrain. The settlement’s Danger rating applies to both encounter charts.

**Well Educated:** The settlement’s inhabitants are incredibly well educated and known for their sharp wits. *(Increase Lore +1, Society +1)*

### Settlement Disadvantages
**Settlement Disadvantages**

Just as a settlement can have unusual qualities to enhance its statistics, it can also suffer from disadvantages. There’s no limit to the number of disadvantages a community can suffer, but most do not have disadvantages, since a settlement plagued by disadvantages for too long eventually collapses. A disadvantage can arise as the result of an event or action taken by a powerful or inf luential NPC or PC. Likewise, by going on a quest or accomplishing a noteworthy deed, a group of heroes can remove a settlement’s disadvantage. Several disadvantages are listed below.

**Anarchy**: The settlement has no leaders—this type of community is often short-lived and dangerous. (*Replaces settlement’s Government and removes Government adjustments to modifiers*; *Corruption and Crime +4; Economy and Society –4; Law –6; Danger +20*)

**Cursed**: Some form of curse aff licts the city. Its citizens might be prone to violence or suffer ill luck, or they could be plagued by an infestation of pests. (*Choose one modifier and reduce its value by 4*)

**Hunted**: A powerful group or monster uses the city as its hunting ground. Citizens live in fear and avoid going out on the streets unless necessary. *(Economy, Law, and Society –4; Danger +20; reduce base value by 20%)*

**Impoverished**: Because of any number of factors, the settlement is destitute. Poverty, famine, and disease run rampant. (*Corruption and Crime +1; decrease base value and purchase limit by 50%; halve magic item availability*)

**Plagued**: The community is suffering from a protracted contagion or malady. (*–2 to all modifiers; reduce base value by 20%; select a communicable disease—there’s a 5% chance each day that a PC is exposed to the disease and must make a Fortitude save to avoid contracting the illness*)

These new disadvantages make your newly created settlement a worse place to live and work.

**Atheistic:** The gods have abandoned the settlement. This effect is identical to Magical Dead Zone (below), but only affects divine magic. Outsiders cannot be summoned anywhere within the borders of the settlement, by any means.

**Bureaucratic Nightmare:** *Special Restriction:* Lawful communities only. The settlement is a nightmarish, confusing and frustrating maze of red tape, official paperwork and petty tyrants in positions of minor power, who relish enforcing all the useless little rules.

All financial transactions in the settlement require a successful DC 10 [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check. If the check is unsuccessful, the character has broken some settlement law, and must pay a fine of 5 GP x his character level. If the check result is a natural 1, the offense is ‘particularly heinous’. Roll 1d6 on the following chart to find out what the punishment (and the way around it) is. *(Decrease Economy -2. Increase Crime +2, Corruption +2)*


| **D6 Result** | **Punishment** | **Way To Avoid the Punishment** |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The character is exiled from the settlement for 1d6 months. | Pay a 500 GP fine (DC 15 [[Diplomacy (Skill)\|Diplomacy]] check to reduce it to 250 GP) |
| 2 | The character's armor and shield are confiscated. | Pay a fine equal to ¼ the items' base value. (DC 20 [[Bluff (Skill)\|Bluff]] check to pass off worthless trash as the seized armor instead). |
| 3 | The character is declared officially dead. | The character can't make purchases over 50 GP in the town, but is no longer subject to the settlement's laws. |
| 4 | The character is placed into debt-slavery for one year. | The character can purchase his own slave contract for 4d6 GP… if he can find the magistrate who holds it, requiring a successful DC 20 [[Diplomacy (Skill)\|Diplomacy]] check to gather information. |
| 5 | The character is sentenced to 100 years in prison! | The character can attempt a DC 20 [[Diplomacy (Skill)\|Diplomacy]] check to be assigned to the permanent custody of the PC with the highest STR score, who is officially assigned as his personal jailer. |
| 6 | The character is sentenced to death! | The character can attempt a DC 15 [[Diplomacy (Skill)\|Diplomacy]] check to be appointed his own executioner, and is then free to schedule the execution for any date he chooses. |

**Fascistic:** *Special Restriction:* Lawful communities only. The settlement is governed by a totalitarian regime. Sadistic and legally all-powerful soldiers walk the streets, enforcing the settlement’s brutal laws. Outsiders are mistrusted and undesirables often simply disappear. *(Increase Law +4, Decrease Society -4. If the settlement has either the Pious or Racially Intolerant qualities, the town’s military or police forces will usually kill, imprison or enslave undesirables.)*

**Ignorant:** The people of this town are uneducated, dull-witted and worse, they consider their ignorance to be an admirable quality. *(Decrease Economy -3, Lore -6, Society -3)*

**Magically Deadened:** For some reason, the magic in this region is weak. Local leylines are warped and the magical eco-system is fragile. *(Decrease Lore -1, Economy -1. Decrease spellcasting by four levels. Reduce the amount of all magical items sold in the marketplace by -2 per category. If this reduces the randomly determined amount of magical artifacts for sale to 0 or below, items of that category cannot be found in the settlement.)*

**Magical Dead Zone:** There is no magic here. Spells do not function, and the entire settlement is a dead magic area, as described in the planar traits chapter of the *Pathfinder Game Mastery Guide*.

**Mutagenic:** *Requires the Use of Accidents of Birth v2 (Otherverse Games, 2011).* Strange energies or pollutants staining the area make this place a haven for deformed and superhuman freaks. Mutagenic vapors fill the sky, making sunsets strangely colored and eerily vibrant, or strange chemicals have tainted the ground water, or perhaps mutation causing crystals are found in the bedrock beneath the settlement. Anyone who spends more than 72 continuous hours in the settlement must succeed at a FORT Save or begin mutating. The FORT Save begins at DC 10, and increases by +1 each successive day until the character either succumbs to the town’s mutagenic effects or leaves the area for at least one week, to purge the accumulated toxins or energies from his system.

**Rampant Inflation:** Common to boom towns sprung up around a rich mining camp or profitable dungeon, and settlements undergoing a revolution or military junta alike, this settlement’s economy is out of control. *(Decrease Economy -4, Increase Corruption +2, Crime +4)*

In addition, before making any purchase, no matter how small, roll 1d6 and consult the following chart.


| **D6 Result** | **Effect** | **A loaf of bread (2 cp) would cost…** | **A short sword (10 gp) would cost…** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add 1 coin to the cost | 3 cp | 11 gp |
| 2 | Add 10 % to the cost | 2.2 cp (no real change) | 11 gp |
| 3 | Add 50% to the cost | 3 cp | 15 gp |

**Soul Crushing:** The settlement has an oppressive, frightening atmosphere. Its architecture is eerie and seems somehow wrong or corrupt. The people are strange and furtive.

Anyone who spends at least 24 hours within the settlement suffers a -2 penalty on WILL Saves for as long as they remain in the area and for 24 hours after leaving the area.

**Polluted:** The settlement’s magical or high-tech industry has stained the sky with sickly grey smog, poisoned the waters with dark slime and made the ground less fertile. Sickness and misery abound.

Anyone who spends at least 24 hours within the settlement suffers a -4 penalty on FORT Saves made to resist disease for as long as they remain within 5 miles of the settlement and for 1d4+1 days after leaving the area (or until they receive any amount of magical healing while out of the polluted region). *(Increase Corruption +2, Economy +4)*

**Wild Magic Zone:** The settlement is built over an area of wild and unpredictable magic. The entire settlement is considered a wild magic area, as described in the planar traits chapter of the *Pathfinder Game Mastery Guide*. Magical beings and spellcasters tend to avoid this dangerous township. *(Decrease spellcasting by -2 levels)*
