# Aquanaut (Archetype)
## Overview
**Aquanaut (Alchemist Archetype)** 

While elder things and alien entities often predated the rise of civilization, many were known and even venerated in long-fallen antediluvian civilizations whose cities and nations have long since vanished beneath the waves in legendary cataclysms long past. Aquanauts are scholars and explorers of the abyssal deeps of the world's oceans, probing the oozy rifts of the ocean floor to find the lost relics of ancient cultures touched by visitors from beyond, often becoming tainted themselves by their discoveries of secrets better left buried beneath the waves.

**Aquatic Apparatus (Ex):** Aquanauts learn how to craft alchemical and technomagical apparatus to help extend her underwater explorations. Crafting an alchemical apparatus takes 1 minute and expends one use of the alchemist's bombs ability. The aquanaut then makes skill checks for Craft (alchemy) and Disable Device against a DC of 12 plus twice the level of the extract being enhanced, which must be a harmless extract with a range of personal or touch. If both checks succeed, the target spell is enhanced by the apparatus. As long as the target of the extract remains in or underwater, the extract's duration elapses at half the normal rate, effectively doubling the effect's duration if she spends the entire duration underwater. In addition, the apparatus makes the effect harder to dispel, increasing the DC of caster level checks to dispel by 4 as long as the target remains in or underwater. An aquanaut can use this ability to extend the duration of his mutagen, with a skill check DC of 10 for an ordinary mutagen or cognatogen, 15 for a greater version, or 20 for a grand version. This replaces Brew Potion.

**Slippery Swimmer (Ex):** At 2nd level, an aquanaut gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against becoming entangled or engulfed and to his CMD against combat maneuver checks made to drag or grapple. These bonuses are doubled in water or underwater. This replaces poison use and poison resistance +2.

**Eldritch Explorer (Ex):** At 5th level, an aquanaut can disarm magical traps with Disable Device. In addition, when underwater he functions as if he had the trap spotter rogue talent. This replaces poison resistance +4.

**Aquatic Enchantment (Ex):** At 6th level, the aquanaut gains the ability to manufacture magical items that improve a creature's ability to breathe, move, and fight underwater, including *apparatus of the crab, cloak of the manta ray, feather token (anchor, swan boat), gloves of swimming and climbing, helm of underwater action, horn of the tritons, necklace of adaptation, plate armor of the deep, ring of elemental command (water), ring of freedom of movement, ring of swimming, ring of water walking, trident of fish command,* or a* trident of warning* as though he had the requisite item creation feats, using her alchemist caster level for his extracts as his caster level for the purpose of magic item creation. He must fulfill all other prerequisites to manufacture such items. This replaces swift poisoning.

**Submersible Suit (Ex):** At 8th level, the aquanaut becomes comfortable adapting heavier armor protection with built-in submersible apparatus and maneuvering surfaces. She gains Medium Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat, and her armor check penalty for armor no longer applies to Swim checks (though penalties apply normally for shields and when carrying a medium or heavy load). At 12th level, he gains Heavy Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.

In addition, as a swift action an armored aquanaut in the water can discharge one of his bombs while attempting a bull rush, drag, or overrun combat maneuver, increasing his combat maneuver bonus for that maneuver by an amount equal to the number of dice of damage the bomb would normally deal. Alternatively, he can discharge a bomb as a swift action as part of a run action, doubling his swim speed until the end of his turn and allowing him to move that turn without requiring a Swim check and to run even through difficult terrain.

This replaces poison resistance +6 and poison immunity.

**Discoveries:** The following discoveries complement the aquanaut: aquatic mutagen, cognatogen, concussive bomb, deep diver, delayed bomb, demolition charge, depth charge, homing torpedo, mine, tentacle, torpedo, underwater demoltion, vestigial arm.
