# Familiars
## Overview
**Familiars**

A familiar is an animal chosen by a spellcaster to aid him in his study of magic. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but is now a magical beast for the purpose of effects that depend on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar grants special abilities to its master, as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other. Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master’s level.

If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

\*A familiar can speak one language of its master’s choice as a supernatural ability.

**Familiar Basics:** Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar’s kind as described in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, but with the following changes.

*Hit Dice:* For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master’s character level or the familiar’s normal HD total, whichever is higher.

*Hit Points:* The familiar has half the master’s total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

*Attacks:* Use the master’s base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar’s Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to calculate the familiar’s melee attack bonus with natural weapons. Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar’s kind.

*Saving Throws:* For each saving throw, use either the familiar’s base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master’s (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

*Skills:* For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master’s skill ranks, whichever is better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar’s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar’s ability to use. Familiars treat [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]], [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]], and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] as class skills.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions:** All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master’s combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities are cumulative.


| **Master** <br>**Class Level** | **Natural**<br>**Armor Adj.** | **Int** | **Special** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1st–2nd | +1 | 6 | [[Alertness (Feat)\|Alertness]], improved evasion, share spells, empathic link |
| 3rd–4th | +2 | 7 | Deliver touch spells |
| 5th–6th | +3 | 8 | Speak with master |
| 7th–8th | +4 | 9 | [[Speak with Animals (Spell)\|Speak with animals]] of its kind |
| 9th–10th | +5 | 10 | — |
| 11th–12th | +6 | 11 | Spell resistance |
| 13th–14th | +7 | 12 | Scry on familiar |
| 15th–16th | +8 | 13 | — |
| 17th–18th | +9 | 14 | — |
| 19th–20th | +10 | 15 | — |

*Natural Armor Adj.:* The number noted here is in addition to the familiar’s existing natural armor bonus.

*Int:* The familiar’s Intelligence score.

*Alertness (Ex):* While a familiar is within arm’s reach, the master gains the [[Alertness (Feat)|Alertness]] feat.

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.

*Share Spells:* The wizard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on himself. A wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the familiar’s type (magical beast).

*Empathic Link (Su):* The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

*Speak with Master (Ex):* If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

*Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):* If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by the Intelligence of the conversing creatures.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master’s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar’s spell resistance.

*Scry on Familiar (Sp):* If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* spell) once per day.

   <sup>1</sup> Or other celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute animal from the standard familiar list.

   <sup>2</sup> The master must first create the homunculus.

Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars, with two exceptions: if the creature’s type is something other than animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already have the ability to communicate).

## Small and Vermin Familiars
Some of these familiars break some of the rules and assumptions of the familiars presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Small familiars threaten the areas around them just like other Small creatures do, and can be used to flank enemies, though both familiars and their masters are often loath to use such tactics, as the result tends to be a dead familiar.

Small familiars are also harder to keep on a master's person than Tiny or smaller familiars. Often they require some form of magic item, like a *bag of holding*, for such a feat to work.

The process of making a vermin into a familiar grants it an Intelligence score and removes the mindless trait. Vermin familiars communicate with their masters and other vermin of their kind (greensting scorpions with other scorpions, house centipedes with other centipedes, and scarlet spiders with other spiders) by way of a strange combination of behaviors, slight changes in coloration, and even the excretion of scents, subtle and otherwise. As with other types of familiars, other creatures cannot understand this communication without magical aid.

## Approximating Familiars
Though the list presented on the previous page is long, as a player, you may desire a special familiar-either real, unique to Golarion, or wholly imagined-that hasn't yet been presented with specific Pathfinder stats. With your Game Master's approval, however, it's easy to "re -skin" an existing familiar stat block to create the exact familiar you want.

The easiest way is to examine the Familiars and Special Abilities table on page 10 and try to find the animal most similar to the one in your imagination, then use the source listed in the Statistics column to find its full stat block. For many animals, you'll be able to simply use that stat block for your familiar, in the same way that a parrot uses the same stats as a raven, and change only the flavor and descriptions. This way, you don't have to worry about tweaking the creature's mechanics, and your GM can rest easy knowing that the familiar is still balanced.

Sometimes, however, you may want an animal radically different from any on this list. In these cases, your best bet is to flip through the various Pathfinder RPG bestiaries until you find something similar to what you're looking for-preferably of a low Challenge Rating. From there, you can change the skills and feats, add or subtract attacks, and otherwise sculpt the creature until it matches the picture in your imagination. Bear in mind that monster design is a complicated process. You'll need to be familiar with the rules in the appendices of the Pathfinder RP G Bestiary if you want your creature to be balanced, and even if you do the math perfectly, your GM may still decide the creature is too powerful. After all, familiars are intended to be relatively weak, and even a baby mastodon is going to be hard to reduce to an appropriate CR without designing a totally new monster, at which point you might as well just grab the pig familiar stats and add fur. The young template is also extremely useful in reducing creatures' CRs. Once you've got the stats worked out, use the examples above to decide what ability your familiar grants its new master. And don't forget to get your GM's approval!

For example, let's say you want to create a cardinal, because you think he'd go well with your fire wizard who only wears red. Since they're both small birds, it's easy enough to take the raven stat block above and simply remove the ability to talk. If you want a lobster, you can use the king crab, perhaps reversing its land and swim speeds to represent its quick movement underwater. A rat makes a fine guinea pig, and a weasel makes a great stoat or ermine. If you want to tinker further, remember that the further you range from an existing stat blockespecially if it's to add extra attacks or otherwise improve a creature-the more likely your GM is to reject it as being unbalanced. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game tries to balance familiars so that none are obviously better than the others; if yours is clearly better, it's probably too powerful, and perhaps better suited for the animal companion class feature.
