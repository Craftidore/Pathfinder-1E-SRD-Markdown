# Creating Villains
## Overview
If you understand evil, you can create villains with appropriate personalities and motives. The following examples detail some villains whose activities reflect the aspects of evil described above.

**THE BOORISH THUG**

Perhaps the simplest sort of villain is the crude, selfish oaf who just takes what he wants. His desires rarely go beyond simple wealth or privilege, although he might crave something as significant as respect.

Driven by basic needs and desires, this villain does not employ subtle or sophisticated methods. He is straightforward, and the only weapon he employs is brute force. If he has assistance or allies, they are likely to be just like him, since companions who are not like him cannot long tolerate his presence.

**Example:** Trendan Resh (NE male human Fighter 2/Rogue 4) is a criminal who has lived all his life in the big city. Since his youth, Trendan has run a small gang of other young toughs. None of them seek gainful employment—they would rather waylay visitors to the city or steal from the drunks in the alleyways behind Tavern Row. Trendan is cowardly, lazy, and crude. He isn’t even particularly skilled at fighting, but he knows how to crack people on the back of the head with a club when they aren’t looking.

**THE TYRANT**

The classic power-mad villain craves domination over all that he sees—lands, people, and magic. He can be a ruler, a would-be ruler, or a loner who desires physical domination more than political power.

A tyrant villain might be a powerful cleric leading legions of fanatic soldiers or a scheming crime lord who runs all manner of illegal operations in the heart of a city. Other tyrants include the petty megalomaniac ruler who wishes to expand her holdings and isn’t afraid to tax her people to death to do so, and the bookish wizard who studies alone, cloistered in a library for years, so that he can learn the spells that will let him take over the world.

The tyrant generally uses minions to accomplish what he wants. He believes that he is superior to others and thus should not have to sully himself with minor deeds. He orders paid mercenaries around and manipulates others with magic. Some tyrants create their own minions, ranging from constructs to slaves to blackmail victims coerced into working for him. A tyrant’s schemes are usually fairly sophisticated, although not all tyrants are smart. Sometimes a tyrant is nothing more than a power-hungry simpleton, dangerous only because he was born into a position of favor.

**Example:** Ystan the Graylord (CE male dwarf Wizard 15) seeks to take over the area around Mount Exalt through the use of his undead minions. However, he does not yet possess the might to animate an army large enough to assault the walled city of Kachel alone, so he has spent years questing for a magic artifact that can dominate the wills of others. With undead and mentally enslaved soldiers, Ystan can launch his assault. Thus begins Ystan’s dream of a vast and terrible empire.

Ystan carries a special item called the *skull of past splendor*, which has all the powers of a *rod of splendor*. Additionally, it confers the memories once contained in the skull to the owner, granting Ystan a +2 circumstance bonus on his [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks. 

**THE SCHEMING LIAR**

The slippery weasel, the cunning thief, the silver-tongued rogue—these villains present different dangers than brutes and psychopaths do, but they are dangerous foes nonetheless. These enemies are far more likely to slip a dagger in someone’s ribs while he sleeps than fight him face to face. Or better yet, thinks the schemer, she’ll just frame someone for murder and let the authorities hang him in the public square. Such diabolic malefactors spin a web of deceit wherever they go. Schemers know just what to say and who to say it to in order to get what they want.

Scheming liars can be political manipulators who use others to accomplish their goals. They do not go against the laws and rules; they make laws and rules work for them, bending and twisting the words as needed. They don’t truly respect the law, but they want to avoid the appearance of breaking it. Such villains are difficult to defeat, and it’s even harder to prove that they are villains in the first place.

**Example:** Narma Glitterhome (CE female gnome Wizard 8) serves as a butler to Lord Feddin Spritestar, a powerful and influential gnome. What most people do not realize is that Narma has the lord’s ear and frequently gives him advice about the rulership of his demesne. But Lord Spritestar does not know that Narma is manipulating him into a war against the nearby kobold tribes of Bloodwall.

Narma is an illusionist who frequently travels to Bloodwall in the guise of a male kobold to manipulate the council of chieftains there. If war breaks out, Narma is poised to assume a third identity: the long-lost gnome queen Halli Guttenstone, who will save the gnomes from the kobolds and become ruler of the land.

Narma wears a ring precious to her, the *ring of many faces*, which grants her the use of *polymorph self* three times per day and a +10 profane bonus on her [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks.

**THE PSYCHOPATH**

Some villains focus on the act of evil itself, rather than on the goals an evil act helps them reach. They revel in killing, inflicting pain, and spreading misery. The motives and methods of psychopaths vary greatly. Some creatures are born psychopathic—lamias, destrachans, orcs, beholders, and black dragons, for example. These monsters are evil through and through, and they delight in death and misery. Their love of killing for its own sake makes them far more dangerous than monsters that simply kill to eat, such as the ankheg or the remorhaz.

Human, elf, dwarf, halfling, and gnome psychopaths are no less varied. Some are clean and efficient at what they do. They sneak up on their victims quietly and make sure that when they are finished, no evidence ties the murderer to the murder. Other psychopaths are far more blatant and direct. They do not care who knows of their activities, and they relish their victims’ fear of death almost as much as they enjoy the pain and the killing itself. Often, such psychopaths have positions of power that keep anyone from easily putting a stop to their terrible activities.

**Example:** Reynod (NE male human vampire Rogue 6/Assassin4) is the henchman of a powerful criminal overlord. Most of the crime lord’s other henchmen expect a bonus when they eliminate one of the syndicate’s enemies. After all, killing is a dangerous and dirty business. Not so with Reynod, who delights in killing. In fact, the crime lord worries about what might happen if he didn’t give Reynod someone to kill every so often. Reynod loves the use of knives; he owns a collection of them that numbers more than three hundred. He is sneaky, subtle, and sly. Reynod’s victims rarely know what is coming because he is so efficient at shadowing, then approaching his prey. Not even Reynod’s criminal employer knows that he is actually a vampire.

Reynod wears an amulet he calls *father’s tooth*. The fang-shaped tooth grants Reynod an additional +4 turn resistance.

**THE SOPHISTICATE**

A villain can be a horrible murderer or a lying cheat and yet still retain a veneer of sophistication. This type of villain can be a foppish rogue without a conscience or a dispassionate overlord who enjoys a sampling of fine elven wines while watching the execution of prisoners.

Sophisticated villains are sometimes the evildoers that no one suspects. Only a thorough investigation can prove their terrible deeds. Urbane villains are able to convince most people that they are noble, civilized individuals. In other cases, these villains are known for what they truly are, but they still believe themselves to be cultured and sophisticated, and they conduct themselves accordingly—even as they commit atrocities.

**Example:** Duchess Winsone D’Artreda (LE female human Aristocrat 13) rules over a vast, wooded realm. All know her as a beautiful, well-mannered, and sophisticated woman. Unknown to most, however, she is also a sadist and a cold-blooded killer. She has a secret set of chambers in the dungeons below her castle where she keeps her victims. Winsone has a strange code of honor: She preys only upon the lower class or upon intelligent nonhumanoid creatures. Her secret hunters make raids upon outlying villages or scour the woods for pixies, dryads, and even the occasional centaur.

Winsone delights in the use of her custom-made whip of many thongs, which grants her a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks when she uses it in her midnight torture sessions.

**THE MISGUIDED FOOL**

Some villains do not even know that they are villains. Deluded through insanity, religious belief, or just stupidity, they commit horrible acts and never realize what it is that they do. A foolish villain might suspect that his acts and thoughts are tainted, but he’s too apathetic to try to uncover the truth. Blindly committing evil acts because it is just easier that way, the misguided fool can easily become a truly sinister villain over time, continuing his evil deeds while his own perceptions veer ever farther from reality.

A young king introduced to evil by his malevolent vizier, the fanatic demon worshiper seeking sacrificial victims for his god, and the radical racial purist are all examples of the misguided fool.

**Example:** Nerence Unger (NE male human Expert 5) is the leader of a school for young boys. Every few months, two men come to Nerence’s office and give him a large bag of gold. At the same time, one of the boys—one whom Nerence has recently put on record as a troublemaker—disappears. Nerence says nothing. He just counts his gold. He tells himself that he did not do anything wrong.

**THE MONSTER**

The monster villain craves killing, lives in filth, and seeks to destroy everything that he encounters. More depraved than psychopaths or sadists, this creature is beyond redemption. This villain is practically a demon or a devil in his own right. He drinks the blood of his enemies and allows it to run down his chin and over his chest. No act is too distasteful for him.

**Example:** Like many evil warlords, Agrattanath (LE male hobgoblin Barbarian 9) kills his foes with impunity. But what Agrattanath really enjoys is killing the children of his dead foes slowly and then feasting on their quivering hearts. When he goes into battle, he leads troops into combat with what appears to be bravery but is actually blood lust. Even Agrattanath’s own tribe is afraid of him, for it is clear that he would just as willingly kill them and devour their children’s hearts if he did not have enemies to kill.

Agrattanath wields a mace whose head is the petrified head of an elflord named Yessef. It is treated as a *+3 mace of life-drinking* (as the *life-drinker greataxe*).

**THE UNEXPECTED VILLAIN**

Sometimes, evil doesn’t show up where your players expect it. A trusted servant can abuse his position to steal and gather secrets for blackmail. A cleric of Pelor might actually be a werewolf. The drug-addicted farmer’s wife will do anything to feed her addiction—even kill. The respected healer in town is in the pay of the local slavers’ ring. The unexpected villain usually also belongs to one of the other villainous categories.

Sometimes the villain is obviously evil, but there is more to him than first appears. A mind flayer might be possessed by a devil, for example, or an evil wizard could really be a polymorphed dragon.

**Example:** Once every six hundred years, an elf child is born with supernatural talent and intelligence. Known as the shadowchild, this being has the mind of a dispassionate killer and many special powers. To all outward appearances, however, the shadowchild is a normal elf child.

In the elf village of Daerthane, young Taetra Featherfall (CE female elf half-fiend) seems like all the other children scampering about the village and the surrounding woods. She is not. She is the shadowchild, and the disappearances near Daerthane of late are because of her, not the nearby clutch of owlbears currently being tracked by the village’s rangers. Taetra is extremely careful when she abducts and sacrifices other children. She has no desire to expose herself before she is old enough to reveal her true nature.
