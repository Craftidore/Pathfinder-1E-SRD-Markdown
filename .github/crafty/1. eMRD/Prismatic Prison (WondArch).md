# Prismatic Prison (WondArch)
## Overview
**Prismatic Prison:** A *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]* surrounds the entire stronghold space, lining the exterior of the walls, ceiling, and floor. The effect of the walls face outward, which blinds anyone with fewer than 8 HD coming within 20 feet (Fortitude save DC 22 negates).

Only the prisonâ€™s creator can pass through harmlessly; anyone else passing through the wall suffers its effects. Most builders who include this item place the space it guards some distance from well-traveled areas of the stronghold.

*Caster Level:* 15; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
