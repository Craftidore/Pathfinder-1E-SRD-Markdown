# Sticky Poison (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Sticky Poison:* Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky—when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
