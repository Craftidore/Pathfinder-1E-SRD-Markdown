# Throne Room, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 2,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Two servants

This plain but respectable chamber serves as the throne room or receiving room for a local lord, merchant prince, baron, or a even monarch on hard times. Colorful tapestries cover the walls, brightening the chamber. The padded throne itself sits on a raised wooden platform. Beside and below the throne, several chairs offer a place for advisers or noble-blooded relatives to sit in places of honor. A long carpet or collection of animal skins shows the path for petitioners seeking to beseech the throne’s good grace.

This room holds up to twenty guests in addition to the throne’s occupant. Purchase this space multiple times for a larger area.
