# Inveigler (Template)
## Overview
The inveigler uses lies as weapons and weaves armor from falsehood. A manipulator and a cheat, the inveigler is so consumed with hiding the truth and controlling others’ ideas of what the truth is that its words and thoughts gain supernatural power.

Inveiglers look like perfectly ordinary specimens of their kinds. Most are likeable and have many friends, but inveiglers are consummate liars, and the lies they tell have the power to command the minds of others. Many inveiglers use their powers to assume roles of authority, but just as many are content to function as the power behind the throne.

Creatures that already rely on falsehood to make their way through life are much more likely to become inveiglers than those that do not. Some inveiglers say they are the chosen messengers of a god of deceit, others claim to have made bargains with demons for their souls, and still others tell anyone who can pry an answer from them that they were born inveiglers. If anything can be said about an inveigler, it is that no story it tells can be totally true.

**Creating an Inveigler**

“Inveigler” is an acquired template that can be added to any nongood creature with Intelligence and Charisma scores of 8 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An inveigler uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature +1.

**Alignment:** Any non-good.

**Special Attacks:** The inveigler retains all the base creature’s special attacks and gains those described here. 

*Charming Falsehood (Su):* Once per day, an inveigler can tell a lie so convincing that it enchants a single creature that hears it. The inveigler need not be able to see the target of its lie or have line of effect to it, but if the target cannot hear the lie, this use of the ability is wasted. The lie must be one that would cause the target to view the inveigler as a trusted friend or that would make it likely to follow the inveigler’s orders, but it can be as outlandish as the inveigler wishes. If the target hears the lie, it must attempt a [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check opposed by the inveigler’s [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check. A creature that fails this check by less than 5 is affected as though by the *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]* spell (caster level equals inveigler’s character level). Failure by 5 or more means the inveigler has dominated the target as though using the *[[Dominate Monster (Spell)|dominate monster]]* spell (caster level equals inveigler’s character level). Charming falsehood is a sonic, mind-affecting charm effect.

**Abilities:** Int +4, Cha +6.

**Feats:** The inveigler gains [[Improved Feint (Feat)|Improved Feint]] and [[Persuasive (Feat)|Persuasive]] as bonus feats.

**Skills:** The base creature gains a +8 competence bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks and a +4 competence bonus on [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks.

**Special Qualities:** The inveigler retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described here. 

*Hidden Enchantment (Su):* When the inveigler uses any effect or spell that mimics *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]**,* *[[Dominate Monster (Spell)|dominate monster]]*, or any similar effect, spells such as *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* magic that reveals magical effects or determines the truth of the situation work normally. 

*Taken to the Grave (Su):* When *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* is used on the corpse or head of an inveigler, it tells nothing but lies. Only a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell used to mimic *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* can pry the truth from the dead body of an inveigler.

*Truth Be Told (Su):* Magic used to determine whether an inveigler is telling the truth reveals its lies only if the inveigler would wish its words to be construed as a lie. This ability affects even spells such as *[[Discern Lies (Spell)|discern lies]]*, *[[Zone of Truth (Spell)|zone of truth]]*, and more powerful spells such as *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*. Other creatures that are asked about the truth of what an inveigler says can represent the truth normally, so spells such as *[[Commune (Spell)|commune]]* can allow characters to discover the truth, provided the creatures interviewed are privy to that truth.

*Undetectable Nature (Su):* Magical effects used to determine an inveigler’s alignment or true form automatically reveal it to be the same as that of the creature doing the detecting. If the inveigler is aware of the attempt, it can cause the magic to reveal any alignment it chooses. This ability also protects the inveigler from spells that detect only certain alignment components, such as [[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]. It defeats even *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*, but a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell used to learn about the inveigler (even by mimicking a lesser spell) reveals the truth.

*Undetectable Thoughts (Su):* Whenever a creature attempts to detect the inveigler’s thoughts (with a *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* spell, for example), the inveigler is immediately aware of the attempt and can cause the effect to reveal any thoughts it chooses. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell used to mimic *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* or a similar effect reveals the inveigler’s true thoughts.

**GM Note**

**Taken from the Paizo forums:** 

The [[Sense Motive (Skill)|sense motive]] takes place of the initial save, I would say the target gets will saves under the following conditions:

"Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus."

"If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination."

Is an Inveigler's failed Charming Falsehood obvious?

The Inveigler template grants a supernatural ability called Charming Falsehood, which, at first blush, grants a one per day charm attempt using a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check, opposed only by [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]]. As written, it grants no will save - though that should probably be house ruled, but that's how it's written. Failing the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check by more than 5 results in being affected by *[[Dominate Monster (Spell)|dominate monster]]* at the Inveigler's caster level, otherwise failure results in a charm effect.

Now, I know how to deal with a failed casting of a *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]* attempt that isn't Silent and Stilled. That usually results in drawn swords and angry words in any world where magic isn't completely gone. I also know that there isn't a great way to make a person forget that they were Dominated.

The question - at the moment of using Charming Falsehood, based on available information, if the target succeeds on it's [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check, is it aware of the supernatural attempt? Or did it just catch you in a lie, as per usual sword-drawn-angry-words roleplaying?

A creature feels a "hostile force or tingle" only upon succeeding on a saving throw against a spell (or effect that emulates a spell) that both has no visible effects and targeted the creature. Other situations don't give a creature a sense that its been targeted by such an effect. (Also see here.)

This means that when a creature that possesses the template inveigler uses the supernatural ability charming flasehood, and the inveigler creature's [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill check result is less than the target's [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] result, the target feels nothing special: no saving throw was attempted for the creature to succeed on.

However, in such a case—like the question mentions—it is obvious to the targeted creature that the inveigler creature told a lie and that the lie was "one that would cause the target to view the inveigler as a trusted friend or that would make it likely to follow the inveigler’s orders." This may be a tip off either that something's just not right with the inveigler creature ("No, you're not my dad, you weirdo—shut up!") or that the inveigler creature is an inveigler creature if creatures with the template are common enough in the campaign setting to have earned a reputation for outrageous lies that unskilled folks often fall for.

Yes, it is obvious they have lied. And they can retry.

The Inveigler published on the Advanced Bestiary says:

**Charming Falsehood (Su)**

Once per day, an inveigler can tell a lie so convincing that it enchants a single creature that hears it. The inveigler need not be able to see the target of its lie or have line of effect to it, but if the target cannot hear the lie, this use of the ability is wasted. The lie must be one that would cause the target to view the inveigler as a trusted friend or that would make it likely to follow the inveigler’s orders, but it can be as outlandish as the inveigler wishes. If the target hears the lie, it must attempt a [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check opposed by the inveigler’s [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check. A creature that fails this check by less than 5 is affected as though by the charm monster spell (caster level equals inveigler’s character level). Failure by 5 or more means the inveigler has dominated the target as though using the *[[Dominate Monster (Spell)|dominate monster]]* spell (caster level equals inveigler’s character level). Charming falsehood is a sonic, mind-affecting charm effect.

Decieving or Lying while bluffing has a retry condition, so it must be followed:

Retry? If you fail to deceive someone, any further checks made to deceive them are made at a –10 penalty and may be impossible (GM discretion).

If the attempt wasn't obvious, there would be no consequences of being caught lying, the character wouldnt take a -10 on future checks for being a considered a liar.

But they have no way to identify the ability

They know they have been lied to, but they have no way of knowing what ability was that. The Spymaster Handbook Player Companion introduced a new knowledge mechanic called Recall Intrigues:

You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using [[Cleave (Feat)|Cleave]]) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]], [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], or [[Enlarge Spell (Feat)|Enlarge Spell]]), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]] or [[Lightning Reflexes (Feat)|Lightning Reflexes]]), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.

This could be used to identify an extraordinary or supernatural ability used by a class feature, but not those used by a monster. If this monster was known for using that kind of ability (like a siren or nymph), you could try to remember about that by making a knowledge check and use Monster Lore, but this is not the case as this is a template.

Which means they have no way to identify Charming Falsehood as an ability.
