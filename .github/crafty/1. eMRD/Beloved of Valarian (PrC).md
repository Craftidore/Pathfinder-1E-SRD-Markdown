# Beloved of Valarian (PrC)
## Overview
The beloved of Valarian (also

called Valarian’s beloved) are

women who have foresworn

the love of mortals to dedicate

themselves entirely to

the unicorn deity Valarian,

thus fostering a close bond

with unicorns. They normally

come from the ranks of

exalted rangers or druids,

although there have

been paladins and even fighters

who have chosen this path.

Most of Valarian’s beloved are humans,

elves, and half-elves, but halflings, gnomes, and dwarves are not

prohibited.

A beloved of Valarian is a solitary being, shunning civilization.

She retreats to the woods where she maintains few contacts with

the outside world. Because she champions the cause of good, she

calls upon their animal allies to help repel invaders should evil

invade her forest refuge. Her relationship with the unicorn is

nothing less than a partnership forged in light. She has a closer

emotional bond to her mount than she does with her own family

members. Just as she relies on the unicorn, the unicorn relies on

her to help keep its mysteries safe.

All of Valarian’s beloved must be chaste and must dedicate

herself wholly both to good and her unicorn companion.

Should a beloved of Valarian ever willingly couple with a

mortal, the unicorn leaves her company without hard

feelings or regret. Because of

the solitary existence

these women must

endure, it is rare (but

not unheard of ) for Valarian’s

beloved to join ranks with

others. They prefer the companionship

of paladins but

associate with any good characters

during times of trouble.

Under no circumstances will

one of Valarian’s beloved agree to

join with an evil character, and she

barely tolerates neutral characters.

The beloved of Valarian and their

unicorn companions may leave

their forest sanctuaries should

they be needed to fight evil.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the beloved of Valarian

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A beloved of Valarian is

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and

small shields.

Spells: A beloved of Valarian has the ability to cast a small

number of divine spells. To cast a beloved of Valarian spell, the

beloved must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s

level, so a beloved of Valarian with a Wisdom of 10 or lower

cannot cast these spells. Beloved of Valarian bonus spells are

based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a

DC of 10 + spell level + the beloved’s Wisdom modifier. When

the beloved of Valarian gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for

instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level beloved of Valarian), she

gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her

Wisdom score for that spell level.

The beloved of Valarian’s spell list appears below. A beloved of

Valarian prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Call Unicorn (Su): A beloved of Valarian can call a unicorn

to her side. See the Monster Manual for the unicorn’s statistics.

The unicorn appears instantly and serves the character for

life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The

unicorn may be dismissed at any time, although a character

cannot call another until she gains a level in the beloved of

Valarian class. If the unicorn should die before its rider, the

character may call another unicorn companion when she gains

a new level in this class.

A beloved of Valarian can have no more than one unicorn

companion at any given time.

A beloved of Valarian can assign her unicorn companion to

undertake different types of tasks. Particularly useful as a

mount, the unicorn typically will not undergo a quest or otherwise

take on complex burdens without the supervision of the

beloved of Valarian.

Telepathic Bond (Su): A beloved of Valarian can communicate

telepathically with her unicorn companion. This bond

remains in effect unless the character is separated from her unicorn

by a number of miles equal to 100 + the beloved’s character

level.

At 6th level, a Valarian’s beloved can communicate telepathically

with any animal native to her unicorn companion’s home

forest.

Timelessness (Su): Unicorns age very slowly, living for

thousands of years. As long as she remains faithful to Valarian

and has a unicorn companion serving her, a beloved of Valarian

ages just as slowly, the aging process essentially halted.

Ethereal Jaunt (Sp): At 2nd level, once per day, a beloved of

Valarian and her equipment may become ethereal, as the ethereal

jaunt spell cast by a sorcerer of the beloved’s character level. If

the beloved of Valarian is astride her unicorn companion, it is

also affected by this ability. However, if the beloved of Valarian

dismounts or the two otherwise become separated before the

ethereal jaunt expires, the unicorn companion instantly returns

to the Material Plane.

Forest Dweller (Ex):Time spent in the forest alters a beloved

of Valarian’s physiology at 3rd level. She gains a +2 racial bonus

on Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a beloved of

Valarian can react to danger before her senses would normally

allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even

when caught flat-footed.

If the beloved of Valarian already has uncanny dodge from a

different class (rogue, for example), she gains improved

uncanny dodge instead; she cannot be flanked except by a

rogue who has at least four more rogue levels than she has in

this prestige class.

As long as the beloved of Valarian is riding her unicorn companion,

it gains the benefit of this ability as well.

Call Celestial Charger (Su): At 6th level, a beloved of Valarian

can call a celestial unicorn—also known as a celestial charger—

to her side. See the Unicorn entry in the Monster Manual for the

celestial charger’s statistics. If the beloved of Valarian already has

a unicorn companion, Valarian transforms it into a celestial

charger instead of sending his beloved a new companion.

Nature’s Understanding (Ex): At 7th level, a beloved of

Valarian gains a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal, Knowledge

(nature), and Survival checks.

Holy Smite (Sp): Starting at 8th level, once per day, a beloved

of Valarian can cast holy smite as a cleric of her class level. She

may choose to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage

with the holy smite.

Wood Repulsion (Su): Weapons partially or wholly fashioned

from wood have a harder time striking a beloved of Valarian,

as though deflected by some invisible barrier. Attacks made

with such weapons take a –2 penalty. As long as the beloved of

Valarian is riding her unicorn companion, it gains the benefit of

this ability as well.

Mass Baleful Polymorph (Sp): At 10th level, once per day, a

beloved of Valarian can cast a special version of the baleful polymorph

spell that affects all evil creatures within 30 feet of her (as

a 10th-level druid). Affected creatures are transformed into

harmless Diminutive mammals (rabbits, squirrels, or the like) or

Fine vermin (nonthreatening spiders, centipedes, or the like).

All affected creatures are transformed into the same type of

creature. See the baleful polymorph spell description in the

Player’s Handbook for details.
