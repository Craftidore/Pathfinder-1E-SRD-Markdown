# Arcane (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Arcane**

Your family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic. While many of your relatives were accomplished wizards, your powers developed without the need for study and practice.

**Class Skill**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (any one).

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Identify (Spell)|identify]]* (3rd), *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* (5th), *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* (7th), *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]* (9th), *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* (11th), *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* (13th), *[[Teleport, Greater (Spell)|greater teleport]]* (15th), *[[Power Word Stun (Spell)|power word stun]]* (17th), *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [[Combat Casting (Feat)|Combat Casting]], [[Improved Counterspell (Feat)|Improved Counterspell]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]], [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[arcana]), [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]], [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you apply a metamagic feat to a spell that increases the slot used by at least one level, increase the spellâ€™s DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells modified by the [[Heighten Spell (Feat)|Heighten Spell]] feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Magic comes naturally to you, but as you gain levels you must take care to prevent the power from overwhelming you.

*Arcane Bond (Su)*: At 1st level, you gain an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Rules for arcane bonds appear on page 78.

*Metamagic Adept (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell. You can use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 19th level. At 20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane apotheosis.

*New Arcana (Ex)*: At 9th level, you can add any one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to your list of spells known. This spell must be of a level that you are capable of casting. You can also add one additional spell at 13th level and 17th level.

*School Power (Ex)*: At 15th level, pick one school of magic. The DC for any spells you cast from that school increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]].

*Arcane Apotheosis (Ex)*: At 20th level, your body surges with arcane power. You can add any metamagic feats that you know to your spells without increasing their casting time, although you must still expend higher-level spell slots. Whenever you use magic items that require charges, you can instead expend spell slots to power the item. For every three levels of spell slots that you expend, you consume one less charge when using a magic item that expends charges.
