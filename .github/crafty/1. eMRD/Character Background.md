# Character Background
## Overview
Your character has a place in the fictional world of the D&D game. Whether you grew up on a farm, struggled for scraps of bread in an alleyway, or were raised by a pack of magical wolves, you had a life before you started walking the road to adventure. The following backgrounds can serve as inspiration for what your character’s childhood and youth were like.

Each background includes several headers that describe how you can apply it to different parts of your character’s life. Youth: This section describes the typical experiences of a character who grew up in this background. It describes how that background shaped your early life.

**Transition:** Your background represents your past. This section offers two or three ideas on how you left your old life behind and became an adventurer.

**At the Table:** Your background shapes your outlook and your actions. This section discusses how your background might manifest when you roleplay your character.

**ARTISAN**

Apprenticed to a promising artisan, you worked hard throughout your childhood to develop the skills necessary to master your craft and make a good living in the world. Hours spent working in the shop alongside your master watching, assisting, practicing, and slowly gaining expertise in all aspects of your chosen craft allow you to truly appreciate the artistry that goes into every facet of the job. From conceptualization to gathering supplies to working the materials into the desired form and finally to the cleanup at the end of each project, you are proud to have the skills of a true artisan.

**Youth:** Working in your master’s shop was no day at the carnival. Early on, you spent most of your time sweeping and scrubbing fl oors, cleaning tools, carrying supplies, and preparing simple meals so your master could spend his time working on his current project. Each time he gave you a task that seemed meaningless to the actual job at hand, more often than not it proved necessary to achieving his goal. As you completed these tasks, you would quietly watch your master, learning all you could from observation before he gave your next task.

**Transition:** What drove you from the comforting grip of the workshop to the world of adventure? Your motivation could come from within, or events beyond your control might have cast you into the role of an adventurer.

Perhaps the toil of the workshop grew tiresome. You always preferred tales of heroes, monsters, and ancient treasures to your master’s long lectures on responsibility, technique, and craftsmanship. As soon as you had enough money saved, you left your master and took up training in your current class. Your master might still hold a grudge for your desertion; if he is powerful in his community or guild, you can expect trouble from him in the future.

If your master was cruel, life on the road could have been a better option than another year of slaving away in his shop. Underfed, beaten for the smallest infraction, and worked to the point of exhaustion, you didn’t so much leave your craft as escape from it. Alone in the world and penniless, you learned enough to survive and eventually became an adventurer. Perhaps a kindly new master took you in, or you were drafted into military or religious service.

Artisans need peace and stability to make a living. A war, plague, or other calamity could have forced you onto the adventurer’s path. If orcs sacked your home city and burned it to the ground, you could have become an adventurer out of necessity rather than any desire for glory. Perhaps you thirst for vengeance against the cruel tyrant who slew your master and smashed your dreams of becoming a respected artisan with a shop of your own.

**At the Table:** Comment on the craftsmanship of weapons and armor you find. A dwarf craftsman might take the time to wonder at the beautiful carvings on an ancient, abandoned stronghold’s walls. An elf artisan might be arrogant toward human goods. While other members of the party are excited at the magical properties of a sword, you find the excellent quality of its blade and the fine detailed work in its pommel worthy of comment. To you, a dungeon can also be a museum of an ancient civilization’s artwork and craftsmanship.

**ASCETIC**

Sequestered in a convent, monastery, library, or school, you spent your youth in study, contemplation, and refl ection. Through meditation, academic study, or prayer, you honed your passion for knowledge in the fire of your will. Through discipline and perseverance, you still constantly drive yourself to unlock lore, whether it is hidden in ancient texts or religious scripture or revealed through constant meditative practice.

**Youth:** As a child you spent hours retrieving and cataloging tomes and scrolls for older scholars who left you to your own devices once they had the materials they sought. Spending these hours with little supervision, you learned the location of nearly every work stored in the library of the mountain abbey you called home. While at that age you couldn’t fathom the mysteries stored within, you kept a mental tally of those that interested you most. From time to time you would be sent to the kitchen for food, or to wash dishes, or to run any number of errands. Each such excursion away from the library that you had come to call home felt like a test—of your resolve to learn, of your desire to spend time only in the library, or simply of your youthful patience.

**Transition:** A scholar can only learn so much in a library surrounded by books. Your masters ordered you out into the world to experience its wonders firsthand. Having learned everything your masters can teach, you can never return home until your magic or *ki* is strong enough, or until you have surpassed your masters, or you have achieved enlightenment or ultimate arcane or divine power.

Alternatively, a rivalry or power struggle among your masters might have forced you out into the world. Your tutor or sponsor fell into disgrace or disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Without your master around, there was no longer a place for you. You still seek him, or at least to avenge him.

Perhaps rather than simply leaving your order, you were expelled. Scholarship demands innovation and forward thought, but your thoughts were too radical for your elders. Your ideas were deemed dangerous or subversive or heretical, forcing your exile. Maybe you delved into lore too dangerous for mere apprentices, such as spells to summon forgotten gods or bind demons. Perhaps a rival student framed you.

**At the Table:** You know a lot, and you aren’t afraid to show it off. While others might refer to creatures by common names such as “kobold,” “troglodyte,” and “bugbear,” you know the proper classifi cation of each in Old Draconic. If you find an ancient library, a collection of scrolls, or even ancient murals and frescoes that depict myths and prehistorical events, you happily lose yourself in studying them even in the midst of a dungeon.

If you trained as a monk or cleric, the habits, beliefs, and ethos instilled in you by your upbringing play a major role in your life. For example, you might be a vegetarian if your sect forbids the eating of meat, and you aren’t afraid to tell others of the superiority of your diet. You have an old saying or a bit of wisdom for every occasion. When faced with a tough decision, you turn to a religious book or similar manual for guidance. You quote scripture or your master’s sayings to support your arguments and decisions.

**DRIFTER**

Home? What’s that? You spent your entire life on the road, moving from town to town. You get by taking odd jobs, some less savory than others, or performing for a night’s bed and food. People are your stock in trade; your keen understanding of their attitudes, behaviors, and desires keeps you employed and alive. When things go bad, it’s time for you and yours to move on to the next town. Survival has always been your first priority, and you have become quite good at it.

**Youth:** As a child, you spent the majority of your days either on the road or performing odd jobs and running errands for your elders. You put any talents you had to work for you just to get by and perhaps earn a little food or a few spare coins. You might have turned to crime when things became desperate, or you might have resisted all temptation no matter how bad things got.

You could have ended up on the road due to a number of reasons. You might have been separated from your family at a young age due to war or some other disaster. A plague could have left you a sole survivor and driven you from your hometown. Perhaps you grew up in an orphanage and ran away as soon as you were able. Your parents could have been wanderers themselves, so that you never knew any other life, at first being carried on your mother’s back and then later walking beside her.

**Transition:** Moving from the life of a scrounging drifter to that of an adventurer was easy for you. The skills you learned on the roads or in the alleys and taprooms of the world prove useful to any adventurer. Perhaps you managed a heist that scored you enough money to buy you thieves’ tools, a weapon, and some armor. That single windfall was enough to transform you from just another wanderer to a skilled, armed adventurer.

You might have stumbled into the adventurer’s life by accident. Seeking shelter from a storm, you entered a cave that turned out to be a monster’s lair. You managed to slay the beast and afterward helped yourself to its treasure. Your first taste of adventure was frightening and exhilarating (and profi table), and you developed a liking for the activity.

Adventure finds you as often as you find it. Perhaps monsters threaten the area you are traveling through, leaving you with a simple choice: fight, fl ee, or die. Maybe you’ve always tried to help others as you were passing through an area. Now that you’re older, stronger, and more skilled, you can take a more active role in protecting the common folk and helping out where you can.

**At the Table:** You’ve done it all before, and your experience makes you calm in a crisis. When a sudden thunderstorm rolls in, you know how to find shelter. When it comes to surviving in the wilds or making your way through a city, you are a treasure trove of folktales, traveler’s lore, and common sense. Worldly for your age, you aren’t afraid to show off that knowledge in front of others. Sheltered people, those who grew up in far easier circumstances than you, earn your disdain if they can’t keep up with you. You didn’t grow up with much, but you learned to take care of yourself.

**FARM HAND**

Born and raised on the farm, you developed a keen understanding of agrarian life, as well as a strong work ethic. Accustomed to being up at dawn and asleep by dusk, you can track the seasons by touch and smell. You know the satisfaction of cultivating the earth on which you live, and you relish the responsibility of taking care of the animals that you depend on for food, clothing, and companionship. Some might consider this a simple life, but those who have that attitude know very little about how to work with the land or understand the respect necessary to coax it to bear fruit.

**Youth:** As a child, you hung upon the apron strings of those working in the home and hearth. You learned to clean the dwelling in which you lived, as well as cook for those who lived there with you. As you grew older, your daily chores became more complicated and laborious. From splitting and hauling firewood, feeding and cleaning up after the animals, and working the earth to produce the crops you need to live on, you learned every aspect of farm life and grew to appreciate the hard work that was required just to put enough food on the table. In your free time you learned to fish and hunt, supplementing your daily diet with game from the nearby wood or stream.

**Transition:** Shifting from the humdrum life of a farmer to the exciting, deadly path of an adventurer was no easy change for you to make. You left behind generations of tradition to seek the adventuring life. Whether you were pushed into this decision or happily left your family’s fields behind you, you know that you can never go back to that life again.

Life on the farm is never easy, and a cruel, demanding ruler only makes things worse. A distant war, a monarch obsessed with building monuments or enjoying the pleasures of the court, or a few years of insuffi cient rain and harsh winters: All these factors can drive a farmer to seek a better life. Perhaps the peasants and yeomen rose up in rebellion. You were one of the lucky ones who managed to escape when the king’s men razed your village. You learned to handle a weapon in the uprising, and a slain mercenary raider’s weapons and armor became your first set of adventuring gear. Maybe one day you’ll return to avenge your family and friends, but until then you hone your skills.

Alternatively, you might have left the farm of your own free will. Maybe you weren’t in line to inherit any of your father’s land, leaving you with little choice but to seek another option. Too ambitious to stay on the farm, at the first opportunity you headed for a life of adventure. Your family still lives in your old hometown, and maybe you visit from time to time or send them a few coins now and then to help out when the harvest is bad and times are tight.

**At the Table:** You are accustomed to hard work and have little patience for those who are lazy, negligent, or irresponsible. You have toiled for hours under a hot sun to feed your family, and you have no time for those who aren’t willing to put out a similar effort.

When you and your companions enter a rural community, you’re the best choice to serve as your group’s spokesperson. You might not be the most elegant figure in the party, but you know how to talk with ordinary people. Despite the armor you wear, the weapons you carry, or the magic you command, at heart you’re still one of them. Any threat to the common folk is likely to draw a sharp reaction from you.

**GLADIATOR**

Born a slave, you trained from an early age to fight with weapons or magic. Experts were brought in from all over the world to train you and your fellows in various forms of attack and defense, imparting to you a respect for cultures outside your own, as well as their methods of combat. Even as a young child, you were forced to fight in the arena against other children as well as animals not considered a threat to older, more experienced gladiators. Given your innate sense of dramatic fl air, you have come to enjoy the adulation of the crowd, as well as the respect of your peers.

**Youth:** Your daily routine began with a strict regimen of calisthenics followed by training in the pits. Every hour you trained with a different master, each focusing on different methods of fighting and teaching you ways to present yourself with a distinct theatrical air. After a noon meal, you were set to sparring in the arena, focusing on different tactics and scenarios—some meant for the individual and some done in pairs, each gladiator working in tandem with another.

**Transition:** A gladiator revolt allowed you to break free of your masters. In a single night of carefully planned violence, you turned the tables on your captors and made a daring escape. You were one of the lucky ones who made it out alive, but your former masters placed a price on your head. You have run far away, but who knows when a cunning bounty hunter or a vengeful tracker might find you? Thus, you keep to the road. You prefer never to talk about your past, and you make an active effort to disguise your true identity. Anyone who shows an unusual interest in you could be a threat.

Alternatively, perhaps you earned your freedom through your success in the arena. Even so, your past haunts you. Old rivals from your fighting days, relatives of opponents you killed, and cocky young brawlers seeking to make a name for themselves all seek you out with bloody intent. Your fame is an unwelcome burden, just as likely to cause trouble as earn favors.

Once you entered the wide world, you had few skills aside from those you learned in the arena and under the tutelage of the pit masters. Mercenary work didn’t appeal to you, since you’ve already had your fill of demanding masters. As an adventurer, you can risk your life as you choose and for your own profit. Life is much better this way.

**At the Table:** You are an expert on weapons, armor, and fighting styles. When you size up others, you look at them in terms of their fighting ability. You collect trophies from fallen enemies, both to respect the talent they displayed in standing against you and to commemorate your victories. When you face a problem, violence is your preferred solution (soft words and subtle methods never served you well in the arena). Politics are beyond you. There’s no obstacle that can’t be overcome with a swift blow to the head. When it comes time to make plans, you argue for a direct and violent solution.

Your weapons, armor, and other tools of combat are your wards against defeat. You spend time each morning caring for your weapons and gear. A warrior who doesn’t take care of his gear risks losing his next fight, and you always plan to win.

**GUTTERSNIPE**

Born into poverty, you grew up on the streets. When other children went home to their parents, you slept in back alleys and dilapidated abandoned buildings, getting food where you could and making friends and family out of those in similar straits. Those with roofs over their heads and doors to close against the night looked down upon you, calling you a worthless, no-good street urchin. They didn’t understand the kind of skills you possessed, skills that allowed you to find what you needed to survive, whether that was food, drinkable water, or a safe place to sleep.

**Youth:** Living on the streets was tough—dodging bullies and gangs, scrounging for food or standing in line for a daily bowl of soup at the temple, avoiding the heavy hand of the local constables. You were always hungry, but you had the freedom to do as you pleased, and from time to time a generous passerby might give you a few coppers to run a quick errand or deliver a message. You spent a great deal of time dodging a gang of toughs who only seemed interested in making you steal on their behalf. You made up your mind that if you were going to be the one stealing, then you would be the one to pick the time and place, determine what was and wasn’t an acceptable level of risk, and reap the benefi t if you pulled it off.

**Transition:** You couldn’t dodge the gang and the constables forever. Perhaps you bit off more than you could chew in a daring robbery. After that your choice was simple: leave town until the heat died down or die at the hands of the gang’s brutal enforcers. You took to the road and found that your skills worked just as well in other cities as in your own. Adventuring offered you the chance to make a fortune and set something aside for the long term.

Perhaps your burgeoning talents came to the attention of a small band of adventurers who needed an item liberated from a certain wizard’s bedchamber. While they distracted the old mage, you climbed the wall of his tower and plucked an amulet from his armoire. You made a lot of money on that job, and you decided this was the life for you. The victimized wizard might seek you out (whether you are aware of that or not) to avenge his loss. If your past catches up to you, you had best hope that your adventuring companions can help bail you out.

**At the Table:** Old habits die hard. You’re accustomed to scrounging for basic necessities, so you tend to keep extra supplies on hand—you never want to go to sleep hungry again. When you have spending money, you have trouble holding on to it. A few nights in a sumptuous inn, seven-course meals, and other luxuries leave you ready to strap on your equipment and head back into the world for another adventure. You live for the day and cast aside worries, long-term plans, and the like. That doesn’t mean that you are foolish or reckless, just that you appreciate the finer things in life. To you, it’s obvious that you should put off hard work till tomorrow when there’s strong drink and good food to enjoy today.

**MARINER**

With a salty breeze in your hair and a hardwood deck underfoot, you spent your life in a constant search for whatever lay over the endless horizon of the sea. You loved the sea and all the dangers that life aboard a sailing vessel offered. Above all, you enjoyed the freedom that you had on such a ship: freedom to travel the world, and freedom from the laws that govern the people living on land.

**Youth:** As a young sailor aboard a ship, your life was filled with work. Cleaning and repairing the ship took up the majority of your time. You also spent a fair amount of time on watch, keeping a lookout for other ships that could have hostile intent. In rare moments when you were not working, you were free to enjoy the passing sea, to sing songs and learn an instrument from another crew member, or to take lessons in navigation from the captain or first mate whenever they had time to give them. You spent time fishing, working in the galley with the ship’s cook to prepare meals, or even practicing swordplay with the master of arms in case another ship attacked yours.

**Transition:** Life as a mariner is almost the same as life as an adventurer. You must face terrible monsters, venture into unknown territories, and stand ready to fight for your life at a moment’s notice.

Perhaps a terrible storm capsized your ship. You were lucky enough to make it to shore in a strange land, but you have no idea what happened to the rest of the crew. To make ends meet, you put your skill with weapons or spells to good use. For now, you adventure to earn enough coin to survive (and, if you strike it rich, someday buy your own ship). You want to discover what happened to your shipmates. Perhaps the storm had a sinister origin, and even now an unknown enemy plots against you.

A run-in with pirates might have sent you on the path to adventure. You were captured and separated from your crewmates. You managed to escape, and now you have sworn to find and free your comrades. Perhaps your family owned the ship you served upon, and now you must rescue your brothers and sisters, parents and cousins. You have no idea where to begin your search, but you hope that over the course of your adventures you can find some clue to their location.

**At the Table:** You use nautical terms in everyday conversation. Your weapon is a cutlass rather than a scimitar. You drink rum rather than ale. You know a lot about ships and boats, refer to others as landlubbers or scalawags, and never turn down the chance to take a sea voyage. You’ve been to dozens of ports around the world, and you love to talk about your exploits in each one. You have amassed a wealth of knowledge, tall tales, and stories. If your group fights a medusa, you might recall legends about a similar creature that haunts the waves. When you enter a port city, you prefer to stay near the docks and visit taverns where you can find other sailors and ask them for news from across the seas.

**NOBLE SCION**

Born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you knew very little about living a common life. No matter what your interests, you had the best instructors. You had servants and soldiers who jumped to do your bidding and ensure your safety. The only higher authority you had to answer to was your family—particularly your parents, who were so busy with the administration of your birthright that they left your education and upbringing to trusted servants.

**Youth:** You toured the countryside from the back of a pillow-laden carriage, sipping freshly squeezed fruit juice from an ice-chilled carafe. You spent entire days taking lessons in the warmth and comfort of your personal chambers. When you were not pursuing your own education, you diverted yourself with games, music, theater, and flirtations. You attended elegant parties dressed all in silk, with properly coifed hair and manicured nails. Above all, you spent countless hours at the court, observing your parents preside over those who served them, settle disputes, pass edicts, and hand down judgments. Some would say that you were blessed from birth, but you believed that the simple fact of your presence bestowed a blessing on others.

**Transition:** Leaving behind an easy life of costume balls, servants, and rolling estates, you took up life as an adventurer. After all, the luxuriant life of a noble depends on one thing: money. If your family managed to lose its fortune (perhaps through a rival’s machinations, perhaps through simple mismanagement), you must now fend for yourself in the world. If you took up the study of magic, or spent long hours working under the tutelage of a swordmaster, you already have the skills needed to become an adventurer. What once served as an amusing diversion became the primary skill you need to return your family to prominence.

Your family’s fall from grace could be more sinister in nature. Your father might have betrayed his liege or sold out to a foreign power. When his scheme was uncovered, your family was stripped of its title, wealth, and land. You must travel in secret or venture far from home, because the mere mention of your name is enough to incite a hostile response in your countrymen. Perhaps your father was innocent and an enemy engineered his fall. The real villains managed to disgrace and destroy a force for justice; you adventure to restore your family’s good name and avenge your losses.

Alternatively, perhaps you were the youngest in your family, and therefore you were not in line to inherit your family’s fortune. You were expected to join the clergy or follow some other respectable vocation. Horrifi ed at the prospect of a life of boredom, you rebelled and set out on your own. Your family might have agents searching for you, so you must travel incognito. You care nothing for your family’s money and now see your old life as a suffocating burden. You only want to wander the road, defying the politics and the social responsibilities of the station that demands your return.

**At the Table:** You are used to fine food and comfortable accommodations. While you fancy yourself tough enough to live an adventurer’s life, you miss the comforts of home. When on the road, you would rather spend a night in an inn with a hot bath and a warm meal than rough it under the stars. You can’t help but complain about the poor food, the sour wine, and other minor indignities that you must endure. It’s beneath your dignity to whine, but sometimes you let others know that their best falls short of your expectations. You admire those whose accomplishments earn them the right for you to consider them your peers, but the sense of entitlement and arrogance that has been ingrained in you since childhood sometimes bubbles to the surface.

**SOLDIER**

From the earliest age you can remember, you were a servant in the army of your lord. You drilled to march, you drilled to fight, and you even drilled to bathe and eat. Every waking moment was utilized to its maximum potential, and you kept moving with one purpose or another as long as daylight lasted. Learning to fight, cleaning weapons and armor, and taking care of the cavalry’s steeds were only a few of the tasks that greeted you each day. No task assigned was meaningless or trivial, and all of them could be accomplished with a sense of honor and pride in knowing that you served an organization whose purpose was much larger than yourself.

**Youth:** As a child you spent your days cleaning. Everything needed to be cleaned twice a day, from pots and pans to the horses’ bridles to your quarters and sleeping mat. Everything was checked and rechecked to make sure it was tended properly. As you grew older, your responsibilities also grew. You were set to repairing practice dummies, patching uniforms, and (when fortune favored you) exercising the horses. Additionally, as you continued to grow older and taller, you began to train with various weapons, becoming skilled in their use through almost constant repetition and practice.

**Transition:** A soldier’s life is an ideal training ground for adventuring. Your knowledge in weapons, armor, and tactics serves you well. Perhaps the prospect of another year of taking orders, cleaning stables, marching in formation, and obeying your offi cers grew tiresome; as an adventurer, you can do what you want, when you want. Perhaps you defied an unjust order and deserted rather than commit a war crime. Now you must dodge press gangs, bounty hunters, and old comrades if you want to keep your freedom.

Your old military unit might have been destroyed in battle, leaving you aimless and alone. Common labor or some other peaceful trade proved too boring and mundane for you. Since you only know how to fight, an adventurer’s life was the best fit for you. Although you enjoy your new life, your past still haunts you. Your unit’s old enemies still seek you. Your surviving comrades might (wrongfully) blame you for their defeat. Perhaps your unit’s destruction was no accident of war. Instead, someone wants you and your old comrades dead, and that individual has the ways and means to hunt you down one by one.

**At the Table:** You have a story about a battle you took part in for almost every occasion. You can’t help but argue from an expert’s point of view, and at times you are too dismissive of those who lack experience in your eyes. You cry out orders in battle, shouting advice and encouragement to your comrades. Part of you thinks that you simply know better than everyone else when it comes to combat, but you also feel a strong attachment and a sense of camaraderie with those who fight alongside you. You want to do everything in your power to keep your fellow adventurers safe.

**TRIBAL ORIGIN**

Born among the people, you were raised by the members of your extended family, all of whom participated in your upbringing to one extent or another. Your mother taught you to gather food and cook, your father taught you to hunt and fi sh. Your grandfather taught you to treat hide and make weapons, and your grandmother taught you the history of your people. Everyone had his or her place at home, and you experienced times of both joy and sorrow with all your kin.

**Youth:** As a child, your activities changed each day based on the needs of your people. Some days you gathered food with your mother, and others you stalked through the underbrush in pursuit of prey with your father. Your tasks depended on what was needed at the time, and you were productive for at least a few hours each day. You also spent a good deal of time in play—swimming with and running races against your siblings and cousins, practicing the use of weapons for hunting and defense from your enemies, and playing elaborate games meant to sharpen your senses and strengthen your body. From time to time you were even asked to stand watch and keep an eye out for the goblins that liked to attack your encampment without warning.

**Transition:** The road from your tribe’s home territory to the heart of civilization was a long and arduous one. Perhaps you took to it freely, when the lure of cities and towns proved too strong. Perhaps the transition was violent and sudden, when a slave trader, raiding party, or other force from the outside world swooped in and plucked you from your home.

If you willingly left home, you could have felt a strong sense of wanderlust from an early age. You always wanted to know what lay over the mountains. The outside world seemed so much more interesting than your humdrum existence, especially when the tribal elders told you stories of the great cities that stood beyond the horizon. Perhaps an old adventurer of the tribe, a warrior who had ventured into the world and returned years later with great treasure and renown, stoked your imagination with the tales of her adventures. As soon as you were old enough, you hired on with a passing caravan and ventured into the world.

Events could have forced you from home. While you were out hunting one day, a gang of slavers captured you and sold you into the service of a rich merchant. After years of toil, you escaped and now run free. While part of you wants to return home, civilization has proven too intriguing to leave behind. You remain one step ahead of the slave lord’s bounty hunters, and by improving your skills in weapons and magic you hope one day to foil their pursuit once and for all. Perhaps the slave lords destroyed your village and you have no home to return to. You remain in civilization to grow in power until you can avenge your people one day. Once you have slain the slave lords and burned their fortress to the ground, you can found a new village peopled by those you free from their chains.

**At the Table:** You always compare the character of civilization to that of your people and find it wanting. You are fond of quoting your grandmother’s sayings to drive home this point. Civilized folk lie, cheat, and steal from each other, actions that would doom a tribe in the wild. You see civilized folk as soft and complacent. Few of them have stalked a beast in the wild, and fewer still have fought off a dire wolf or displacer beast attack. Your origin sets you apart, but it makes you stronger, tougher, and more cunning than the soft-bellied folk of the cities. While you might be ignorant of civilization and its customs, you are by no means a fool.
