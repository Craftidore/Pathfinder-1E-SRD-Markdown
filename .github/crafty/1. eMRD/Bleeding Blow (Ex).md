# Bleeding Blow (Ex)
## Overview
*Bleeding Blow (Ex)*: When she uses her [[Powerful Blow (Ex)|powerful blow]] rage power, the barbarian also deals bleed damage equal to her bonus damage with the powerful blow. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. A barbarian must have the [[Powerful Blow (Ex)|powerful blow]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
