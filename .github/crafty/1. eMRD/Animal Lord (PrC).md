# Animal Lord (PrC)
## Overview
For an animal lord, a humanoid form is simply an accident

of birth. In spirit, he belongs with the wild pack of wolves,

the running herd of horses, or the dancing school of

fish. His nearly hairless, two-legged form is a hindrance

to being one with his true kind, but it is a hindrance he

can overcome.

Each animal lord forms a bond with one group of animals.

Apelords, bearlords, birdlords, catlords, horselords,

sharklords, snakelords, and wolflords all exist. Animals

in his selected group accept an animal lord as a kindred

soul and a leader. They offer him their support, and he

watches over them in turn.

Individual animal lords approach their calling in

different ways. Some are simple defenders of their kind,

content to live as part of the natural cycle of predator and

prey. Others, believing that nature’s creatures are meant

to guard and ultimately improve this world, use their

gifts to do good. Still others lead their animal brothers

and sisters down a path of selfishness or vengeance.

Barbarians, rangers, and druids are the most likely

characters to adopt this class. Barbarians prefer the more

physically powerful options, including apelord, bearlord,

and horselord. Rangers gravitate toward the stealthier

selections, such as catlord and wolflord. Most birdlords

are druids with the ability to use wild shape, but druids

are equally likely to select any type of animal to bond

with. Some scouts, rogues, and even rare monks find

this path rewarding as well. Among the races, elves and

half-elves are the most common examples of animal lords

due to their close bond to nature.

A character can choose this prestige class more than

once but must select a different group of associated

animals and start at 1st level each time. Levels of different

animal lord classes do not stack when determining

level-based class features.

Adaptation: Customize this class for your campaign

by associating each variety with a specific race or culture.

Sahuagin (malenti) and evil aquatic elves make

natural sharklords, for example, while plains-dwelling

humans would be most appropriate as horselords. Eight

animal lord types are presented here, but you can easily

create others appropriate to your campaign, such as the

sewer-dwelling ratlord, the gnoll hyenalord, or even the

aquatic squidlord. Alternatively, you could subdivide

existing groups (creating rival tigerlords and lionlords,

for example). Use the examples below as templates when

creating a new animal lord.

Hit Die: d10.

**CLASS FEATURES**

All of the following are class features of the animal lord prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Animal lords gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Animal Bond (Ex): An animal lord develops a bond

with animals of his selected group (see below). He gains

a +4 bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks

made to influence animals from his chosen group. If

an animal lord has the animal companion class feature,

he adds his animal lord level to his effective druid level

for the purpose of determining his animal companion’s

bonus Hit Dice, special abilities, and so forth.

The eight groups of animals included here, along

with examples taken from the *Monster Manual*, are as

follows.

*Apelord*: ape, baboon, dire ape, monkey.

*Bearlord*: black bear, brown bear, dire bear, polar bear.

*Birdlord*: eagle, giant eagle\*, giant owl\*, hawk, owl,

raven.

*Catlord*: cat, cheetah, dire lion, dire tiger,

leopard, lion, tiger.

*Horselord*: horse (all), pony, warpony.

*Sharklord*: dire shark, shark

(all).

*Snakelord*: constrictor, giant constrictor,

viper (all).

*Wolflord*: dire wolf,

wolf.

\*These creatures are included

even though they

are not of the animal type.

Detect Animals (Sp):

Beginning at 1st level, an

animal lord can detect the

presence of any animals of

his selected group at

will, as if using

*detect animals*

*or plants* with a

caster level equal

to his class level.

Wild Empathy (Ex):

An animal lord can improve

the attitude of an animal. See

the druid class feature, page 35

of the *Player’s Handbook.* If an animal

lord has wild empathy from another

class, his levels stack for determining the bonus.

First Totem: At 2nd level, an animal lord gains a +4

bonus on checks made with a specific skill, determined

by his selected group as follows. *Apelord:* Climb; *Bearlord:*

Intimidate; *Birdlord:* Spot; *Catlord:* Move Silently;

*Horselord:* Jump; *Sharklord:* Swim; *Snakelord:* Escape Artist;

*Wolflord:* Survival.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, an animal lord

gains low-light vision, allowing him to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and

similar conditions of shadowy illumination. He retains

the ability to distinguish color and detail under these

conditions.

If an animal lord already has low-light vision from

another source (such as his race), his low-light vision

improves, allowing him to see three times as far as a

human in conditions of shadowy illumination.

Wild Aspect (Su): At 3rd level and higher, an animal

lord can take on an aspect of the animals of his selected

group. Assuming a wild aspect is a swift action that does

not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions

and Immediate Actions, page 137). Unless otherwise

noted, the effect lasts for 1 minute per level. An animal

lord can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one

additional time per day for every three levels gained after

3rd (twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at

9th level).

When an animal lord reaches 7th level, his wild aspect

becomes more powerful, as described below.

If an animal lord has the wild shape ability, he can

spend one daily use of wild shape to assume his wild

aspect instead (the duration is as normal for the wild

aspect). If an animal lord already has a natural attack of

the type gained by his wild aspect, use whichever damage

figure is superior while the wild aspect is active. If an

animal lord wields a weapon while using his wild aspect,

he can use the natural attacks gained as natural secondary

weapons if he uses his weapon as a primary attack,

provided they are still available (an apelord couldn’t use

a secondary claw attack, for example, if he wields a twohanded

weapon).

*Apelord:* An apelord gains two primary claw attacks.

Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for

Small apelords). If an apelord hits an opponent with both

claw attacks, he rends the foe for an additional 2d4 points

of damage (or 2d3 points for Small apelords), plus 1-1/2

times his Strength bonus. At 7th level, the claw damage

increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small apelords)

and the rend damage to 2d6 points (or 2d4 points for Small

apelords).

*Bearlord:* A bearlord gains two primary claw attacks.

Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for

Small bearlords). If a bearlord hits with a claw attack,

he can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. The bearlord still follows

all the other normal grappling rules. At 7th level,

the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points

for Small bearlords).

*Birdlord:* A birdlord grows feathery wings, allowing him

to fly at his base land speed (average maneuverability).

At 7th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per

level.

*Catlord:* A catlord gains two primary claw attacks.

Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for

Small catlords). If a catlord charges, he can attack with

both claws at the end of his charge. At 7th level, the claw

damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small

catlords).

*Horselord:* A horselord’s speed, as well as the speed of

any horse upon which he rides, improves by 10 feet for

a duration of 1 hour per level. At 7th level, the speed

increase improves to 20 feet.

*Sharklord:* A sharklord gains a devastating bite as a primary

natural attack. The bite deals 1d8 points of damage

(or 1d6 points for Small sharklords). A sharklord also

gains the ability to breathe water while his wild aspect

is active. At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 2d6

points (or 1d8 points for Small sharklords).

*Snakelord:* A snakelord gains a poisonous bite as a

primary natural attack for 1 round per level. This bite

deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small snakelords).

The poison’s Fortitude save DC is 10 + animal lord

level + Con modifier, and it deals initial and secondary

damage of 1d3 points of Constitution. At 7th level, the

bite damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for

Small snakelords), and the initial and secondary poison

damage increases to 1d4 points of Constitution.

*Wolflord:* A wolflord gains the scent ability (see page

314 of the *Monster Manual*) for 10 minutes per level. At

7th level, the duration increases to 1 hour per level.

Speak with Animals (Sp): Beginning at 4th level,

an animal lord can use *speak with animals* (as the spell)

once per day to converse with animals of his selected

group.

Summon Animal (Sp): Beginning at 5th level, an

animal lord can summon one or more animals of his

selected group once per day. This ability functions identically

to *summon nature’s ally V*, except that an animal lord

can summon creatures only from his selected group, as

detailed below. The duration of the effect is 1 minute per

class level.

*Apelord:* 1d3 dire apes or 1d4+1 apes.

*Bearlord:* 1 polar bear, 1d3 brown bears, or 1d4+1 black

bears.

*Birdlord:* 1d4+1 eagles, giant eagles1, giant owls1, hawks,

ravens, or owls.

*Catlord:* 1 dire lion, 1d3 tigers, or 1d4+1 lions.

*Horselord:* 1d4+1 heavy horses, heavy warhorses, light

horses, light warhorses, ponies, or warponies.

*Sharklord:* 1d3 Huge sharks2 or 1d4+1 Large sharks2.

*Snakelord:* 1 giant constrictor snake, 1d3 Huge vipers,

or 1d4+1 constrictor snakes or Large vipers.

*Wolflord:* 1d4+1 dire wolves or wolves.

1 May be summoned only by nonevil birdlords.

2 May be summoned only into an aquatic or watery environment.

**Second Totem:** At 6th level, an animal lord gains a bonus feat related to his selected group, even if he doesn’t meet the prerequisites. If the animal lord already has the feat, he can choose any other feat for which he meets the prerequisites. *Apelord:* Brachiation; *Bearlord:* Improved Grapple; *Birdlord:* Flyby Attack; *Catlord:* Lightning Reflexes; *Horselord:* Trample; *Sharklord:* Improved Critical (bite); *Snakelord:* Improved Initiative; *Wolflord:* Improved Trip.

**Animal Growth (Sp):** Once per day, an animal lord of 7th level or higher can use *animal growth* on a single animal from his selected group as a swift action as a spellcaster of his class level. This ability otherwise functions just like the spell.

**Animal Telepathy (Su):** Beginning at 8th level, an animal lord can converse telepathically with any animal of his selected group that he can see within 100 feet.

**Third Totem:** At 10th level, an animal lord gains a permanent 2-point increase to one of his ability scores, determined by his chosen animal group as follows. *Apelord*: +2 Strength; *Bearlord*: +2 Constitution; *Birdlord*: +2 Wisdom; *Catlord*: +2 Dexterity; *Horselord*: +2 Constitution; *Sharklord*: +2 Strength; *Snakelord*: +2 Charisma; *Wolflord*: +2 Strength.
