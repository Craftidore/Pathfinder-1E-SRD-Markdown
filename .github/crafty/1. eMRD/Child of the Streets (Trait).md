# Child of the Streets (Trait)
## Overview
**Child of the Streets**: You grew up on the streets of a large city, and as a result you have developed a knack for picking pockets and hiding small objects on your person. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks, and [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] is always a class skill for you.
