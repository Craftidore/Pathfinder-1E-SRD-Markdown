# Acrobat (Trait)
## Overview
**Acrobat**: Having trained from a young age, you’re capable of amazing feats of daring. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks, and you take only a –2 penalty instead of the normal –5 penalty when using the [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] skill to attempt an accelerated climb.
