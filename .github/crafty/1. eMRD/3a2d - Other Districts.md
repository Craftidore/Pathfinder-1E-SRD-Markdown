# 3a2d - Other Districts
## Overview
**Other Districts**

**Cartways:** A series of tunnels lies under the city. Before the Great Revolt, the city’s wealthy used these old kobold mining tunnels for their private highways, and noble revelers used them to travel to and from Stross-sponsored Winter Festival parties in the underground cavern called Winter Hall. Although the city has officially closed the Cartways, thieves, smugglers, gangs, and undesirable residents use the tunnels to conduct business or lair within them.

**Collegium:** As its name suggests, this district’s greatest feature is Zobeck’s famous Arcane Collegium. Lada’s Temple of the Celestial Dawn is its other great landmark. Scholars, scribes, mages, students, and alchemists frequent this district and gather at the Hedgehog tavern or peruse the shelves at the Book Fetish.

**Docks:** Also called the Gullet—and one of the busiest areas of the Free City—the Docks along the Argent River are the center of the city’s trade, slightly eclipsing the Great Northern Road. Its wharves, alleys, and thoroughfares see traffic from merchants, bargemen, and stevedores at all hours. Its taverns, gambling dens, and bordellos stand beside warehouses, dry docks, and other industries of the water trade. Brawls are common, and the Watch heavily patrols the area to ensure the smooth continuation of commerce.

**Lower Zobeck (Ashmill):** Ashmill is home to the Free City’s poor and unskilled working classes, though a few merchants like the Kappa family have purchased large chunks of space here near the Moon Temple and the shrine to St. Charon (Charun). Lower Zobeck also houses the Wheatsheaf tavern, a favored drinking hole for smugglers and rogues. Merchants selling foodstuff, livestock, and spices do brisk business in this district.

**Market District (Vineyard District):** Merchants selling carpets, cloth, leather, wine, weapons, alchemical powders, poisons, goods from other lands, and even otherworldly goods from the Realm of Shadow hawk their wares from tiny stalls in this district. Most anything can be found for sale here.

**Merchant District:** Weavers, cobblers, coopers, carpenters, jewelers, armorers, and other skilled workers maintain shops lining this district. Some of their wares are sold in the Market District, supplementing their income, but these artisans generally work to order and have enough orders to keep them busy. Many merchants reside in the upper levels of their shops, though the wealthier ones have residences in Upper Zobeck.

**Temple District:** Temples to the Free City’s five main deities—Lada (her largest temple in Zobeck is here), Perun, Rava, Volund, and Porevit and Yarila (the Green Gods)—comprise the extent of this district. The structures surrounding the temples house their staff or store goods and livestock to support the clerics.

**Upper Zobeck:** The Free City’s government centers, including the Council Hall, City Archives, the Redrock Bailey (jail), and the Civic Courthouse, cluster in this district. The opulent, painted-brick houses of the city’s richest and oldest families stand in the Crown Square portion of the district, where the great Old Stross Clock tolls the hours.
