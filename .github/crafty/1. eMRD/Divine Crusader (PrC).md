# Divine Crusader (PrC)
## Overview
The divine crusader

embodies devotion and

dedication to a chosen

deity. Even more than a

cleric, the divine crusader

serves as a symbol of a

specifi c aspect of his deity’s

portfolio, such as fi re, good,

knowledge, or war. They

serve as elite godservants,

carrying out

the deity’s will and furthering

the deity’s aims.

Paladins make good divine

crusaders, as do clerics (particularly

those of martial-minded

deities). However, characters

of many other classes fi nd great

spiritual rewards from the path of

the divine crusader, including fi ghters,

barbarians, monks, rangers, and

rogues.

NPC divine crusaders typically

work side-by-side with others who

share their devotion, such as clerics or other divine crusaders.

They get along well with other crusaders who share

the same deity (even if their chosen domains differ), and

some even ally themselves with divine crusaders who

share a domain but not a deity, though alignments must

be similar as well (divine crusaders of Corellon Larethian

and Gruumsh don’t get along, even if both have chosen the

War domain).

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: The divine crusader

gains no weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Aura (Ex): The power of a divine crusader’s alignment

aura (see the *detect evil* spell on page 218 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*) is equal to her class level, plus any class levels

in other classes that possess such an aura (such as cleric or

paladin).

Deity and Domain: Every divine crusader has a chosen

deity. Sample deities are provided on Table 3–7: Deities,

page 32 of the *Player’s Handbook,* and also in Chapter 5 of

this book. A divine crusader’s chosen deity infl uences heralignment,

what magic she can perform, her values, and how

others see her. The character’s alignment and her deity’s

alignment must match exactly.

A divine crusader chooses one domain from among

those offered by that deity to his or her clerics and gains the

granted power of the domain. (If the domain granted power

includes the addition of a skill or skills to the cleric class

skill list, add it to the class skill list for the divine crusader

instead.) The divine crusader also gains the ability to cast

spells from that domain (see below).

Spells per Day: A divine crusader casts divine spells. She

may only prepare and cast spells from her chosen domain

(see above). Effectively, a divine crusader has a class spell list

of only nine spells (one per spell level).

To prepare or cast a spell, a divine crusader must have a

Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The diffi

culty class for a saving throw against a divine crusader’s

spell is 10 + the spell level + the divine crusader’s Cha modifi

er. The divine crusader also gets bonus spells based on her

Charisma.

A divine crusader prepares and casts spells as a cleric, except

that she cannot spontaneously cast *cure* or *infl ict* spells.

Electricity Resistance (Ex): A divine crusader gains

resistance to electricity 5 at 3rd level. At 9th level, this

increases to resistance 10.

Weapon Specialization: At 5th level, a divine crusader

gains Weapon Specialization in her deity’s favored weapon

as a bonus feat.

Acid Resistance (Ex): A divine crusader gains resistance

to acid 5 at 6th level. At 9th level, this increases to resistance

10.

Darkvision (Ex): A 7th-level divine crusader gains

darkvision out to 60 feet. If the divine crusader already has

darkvision, the radius of her existing darkvision increases

by 30 feet.

Perfect Self: At 10th level, a divine crusader completes

her transformation into a creature of the planes. Her type

changes to outsider (native). As a native outsider, the character

can still be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just

as other living creatures can be, and remains native to the

Material Plane. Additionally, the divine crusader gains

damage reduction 10/magic.

EX-DIVINE CRUSADERS

A divine crusader whose alignment changes to no longer

match her chosen deity’s alignment loses all divine

crusader spells and abilities. She may not progress any

farther in levels as a divine crusader. She regains her

abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her

violations (see the *atonement* spell, page 201 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*).

An ex-divine crusader cannot change her devotion to a

different deity in order to regain abilities and advancement

potential. Once a divine crusader has failed one deity, no

other deity trusts the character with these powers.
