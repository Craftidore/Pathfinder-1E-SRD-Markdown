## Overview
**Life Lessons**

You have discovered the secrets of magic can be found in every part of life.

**Benefit:** When you gain a new level of wizard, you gain 2 additional spells known (in addition to the 2 spells known learned by all wizards at each level). These additional spells known can not be of the highest level of spell you can cast, and can not be from your opposition school (if any).
