# Elysium (Plane)
## Overview
**Elysium (Chaotic Good)**

A vast land of untamed wilderness and wild passions, Elysium is the plane of benevolent chaos. Freedom and self-sufficiency abound here, personified in the azatas native to the plane. In Elysium, selfless cooperation and fierce competition clash with the violence of a raging thunderstorm, but such conflicts never overshadow the lofty concepts of bravery, creativity, and good unhindered by rules or laws.

Elysium has the following traits:

- **Divinely Morphic**: Deities with domains in Elysium can alter the plane at will.
**- Strongly Chaos-Aligned and Strongly Good-Aligned
**- **Enhanced Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities with the chaotic or good descriptor are enhanced.
**- Impeded Magic: Spells and spell-like abilities with the lawful or evil descriptor are impeded.
