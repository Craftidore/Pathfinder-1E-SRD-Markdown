# Spellbane
## Overview
**Spellbane**

You know how magic spells work... and how to disrupt them.

**Benefit:** When you deal hit point damage to a target with a spell or spell-like ability, as a swift action you may choose to use the damage to disrupt that target. The damage dealt by the spell counts as “continuous damage” for that target’s spellcasting and concentration checks. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Int modifier.
