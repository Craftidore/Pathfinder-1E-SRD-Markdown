# Lovesick (Drawback)
## Overview
**Lovesick:** Your love for another occupies your every thought, and you become despondent when you are away from that person. The person is chosen by your GM (with consideration to your roll on Table 1—56: Romantic Relationships if you used the background generator). At the start of each day, if you are away from this person you take a —2 penalty on initiative checks and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. If you ever lose or fall out of love with this person, exchange this drawback for the [[Doubt (Drawback)|Doubt]] drawback.
