# Ooze School
## Overview
**Ooze School**

**Associated School**: transmutation. 

**Replacement Powers**: The following powers replace the physical enhancement, telekinetic fist, and change shape abilities of the transmutation school. 

*Ooze Mind (Su):* You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against mind- affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. This bonus stacks with other such bonuses. 

*Ooze Touch (Sp):* Your arm transforms into a slimy pseudopod (as a swift action), allowing you an immediate melee touch attack on any target within your standard reach +5ft. The attack does 1d4 hp acid damage +1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier. 

*Ooze Form (Sp):* At 8th level, you can change your shape for a number of rounds equal to your wizard level. These rounds need not be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like *ooze shape I*. You can also move through and among all creatures with the ooze subtype without suffering any harm. At 12th level, ooze form functions like *ooze shape II*.
