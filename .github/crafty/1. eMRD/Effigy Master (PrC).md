# Effigy Master (PrC)
## Overview
Fascinated by the animating force of life itself, the effi gy

master is an expert in the imitation of true life. Through long

study and experimentation, he learns to infuse his creations

with a pseudolife far more resilient and vital than that which

animates similar creations of other spellcasters. The effi gy

master brings to life sculptures made of clay, snow, wax, or

mud, and uses this ability to create guardians, defenses, and

even companions and cohorts. At the same time, the effi gy

master continues to study the secrets of magic, albeit at a

slower pace.

Effi gy masters are often wizards who seek the knowledge

of imparting life to nonliving elements as a means to create

loyal minions that don’t require much maintenance. Sorcerers

also sometimes become effi gy masters, although they

generally don’t pursue the class for long.

NPC effi gy masters are unusual individuals. Some sell

their services to wealthy lords or merchants who desire

retinues of absolutely loyal guards who cannot be charmed

or bought. Others are experimenters who indulge in the

process of creating pseudolife to satisfy their own curiosity

and inquisitiveness. A few are bitter and spiteful loners who

delight in creating mockeries of the living or seek to attain

power by replacing those who have what the effi gy master

desires.

Adaptation: Those who really enjoy the concept of the

effi gy master might wish the prestige class offered more

than fi ve levels of advancement. It would be a simple enough

matter to extend the class for fi ve more levels, continuing the

implied progression in all areas. This means the class should

gain an ability at 7th and 9th levels, at least, and perhaps

another ability at 10th level. The 7th-level ability could allow

new effi gies to be created more cheaply. The 9th-level ability

could further improve an effi gy’s attack, damage, and saving

throws by an additional +1. The fi nal ability (in return for not

gaining +1 caster level at 10th level) might allow the effi gy

master to possess an effi gy once per day for up to 10 minutes

in a manner similar to the *magic jar* spell.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become an effi gy master, a character must fulfi ll

all the following criteria.

Skills: Craft (leatherworking, metalworking, or woodworking)

10 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft

5 ranks, Use Magic Device 2 ranks.

Feat: Craft Wondrous Item.

Special: Must have the *simulacrum* spell on a class spell

list, whether or not the character is able to cast it.

Class Skills

The effi gy master’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

(all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and

Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the effi gy master

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Effi gy masters gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each class level after

1st, an effi gy master gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the

prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and

so on). If he had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming an effi gy master, he must decide to which class

to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Craft Effi gy (Su): An effi gy master can create constructs

known as effi gies (see page 151). Unlike other creators,

he need not possess the Craft Construct feat to complete

this task, nor does he need the feat or ranks in Knowledge

(architecture and engineering) to repair an effi gy he creates

(see page 151 for details on repairing an effi gy). An effi gy

master can add his class level to his caster level to determine

the maximum Hit Dice of effi gy that he can create.

Crafting an effi gy requires a body to be built from wood,

leather, metal, and wire. This requires a DC 15 Craft (woodworking,

leatherworking, or metalworking) check. The gp

and XP required to create the effi gy depends on its size, as

described on page 155.

Improved Effi gy (Ex): An effi gy master of 3rd level or

higher can improve upon his creations, granting them a

permanent +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, damage,

and saves. This requires one day of work and costs 100 gp of

supplies per Hit Die of the effi gy to be improved, but has no

XP cost.

Effi gy Link (Su): At 5th level and higher, an effi gy master

can create a supernatural bond between himself and one of

his effi gies. This requires a 1-hour ritual. Afterward, the effi gy

master can sense the effi gy’s condition (as if he had cast *status*

on the effi gy), and can scry on the effi gy (as if casting the

*scrying* spell) once per day.

Furthermore, an effi gy master gains a +1 morale bonus on

saving throws and caster level checks as long as he is within

5 feet of his bonded effi gy.

An effi gy master can be linked to only one effi gy at any

time. If the linked effi gy is destroyed, or if the effi gy master

wants to establish a new link, he can create a link to another

effi gy (and eliminate the old link) by performing the ritual

with the new effi gy.
