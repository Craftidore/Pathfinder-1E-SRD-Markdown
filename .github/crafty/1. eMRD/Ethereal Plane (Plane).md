# Ethereal Plane (Plane)
## Overview
**Ethereal Plane**

The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] and often other planes as well. The [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct; colors blur into each other and edges are fuzzy. While it is possible to see into the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] from the Ethereal Plane, the latter is usually invisible to those on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]]. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]], and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, insubstanial, and utterly silent to someone on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]].

The Ethereal Plane has the following traits:

**- No Gravity
**- **Alterable Morphic:** The plane contains little to alter, however.
**- Mildly Neutral-Aligned
- Normal Magic: Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]]. The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings; these can cross from the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] to the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]] must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based spells. While it’s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]], the reverse isn’t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the [[Material Plane (Plane)|Material Plane]], including force attacks.
