# Mathematical Prodigy (Trait)
## Overview
**Mathematical Prodigy:** Mathematics has always come easily for you, and you have always been able to "see the math" in the physical and magical world. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
