# Stronghold Spaces for Vehicles
## Overview
The stronghold space system provides an easy, modular method for creating or adding to a stronghold structure. The same system with a few modification (mostly in size and cost) works with vehicles, especially ships. All spaces on a ship are usually much smaller than a similar space in a castle would be.

**List of Components**

The following is an alphabetical list of stronghold components for vehicles.
