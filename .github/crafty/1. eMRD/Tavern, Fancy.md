# Tavern, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 4,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Three servants

This place serves wine as well as liquor and beer from its polished, marble-topped bar. It can call on the strongholdâ€™s kitchen for food; alternatively, you can attach an extra kitchen assigned purely to this component. The tables are round, with solid chairs, and there are a few booths lining the walls. Three servants (Com1; [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] \[bartender] +5) run the bar and serve meals.

The cost of this component does not include any food or drink. See Food, Drink, and Lodging for prices.

The tavern can seat up to 20 people. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
