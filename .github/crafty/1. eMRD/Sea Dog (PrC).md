# Sea Dog (PrC)
## Overview
*“Yaarrggghhhhh!”*

Whether crewing a pirate sloop, a merchantman, or a man o’ war, the

sea dog is at home on the deck or in the rigging of any ship, large

or small. The endless oceans hold a myriad of dangers, from lethal

storms to enemy warships crewed by orcs, slavers, and worse. The sea

dog makes it his business to deal with these threats and ensure he

and his crew make it to their next port of call.

Becoming a Sea Dog

Nearly any martial character can enter the sea dog class with little

trouble. Corsairs, fighters, and rangers are the most common sorts

of candidates, but barbarians make excellent sea dogs as well. Other

characters can enter this class, but the high base attack bonus means

a much later entry for rogues, assassins, and other non-warrior

characters.

**Base Attack Bonus:** +6.

**Skills:** Acrobatics 3 ranks, Climb 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks

**Feats:** Pearl Diver, Rope Monkey, or Sea Legs

Class Features

The sea dog class grants many abilities that allow these characters

to shine while on board a ship. Close quarters gives the sea dog a

decided edge when fighting in the tight environment of ship-to-ship

combat, while the favored ship ability rewards constant service on a

particular vessel. Although many of these class features are intended

for nautical adventures, the sea dog can use many of his abilities on

land or in more traditional adventuring environments. Superstitious

grants a useful defense mechanism, while recognize omen allows the

sea dog to react before his enemies can draw their weapons.

Close Quarters (Ex)

The sea dog is skilled at fighting in tight quarters amidst a press of

opponents or in the narrow corridors of a ship’s hold. Whenever he

is adjacent to at least two other creatures or when he is squeezed,

the sea dog gains a +1 competence bonus on all attack and weapon

damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level,

and finally +4 at 10th level.

Superstitious (Ex)

Sea dogs are a superstitious lot. Each sea dog cleaves to some strange

set of beliefs about what actions and events can spoil a person’s luck.

Generally, a sea dog’s superstitions are little more than a curious

preoccupation with forces beyond his control, but occasionally, a sea

dog can put his superstitious nature to good use. As an immediate

action, he may add his class level as an insight bonus to one saving

throw. Until the end of his next turn, the sea dog takes an insight

penalty equal to his class level to all attack rolls.

Favored Ship (Ex)

Starting at 2nd level, the sea dog gains a special familiarity with a

particular vessel. When he gains this class feature, select one particular

ship—usually the ship the sea dog sails. While on board this ship,

he gains a +1 competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Profession

(sailor), and Stealth checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level,

and +4 at 8th level. Should the favored ship be destroyed, the sea dog

may select a new ship when he gains his next sea dog level.

Iron Gullet (Ex)

At 3rd level the sea dog gains an iron gullet, developed during years

spent drinking befouled water and eating suspect food. He gains

a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves made against poison

and disease.

Batten down the Hatches (Ex)

Beginning at 6th level, the sea dog learns how to prepare for the

worst. Whenever he readies an action, he may make one additional

attack of opportunity per round. This extra attack of opportunity is

in addition to any extra attacks gained from the Combat Reflexes

feat and is subject to the same limitations.

In addition, as an immediate action, the sea dog may forfeit a provoked

attack of opportunity to add 1 + his Wisdom modifier (minimum

+1) to his Armor Class until the end of his next turn.

Recognize Omen (Ex)

At 9th level, the sea dog may spot omens around him to lend insight

into the future. As an immediate action, he may attempt a DC 15

Wisdom check. If the check succeeds, the sea dog’s initiative count

functions as if he had rolled a 20. If the check fails, his initiative count

functions as if he had rolled a 1. The sea dog must wait 5 rounds

between each use of this ability.

Using Sea Dogs

The sea dog prestige class presents an option for veteran sailors and

characters seeking to specialize in seafaring adventures. To fully

realize this class, candidates should serve as crew on a particular

ship or own a ship themselves. The vessel can serve as a mobile

base of operations allowing sea dogs and their allies a great deal of

flexibility when undertaking adventures in far-flung lands. Stripping

a ship from a sea dog does hamper the character’s abilities, but not

in significant ways.

Sea dog NPCs can represent a wide range of characters, from ship’s

captains and their first mates to experienced crewmen. They might

be vicious pirates or noble swashbucklers, cunning freebooters or

bloodthirsty buccaneers. Sea dogs can also represent experienced

merchants, slavers, and just about anyone else who has made a life

at sea.

Adapting the Sea Dog

The sea dog works well in just about any campaign setting and

requires no adaptation for use outside of the World of Freeport. For

campaigns that don’t heavily feature water-based adventures, you

could alter the prestige class to represent a caravan master, replacing

the favored ship class feature with a favored mount or vehicle. The

sea dog class can also represent old hands on aircraft, if your games

include such vessels, with no adaptation at all.
