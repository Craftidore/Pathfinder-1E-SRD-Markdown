# Comtemplative (PrC)
## Overview
For any servant of a deity, no joy is greater than at those rare

moments when the presence of her patron deity is a real, tangible

force, sending shivers of power through her body and

sending her soul soaring. For some, the taste of this experience

is such a powerful attraction that they begin devoting

their lives to cultivating it, hoping to attain greater closeness

to their deity through a life of contemplation. Spending

hours in prayer and meditation, these devoted followers

purify their souls, making them worthy of closer contact

with the divine. While some contemplatives withdraw from

the world into private retreats, others remain active, even

adventuring, fi nding that true nearness to their deity comes

from living out the deity’s will in the world. In return, they

fi nd their minds, bodies, and souls purifi ed, perfected, and

fi nally brought close to union with their deity.

Rather than devoting their lives to a deity, some contemplatives

strive to conform themselves to some other abstract

principle, such as an alignment. Their mission is no less

divine than that of contemplatives devoted to a deity, and

their methods substantially the same. Many such contemplatives

live as itinerant philosophers, teaching their doctrines

in schools or in the marketplace as they travel

from city to city, hoping to enlighten the masses.

Most contemplatives are clerics, though

paladins are also often drawn to the mystic’s

journey. Members of other classes rarely

have suffi cient devotion to a deity or

philosophy to choose this course.

An NPC contemplative

might be a reclusive hermit,

a church leader, or a passionate

champion of her

deity. Such a character

might have something a

group of player characters

needs—a holy relic, a bit

of sacred lore, or simply a

higher-level spell than the

clerics in town can cast.

Adaptation: Central

to this prestige class is the

notion of gaining power

through meditation and

prayer. Perhaps only certain

deities reward their followers

in this specifi c way, or

maybe only clerics who don’t

worship a deity are eligible

to become contemplatives

because they aren’t tied to specifi

c tenets of faith. Finally, the

fl avor of this prestige class and the

fl exibility of the bonus domain class

feature make it a good choice if you want

a prestige class to represent a change in worship

from one deity to another.

Hit Die: d6.

ll all the following criteria.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class

features of the contemplative

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi -

ciency: Contemplatives gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells

Known: A contemplative who was

previously a spellcaster continues to

gain access to more powerful divine

magic while following the contemplative

path. Thus, when a new contemplative level

is gained, the character gains new spells

per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in the spellcasting class she

belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does

not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that

class would have gained (improved chance of controlling

or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so

on). This essentially means that she adds the level of contemplative

to the level of whatever other spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly.

For example, if Theresa, an 11th-level cleric, gains a

level as a contemplative, she gains new spells as if she had

risen to 12th level as a cleric, but uses the other contemplative

aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus

and save bonus. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making

her a 12th-level cleric/1st-level contemplative, she gains

spells as if she had risen to 13th level as a cleric.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class

before she became a contemplative, the player must decide

which class to assign each level of contemplative for the purpose

of determining divine spells per day and spells known.

If the contemplative did not previously belong to a divine

spellcasting class, she gains the ability to cast divine spells

exactly as a cleric of her patron deity. Her spell progression

is the same as that of a cleric.

Bonus Domain: Upon adopting the contemplative

class, and again at 6th level, a character gains access to a

bonus domain of her choice. The character can choose any

domain made available by her deity or alignment. The character

gains the granted power associated with the domain

she chooses, and can select the spells in that domain as her

daily domain spells.

Divine Health (Ex): A contemplative has immunity to

all diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy rot

and lycanthropy.

Slippery Mind (Ex): At 2nd level, a contemplative gains

the ability to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise

control or compel her. If a contemplative with resistant

mind is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving

throw, one round later she can attempt her saving throw

again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed on her

saving throw.

Divine Wholeness (Su): At 3rd level and higher, a

contemplative can heal her own wounds, in addition to any

other healing ability she may have. She can heal up to four

times her contemplative level in hit points each day, and she

can spread this healing out among several uses.

Divine Body (Su): At 5th level, a contemplative becomes

immune to poisons of all kinds.

Divine Soul (Su): At 7th level, a contemplative gains

spell resistance. Her spell resistance equals her class level

+ 15. In order to affect the contemplative with a spell, a

spellcaster must roll the contemplative’s spell resistance or

higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster’s level.

Eternal Body (Ex): After achieving 9th level, a contemplative

no longer suffers ability penalties for aging and

cannot be magically aged. (Penalties she has already suffered

remain in place.) Bonuses still accrue, and the contemplative

still dies of old age when her time is up.

Mystic Union (Su): At 10th level, a contemplative

becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an

outsider (native) rather than a humanoid for the purposes of

spells and magical effects. Additionally, the contemplative

gains damage resistance 10/magic.
