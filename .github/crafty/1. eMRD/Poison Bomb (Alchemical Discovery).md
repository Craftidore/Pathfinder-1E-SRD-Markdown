# Poison Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Poison Bomb\*:* The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist’s bomb duplicates the effects of *[[Cloudkill (Spell)|cloudkill]]* instead of *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]*, filling an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.
