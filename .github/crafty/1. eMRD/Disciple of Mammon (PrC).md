# Disciple of Mammon (PrC)
## Overview
“Almighty Mammon, lord of lust and king of covetousness, I call

upon your great might to get what I want. I prostrate myself before

you and your relentless power. Bring me my heart’s desire.”

—Zbavra the Witch-Queen

The disciple of Mammon takes what she wants any way she

can. She is quick to betray her friends and allies to get ahead,

and she will put herself in an embarrassing or awkward position

if it ultimately leads to what she wants. The disciple of

Mammon has no honor, no shame, and no scruples. Her

abilities help her not only to lie, cheat, and steal, but also to

avoid danger at the expense of others.

Evil rogues and bards sometimes become disciples of

Mammon, particularly those who are more interested in

stealing than killing.

Disciples of Mammon generally operate alone. Although

they might join a guild or operate with allies, disciples of

Mammon betray their companions so quickly that they

soon develop a poor reputation. For this reason, among

others, Mammon’s disciples are often on the move, one step

ahead of those they have betrayed, cheated, and robbed.

Goblinoid creatures are sometimes drawn to the service of

Mammon—as is the occasional evil dragon (usually one

that deals with the outside world, not a remain-in-its-lair

sort of dragon).

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of

Mammon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Mammon

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no

type of armor or shields.

Lie (Su): A disciple of Mammon gains a +4 competence

bonus on Bluff checks and spell resistance of 11 + disciple

level against spells that reveal falsehood, such as zone of truth

and discern lies, even when spell resistance is normally not

allowed (such as with discern lies).

Cheat (Sp): Once per day per class level, a disciple of

Mammon can produce an effect identical to that of a cheat

spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Thief (Ex): A 3rd-level disciple of Mammon gains a +4

competence bonus on Pick Pocket and Open Lock checks.

Steal (Sp): A 3rd-level disciple of Mammon can call a

single unattended object weighing no more than 5 pounds

to her as if using telekinesis. This functions as the spell cast by

a 15th-level caster.

Divert Attack (Ex): Three times per day, a 4th-level disciple

of Mammon can maneuver events so that an opponent’s

melee attack meant for her is actually directed at

another character within the attacker’s reach. The new

target must also be a foe of the attacker. If there is no such

foe within reach, the maneuver fails.

Summon Osyluth (Sp): A 5th-level disciple of Mammon

can summon 1 osyluth once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Take Object (Ex): A 6th-level disciple of Mammon gains

a +4 competence bonus on attempts to disarm a foe, and she

draws no attacks of opportunity for making an attempt

unarmed.

Enhance Value (Ex): By careful, slight modifications, a

7th-level disciple of Mammon can increase the value of a

nonmagical item of value, such as a gem, an art object, or a

piece of equipment. The disciple spends 1 hour performing

these modifications and then makes an Appraise check,

increasing the value of the object by 1% per point of the

check result. A disciple of Mammon cannot enhance something

with a readily obvious value, such as a coin, and she

cannot enhance the same object twice.

Divert Spell (Ex): Once per day, an 8th-level disciple of

Mammon can maneuver events so that an opponent’s spell

targeted on her is actually targeted at another instead. The

new target must be within range and must also be a foe of

the attacker. If there is no such foe within reach, the maneuver

fails.

Nondetection (Sp): A 9th-level disciple of Mammon can

constantly produce an effect identical to a nondetection spell

cast by an 18th-level caster. This ability cannot be dispelled,

but it can be suppressed.

Summon Gelugon (Sp): A 10th-level disciple of Mammon

can summon 1 gelugon once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by an 18th-level caster.
