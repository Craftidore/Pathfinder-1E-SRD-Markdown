# Forced Reincarnation (Hex)
## Overview
*Forced Reincarnation (Su)*: The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately *reincarnated* into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
