# Slippery Mind
## Overview
*Slippery Mind (Ex):* This ability represents the rogue’s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

*Slippery Mind (Ex):* A rogue with this talent can wriggle free from that which would otherwise control or compel her. If the rogue is affected by a mind-affecting spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again at the start of her next turn at the same DC. This ability only gives the rogue one extra chance from to succeed on her saving throw against each mind-affecting effect. At 15th level, the restriction of only one extra chance no longer applies.

Instead, at the start of the rogue’s turn, if she is still subject to any mind-affecting spells or effects, she can make a Will saving throw with a standard DC for the effect’s level, and if she succeeds at the save, she is no longer subject to the mind-affecting effect. She can even make this saving throw against mind-affecting effects that normally don’t allow a saving throw. In those cases, generate the saving throw DC as if the spell or effect did allow a saving throw. The rogue must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.
