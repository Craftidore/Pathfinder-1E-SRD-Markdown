# 3d2 - School of Illumination Magic
## Overview
**School of Illumination Magic**

The school of illumination includes the study of star and shadow magic, which is unknown outside the Free City of Zobeck and a few elven wizards, who regard it as more of a curiosity than anything else. Indeed, it is considered a quirk of Zobeck to call it a separate school at all. More properly called the school of illumination, it is closely related to illusion and tangentially related to creation, conjuration, and necromancy, but it stands apart from all of them.

**The Nature of Illumination**

Star and shadow magic uses the power of the Shadow Realm to generate spell effects, in the same manner that elementalists use the various elemental planes to generate their magic. Its spells create force effects, light and shadow spells, and limited forms of divination and magical compulsion.

But all this misses the point. The school of Illumination is a mystery much like Summoning, Divination, and Abjuration. Its practitioners believe that its wellsprings of power come from an understanding of the stars, their alignments, and the power they give an arcanist over every living creature.

All star and shadow spells belong to the Illumination school.
