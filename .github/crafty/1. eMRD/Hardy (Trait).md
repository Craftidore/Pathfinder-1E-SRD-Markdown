# Hardy (Trait)
## Overview
**Hardy**

You are made of tougher stuff than the average person, but you're not quite as quick to react to dangerous effects.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on Reflex saves.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might see their physical prowess as normal and look down on less hardy individuals, or they might see it as their duty to play the role of protector and help those less able to endure physical hardship.
