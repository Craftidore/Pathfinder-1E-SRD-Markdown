# 3l - The Free Cantons of the Ironcrags
## Overview
Dwarves think of their canton first, their race or clan second. The canton is home and hearth, family and wealth, and safety from an uncaring world. These traits do not guarantee greater harmony or joy among cantonal dwarves than among other races. Indeed, cantonal dwarves are notoriously dour, fractious, and opinionated about everything. Cantonal dwarves unify only in the presence of some external threat, which gives their elders and the leaders of their Free Companies an excuse to go on about the importance of the Free Dwarven Cantons to the younger generation.

The Ironcrag cantons currently number 14, each defined by a settlement existing at least 100 years that contains both free and cloistered dwarves, and that encompasses a set of halls—not just mines and simple shelter. Proper halls include a set of forges or smelters, a brewery, a set of clan homes, and at least one temple or shrine. The total population of the cantons is difficult to determine (dwarves are reticent to count their numbers, or at least to share those numbers with anyone outside their own canton). The best guesses say the cantons hold as many as 150,000 dwarves and perhaps 25,000 slaves outside Grisal—most of whom are human.

The 13 settled cantons are Bareicks, Bundhausen, Grisal, Gunnacks, Hammerfell, Juralt, Kubourg, Nordmansch, St. Mishau, Templeforge, Tijino, Vursalis, and Wintersheim. Some of the cantons have three names: one in the Trade Tongue, one in the Southern speech, one in the Dwarvish speech of the Northlands.

Other cantons besides the 14 constantly rise and fall and are not counted among the official settlements. Most notably, the small settlements of Roglett and Mynnasgard have been inhabited for about 50 and 80 years, respectively. They are not yet established enough to merit mention among the cantons, but they are on their way to that status. The former canton of Citadel (Friundor) lies mostly abandoned, although gold has been found there recently, drawing prospectors, priests, and the curious back to its halls. Also abandoned are the Fallen Halls of Sargau, Villershall, and Volund’s Beard.

The dwarven cantons all lie in the Ironcrags, although varying altitudes and passes make some much more accessible than others, and a few are separated from the main cantons by lowlands and rivers inhabited by humans. The two outliers are Wintersheim to the north, and the dark canton of Grisal, which stands across the River Argent near the Morgau and Doresh border.

Each of the Free Cantons is a nation within its own valleys, with its own customs, rulers, and traditions. The major cantons are larger and more settled, their insignia more widely known outside the mountains. The smaller cantons are equally as distinctive, but isolated or obscure for reasons of landscape, history, or by the preference of its people. Here are the most important of places of the peaks.

## The Free Cantons of the Iron Crags
**The Free Cantons of the Iron Crags**

**Symbol:** Each canton has its own symbol

**Ruler:** Each canton chooses its own leaders

**Important Personages:** Oreschelli van Bund, Clan Voice of Bundhausen (LN female dwarf bard 16); Enzali Hackel, Dwarflord of Grisal, Defender of the North (LG male dwarf sun paladin 12 \[Khors]); Nanneli Gunnacks, Clan Mother of Gunnacks (LG female dwarf oracle 6); Jostli Shmeid, Chief Smith of the Halls of Hammerfell (LG male dwarf expert 12); Martili Vordrashi, Marshalling Master of Tijino (LN male dwarf fighter 11); Herma Heid, High Vaer of Kubourg (NG female dwarf cleric 15 \[Ninkash]); Baldereik Norensen, Dragon Master of Wintersheim (LG male dwarf magus 12); Toveli Rogest, master of Templeforge (LG male dwarf cleric 20 \[Volund]); Hrothvengr (CE male young adult white dragon)

**Population:** 310,000 (130,000 dwarves, 160,000 humans, 20,000 goblins)

**Great Gods:** Volund (patron god), Thor-Perun, Khors, Lada, Ninkash

**Trade Goods:** Iron, weapons, armor, beer, cheese, leather, wool, adamantine, mithral, gold

## Bundhausen
**The Dwarfmoot Canton**

**Ruler:** Oreschelli van Bund, Clan Voice of Bundhausen (LN female dwarf bard 16)

**Population:** 24,000 (22,000 dwarves, 2,000 humans)

This is the central canton, located above Lake Soizal. Centuries ago, it was an elven mountain retreat called Liadmura. The dwarves built half their city on the surface, and that section serves as both a powerful hub of trade and as the home of the canton’s yearly Dwarfmoot (see page 71). Cantons gather for the annual Dwarfmoot to air grievances, make new laws, administer justice between cantons by common vote, and (at times) declare war or negotiate peace with outsiders from the lowlands (which is everything outside the Ironcrags).

The elven towers and dwarven piles of mine tailings make for a strange landscape in Bundhausen, as does the small set of docks and fishing boats for the lake, but the dwarves seem comfortable with the alpine lake and meadows. The days of the Eagle Emperor of the elves are gone, but his winged emblem and his flowered knot symbol can still be seen around the canton. Likewise, the griffons that the elves brought to the region still hunt its peaks, and they are quick to snatch up unguarded sheep, mules, or ponies.

Bundhausen is the canton most open to embassies and petitions from outside, and many humans (mistakenly) assume it is the capital of the cantons, or that it speaks for all halls.

## Grisal
**The Black Canton**

**Ruler:** Enzali Hackel, Dwarflord of Grisal, Defender of the North (LG male dwarf sun paladin 12 \[Khors])

**Population:** 44,000 (22,000 dwarves, 12,000 humans, 10,000 goblins)

Disputed by both the Grand Duchy of Dornig and the undead-ruled Principality of Doresh, Grisal lies on the eastern bank of the River Argent. The folk of Grisal are among the most pious of the cantonal dwarves, with special emphasis in worship placed on Volund and his son, the solar god Khors, as well as Grajava the Shield Maiden and both Wotan and Perun.

Fully one-tenth of the canton’s dwarves are clerics, paladins, or servants of the temples in some fashion. Grisal’s priests are kept busy, since its halls stand above the Zombie Wood of Zwargau and within sight of the Great Temple of the Red Goddess, where the dead are brought to serve the living.

For the most part, the Black Canton strives merely to keep the undead at bay. From time to time, though, its younger warriors mount raids against Doresh, slaughtering zombies and skeletons by the score during daylight and return across running water before nightfall. Those who fail to return are sometimes seen again as black-armored servants of the Red Goddess Marena (see page 260).

Grisal’s large human and goblin population dates from the times before it was a canton, when it was ruled as part of the Grand Duchy of Dornig by elfmarked members of House Hirsch-Dammung. The dwarves took the territory to prevent it from falling into the hands of Prince Lucan of Morgau and Doresh. The elfmarked nobles of the Grand Duchy, and the Imperatrix Regia Moonthorn Kalthania-Reln vann Dornig herself, have stated that they do not acknowledge this claim, and this argument has been the source of repeated border skirmishes between Grisal and the Grand Duchy.

## Gunnacks
**The Mule Canton**

**Ruler:** Nanneli Gunnacks, Clan Mother of Gunnacks (LG female dwarf oracle 6)

**Population:** 39,000 (27,000 dwarves, 12,000 humans)

One of the few cantons to have kept a king until recent times, Gunnacks is the hearth and home of the exceedingly numerous Gunnacksen clan, merchants and caravaneers of note who travel from Wolfheim to Siwal and the Rothenian Plain. They are travelers unlike any others, with young dwarves learning to drive mule teams before they fully grow their beards. The Gunnacks canton (some still refer to it as a clanhold or kingdom out of habit) is traditional in all other ways, but its people were among the first to travel south from the old halls in the North. As a result, their new halls possess the finest locations in the Ironcrags, with upper halls looking out over three beautiful valleys below, fine rivers and easy passes to both north and east, and plentiful forests and iron, limestone, and mineral deposits. The Gunnacks have it so good, quip the other cantons, they have no reason to leave home. But leave home they do.

The Gunnacks journey from their idyllic home to trade and barter and see the world, and then (when they are wealthy enough) to settle down and have enormous numbers of children. The worth of a Gunnacks canton dwarf is measured by his or her offspring, and so (despite its great wealth) the Gunnacks canton constantly demands food, clothing, and goods of all sorts to raise ever-more Gunnacksens. Some even speak of splitting the canton in two, although nothing has come of it so far.

## Hammerfell
**Canton of the Forge**

**Ruler:** Jostli Shmeid, Chief Smith of the Halls of Hammerfell (LG male dwarf expert 12)

**Population:** 15,000 (14,000 dwarves, 1,000 humans)

One of the great iron working halls, Hammerfell recently withdrew into itself, sealing the hall doors for an entire summer. This is often a sign that the withdrawn canton is fighting a war against creatures from the depths, although sometimes it signals that work is at a critical phase in some new feat of forgecraft, engineering, or item enchantment. Dwarves outside of Hammerfell do not yet know the cause for the canton’s silence.

Some might guess that its dwarven name of Mazzot (literally “hammer”) refers to its warriors, but traditionally, Hammerfell is a place of great armorers and weaponsmiths, and its smiths create suits of the finest dwarven plate armor. Some of its shields bear magic runes, where others display magic blazons, such as heraldic animals that can be summoned to serve their bearers. These magic shields are called Hammershields and their creation is both a long tradition and entirely a secret of the canton.

## Kubourg
**The Cheesemaker’s Canton**

**Ruler:** High Vaer of Kubourg (NG female dwarf cleric 15 \[Ninkash])

**Population:** 25,000 (9,000 dwarves, 13,000 humans, 3,000 goblins)

Called Friunsgorla in Dwarvish, Kubourg is a great castle on the surface, built atop a small hill and surrounded by verdant fields. Unlike the Bareicks or Vursalis folk, the Kubourgers are not merely herders for the sheep and cows, but also the Ironcrags’ butchers, cheesemakers, and leatherworkers. They breed fine donkeys, mules, and dogmoles (see Midgard Bestiary) and are purveyors of jewel-toned inks and black powder.

The Kubourgers settled rich valley bottomland rather than orebearing land, and have earned their gold through trade for generations. In addition, they have cornered the hops supply, making themselves critical to the brewing of stout dwarven beer. Their priestesses of Ninkash brew the canton’s finest holy ales. All of these factors make them one of the wealthier cantons.

Outsiders sometimes ask why their neighbors do not overrun the shepherds, merchants, and cheesemakers of Kubourg. The dwarves of Kubourg might not mine much ore, but their arquebuses and heavy crossbows keep greedy neighbors at bay, and their money buys them many friends. The fact that the Dwarfmoot halls of Bundhausen stand across the lake also might discourage the wilder clans from raiding Kubourg too often, for fear of legal retribution at the next Dwarfmoot.

## Tijino
**The Gateway Canton**

**Ruler:** Martili Vordrashi, Marshalling Master of Tijino (LN male dwarf fighter 11)

**Population:** 18,000 (11,000 dwarves, 7,000 humans)

The southernmost free canton is Tijino, not far north of the royalist canton of Melana and the human city of Triolo. It is known for ironwork and weapons sold to humans, gnomes, and anyone else with money to pay, and also as a source of good wood for spears, ax hafts, and crossbows. The great hall of Tijino is a springtime gathering point for Free Companies, who sell their services to Friula, Valera, Triolo, and the feuding cities of the South. “When we cross Tijino Pass” is roughly equivalent to “when we go raiding” in the argot of the Ironcrags.

## Wintersheim
**The Dragon Canton**

**Ruler:** Baldereik Norensen, Dragon Master of Wintersheim (LG male dwarf magus 12)

**Population:** 22,000 (18,000 dwarves, 4,000 humans)

Northernmost of the cantons, Wintersheim keeps close ties with Stannasgard and the clan-centric—”the kingly cantons”—lands beyond the Ironcrags. The Wintersheim dwarves are famous for the ranger society they formed (the Order of the White Wolf) as well as for the quality of their jewelry and runecarving. Ancient lore of the North is kept alive in their records, and the sagas are faithfully copied for temples and the libraries of the wealthy.

Beyond that, though, Wintersheim is famous for its dragon, Hrothvengr, a white dragon of middle years tamed by the Wintersheim dwarves. He guards the entrance to their hall on an enormous bed of copper coins and odd little pebbles, and seems to be a bit dimwitted (even for a white dragon), since he is convinced his hoard is worth a great deal. The other cantons have tried magic, various drugs and poisons, and even simple bribery to convince other dragons to take similar positions guarding their halls, but thus far none have succeeded. Hrothvengr is treated with respect by the Wintersheim dwarves. Visitors who mock the dragon are punished soon enough, since Hrothvengr casts *charm person* on those he feels are insufficiently awed by his wealth and status. Some of these charmed thralls stay for years, helpfully shining copper coins to a warm, red glow.

## The Minor Cantons
**The Minor Cantons**

**Populations:** Bareicks, population 3,500 (2,500 dwarves, 500 humans, 500 goblins); Juralt, population 10,000 (8,000 dwarves, 2,000 humans); Nordmansch, population 7,500 (all dwarves); St. Mishau, population 4,500 (4,000 dwarves, 500 humans); Templeforge, population 9,000 (5,000 dwarves, 4,000 humans); Vursalis, population 8,300 (6,000 dwarves, 1,800 humans, 500 goblins)

**Bareicks:** The smallest of the cantons, known mostly for the poverty of its mines and the wealth of its sheep and cattle herds, such a strong image of the canton that all dwarven herders are assumed to hail from Bareicks. The canton includes several densely forested lowlands. In addition, the most dangerous mercenaries in the Ironcrags hail from Bareicks. With nothing to lose and no interest in going home unless they’re wealthy or dead, the Bareicks berserkers earn their fearsome reputation. The death of a Bareicks berserker is reason enough for his canton companions to break camp and carry him home the next day.

**Juralt:** The warm lowlands of the Juralt Valley are surrounded by a ring of peaks that border some of the finest pasture land in the Ironcrags. The canton is defended by swarms of half-tamed griffons (fed by the dwarves, but not ridden into battle), and by mountain troops who are bolstered by the canton’s powerful pike walls and its battle wagons. The Juralt dwarves are among the most warlike of the canton dwarves, raiding the lowlands every other year. This has not endeared them to their neighbors or trading partners. Despite their great reputation as mercenaries, they are considered a reckless and greedy bunch, more interested in plunder than in proper mining and smithwork.

**Nordmansch:** The dark black pine forests of Nordmansch are home to two settled halls: Upper Nordmansch, which lies under the peak called the Sentinel, and Lower Nordmansch, located in the heart of the forested hills. The two settlements are friendly rivals, and their trades include silver, iron, and mithral mining, the making of enchanted steel, and the forging of magical rings. Nordmansch dwarves have kept alive more of the dwarven rune magic and lithomancy than any other canton, and the Ordenn forest is a place of enchantments. It is also one of the best sources for pine, yew, and ash in the Ironcrags, and many of the timbers bracing dwarven mines hail from those black woods. Nordmansch axes are especially prized, both for lumbering work and for war.

Nordmansch is the only canton that does not take and hold slaves among its people, and it takes little wergeld for blood feuds. Other dwarves believe this is due to the Nordmansch dwarves’ reverence for the Golden Goddess Lada, whose healing arts they revere as much as the sterner words of Wotan and Volund.

**St. Mishau:** The strange little canton of St. Mishau leaves its neighbors scratching their beards in wonder. All female dwarves within the canton are cloistered—none emerge to make war or serve in the great forges. Most cantonal dwarves consider this restriction at least slightly bizarre, perhaps even a bit sinister. The male dwarves of St. Mishau speak with a strange accent, and they serve in Free Companies only every five or six years. The rest of the time, they mine adamantine, cartloads of coal, a few enormous gems, and quicksilver and other alchemical materials from hidden little mines.

Some claim the dwarves of St. Mishau are servants of Mammon, of St. Charon, or of some dark fey goddess, but these are surely tales spread by jealousy and envy. The dwarves of St. Mishau trade with kobold merchants from Zobeck, which others consider dishonorable at best.

**Templeforge:** Sometimes still called by its Southern name of Favgia Baselgia, the holy ground of Templeforge is also the home of the dwarven airship, since the maker of the first such ships was a priest of Volund who lived here. Lift gas is mined here and new ships are built every 20 years or so to replace lost ones, but the industry remains a tiny one: very few can afford the sums required to keep an airship flying.

The canton makes its reputation as a place of pilgrimage, since Volund’s Hammer rests within the Temple of the Sacred Hammer here. The god used this sacred hammer to make the first gearforged and imbue it with life. As a result, pilgrims from Zobeck, Magdar, and the Septime Cities are a common sight, and dwarven smiths of all kinds make a point to visit Templeforge for a blessing at least once a decade or so.

**Vursalis:** The snowiest of the cantons, boasting the peaks of Mount Mergansar, the Kronhorn, and the Peshvai Glaciers on its crown, Vursalis is also a breadbasket canton. Although it has great deposits of copper and salt, the Vursalis fields of barley, wheat, and potatoes are well tended enough to feed some of its neighbors. The work is not considered especially noble or pleasing to the dwarven ancestors, and so most of the planting and harvest is done by slaves captured in war by the Juralt canton (and bought as thralls) and also by the youngest of the Vursalis canton dwarves.

The canton’s elders ensure that young dwarves learn the traditional ways of mining, worship, and the history of the canton. A law prevents them from leaving the fieldwork for the mines, merchant caravans, or mercenary companies until the youngsters pass a test of knowledge and dwarven deportment. Young dwarves resent this law, but it does ensure the fields are well tended and the lessons well learned.

## The Lost Halls
**The Lost Halls**

Not all cantons thrive. The Golden Citadel of Friundor, Krongard, Sargau, Villershall, and Volund’s Beard were abandoned for one reason or another. Friundor’s gold made it wealthy, but it fell when the gold ran out. Sargau was destroyed from below by ghouls and derro, though its halls remain celebrated in song and story. Krongard held the western approaches to the Ironcrags, but was leveled by the mages of Allain in an eldritch siege, a source of continued anger and remembrance among the dwarves. Villershall was destroyed by fellow dwarves, mercenaries working for the Gunnacks clan who destroyed their great rivals in trade with a year-long siege.
