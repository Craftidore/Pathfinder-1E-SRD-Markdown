# Knockdown (Ex)
## Overview
*Knockdown (Ex)*: Once per rage, the barbarian can make a trip attack against one target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage equal to the barbarianâ€™s Strength modifier and is knocked prone. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
