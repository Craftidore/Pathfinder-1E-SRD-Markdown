# Trap (Room)
## Overview
**Trap**

**Benefit** see below 

**Cost** see below; **Time** see below 

**Size** 1â€“4 squares 

This can be a specific room in a building or an augmentation to another room. A Trap room might appear empty or it might be decorated to appear to be harmless in order to lure a target into the trap. A Trap costs are explained in the *Core Rulebook* (page 423), and building one uses the crafting rules in the *Core Rulebook* (page 91), though you may spend Goods and Labor toward this cost.
