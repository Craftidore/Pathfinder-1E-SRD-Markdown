# Illusory Landscape (WondArch)
## Overview
**Illusory Landscape:** The creator designs a permanent illusory terrain capable of changing the terrain around a stronghold. This can make a foreboding or dangerous land look friendly and peaceful, or vice versa. Some stronghold owners put an illusory landscape into place before they even break ground. This helps prevent later visitors from knowing the true nature of the surrounding terrain.

A single *illusory landscape* covers up to forty-seven contiguous stronghold spaces, and you can overlap multiple illusory landscapes to cover more area. Note, however, that the spell only affects natural terrain. Structures, equipment and creatures within the area cannot be hidden by the *illusory landscape* or have their appearance changed. An* illusory landscape* can cover up the existence of a river or a moat. It could even make a floating stronghold look as though it sits on the ground, or make a regular stronghold look as though it hovers over the open land.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Hallucinatory Terrain (Spell)|hallucinatory terrain]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
