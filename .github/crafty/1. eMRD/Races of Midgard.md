# Races of Midgard
## Overview
The world of [[Midgard]] is filled with a diverse array of peoples whose histories, traditions, beliefs, and ways of viewing life continually shape society as a whole. On Midgard, traditional fantasy races such as dwarves, elves, gnomes, and others are certainly present, but their backgrounds and places in society are often unique to the setting—and knowing these details will help players create characters that are truly part and parcel of Midgard’s social fabric. 

This chapter contains all of the details that players and Game Masters might wish to know about the most prominent races on Midgard. The first part of this chapter presents Midgard’s major races, which include humans, elves, and elfmarked (or half-elves, as they’re more traditionally known), dragonkin, dwarves, gearforged, kobolds, ravenfolk, shadow fey, and trollkin. The second part focuses on races whose members are still key to Midgard’s societies but are found in fewer numbers, including darakhul, gnomes, minotaurs, tieflings, and tosculi. 

For feats tied to many of these races, see Chapter 5. For information about even more races found in Midgard, see Kobold Press’s *Advanced Races Compendium*.

## Race Tables
**Race Tables**

Presented below are the random starting ages, aging effects, and random heights and weights of members of the races detailed in this chapter.

**Exceptions to the Norm**

In Midgard, some races follow special rules for determining their starting ages, aging effects, or heights and weights.

The gearforged follow different rules for ages, as do the darakhul follow different rules for their physical aspects.

See page 16 or 28, respectively, for details.
