# Oaken Guardian (WondArch)
## Overview
**Oaken Guardian:** This magic item is a large oak tree that can transform into a treant. The creator of an *oaken guardian* gives it an 11-word trigger phrase that tells the treant what to do and when.

You must create the *oaken guardian* within 300 feet of something it is meant to protect. A druid can create multiple oaken guardians if she likes, but they must each be near something that needs protecting. The *oaken guardian* returns to its treelike state when it has accomplished its objective. If it is killed, it is no more. However, if it is only damaged, it can heal normally—as a treant would, not a tree—even in its treelike state.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Liveoak (Spell)|liveoak]]**; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
