# Evangelist (PrC)
## Overview
Evangelists travel the world proclaiming their devotion to a

particular deity, pantheon, or religious doctrine. They seek

to convert others to their way of thinking and to spread their

word throughout the land. All races and cultures have evangelists

of one type or another. Most evangelists come from

the charismatic laity of a culture. They do not possess the

learning or perhaps temperament to be spellcasting clerics

but have found other ways to proselytize. Those who worship

deities often fi nd themselves working in cooperation

with clerics of the same faith while those who simply evangelize

a particular belief—even one embraced by a deity or

pantheon—can fi nd themselves at odds with even those of

their own alignment. An evangelist is often a leader and, in

some ways, a loner. Even though his abilities strengthen his

allies, he stands apart.

While clerics and even druids can make powerful evangelists,

few trade in their spellcasting abilities for the power

this prestige class offers. Bards, naturally charismatic, may

fi nd religion and become evangelists. Rogues can also

benefi t from this class. A few paladins, particularly

those who seek to convert evil to good (rather than

simply destroying evil), may set their feet upon

this path. Gnomes, halfl ings, and humans tend

toward

evangelism

more

than

most other races.

The half-races, both

half-elves and halforcs,

can fi nd purpose

along this

path, though

it is a strange

half-orc that

can follow

it successfully.

Elves often disdain

evangelists and

dwarves see them

as busybodies or

trouble makers.

Good evangelists bolster

and strengthen their allies

and often see other

people as students

or even a fl ock

to be educated

or guided. Evil

evangelists

view others as

unenlightened

and seek to enforce their will upon others. While a good

evangelist may use his abilities to sway or even convert

others to his belief system, those who follow the path of

evil tend to intimidate and dominate others.

Adaptation: Bards who revere St. Cuthbert (described in

Chapter 5) sometimes become inspiring or terrifying evangelists.

Any deity that inspires particular zealousness in his

followers or who sponsors active efforts to increase the size

of the faith would make a good patron for an evangelist.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the evangelist.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Evangelists gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Great Orator (Su): An evangelist can inspire, protect,

and otherwise improve the situation of his allies simply

by speaking clearly and being heard. This ability is similar

to the bard’s bardic music ability (see page 29 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook* for a complete description) and, indeed, evangelist

levels stack with bard levels to determine the strength

of known bard songs. For example, a bard 3/evangelist 5

improves his inspire competence ability, but does not gain

any new bard abilities. He could use bardic music to convert

the unfaithful, countersong, *fascinate,* inspire the righteous,

inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, but would

not gain the inspire competence, inspire greatness, or *suggestion*

abilities. Alternately, a bard 7/evangelist 1 would be

able to use bardic music to countersong, *fascinate,* inspire

competence, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire

hope, and *suggestion.* Evangelist oratory abilities function in

exactly the same manner as bardic music except the evangelist

must speak loudly and clearly, rather than sing or play

an instrument.

*Inspire Dread (Su):* An evil evangelist with 9 or more ranks

in Perform (oratory) can inspire hopelessness in all enemies

within 30 feet. This ability imposes a –4 penalty on Will

saves on all enemies within 30 feet of the evangelist. Delivering

this oratory requires a full-round action to activate

and requires concentration each round to continue the

effect. The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and

for 3 rounds thereafter. Inspire dread is a mind-affecting

ability.

*Inspire Hope (Su):* A good or neutral evangelist with 9

or more ranks in Perform (oratory) can inspire spiritual

resilience in all allies within 30 feet. This ability gives the

evangelist and all allies who can hear his oratory a +4 sacred

bonus on Will saves. Delivering this oratory requires a fullround

action to activate and requires concentration each

round to continue the effect. The effect lasts as long as the

evangelist speaks and for three rounds thereafter. Inspire

hope is a mind-affecting ability.

*Infl ame the Righteous (Su):* An evangelist of 3rd level or

higher with 11 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) can use

this ability to wreath himself and any of his allies within 30

feet in divine fl ame. Each benefi ciary of this ability gains

the benefi t of a *fi re shield* spell. Use the evangelist’s level +5

to determine the caster level of the spell. The damage caused

by the spell is, however, purely divine and not subject to a

creature’s resistance or immunity to fi re.

This oratory requires a full-round action to perform and

requires concentration each round to continue the effect.

The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and for three

rounds thereafter.

*Convert the Unfaithful (Su):* An evangelist of 5th level with

at least 13 ranks in Perform (oratory) may attempt to convert

a single enemy within 30 feet. As a full-round action, the

evangelist delivers an impassioned speech on the righteousness

of his beliefs to a single enemy, who must attempt a

Will save (DC = 10 + class level + Cha mod). If the creature

succeeds, it is shaken for one round. If the creature fails its

saving throw, it converts. Creatures with an alignment subtype

(such as angels and devils) are immune to this ability.

A converted creature is effectively charmed by the evangelist

(similar to a *charm monster* spell). In addition, a converted

creature temporarily assumes the alignment of the

evangelist and acts accordingly. This may mean some of the

creature’s class abilities, spells, or other abilities are unavailable

to it for the duration of the spell (a paladin converted

to something other than lawful good, for example, loses her

class abilities for the duration).

When the duration elapses, the creature then has a choice:

It can continue to act according to its new alignment, or

it can shift back. If the creature chooses to permanently

change its alignment to the evangelist’s, it acts as if a cleric

of the appropriate alignment had cast *atonement* on it. If

the creature chooses to change back, it must make another

saving throw (with the same save DC as before). If it fails

this saving throw its alignment changes back but it needs

an *atonement* spell to gain back any abilities it lost due to its

temporary alignment change.

Fast Talk (Ex): At 2nd level, the evangelist knows

the right thing to say at the right time. He may make a

rushed Diplomacy check as a full-round action at only a –5

penalty.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, the evangelist becomes

so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them

reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this

ability, the evangelist selects a number of skills equal to 1 +

his Intelligence modifi er (minimum of 1) from the following

list: Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sense

Motive. When making a skill check with one of the selected

skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would

normally prevent him from doing so.

*Countersong (Su):*Orellen can counter magical effects that

depend on sound by making a Perform check for each round

may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of his or her

saving throw if desired. Countersong lasts for 10 rounds.

within 90 feet that can see and hear him to become *fascinated*

obvious threat breaks the effect. Fascination lasts up to 8

rounds.

hear Orellen receive a +1 morale bonus on saves against

charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and

check as a full-round action at only a –5 penalty.

Great Orator: Orellen can use the great orator special

ability three times per day.

*Inspire Hope (Su):* This ability gives the evangelist and all

allies within 30 feet who can hear his oratory a +4 sacred

bonus on Will saves. Delivering this oratory requires a

full-round action to activate and requires concentration

each round to continue the effect. The effect lasts as long as

Orellen speaks and for three rounds thereafter. Inspire hope

is a mind-affecting ability.

*Infl ame the Righteous (Su):* Orellen can use this ability to

wreath himself and any of his allies within 30 feet in divine

fl ame. Each benefi ciary of this ability gains the benefi t of

a *fi re shield* spell (caster level 8). The damage caused by the

spell is, however, purely divine and not subject to a creature’s

resistance or immunity to fi re.

This oratory requires a full-round action to perform and

requires concentration each round to continue the effect.

The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and for three

rounds thereafter.

sleep effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered
