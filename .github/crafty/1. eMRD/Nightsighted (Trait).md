# Nightsighted (Trait)
## Overview
**Nightsighted**

Your eyes are particularly well suited to using darkvision, but they are less well adapted to what others consider normal light.

**Benefit:** Add 10 feet to the range of your darkvision.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) checks when in areas of bright light.

**Special:** You must have darkvision as a racial ability to have this trait.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** This trait might not affect a character's personality at all, but it might make the character prefer going on underground or nighttime adventures.
