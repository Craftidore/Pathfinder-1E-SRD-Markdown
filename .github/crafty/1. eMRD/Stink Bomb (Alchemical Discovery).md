# Stink Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Stink Bomb\*:* The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist’s bomb can duplicate the effects of *[[Stinking Cloud (Spell)|stinking cloud]]* instead of *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]*, filling an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the [[Smoke Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)|smoke bomb]] discovery before selecting this discovery.
