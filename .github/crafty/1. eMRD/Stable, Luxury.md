# Stable, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 9,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Two grooms

This stable has polished floors, intricately carved and inlaid woodwork, and walls of finished wood or the finest plaster. Fresh hay fills the six stalls, which the grooms clean on an hourly basis. Each tack and saddle has its own custom-carved pedestal upon which to rest. The entire place is as clean as most peopleâ€™s kitchens.

Running this stable requires two grooms (Com1; [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] +5) to keep it pristine. They can care for up to six Large mounts at a time. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
