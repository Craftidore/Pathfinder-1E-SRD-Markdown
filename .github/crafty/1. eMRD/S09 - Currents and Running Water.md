# S09 - Currents and Running Water
## Overview
**Currents and Running Water**

Currents in the ocean (or a similarly large body of water) work similarly to rivers. Each current has a particular speed (measured in feet per round), width, and direction, and at the beginning of a creature’s turn, the current pushes it that distance. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to creatures not in the same current. A creature can try to swim against the current’s flow on its turn to stay in place, but it’s usually a better idea to swim perpendicular to the current to reach the edge and exit the current. Fortunately, while rivers can reach speeds up to 90 feet per round, the fastest natural ocean currents are usually not much faster than 50 feet per round in the sunlight zone, and are slower the deeper one travels. This is because currents are mainly influenced by the weather near the surface and tiny discrepancies in temperature far below the surface, and the effects of the latter are not as strong. Currents always count as at least rough water ([[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] DC 15), and faster currents count as at least stormy water ([[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] DC 20).

The majority of the ocean does not count as running water, but currents do. Thus while the spell *[[Locate Creature (Spell)|locate creature]]* functions underwater, it rarely extends to its full range, since even an extremely slow current blocks the spell. Likewise, vampires tempt fate in the ocean by exposing themselves to the risk of an unexpected current.

**Whirlpools**

When currents flowing in opposite directions meet, they create a whirlpool. Most whirlpools are harmless, but some mighty maelstroms formed by powerful tides are capable of great destruction. The most powerful whirlpools can reach a maximum current speed of around 200 feet per round, spinning in a circle and generating a centripetal force to pull nearby creatures and objects into the whirlpool and prevent those caught in the whirlpool from leaving. Whirlpool movement doesn’t normally provoke attacks of opportunity, because no one caught in the current is in a position to make one. Conditions are so rough in maelstroms that [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks reach DC 40 or higher. Creatures caught in a whirlpool take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round for every 50 feet of the whirlpool’s speed. Sometimes the only way to survive a whirlpool is to reach the center, since—unlike when a [[Elemental, Water (Bestiary PF1)|water elemental]] creates and controls a whirlpool with mischief in mind—a natural whirlpool eventually drags its captives to the bottom and out.
