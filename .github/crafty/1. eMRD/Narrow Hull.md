# Narrow Hull
## Overview
**Narrow Hull**

The ship has been intentionally designed with a slenderer hull, enabling it to slip through smaller spaces.

**Benefit:** The ship’s beam (width) is decreased by 20%, and cargo capacity is reduced by 10%. However, the ship gains a +2 bonus on all sailing checks. This improvement must be installed at the time of the ship’s construction and cannot be added later.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 22; Cost: 15% of base ship cost
