# Lingering Necromancy
## Overview
**Lingering Necromancy**

You can put the necromantic magic you create to multiple uses.

**Benefit:** When you cast a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher, on your next turn if you deal hp damage to one or more targets with a spell or spell-like ability, you may heal yourself for 1 hit point per die of damage dealt by your spell. (You gain the same amount of healing regardless of how many targets you harm with your spell.)
