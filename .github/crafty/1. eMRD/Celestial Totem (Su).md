# Celestial Totem (Su)
## Overview
*Celestial Totem (Su):* While raging, the barbarian shines with a righteous light. This effect bestows upon the barbarian a halo of gleaming light that shines as if it were daylight and triggers an *[[Invisibility Purge (Spell)|invisibility purge]]* effect in the barbarianâ€™s square and each adjacent square. The *[[Invisibility Purge (Spell)|invisibility purge]]* only affects nongood creatures. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.
