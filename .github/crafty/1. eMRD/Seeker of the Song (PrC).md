# Seeker of the Song (PrC)
## Overview
Beyond magic, beyond sound, beyond good or evil, lies music

so profound and powerful that even deities quake at its sound.

This primal music—of unknown origin and with no limit

to its power—is incomprehensible to the mortal ear. To

some who hear a fragment of this music, it becomes beauty

incarnate, and they devote their lives to its discovery. These

seekers wield the power of music in ways that amaze even

the most skilled bards.

United only by their quest, seekers of the song have

incredibly diverse goals and motivations. Some black-hearted

seekers know that this primal music is power, and they lust

after it in hopes of turning it against their many enemies.

Others search for the music to bring joy and peace. Most

have more moderate aspirations and seek the music because

it moves them. Regardless of their goals, seekers of the song

rarely work against one another—each hoping that another

seeker will uncover another piece of the primal music and

share it with the rest.

The song never leaves a seeker, and its power can have

strange effects on their souls. Some retire from society,

seeking the silence of distant monasteries or mountaintops

from which to better concentrate on the music they once

heard. Others remain unchanged to outward appearances,

yet the music remains in the back of their minds at all times.

Some talk to any who will listen about the importance and

beauty of the primal music, while others cannot seem to

fi nd the words to express what this music means to them

or to the world.

Every seeker of the song must have at least one bard level,

but beyond that, their stories and careers differ wildly.

Many begin their adventuring careers as bards, drawn to

music from their earliest days. Others come to the class

after adventuring as fighters, rogues, clerics, or members

of other classes for most of their careers, with little idea

that the primal music will become their chosen path.

Although at least a few seekers emerge from every class,

few wizards or sorcerers take up the pursuit; members

of these classes are more likely to devote themselves to

traditional spellcasting rather than the strange pull of

the primal music.

Adaptation: The seeker of the song prestige class

presents a powerful new set of bardic abilities, going far

beyond the basic bardic music ability presented in the

*Player’s Handbook*. Many campaigns can benefit from

exploring this facet of the game, but a DM might not want to introduce the idea of primal music into a campaign’s

cosmology. In this case, the seekers of the song might

become the disciples of a distant bardic college. The college

is extreme in the eyes of other bards: They discard

the notion of bards as wanderers and gatherers of diverse

skills, and instead focus on music as a force of magic to

the exclusion of all else.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the seeker of the song

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Seekers of the song

gain no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Rapture of the Song (Su): A seeker of the song is so

in tune with the power of the primal music that she gains

special insight, physical fortitude, and resistance to magic

while in the throes of her song. A seeker gains a +2 insight

bonus to Armor Class whenever she uses her bardic music

ability, seeker music, or a similar ability.

At 4th level and higher, a seeker also gains a +2 insight

bonus on saving throws whenever she uses her bardic music

ability, seeker music, or a similar ability.

At 7th level and higher, a seeker also gains damage reduction

2/— whenever she uses her bardic music ability, seeker

music, or a similar ability.

At 10th level, a seeker gains these abilities and also acts

as though affected by a *freedom of movement* spell whenever

she uses her bardic music ability, seeker music, or a similar

ability.

Seeker Music: A seeker of the song can use music or poetics

to produce magical effects. Seeker music follows the same

rules as bardic music (see page 29 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

Each use of seeker music costs one daily use of bardic music

to activate. Seeker of the song levels stack with bard levels

for purposes of determining how many daily uses of bardic

music and seeker music the character has.

Some seeker music effects include a secondary effect,

called a refrain. In any round when a seeker concentrates

on a seeker music effect and expends another use of bardic

music, she can activate the refrain associated with that seeker

music effect. Using a refrain is a swift action (see page 86)

that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The original

effects of the song do not end; the seeker can maintain the

song and activate the refrain simultaneously.

*Burning Melody (Su):* A seeker of the song with 14 or more

ranks in a Perform skill can gather a glimmer of the power

of the primal music and gain some control over fi re through

this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her

allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to fi re

15. An ally benefi ts from this effect for as long as it can hear

the seeker sing.

*Burning Melody, Refrain:* When she uses the refrain with her

burning melody, a seeker shoots a 30-foot cone of fi re from

her fi ngertips. The cone deals 6d6 points of fi re damage to

creatures in its area. A successful Refl ex save (DC 10 + the

seeker’s ranks in the Perform skill) halves the damage.

*Song of Unmaking (Su):* At 2nd level and higher, a seeker with

15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can turn a fragment of

the primal music’s power against constructs. She can expend

a use of bardic music and make a Perform check to deal 1d8

points of damage per seeker level to all constructs within a

30-foot burst of the seeker (no save).

*Dirge of Frozen Loss (Su):* A seeker of the song of 3rd level or

higher with 16 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over cold

energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song,

she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain

resistance to cold 15. An ally benefi ts from this effect for as

long as it can hear the seeker sing.

*Dirge of Frozen Loss, Refrain:* When she uses the refrain

with her dirge of frozen loss, a seeker shoots a 60-foot line

of cold energy from her fi ngertips. The line deals 10d6

points of cold damage to any creature it hits and causes any

creature damaged by it to become fatigued. A successful

Fortitude save (DC 10 + the seeker’s ranks in the

Perform skill) halves the damage and negates

the fatigue.

*Song of Life (Su):* A seeker of the song of

4th level or higher with 17 or more ranks

in a Perform skill can use fragments of

the primal music to protect and heal

her allies. While a seeker sings

this song, she and all of her

allies within 30 feet who can

hear her gain immunity to

poison and disease. An ally

benefi ts from this effect

for as long as it can hear

the seeker sing.

*Song of Life, Refrain:* When

she uses the refrain with her

dirge of frozen loss, a seeker

can make a Perform check

to heal a living creature

of an amount of hit

point damage equal to

the check result (up to

the creature’s full normal

hit point total). She must touch the

affected ally to use this ability. The

touch is a standard action, although

activating the refrain is still a swift

action. The refrain has no effect on

undead or nonliving creatures.

*Anthem of Thunder and Pain (Su):* A seeker

of the song of 5th level or higher with 18

or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the

primal music and gain some control over electrical energy

through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all

of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance

to electricity 15. An ally benefi ts from this effect for as long

as it can hear the seeker sing.

*Anthem of Thunder and Pain, Refrain:* When she uses the

refrain with her anthem of thunder and pain, a seeker

shoots a ray of electricity from her fi ngertips. The ray has

a range of 20 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to

hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to a

creature it hits. The seeker can then cause the electricity

to arc to additional foes, all of whom must be within 20 feet

of the fi rst creature struck. Each secondary ray requires

another ranged touch attack to hit and deals half as much

damage as the initial ray. A seeker can create one secondary

ray for every three seeker class levels (one when the song

becomes available at 5th level, two at 6th level, and three

at 9th level). No creature can be affected by more than one

arc in a single round.

*Hymn of Spelldeath (Su):* A seeker of the song of 6th

level or higher with 19 or more

ranks in a Perform skill can

turn the power of the primal

music against magic effects.

Any creature that can hear

the seeker perform must

make a Concentration check

opposed by the seeker’s Perform

check in order to cast a spell. If the

Concentration check fails, the spell

is lost and has no effect. If the Concentration

check succeeds, the

spell is cast as normal. A hymn

of spelldeath is a mind-affecting

ability.

*Hymn of Spelldeath, Refrain:*

When she uses the refrain with

her hymn of spelldeath, a seeker

can attempt to dispel magic. This

ability works just like the area version

of *dispel magic,* except the effect is

centered on the seeker. At her option,

a seeker can exclude herself and her

allies from this effect, but the effect

must still be centered on her. The

seeker makes a level check just as if

she were a spellcaster using the *dispel*

*magic* spell, using the total of her bard

levels and seeker of the song levels as

her modifi er for the check.

*Ballad of Agony Reborn (Su):* A

seeker of the song of 7th level or

higher with 20 or more ranks in a

Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to

gain control over acid energy through this music. While

a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within

30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to acid 15. An

ally benefi ts from this effect for as long as it can hear the

seeker sing.

*Ballad of Agony Reborn, Refrain:* When she uses the refrain

with her ballad of agony reborn, a seeker shoots a ray of

acid from her fi ngertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and

requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6

points of acid damage to a creature it hits, and another 10d6

points of acid damage 1 round later.

*Aria of Everywhere (Sp):* A seeker of the song of 8th level

or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can

pull the power of the primal music into herself and move

short distances instantaneously. She can expend a use of

bardic music or seeker music to instantly transport herself

to any other spot within 25 feet + 5 feet/level. This ability

otherwise functions as the *dimension door* spell, except that

the seeker can’t bring along additional creatures with this

ability.

*Dirge of Songdeath (Su):* A seeker of the song of 9th level or

higher with 22 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather

the power of the primal music to gain control over sonic

energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song,

she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain

resistance to sonic 15. An ally benefi ts from this effect for as

long as it can hear the seeker sing.

In addition, as long as the seeker is singing a dirge of

songdeath, other creatures within 30 feet cannot easily use

bardic music, seeker music, or similar abilities. To use such

an ability, a creature within the area must make a Perform

check opposed by the seeker’s Perform check. If the check

is successful, the creature can use the ability as desired. If

the check fails, the ability has no effect, but a daily use of the

music ability must be expended normally.

*Dirge of Songdeath, Refrain:* When she uses the refrain with

her hymn of spelldeath, a seeker shoots a ray of sonic energy

from her fi ngertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires

a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 15d6 points of sonic

damage to a creature it hits.

*Note of Solitude (Su):* Upon reaching 10th level, a seeker

of the song with 23 or more ranks in a Perform skill can

use the power of the primal music to temporarily sever

some creatures’ tie with other planes. Extraplanar creatures

within 60 feet of a seeker who activates this ability must

make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the seeker’s ranks in

the Perform skill). Creatures affected by this ability get a

bonus on this saving throw equal to their Hit Dice. Any

creature that fails this saving throw is instantly sent to its

home plane. Unlike other musical abilities and affects, a

note of solitude has a duration of instantaneous and cannot

be maintained, though the seeker can activate it again on

subsequent rounds by spending additional uses of bardic

music or seeker music.

Combine Songs (Ex): A seeker of the song of 2nd level

or higher can combine two types of bardic music or seeker

music to provide the benefi ts of both. The seeker chooses

two music abilities and activates both using the same

standard action. If either or both require concentration,

the seeker can maintain concentration on both by using

one standard action each round to concentrate. The normal

stacking rules for bonus types apply to music abilities

combined with this ability.

Subvocalize (Ex): At 5th level and higher, a seeker of the

song can begin a new bardic music or seeker music song as a

swift action (see page 86). A seeker can use this ability only

if he already has one (and only one) bardic music or seeker

music ability already active. A seeker can use this ability in

conjunction with the combine songs ability to start a second

song and then maintain both as a standard action each round

(as per the combine songs ability).

Ex-Seekers of the Song

Like a member of any other prestige class, a seeker of the song

can take levels in other classes after entering the seeker of the

song class, but seekers of the song face a special restriction.

A seeker of the song who gains a level in any other class after

having gained his fi rst seeker level can never again raise her

seeker of the song level, though she retains the seeker abilities

she has already earned. The path of the seeker demands

constant attention and devotion. If a character adopts this

prestige class, she must pursue it to the exclusion of all

other careers. Once she has turned from the path, she can

never return.
