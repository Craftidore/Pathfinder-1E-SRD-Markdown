# Character Traits
## Overview
**Character Traits**

Playing an Adventure Path is a different experience than playing in a one-shot adventure. An Adventure Path presents a long, ongoing campaign, but unlike a custom created campaign built by a specific GM for a group of players whose tastes and proclivities in character creation are known quantities, we don’t know what kinds of choices your players prefer when building their characters. As a result, one of the driving philosophies of crafting an Adventure Path is to include sections for all 11 of the core classes, so that no one feels “left out” by the game.

But what about the less tangible elements of game play? If you’re rolling up a new character for a homebrew campaign, you can (hopefully) trust your GM to tailor the campaign to include your character and his history and personality. For an Adventure Path, though, how is a player to know what choices and what backgrounds might dovetail into the predetermined story arc of the campaign he’s about to spend several months playing, without spoiling key components of the adventure’s plotline?

That’s the question that the Adventure Path Player’s Guides have attempted to address. In all of the Player’s Guides we provide not only a gazetteer of the region in which the campaign begins, but also a spoiler-free discussion on what choices might be best to make when creating a dwarf, an elf, a sorcerer, a ranger, and so on. Yet there’s another tool that’s been evolving as well: the character trait.

The first incarnation of this new element to your character appeared in the [[Rise of the Runelords]] Player’s Guide, disguised as six new feats that your new character could take (we recommended that GMs allow players to pick one of these six as a bonus feat). These new feats were more than just additional tricks and powers, though; they were crafted to infuse newly created characters with built-in links to the then brand-new realm of Varisia.

In the Curse of the Crimson Throne Player’s Guide, we abandoned the bonus feat model and instead came up with several traits from which new players could pick and choose. Each trait granted one of two relatively minor bonuses, but the majority of each trait consisted of flavor and background information intended to prime your new character for the start of the campaign.

And that brings us here, to the official Pathfinder character traits PDF, updated to work seamlessly with the Pathfinder RPG. This document contains all the rules you need to use character traits in your campaign, be they Pathfinder Adventure Paths or campaigns of your own design.

**Character Trait Design Philosophy**

At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat—in fact, at one point, we considered calling them “Half Feats” but abandoned that idea when we realized it implied a point-based system that didn’t really exist (there’s no such thing, for example, as a “Double Feat”). Yet a character trait isn’t just another kind of power you can add on to your character—it’s a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into the world of Golarion. Think of character traits as “story seeds” for your background; after you pick your two traits, you’ll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character’s personality and history. Alternatively, if you’ve already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.

One more thing: character traits are for PCs. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC will need to “buy” them with the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat. Player characters are special; they’re the stars of the game, after all, and if they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way, that kind of makes sense. The pregenerated characters presented in Pathfinder and the modules will not have bonus traits selected for them—we’re leaving those choices to you if you wish to use one of them as a PC.

Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a “trait” bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack—they’re intended to give you a slight edge over the non-PCs of the world, not a secret backdoor way to focus all your traits on one type of bonus to gain an unseemly advantage over the rules. It’s certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a “[[Courageous (Trait)|Courageous]]” trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait’s on the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn’t mean you’re any more brave if you choose both than if you choose only one.

**Gaining Traits**

When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what amounts to a bonus feat at character creation. Some GMs may wish to limit this somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM doesn’t allow bonus traits, you should still be able to pick up some with the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat (see the sidebar on page 6). For Pathfinder Adventure Paths, there are two categories of traits to choose from. One of your traits must be a campaign trait chosen from the list given in that Adventure Path’s Player’s Guide—this trait ties your character into the campaign’s storyline and gives you a built-in reason to begin the first adventure. Your other trait can be chosen from one of the other types of traits: basic traits, region traits, race traits, or religion traits.

**Types of Traits**

There are five types of character traits to choose from. This document presents only one category—the basic trait. The other four types of traits can all be found in Pathfinder Companions.

**Basic Traits:** There are a total of 40 basic traits—ten each, split among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren’t tied to specific classes. It’s perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are “generic,” and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization. 

**Campaign Traits:** These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new Adventure Path. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path’s Player’s Guide.

**Race Traits:** Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities. In order to select a race trait, your character must be of the trait’s race or ethnicity. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (as could be possible due to the result of polymorph magic or a *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]* spell), the benefits gained by your racial trait persist—only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait. Of course, in such an event, you’re also likely to lose skills, feats, and a whole lot more!

**Regional Traits:** Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At first level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character’s place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character’s background.

**Religion Traits:** Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions.

**Restrictions on Trait Selection**

There are a few rules governing trait selections. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits. Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.

Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character’s development, either before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat) events that happened while adventuring. Even if you become a hermit and abandon society, you’ll still retain your legacy of growing up an aristocrat if you took a social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits—since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, you can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if you switch religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. He may simply rule that you lose that trait, or he might allow you to pick a new religion trait tied to your new deity. Another option is that if you abandon a religion, you lose the associated religion traits until you gain an experience level, at which point you may replace lost religion traits with basic [[Faith Traits|faith traits]].

**Character Traits (v3.5)**

Traits are aspects of a character's personality, background, or physique that make him better at some activities and worse at others. In many ways, traits resemble feats: A character can have only a limited number of traits, and each trait provides some benefit. Unlike feats, however, traits always carry a corresponding drawback. In additon to their game effects, traits suggest characteristics about the character's personality that might lead to interesting roleplaying opportunities. Together with a character's class and feat selection, traits offer a way for game mechanics to encourage deeper character backgrounds and consistent roleplaying.

Traits serve as an interesting starting point for roleplaying, reminding players of their characters' prominent strengths and weaknesses. However, roleplaying a certain aspect of a character's personality does not require possessing the trait. For example, a paladin can be honest and forthright without the Honest trait. The player should roleplay the character consistently even though the character's honesty has no effect on his skill checks.

A character can begin play with up to two traits, chosen by the player at the time of character creation. Alternatively, the DM can require players to roll on Table 3-3: Character Traits to determine the traits possessed by their characters.

As characters advance in level and ability, they ,might want to get rid of the traits that they chose at the beginning of play. Although characters cannot rid themselves of a trait directly, specific feats, skill ranks, or magic items can compensate for the penalties imposed by a trait. For example, an abrasive character can work on becoming more personable by spending skill points to gain a rank in [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and a rank in [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], thereby offsetting the drawback from the Abrasive trait.

If the DM allows it, players may add traits to their characters after 1st level The DM might allow a player to assign a trait to her character after she has roleplayed the character in a manner consistent with the trait in question, or after a traumatic or lifechanging experience (after dying, a character might develop the [[Cautious (Trait)|Cautious]] trait or the [[Aggressive (Trait)|Aggressive]] trait). If the DM includes this option, a character should gain a new trait no more frequently than once every five levels.

**ROLEPLAYING OF TRAITS**

If a player creates a character with one or more of the traits described here, she has three basic choices for how that trait affects the character's personality.

First, the character might view the trait as a weakness. A character with this view might try to hide the trait or make excuses for his behavior. On the other hand, he might seek out others with the trait to feel better about his own idiosyncrasy.

Second, the character might view the trait as a strength. A character might call attention to the trait, encourage others to act in ways that mimic the trait, or simply assume that those without the trait are less worthy than those who possess it.

Finally, the character might not acknowledge the trait at all. A character might adopt this attitude toward a trait for several reasons, each suggesting something different about the character's background and personality.

- The character might not be aware of the trait; for example, a nearsighted character might not realize that others see better at a distance because his impairment is mild and the onset was so gradual that he never noticed the change.
- The character might be aware of the trait but not want to admit that he possesses it. For example, an abrasive character might realize that his mannerisms affect others, yet find more solace in putting the blame on those whom he offends rather than on himself.
- The character might know but simply not care.
