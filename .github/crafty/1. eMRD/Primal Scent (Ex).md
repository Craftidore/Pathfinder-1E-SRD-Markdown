# Primal Scent (Ex)
## Overview
*Primal Scent (Ex)*: When using her [[Scent (Ex)|scent]] rage power, the barbarian adds half her barbarian level on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks made to track by scent and on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to pinpoint the location of creatures she cannot see. If she pinpoints the location of a creature that has total concealment, she treats it as having concealment. A barbarian must have the [[Scent (Ex)|scent]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
