# Touchstone of Faith (WondArch)
## Overview
**Touchstone of Faith:** The 5-foot-square touchstone grants a deflection bonus to AC to any single creature standing upon it. Stronghold builders often add this to key guard posts or other areas important to the defense of a stronghold.

If more than one creature attempts to use this simultaneously (for instance, if two grappling creatures stand atop it), the item grants no AC bonus.

The *touchstone of faith* comes in four varieties: Type I grants a +2 bonus, type II a +3 bonus, type III a +4 bonus, and type IV a +5 bonus.

*Caster Level:* 3rd (I), 6th (II), 12th (III), 18th (IV); Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Shield of Faith (Spell)|shield of faith]]**; Market Price:* 1,500 gp (I), 3,000 gp (II), 6,000 gp (III), 9,000 gp (IV).
