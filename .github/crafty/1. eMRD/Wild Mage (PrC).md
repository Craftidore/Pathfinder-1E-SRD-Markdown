# Wild Mage (PrC)
## Overview
Magic is one of the most capricious and unpredictable of all

natural or supernatural forces in the universe. Attempts to

codify spellcasting through arcane formulas, or to impose

order on magic through the force of will, are essentially

pointless—or so wild mages believe. Instead, those who

would truly master magic must forget what they know and

abandon their willful control of the arcane. Within this

paradox lies the awesome power of wild magic.

The wild mage aspires to cast spells without structure. By

taking the risk of substituting an element of randomness, she

gives up the safe predictability of other arcane spellcasters.

This risk allows for the potential of power greater than other

casters can hope for. Of course, she also risks the potential

for less power, but what is magic if not risky? Chaos is

strong, and her magic often carries her to heights of power

that other casters cannot reach—but chaos is also fi ckle,

and her spells sometimes fall short of her expectations. In

addition, from time to time her spells unfold in spectacular

wild surges that might prove catastrophic to the wild mage

and her companions. The wild mage accepts this as the price

of her convictions.

Sorcerers are naturally intrigued by the study of wild

magic. The act of unchaining their spells from the safeguards

and controls built into these time-honored formulas

appeals to many of them. One might suppose that few

wizards would be drawn to the spontaneity and unpredictability

of wild magic, but in fact many wizards do become

wild mages, seeking to explore and harness the power of

chaos.

Wild mages tend to be solitary innovators. They have

little contact with their fellow spellcasters, since wild mages

can’t really learn from them. Rumors persist of a secretive

Prismatic Cabal of wild mages who cloister themselves

within the depths of Limbo to experience the power of chaos

fi rsthand.

Capricious and powerful, NPC wild mages act much like

chaotic sorcerers and wizards. Some are heroes who join

parties crusading against tyranny and evil, while others are

villains who revel in the chaos of destruction and disaster.

A few wild mages (generally not good-aligned ones) believe

that the power of their magic increases as the amount of

chaos and uncertainty in the world around them rises,

and therefore they bend their efforts toward instigating

catastrophes of all kinds.

Adaptation: A twist on this class might include the

concept that wild mages do not so much exploit instabilities

in the magic as create those instabilities themselves

with their skewed technique. The proliferation of such

casting could possibly lead to geographic or ecological consequences that are strange at the least, or, at worst, stepping

stones to disaster.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the wild mage prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Wild mages gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a wild

mage gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane

spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the

prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as

the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a

wild mage, she must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Wild Magic: A wild mage casts spells differently from any

other arcane spellcaster. She reduces her caster level by 3 for

all spells she casts from now on. However, every time she casts

a spell, her use of wild magic adds 1d6 to her adjusted caster

level. For example, an 8th-level sorcerer/1st-level wild mage

has a base caster level of 6th, not 9th, but her actual caster

level varies from 7th to 12th for every spell she casts. Caster

level affects all level-based variables of a spell, including spell

penetration checks.

Random Defl ector (Su): At 2nd level and higher, a wild

mage has the ability to protect herself from certain attacks

with this ability. Using this ability is an immediate action

(see page 86), which means that a wild mage activates it when

it is not her turn. When activated, the random defl ector lasts

until the beginning of the wild mage’s next turn.

The random defl ector redirects ranged attacks, ranged

touch attacks, and individually targeted spells (spells designating

the wild mage as the sole target, but not area spells

striking an area in which she happens to be the sole target)

so that they instead attack or affect a random target within 20

feet of the wild mage. A wild mage includes herself and her

allies among the possible new targets. Any creature targeted

by a defl ected attack is attacked or affected normally, so an

attack roll is made normally against the new target’s AC, the

new target receives a saving throw if a spell or effect allows

one, and so on. A wild mage can use this ability once per day

at 2nd level, two times per day at 5th level, and three times

per day at 8th level.

Student of Chaos (Ex): Whenever a wild mage of 3rd

level or higher uses a magic item that offers a randomly

determined effect (such as a *bag of tricks* or *rod of wonder*),

she can roll twice and choose between the two results. If a

random roll is made only once to determine the nature or

contents of a device (for example, a *robe of useful items* or an

*iron fl ask*), a wild mage gains no special advantage.

Chaotic Mind (Su): When a wild mage reaches 6th level,

the power of chaos infuses her mind. She gains immunity to

*confusion* and *insanity* spells and effects, and she is shielded

by a continuous nondetection effect (as the spell).

Reckless Dweomer (Su): At 9th level and higher, a wild

mage knows how to spontaneously convert her own spell

energy into random, unpredictable results. As a standard

action, she can eliminate a prepared spell or spell slot of at

least 1st level to create an effect similar to that of activating

a *rod of wonder.* The character’s student of chaos ability (see

above) applies when she uses her reckless dweomer ability.

See page 237 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* for details on the

*rod of wonder.*

Wildstrike (Sp): At 10th level, a wild mage gains the

ability to make a *wildstrike* once per day. A *wildstrike* affects

a single creature within 60 feet, surrounding the creature in

an aura of shimmering rainbow colors for 2d6 rounds. Spell

resistance applies, but the target receives no saving throw.

While a *wildstrike* is in effect, there is a 50% chance each time

the affected creature casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability

that its intended action fails. Instead, the creature rolls as if

it had activated a *rod of wonder* (see page 237 of the *Dungeon*

*Master’s Guide*).

decipher spells on scrolls), Spot +0, Use Magic Device +16

(+18 when using scrolls); Combat Casting, Empower Spell,

Magical Aptitude, Sudden Maximize†.

† New feat described on page 83.

*Languages:* Common, Elven, Goblin.

Random Defl ector (Su): Revena can take an immediate

action to protect herself from ranged attacks, ranged touch

attacks, and spells that target her. Such an attack randomly

targets someone within 20 feet of Revena instead of targeting

her (possible targets include Revena and her allies). Any

creature targeted by such an attack is attacked or affected

normally, so an attack roll is compared against the new

target’s AC, or the new target can make a save if the attack

allows one. The random defl ector lasts until the beginning

of Revena’s next turn.

Wild Magic: Revena’s caster level is three lower than

her level indicates. However, each time she casts a spell, she

rolls 1d6 and adds the result to her modifi ed caster level to

determine her adjusted caster level for that spell.

Chaotic Mind (Su): Revena has immunity to *confusion* and

*insanity* spells and effects, and she is shielded by a continuous

nondetection effect.

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep

effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered

an elf.

Student of Chaos (Ex): Whenever Revena uses a magic

item offering a randomly determined effect (such as a *bag of*

*tricks* or *rod of wonder*), she can roll twice and choose between

the two results.

43 pp.

WILD MAGES IN FAERÛN

Wild mages are particularly adept at exploiting zones of wild

magic, and they are much less likely to experience deleterious

effects while casting spells within wild magic zones. Wild

mages can roll twice on Table 2–1: Wild Magic Effects in Chapter

2 of the *FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting* and choose the

preferred result. For example, a wild mage who rolls a result

of 37 (nothing happens) and a result of 57 (spell functions

normally) would choose the second result.
