# Lion of Talisid (PrC)
## Overview
The undisputed ruler of the guardinals, Talisid the Celestial

Lion is an enormously powerful force for good—and good

alone, undiluted by concerns of law or chaos. He is also a mighty

druid, and his mortal and guardinal champions are druids and

rangers who share both his fierce hatred of evil and his passionate

love of the natural world and its creatures. Called the lions of

Talisid, these protectors of nature and champions of good emulate

their celestial patron in more concrete

ways: adopting feline animal companions,

assuming great cat forms

with their wild shape ability, and

eventually roaring like a leonal.

Druids and rangers most commonly

become lions of Talisid, and

only a character

with an animal

companion

can enter the

class. Multiclass

druid/rangers also commonly

adopt the class, and less

commonly, fighter/druids or

cleric/rangers.

Like their guardinal

patron, lions of Talisid usually

work alone or in small groups of

close companions, rarely with other lions.

NPC lions of Talisid can be found wandering the wilderness, fighting any who would defile the natural world with evil.

They are particularly concerned with areas where some evil

presence corrupts nature itself, manifesting evil weather and

vile corrupted creatures.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the lion of Talisid prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Lions of Talisid gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Animal Companion (Ex): A lion of Talisid can add his lion

of Talisid levels to his effective druid level (his actual druid level

or one-half his ranger level) to determine the capabilities of his

animal companion.

Lion’s Courage (Ex): A lion of Talisid is immune to fear

(magical or otherwise) and gains a +4 sacred bonus on Will saves

against other mind-affecting spells and effects.

Spells per Day: At each level, a lion of Talisid gains new

spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting

class to which he belonged before adding the prestige

class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character

of that class would have gained. If the character had more

than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a lion of Talisid,

the player must decide to which class to add each lion of

Talisid level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Scent (Ex): At 2nd level, a lion of Talisid gains the scent special

quality. He can detect approaching enemies, sniff out

hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Wild Shape (Su): At 3rd level, a lion of Talisid gains the ability

to turn himself into any Small or Medium animal and back

again once per day. This works exactly as the druid’s wild shape

ability. Lions of Talisid prefer the shape of great cats (cheetahs or

leopards at lower levels), but are not limited to such forms.

The lion of Talisid can use this ability more times per day at

4th, 5th, and 8th level, as noted on Table 5–12. In addition, he

gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 6th level,

and a Tiny animal at 9th level.

A lion of Talisid who is also a druid can add his lionof Talisid

level –2 to his druid levels to determine his wild shape ability.

For example, an 8th-level druid/6th-level lion of Talisid can wild

shape as a 12th-level druid, and can thus assume plant forms as

well as Large and Tiny animal forms, and can use this ability 4

times per day.

Exalted Companion: At 4th level, a lion of Talisid gains the

Exalted Companion feat as a bonus feat.

Lion’s Pounce (Ex): At 5th level, a lion of Talisid can make a

full attack at the end of a charge.

Lion’s Swiftness (Ex):When he reaches 7th level, a lion of Talisid

can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 1

round per class level per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.

Leonal’s Roar (Su): Three times a day, a 10th-level lion of Talisid

can issue a roar that duplicates the effects of the leonal’s roar

spell (new spell described in Chapter 6 of this book). The saving

throw DC is 20 + the lion of Talisid’s Charisma modifier.
