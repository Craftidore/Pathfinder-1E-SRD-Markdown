# Nightmares (Hex)
## Overview
*Nightmares (Su)*: Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by terrible nightmares. This functions as the spell *[[Nightmare (Spell)|nightmare]]* each time the affected creature attempts to rest. A Will save negates this effect. If the save is failed, the target must make a new save each night or be unable to rest.
