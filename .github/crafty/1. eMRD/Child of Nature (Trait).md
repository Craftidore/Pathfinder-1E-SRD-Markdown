# Child of Nature (Trait)
## Overview
**Child of Nature ([[Gozreh]]):** You have been blessed by [[Gozreh]] to be as comfortable in the wilderness as you are at home. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to find food and water, and a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
