# Bladed Magic (Trait)
## Overview
**Bladed Magic:** You have an innate talent for using magical weaponry and those weapons capable of becoming magical. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] checks made to craft magic or masterwork weapons. In addition, when you use your arcane pool class ability to grant a weapon an enhancement bonus, that bonus lasts for 2 minutes instead of 1.
