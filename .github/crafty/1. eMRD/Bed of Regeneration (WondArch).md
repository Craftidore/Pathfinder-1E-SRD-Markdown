# Bed of Regeneration (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bed of Regeneration:** Any subject missing a limb or other extremity can lie in this bed and find his body restored to its original state. If the severed parts are available and touching the subject, this healing takes place in 4 full rounds. Otherwise, it takes 2d10+3 rounds.

The subject also regains 1d8+13 lost hit points. If the subject does not want to be healed, he can make a Fortitude save (DC 20) to negate the effect.

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *regeneration; Market Price:* 91,000 gp.
