# Hall of Chaos (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Chaos:** An aura of randomly patterned colors surrounds all chaotic characters in this stronghold space. This grants them a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. They also get spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and those cast by lawful creatures. They are also protected from possession and mental influence as per *[[Protection From Chaos (Spell)|protection from chaos]]*. If a lawful creature hits a protected character in melee, the attacker is [[Confused|confused]] for 1 round, as per the *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]* spell. A Will save (DC 22) negates this.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Cloak of Chaos (Spell)|cloak of chaos]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
