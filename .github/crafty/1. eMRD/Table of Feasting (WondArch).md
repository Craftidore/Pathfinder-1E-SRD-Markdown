# Table of Feasting (WondArch)
## Overview
**Table of Feasting:** This banquet table seats twelve and magically delivers three fantastic meals per day, each of which works as a *[[Heroes' Feast (Spell)|heroes’ feast]]*. Each feast requires an hour to eat, and any interruption of the feast ruins the effects.

*Caster Level:* 12th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Heroes' Feast (Spell)|heroes’ feast]]**; Market Price:* 43,200 gp.
