# S03 - Thinking in Three Dimensions
## Overview
**Thinking in Three Dimensions**

While flying creatures can add a third dimension to land-based combat, such creatures are an exception rather than the rule. The main challenge three-dimensional adventuring presents is representing a creature’s vertical position during combat. This challenge is tougher than usual because most flying in adventures still involves encounters relatively close to the ground, rather than in the open sky, but plenty of encounters in an underwater adventure may occur in open water, nowhere near the surface or bottom. Typical solutions for flying creatures like using stackable tokens or transparent dice boxes to elevate the flying creature all depend on the main map being a consistent bottom altitude, but in an underwater fight, the combatants could just as easily move farther down. One way to avoid physically representing the third dimension is to use your imagination instead of a battlemap, but given that’s it’s even harder to keep track of all three dimensions in your head, it becomes difficult to keep accurate relative distances that way. Another simple way to handle it is to mark a creature’s depth relative to its starting depth, either on a small token you move along with the creature or directly on the Pathfinder Flip-Mat. This solution doesn’t involve as much work as creating a complicated three-dimensional representation of the battle, but it isn’t always easy to judge the relative vertical position without looking at the numbers and thinking about them. In the end, use the solution that works best for you whether that’s judging distances in your head or crafting elaborate physical representations.

**Flanking:** All the usual rules for flanking still apply in three dimensions, but now there are far more ways for a target to potentially be flanked. It also means a larger number of weaker creatures can gang up on a stronger creature, since there are 26 valid spaces adjacent to a given square, rather than 8.

**Flexible Movement:** In a normal adventure, particularly before magical flight becomes easily accessible, it’s easier to predict a character’s exact path. For instance, on land, to get to a cave in the woods, the characters have to walk through the woods, and they are likely to use a forest trail that allows them to move quickly, rather than heading off into the deep foliage. Particularly in a dungeon, denizens can place traps with the expectation that characters will step in very particular places, and in all likelihood, a character will do so. However, underwater, all bets are off. If the PCs need to get to a cave in a kelp forest, they can just swim over the kelp forest until they are directly above the cave and then swim down, barely spending any time in the kelp forest at all. Even in an underwater dungeon, unless both the ceiling and walls narrow to 5 feet (which could be a giveaway that the characters are being channeled into a trap), the characters have significant more leeway in where they move, which means that dungeon denizens should set proximity traps covering a wider radius, rather than depending on a particular square. The third dimension also makes it harder to blockade or patrol a perimeter, since there are so many more ways to slip past; essentially, defenders are patrolling along the surface of a sphere instead of the perimeter of a circle.
