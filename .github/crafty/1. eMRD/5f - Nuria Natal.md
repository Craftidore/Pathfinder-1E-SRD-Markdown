# 5f - Nuria Natal
## Overview
**Nuria Natal**

The River Kingdom is a tranquil oasis of ancient knowledge. It is a festering cesspit of corruption. It is a well governed and harmonious land with a special place in the world—and its shadows are filled with ancient terrors.

As a land of opposites and millennial histories, Nuria Natal is difficult to pigeonhole. Its people are powerful and its priests and wizards especially so. Despite a dozen major attempts at conquest, the people of Nuria Natal have turned back the draconic tide, in some cases with ease, in others with a narrow margin and major losses. Its defenses are robust, and the people’s pride in their knowledge and achievements gives them a confidence that others mistake for arrogance.

The defenses of Nuria Natal are based on the nation’s close relationship with its gods. Aten, Horus, and Bastet are not figures worshiped from afar; they walk the earth when called, and their power has thrown the Mharoti dragons back in confusion several times.

However, the gods are fickle, and on many occasions they have refused to answer the entreaties of mortals. In these cases, the people resurrected some of their ancient kings, powerful heroes whose bodies had lain under the sands and in step-pyramid tombs for ages. These restored rulers led several brilliant defenses of Nuria Natal against the dragons as well. Afterward, though, the reborn rulers chose to stay and reassert themselves in Nurian politics. This has been awkward, to say the least, for the current king.

Nuria Natal is the home of the Southern Tongue, which seems especially suited for use in magic. Some spells and incantations known in the South are somehow never translated into the Trade Tongue, Northern, or Draconic speech.

## Government
**Government**

The current god-king, Thutmoses, is a somewhat besieged and worried man of middle years, with a prominent nose, shaved head, and a glorious beard woven with gold and mithral. Six of his kingly ancestors have been awoken from their tombs to defend the land against the Mharoti dragon-armies, and his own power has been eroded. One of the kings returned to his tomb beneath the great step pyramid, two were slain in battle with the dragon lords, and four still wander the kingdom: Queen-Goddess Meskhenit (NE female human lich wizard 18/cleric 2 \[Bastet]), God-King Set-Amun (LE outsider demigod magus 15/divine rank 0), God-Wizard Kuluma-Siris (CE lich wizard 16), and God-King Sut-Akhaman (LN human mummy cleric 19 \[Anu-Akma]). The most obvious sign of this erosion is the increasing independence of Per-Xor and Per Bastet, both of which still render tribute and troops to Nuria, but with increasingly loud complaints and a sense that perhaps the current god-king does not measure up to the standards of his illustrious ancestors.

Whatever the grumbling of the provinces and other major cities, though, the people of Nuria are entirely united in their defiance of foreign invasion, and their loyalty to Thutmoses is great. The other god-kings and queens might also be popular, but when the time comes to fend off great dangers, the current living king still holds his people’s hearts. The fact that he also controls the vast machinery of grain production, bread-making, and the loyalty of the matron-goddess Ninkash is surely also helpful to the king’s peace of mind.

## Nuria, City of the River
**Nuria, City of the River**

The capital is lined with monuments, domed temples, palm trees and thousands of houses built of dried river mud. The whole place sprawls for miles along the riverbank, and when the River Nuria floods, the city’s magic defends it from being entirely washed away.

### The Palm Palace of the God-King
**The Palm Palace of the God-King**

The palace contains an interior of interlinked courtyards shaded by enormous palms, and its walls are covered with vast amounts of thinly beaten gold—gold cursed, warded, and protected by divine sanction. Those who steal are invariably found dead, slain by walking statues, devoured down to scraps by gnoll avengers, or withered into dry husks that whisper the names of the god-kings in a never-ending stream of praise. Thefts are rare.

The palace interior includes courtyard gardens, terraces, storerooms, and working spaces for priests, accountants, scribes, and overseers as well as servants. All serve Thutmoses well and are proud of their station, and those who work in the palace are said to live longer and healthier lives than those who work elsewhere, since the divine favor of Nuria’s gods enriches the lives of all those near them.

The exceptions to this rule are those servants assigned to the Royal Serpent’s Courtyard, where the God-King Set-Amun has installed himself as an advisor and intriguer. Said to be the son of a slain serpent- god and a queen of the early dynasties, Set-Amun seems content for now to revel in his role as counselor and defender. He also has a keen eye for military affairs, and the current king fears his winning a second great victory against the Mharoti—which would raise Set-Amun’s status even further among the people.

### The Step Pyramids of Faizal
**The Step Pyramids of Faizal**

Nine pyramids— three of great kings, three for great queens, and three of dead demigods— stand along the river outside the city walls. These step pyramids are guarded by the priests of Anu-Akma and a cohort of gnoll guardians, and those who defile them by climbing the steps without proper purification are cut down on the spot. Two tombs were robbed long ages ago, one is recently resealed, and one is empty since its inhabitant was resurrected and died in battle.

### The Tombs of the God-Kings
**The Tombs of the God-Kings**

Dozens of mausoleums tended by priests and attendants stand in a secluded part of town. These tombs of the god-kings are unlike the step pyramids as they are guarded not just by traps and hideous beasts, but also by divine heralds and holy curses—and a few are even being rebuilt as throne chambers for the living gods, because some of these kings now live as mummies or in restored flesh. The place crawls with magic, demons, and danger.

The God-Wizard Kuluma-Siris maintains a tower here, and he issues orders for strange relics, objects, oils, stones, and other materials to be brought to him daily. The God-King Thutmoses says that Kuluma-Siris is enchanting new weapons and armor for the kingdom, but no one knows for certain.

### The Forest of Obelisks
**The Forest of Obelisks**

This city market serves as a place of debate, commerce, quick trysts, and quicker speeches. The bazaar sells all goods and is a market for slaves, servants, and laborers of all kinds, from dwarf smiths to gnoll caravan guards. The whole market is well organized by the priests of Horus, who assign each vendor a place for a small fee. The largest single stall is the Market-Church of Ninkash, whose priestesses bring barrels of holy ale and conduct services in the market daily.

### The Barge Souk of Nuria
**The Barge Souk of Nuria** 

Much of the city’s trade comes by river, and trade happens directly on the boats. The barge souk buys and sells in bulk: gallons of honey, oil, and beer, huge amphorae of wine, and enormous sacks of every grain and bean, as well as monumental stone blocks and even bone and ivory.

## Corremel, the City of Ale
**Corremel, the City of Ale**

As the breadbasket of Nuria, Corremel is a grain-producing wonder located in the river delta, and its fishing fleet is greatly skilled. Founded by minotaurs and ruled by the Priestess Ekibe of the Barley (CG female dwarf cleric 11 \[Ninkash]), the city is devoted to agriculture and brewing. The beer of Corremel slakes the thirsts of every Nurian in the delta, from peasant to king. The city is wealthy but not ostentatious, and it is one of the few that doesn’t host a reborn god-king.

## Per-Bastet, the City of Cats
**Per-Bastet, the City of Cats**

The goddess of cats made this city her home, and she walks here now with her gnoll admirers. The entire city is a vast home for tens of thousands of cats and gnolls, and humans claim they are increasingly unwelcome. The city’s ruler is the great-grandmother of the current King Thutmoses, who styles herself the Reborn Queen-Goddess Meskhenit, Mother of Destiny and Defender of the Realm (NE female human lich wizard 18/cleric 2 \[Bastet]). She turned back the tide of a Mharoti army near the ruins of Iram, City of Pillars, and since that time her hold on the region near Per-Bastet has been unshakable. She retains a harem of 15 young weretigers, who are said to have been gifts from a wealthy Khandiri prince.

The City of Per-Bastet is home to a vast array of caravans and three great temples: to Anu-Akma, to Horus, and the greatest of all to Bastet. The high priestess within the Dome of the Divine Face of Bastet is Nafrini (CN female human cleric 13 \[Bastet]), a black-skinned woman of surpassing beauty and gentleness. Her word commands the city’s armies of gnolls, and she and Meskhenit have a small rivalry going, expressed in feats of perfumery and the employment of magic against Nuria’s enemies.

## Per-Kush, City of Ivory
**Per-Kush, City of Ivory**

In the South, the oliphants, camelpards, hunting birds, and much stranger creatures yet are brought through Per-Kush, the City of Ivory. Its patron is the Hunter, and its people are dark-skinned and wise in the ways of wild creatures. Their camel caravans travel daily to the Kingdoms of Gold and Salt, and their river boats bring Nurian grain to the larger cities upriver. Per-Kush is not as large as Nuria, but it is swiftly growing rich and strong. Its elephant-god Abu is also gaining in adherents, as a water god and god of strength and wealth.

The dwarves of Per-Kush are peculiar, followers of Southern demons and their patron Ptah (Volund). One of these dwarves, Ashabtilach, calls himself a shellwright (a maker of automaton shells) but he builds constructs of enormous ambition, some of brass and iron, others including darker elements as demonic retrievers. So far, they serve the kingdom.

## Per-Xor, the City of the Sun
**Per-Xor, the City of the Sun**

Built only recently (within the last two centuries), Per-Xor is a city of faith and for the faithful, the home and center of the worship of Aten, the Sun God. It was greatly scarred 40 years ago, when Aten’s Prophet was martyred in the city’s central square. The Prophet’s Square is surrounded by four great Towers to the Sun, each with balconies for preachers and a sun-focusing glass at its peak. The square is the site of enormous public acts of devotion, from the humble Blessing of the Children in the late spring to the raucous Barley Harvest festival in the later summer and the Height of Aten frenzy of prayer and scourging of unbelievers in midsummer.

At the height of the rainy season, the Xorians build an enormous bonfire of palm wood, myrrh, and oils outside the Tomb of the Prophet, the holiest shrine of the city. Its fiery immolation is said to light the way for Aten’s return and triumph each year. The Tomb’s construction was begun 40 years ago and is not entirely completed; it is an elaborate structure of carved and enchanted marble and red granite.

The rulers of Per-Xor are the high priest and high priestess of Aten. They strive to keep the splinter cult of the Prophet from gaining equal status to Aten himself, but it is like interfering in a struggle between brothers. Zuberi, the Wise Keeper of Per-Xor, and Saint Hafsah, Golden Daughter of the Prophet, are a pair of grandparents with an enormous family of children, grandchildren, and relatives on every side. The high priest Zuberi maintains three lesser wives, each also a powerful woman commanding (respectively) the human, dwarf, and gnoll folk of Per-Xor. All the Ateni clan swear allegiance to King Thutmoses and the great Palm Palace of Nuria, but their first loyalty is clearly to their faith and missionary work. The followers of the Prophet Ra-Amon-Ra (see page 247) are less loyal to the king Thutmoses, and its most radical preachers speak of a rebellion and a new, holy dynasty.

## Adventures in Nuria Natal
**Adventures in Nuria Natal**

Adventures in the River Kingdom typically involve the ancient magic, undead, or power struggles among the god-kings.

- The God-Wizard wants a hair from a hero’s head—and also, feathers from a roc’s tail. Immediately.
- Crimson drakes have set fire to a grain barge in Corremel. Mharoti saboteurs are suspected.
- A cemetary has not rested easily lately, with ghosts rising up every night and devouring the living.
- Gnoll servants of Bastet need someone to help them with a perfume delivery. What could go wrong?
- A lesser courtesan of the god-king’s harem is missing. Some believe she has fled with her lover, a peculiar dwarf.
