# C03 - Bonds of Blood
## Overview
It was almost noon, and both men were staggering, leaning on their battleaxes now rather than swinging them, glowering at each other over the shattered remnants of their shields. They seemed to be suffering as much from sheer exhaustion as from the many wounds each bore, for they had been battling since dawn. Their injuries were for the most part ugly, gaping hacks, none of them very deep but all messily oozing blood, though each man’s right arm was also red and swollen from the sheer effort of wielding a heavy axe in combat for several hours.

‘You have a. . . strong arm, and a. . . quick foot, Ragnar, but Thora. . . Thora is mine. You’re in no. . . no state to go on. . . . Yield and go with honour. . . you have been a worthy foe.’

‘Ha! You should take a. . . look in the mirror, Eirik. . . though with that. . . that slice out of your. . . brow you’d not see much. . . but your own blood in. . . your eyes. I will not give up Thora. . .’

Both men were aware now of approaching hoofs. Confident that the terms of their honour duel would be respected, neither looked aside as the shaken rider reined in. ‘Eirik! Ragnar! Forget your battle! The farm is under attack, and Thora has been taken by the frost giants! They dragged her off, more dead than alive. . .’

The two former antagonists stared at one another for a moment longer, a flicker of understanding and agreement flashing between their eyes. Ragnar dropped his axe first, Eirik following suit a moment later. With a visible effort they stepped towards one another, drew their knives. Each man slashed his own palm. They clasped their right hands together.

‘Blood brothers it is, then. . .’

‘Some things, some few things are more important than love. . .’

‘We go against the giants, then, once the priest has seen to our wounds?’

‘Aye, and if only one of us returns. . .’

‘Then our quarrel is over, and he will bury the other with honour; but if we both return, with Thora?’

‘If we both return, Ragnar, we will let Thora choose, and we will still be blood brothers. . .’

‘Always.’

Almost every culture has tales of a barbarous rite in which two comrades slice open the flesh of the palms of their own hands, clasping them together to cement the bond of blood brotherhood. Usually fighting-men of some kind, and sometimes brought together after a period of initial adversity, they often swear blood brotherhood when facing a powerful adversary or perilous mission from which one or both will likely never return. Blood brotherhood transcends all other loyalties, to country, friend, family and lover alike.

On the few occasions when both warriors do survive victorious, their bond of blood brotherhood is everlasting, and even if they part company for many years their first loyalty will always be to one another. If only one survives, part of the deal is usually that he carries the news of his comrade’s death to any other concerned parties, before launching himself on a blood-feud to slay all who might have been even partially culpable for that death. If both die, most traditions have it that they will ascend to whatever warrior’s paradise they believed in together.

Blood brotherhood then is the most widely known and understood of the blood bonds. However, there are several others, all of a similar nature, and the creative practitioner of blood magic can create still more.

**Blood Brotherhood**

Simple swearing of blood brotherhood can be

done by anyone, whether they have formal blood

magic training or not – even a non-spellcaster.

Though this can create a strong bond, it is usually

of a very simple nature and is also vulnerable to

interference from someone who does have formal

blood magic training, who might use the link

created between the blood brothers to harm one by

capturing and torturing the other, or any number

of other vile practices (see pg 22, Abuse of Blood

Bonds).

Two combat-oriented characters who might

otherwise get married sometimes prefer to carry

out the blood brotherhood ritual, becoming bonded

far more deeply and fundamentally than would

happen with a typical religious wedding.

**Bloodrite: Blood Brotherhood**

**Components:** S, F

**Casting Time:** Two rounds

**Range:** Personal, plus see below

**Subject:** Self, plus see below

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** No

**Prerequisites:** Will save +4 or higher

**XP Cost to Learn:** 100 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 500 XP

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 1d3

*Blood brotherhood* must always be performed by

two ritualists simultaneously. Both must know

the bloodrite, and pay the usual costs involved.

If either bloodrite is interrupted by one ritualist

having his concentration broken, both bloodrites

automatically fail.

Once the ritual is complete, the two ritualists are

now blood brothers. A creature whose blood

brother is in an adjacent 5-feet square may use

the aid another action (see *Core Rulebook I*),

targeting his blood brother, once per round as a

free action. In addition, whenever they are within

sight of one another and both conscious, the two

blood brothers each gain a +2 morale bonus to

all Will saving throws. If either blood brother is

ever reduced to 3 or less hit points in combat, his blood brother may immediately go into a rage

as a free action. This rage functions exactly as a

barbarian’s Rage class feature (see *Core Rulebook*

*I*), though the character never gets the benefits of

Greater Rage or not being winded after the rage,

whatever his level.

If either blood brother attacks the other, the

attacker immediately sustains 1d6+1 permanent

damage to Charisma, and the blood brotherhood is

ended. This occurs even if the attack was caused

by a magical or other compulsion.

If either blood brother is killed, the remaining

blood brother suffers a -2 morale penalty to all

attack rolls, checks, and saving throws that are

not directly relate to his efforts to avenge his slain

blood brother until all who had any active hand in

the blood brother’s death are themselves dead.

No character can ever have more than one blood

brother at a time. In addition, a character who is

blood brothers with another may not join a blood

tribe. If a character’s blood brother is killed, he

may not perform this bloodrite again for at least

one year.

*Focus:* The ritualist’s dagger, which is used to cut

his hand.

**Blood Tribes**

A lesser-known practice than standard blood

brotherhood involves extending similar benefits to

a small group, rather than simply two ‘brothers.’

In this bloodrite, all participants stand in a circle

and slash open both their hands, then clasp them

together with those on either side of them; in this

way it is thought that all their blood flows together.

At one time it was common for all the male

warriors of certain tribes to use such a ritual

to bond together, though today the rite is more

usually employed by small mercenary groups and

similar fighting teams. It is still typically known

as the creation of a blood tribe, and indeed those

who undergo the ritual often feel far more like a

tribe afterwards than a mere military unit.

As the *blood tribe* bloodrite only lasts for one

year, it is usual for all the members of the tribe to

gather once more at the end of the year to perform

it again. Depending on the tribe, this may be on

some magically or spiritually significant day, or it

may be simply a matter of convenience.

**Bloodrite: Blood Tribe**

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One minute

**Range:** Personal, plus see below

**Subject:** Self, plus see below

**Duration:** One year

**Saving Throw:** None

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** No

**Prerequisites:** Will save +3 or higher

**XP Cost to Learn:** 50 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 100 XP per member of

blood tribe (for example, in a tribe of twelve, each

must pay 1200 XP)

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 1d6

This bloodrite is always performed by all

the proposed members of the *blood tribe*

simultaneously. All must know the bloodrite, and

pay the usual costs involved. If any ritualist’s

bloodrite is interrupted by one ritualist having

his concentration broken, all the bloodrites

automatically fail.

Once the ritual is complete, the all the ritualists are

now members of the same blood tribe. Once per

round, as a free action, a character may perform

the aid another action (see *Core Rulebook I*) as a

free action, so long as the target is a member of

the character’s blood tribe. In addition, whenever

all the surviving members of the tribe are all

within sight of one another, they each gain a +1

morale bonus to all Will saving throws.

No new creature can join the blood tribe until the

duration is ended and the tribe is ready to renew

its vows and perform the ritual once more.

If a character attacks a member of his own blood

tribe, the attacker immediately sustains 1d4+1

permanent damage to Charisma, and is no longer a

member of the blood tribe for any purposes. This

occurs even if the attack was caused by a magical

or other compulsion.

If a member of the blood tribe is killed, the

remaining blood members suffer a -1 morale

penalty to all attack rolls, checks, and saving throws that are do not directly relate to their

efforts to avenge the slain blood tribe member,

until all who had any active hand in the member’s

death are themselves dead.

No character may ever be a member of more than

one blood tribe at a time. In addition, a member

of a blood tribe may not have a blood brother.

*Focus:* The ritualist’s dagger, which is used to cut

both his hands.

**Drinkers of Blood**

Many secret societies create subtly powerful

bonds between the entire group, by having all of

them cut themselves, bleed into a cup or other

vessel, and consume a portion of the combined

liquid. The advantage of this from the leaders’

perspective is that newcomers to the society do not

necessarily realise quite how powerful this form

of blood magic is, or indeed that it is magical at

all, particularly if they originate from a civilised

society. Those from a more tribal background will

be very wary of such a practice, but in most cases

they are not the type targeted by the society’s

recruiters anyway. Often a ritualist will convince

the targets of the spell that what they are joining is

a blood tribe. The *bloody chalice* bloodrite is the

most common ritual of blood drinking.

Of course, vampires and certain other creatures

also drink blood, for quite different purposes. In

addition to the usual ill effects of having one’s

blood drunk by a vampire, a vampire who is also

a blood magician may in addition use the *bloody*

*tongue* bloodrite to create a blood bond with

its victims. The main use of this bloodrite is to

ensure there is a bond available for the vampire to

cast one or other of the more conventional arcane

spells listed later in this chapter, in the Abuse of

Blood Magic section.

**Bloodrite: Bloody Chalice**

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One round per subject

**Range:** See below

**Targets:** Up to one creature per level in highestlevel

arcane spellcaster class

**Duration:** One month plus 1d6 days

**Saving Throw:** See below

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** DC 15

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (blood magic) 6+

ranks, the ability to cast arcane spells of at least 2nd

level

**XP Cost to Learn:** 250 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 50 XP per target

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 1d3, plus see below.

This bloodrite allows the ritualist to bind a

number of other creatures to him, in the guise

of a religious or tribal ritual. He cuts himself,

usually on the forearm, bleeding into a cup. He

passes this around each of the intended targets.

If they are willing to cut themselves (also each

sustaining 1d3 damage, just as the ritualist did)

and mingle their blood with his in the cup, then

take a sip from the resulting mixture, they will find

themselves bound together in a similar manner to

a blood tribe (see above), but with a more sinister

consequence.

Each target that takes a sip is bound together with

all the targets and the ritualist for one month,

with the effect that whenever any of the targets is

within sight of the ritualist the target gains a +1

morale bonus to all attack rolls.

In addition, each target must make a Will saving

throw or become susceptible to the influence of

the ritualist. Failure at the saving throw means

the target suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to all

Sense Motive checks opposed to the ritualist’s

Bluff checks, as well as a -1 circumstance penalty

to all further Will saving throws against spells,

bloodrites, supernatural effects or spell-like effects

cast or activated by the ritualist. If the bloodrite

is repeated before the end of its duration, and the

same targets take sips from the cup and fail their

saving throws again, the above circumstance

penalties are increased by -2 and -1 respectively,

lasting for the duration of the most recently cast

*bloody chalice*.

For example, a ritualist casts *bloody chalice* on

four targets. All four fail their saving throws. As a

result, they all suffer a -2 circumstance penalty to

their Sense Motive checks opposing the ritualist’s

Bluff checks, and a -1 circumstance penalty to

their saving throws against his magic. A month

later, the ritualist casts *bloody chalice* on the same

four targets once more. This time, one of them

succeeds even despite the -1 penalty, so he no

longer suffers any penalties at all, though he still gains the +1 morale bonus to attack rolls while

in sight of the ritualist. The other three all fail,

so for the next month their penalties are -4 and -2

respectively. Again they still gain the +1 morale

bonus to attack rolls while in sight of the ritualist.

*Focuses:* An ornate cup or other vessel, costing at

least 500 gp, plus a ritual dagger for bloodletting,

costing at least 300 gp.

**Bloodrite: Bloody Tongue**

**Components:** S

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature from whom the vampire

drained blood at some time in the previous 24

hours

**Duration:** One month

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** No

**Prerequisites:** Must be a vampire and have the

ability to cast arcane spells of at least 2nd level

**XP Cost to Learn:** 500 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 25 XP

**Hp Cost to Perform:** None.

*Bloody tongue* allows the vampire to create

a telepathic blood bond with one creature it

has bitten. The vampire may communicate

telepathically with the target for the duration of

the spell, if it wishes, so long as the target creature

has an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, exactly as

though both were targeted by a *Rary’s telepathic*

*bond* spell.

**Blood Contracts**

More complex bonds than mere blood brotherhood

and its formulaic variants can involve detailed

contracts, with specific, magically enforceable

penalty clauses for specific breaches of contract.

An experienced blood magician can draft a

purpose-designed contract, in the mingled blood of

all the parties to the contract, with various clauses

and sub-clauses depending on the use to which

the contract is to be put. Blood contracts are

commonly used when creatures from the material

plane wish to make a deal with creatures from one

of the outer planes, though they can be used by

anyone and can take a wide variety of forms, from

a business partnership to the shared ownership of

some object of power to a slave contract.

Some blood magicians write *blood contracts*

exclusively for their own purposes, whereas others

write them to order for a suitably high fee. In the

latter case the fee is typically a minimum of 10

gold pieces per experience point lost (note that due

to the specialist nature of blood contracts this is

significantly higher than the usual cost for spells

with an experience point lost), plus any material

component costs required.

The sample contract given on pg19 costs 725

experience points to cast, broken down as follows:

2 x 50 = 100 XP for two subjects, plus 25 XP for

clause 5, 5 x 50 =250 XP for the 5th level spell in

clause 6, plus 7 x 50 = 350 XP for the 7th level

spell in clause 7. The ritualist will need to be

capable of casting both *feeblemind* and *finger of*

*death*, and must expend a total of 12,000 gp in

material components (5,000 gp for the 5th level

spell, 7,000 gp for the 7th level spell).

More primitive blood magicians, who may be

dealing commonly with folk who are not capable

of reading and understanding something so

complex as a blood contract, use a similarly

primitive variation on the blood contract known as

a blood oath.

**Bloodrite: Blood Contract**

**Components:** V, S, F, M

**Casting Time:** One hour

**Range:** See below

**Subjects:** Up to one creature per level in highestlevel

arcane spellcaster class

**Duration:** See below

**Saving Throw:** See below

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** DC 15 +1 per

clause in the contract.

**Prerequisites:** Knowledge (blood magic) 8+

ranks, the ability to cast arcane spells of at least 5th

level

**XP Cost to Learn:** 150 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 50 XP per subject, plus

additional experience points for each penalty

clause (see below)

**Hp Cost to Perform:** See below

*Blood contract* creates a formal, written contract

that can be written as the ritualist desires,

depending on the nature of the enterprise or

business the signatories wish to agree to. In form it is typically written very much like a legal

contract, so as to ensure that it is completely

unambiguous. The terms can be anything the

ritualist likes, so long as the signatories are willing

to sign it.

Anyone who signs the contract is one of the

subjects of the bloodrite. They may be willing or

unwilling – the bloodrite makes no distinction,

so long as they sign. The ritualist may be one of

the signatories, or not, as desired. Each signatory

to the contract must provide enough of his own

blood to equal 1d4 hit points or as many hit points

as there are pages in the contract, whichever is

greater. The ritualist need only sustain damage

and provide blood if he is one of the subjects

himself.

As part of the terms of the contract, the ritualist

may choose to include a variety of penalty clauses

from the following list, or as devised by the

ritualist with the agreement of the Games Master.

Each penalty clause costs the caster additional

experience points, as specified in the description

of each penalty clause. Penalty clauses can

relate only to specific breaches of the contract,

or alternatively all relevant penalty clauses can

be invoked at once for any breach whatsoever, as

desired.

† The character who breaches the contract

(hereafter referred to as the ‘breacher’) remains

bound by the terms of the contract, but other

signatories are no longer bound by the contract

with regards to the breacher. Additional cost: 25

XP.

† The breacher sustains 1d3 temporary

Wisdom damage per day until he is once more

abiding by the terms of the contract and has made

sufficient restitution to the injured party, as agreed

by all other signatories. Additional cost: 100 XP.

† The breacher sustains 1d6 or more damage

for each breach. In the case of an ongoing breach,

he sustains a like amount of additional damage

for each day beyond the first when he remains in

breach of the contract. Additional cost: 25 XP per

1d6 damage, to a maximum of 1d6 damage per

two caster levels.

† All signatories are automatically *teleported*

into the presence of the ritualist, including the

breacher, for an immediate and impromptu ‘court

session’ at which they may decide the fate of the

breacher. At the conclusion of the ‘court session’

as defined by the ritualist, all signatories are

automatically *teleported* back to their previous

locations. To add this penalty clause to a contract,

the ritualist must be able to cast the spell *teleport*.

Additional cost: 250 XP.

† The breacher is immediately targeted by

one of the following spells, specified during the

casting of the bloodrite: *suggestion*, *emotion*,

*lesser geas*, *phantasmal killer*, *contagion*,

*enervation*, *polymorph other*, *dismissal*,

*feeblemind*, *geas*, *banishment*, *finger of death*,

*maze*, *trap the soul*, *polymorph any object*,

*imprisonment*¸ *energy drain*. To add this penalty

clause to a contract, the ritualist must be able

to cast the relevant spell. Any decisions that

must normally be made on casting the spell

must be made while casting this bloodrite, and

incorporated into the finished contract. The spell

may be activated any number of times, whenever

an appropriate breach occurs. Additional cost: 50

XP per level of spell, plus any additional XP that

must usually be expended on casting the spell,

plus additional material components in the form of

incense amounting to 1,000 gp per level of spell.

A blood magician who has become a signatory

to a *blood contract* (whether or not he cast the

bloodrite in the first place) and who knows the

*blood contract* bloodrite can attempt to remove

one of the penalty clauses from the contract. Each

attempt to do so costs him 5 experience points

for each experience point the original ritualist

paid to include that clause; for example, a blood

magician who had signed a contract including

the teleportation clause must pay 5 x 250 = 1250

experience points to attempt to remove the clause.

The attempt requires a Will saving throw, DC

determined by the power of the original ritualist

as usual for bloodrites (see pg 11). Success

indicates that the desired clause, in its entirety, is

permanently removed from the contract. Failure

indicates that the blood magician expends the

experience points, but to no avail. Note that it

is common practice to include a penalty clause

penalising any attempt to remove one or more

penalty clauses from the contract! 

Note that once the contract is written and the

bloodrite cast, it is binding, whatever happens to

the original, physical contract itself.

*Focus:* An inkpot and sharpened pen inlaid with

rubies and red gold, to a value of at least 600 gp

each.

*Material Component:* A blank piece of parchment

or paper for each subject. This is not destroyed

during the bloodrite, but it is written on to form

the final contract.

**Sample Contract**

**Bloodrite: Blood Oath**

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One hour

**Range:** See below

**Subjects:** Up to one creature per two levels in

highest-level arcane spellcaster class

**Duration:** See below

**Saving Throw:** See below

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** DC 14

Prerequisites: Knowledge (blood magic) 4+ ranks,

the ability to cast arcane spells of at least 3rd level

**XP Cost to Learn:** 100 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 50 XP per subject

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 1d4

The *blood oath* is traditionally used by barbarian

tribes and other savages to solidify an agreement

that would not fall into one of the categories

covered by the other blood bonds. This could

be anything from a business deal to a marriage

contract. All the participants must slash their

arms, spilling 1d4 hit points’ worth of their blood

onto the bloodrite’s focus, a gold arm-ring.

In general a *blood oath* is treated very similarly

to a *blood contract*, but its terms must be a great

deal simpler, so that it can be defined in at most

100 words. Penalty clauses need not be discussed as part of this 100-word limit, because all *blood*

*oaths* share the same penalty clause. Likewise the

participants’ names need not be included, as any

who spill their blood on the bloodrite’s arm-ring

focus are considered to swear the oath.

Any who break their side of the deal immediately

begin to lose face within the community, as well

as losing their own self-confidence. The oathbreaker

suffers 1d4 temporary Charisma damage

per day until he can make suitable recompense

to the satisfaction of all other participants. This

Charisma damage is not recovered, and cannot

be healed by any means, until the recompense is

made.

The duration of a blood oath must be defined

in terms that are reasonably easy for all its

participants to comprehend and abide by. Typical

durations are: ‘until the sun’s rays dawn once

more,’ ‘until the next new moon,’ ‘until first frost

of the coming winter,’ ‘until the summer solstice,’

or similarly simple, seasonally tied timescales.

Note that unlike the *blood contract* spell, the

ritualist may never himself be involved in

swearing the *blood oath*. It is crucial that the

ritualist retain neutral status with regard to the oath and its participants, for he may be called

upon later to resolve any disputes that are too

minor to be considered breaches of the bloodrite.

*Focus:* A gold arm-ring retained by the ritualist,

weighing one pound and worth at least 1,000 gp.

Each arm-ring can be used to swear up to twelve

blood oaths.

**Bonds of Death**

Among warrior cultures and primitive tribes,

blood feuds are one of the best-known pieces of

blood magic, along with the aforementioned blood

brotherhood ritual. By declaring a blood feud,

the ritualist makes a firm commitment to devote

his life to slaying a particular individual. He will

do nothing that is not totally dedicated to that end

until it is achieved. This is very common among

many tribes or savage countries as a means of

achieving revenge for a slain kinsman or close

comrade.

The inclusion of a blood feud among other blood

bonds may seem curious, though it is as strong a

bond as any other, even that between two blood

brothers. Once the ritualist declares a blood

feud, he is irrevocably bound to the target of the

bloodrite, until that target is dead. Note that this

can lead to some intriguing possibilities when

it comes to exploitation of the blood bond (see

Abuse of Blood Bonds, pg 22).

Scholars attempting to categorise bloodrites

typically classify the *bleeding test* rite along with

the *blood feud* as Bonds of Death. The bleeding

test is well-known among the barbarian tribes

and even in many civilised villages. It is useful

in any place in which there are few possible

suspects for a murder, since it would hardly be

practicable to test every inhabitant in a large city.

By exploiting the blood bond that inevitably exists

between a murder victim and his killer, it allows

the experienced blood magician to prove who

committed the murder.

**Bloodrite: Blood Feud**

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One minute

**Range:** See below

**Target:** One creature

**Duration:** One day

**Saving Throw:** No

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** None

**Prerequisites:** Will save +7 or higher

**XP Cost to Learn:** 50 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 500 XP

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 2d6

The ritualist must declare one creature the target.

Traditionally this should be someone who has

done him great wrong; if, at the Games Master’s

discretion, this is not the case, the ritual will

automatically fail, but the hit point and experience

point costs will still be paid. In addition, the *blood*

*feud* should be cast as soon as possible after the

target does the ritualist a great wrong, or at least

as soon as possible after the ritualist discovers it;

again it will simply fail if this is not the case.

When in combat with the target, the ritualist gains

a +4 morale bonus to his melee attack rolls, and

+1d6 damage to each melee attack he makes.

If the ritualist does not slay the target before the

spell’s duration ends, he may cast *blood feud*

again, at half the usual costs in experience points

and hit points. This only applies if at the Games

Master’s discretion the ritualist made every effort

to find and kill the target throughout the spell’s

duration, otherwise the usual costs apply to any

recasting. If he elects not to cast *blood feud* again,

or if the target of the spell is killed by some other

means rather than by the ritualist, the ritualist

loses one full level, just as if he had been raised by

a *raise dead* spell.

*Focus:* The ritualist’s dagger, which is used to cut

his arms and chest.

**Bloodrite: Bleeding Test**

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One round

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature/rank in Knowledge (blood

magic)

**Duration:** One round/rank in Knowledge (blood

magic)

**Saving Throw:** No

**Knowledge (blood magic) Check:** DC 15

**Prerequisites:** The ability to cast at least one

arcane magic Divination spell of 2nd level or higher

**XP Cost to Learn:** 100 XP

**XP Cost to Perform:** 0 XP

**Hp Cost to Perform:** 1d3

It is said that if a murderer touches the corpse of

his victim, the corpse will begin to bleed once

more, as though recognising its slayer. The

basis of this old superstition is, of course, the

*bleeding test*, which can be a powerful tool for any

investigator or tribal law-speaker.

When this bloodrite is cast, the ritualist touches

one or more murder suspects. If the targets then

touch the murder victim one at a time, it will

begin to bleed in an obvious manner as soon as the

murderer (if any) touches it. This occurs however

the victim was killed, even if slain indirectly or

by magic. Furthermore, even if he was somehow

drained of all blood he will bleed nonetheless.

Of course it is usually necessary to use other

means to compel the suspect or

suspects to touch the murder

victim, but in most cases a

refusal to co-operate on

the part of the suspect

can be take as a

reasonably clear

indication of guilt.

Whether or not

this indication is

enough to secure a

conviction or

punishment is very

much dependent

on the nature of the court or other authority in

the community – in the more primitive tribes it is

quite common for the tribal shaman’s word to be

very nearly law in any case.

Note that for purposes of the various spells

listed in the Abuse of Blood Bonds section, this

bloodrite does not establish a connection between

the ritualist and any of the suspects, or bond the

suspects to one another. Rather, it exploits an

already existing blood bond which connects ever

murderer with their victim.

*Focuses:* The ritualist’s dagger, which is used to

cut his arms and chest.

**Abuse of Blood**

**Bonds**

As will have been seen earlier in this chapter, there

are several ways a creative blood magician can

potentially use blood bonds for his own sinister

ends; indeed, *bloody chalice* and *blood contract* almost seem designed with abuse in mind. In

addition, it is possible for an experienced blood

magician to make use of the ‘magical link’ which

connects together any creatures that are affected

by the same blood bond.

This is done through the use of various spells,

as follows. Note that these are all conventional

arcane magic spells, not bloodrites.

**Blood Doll**

*Necromancy*

**Level:** Sorcerer/Wizard 3

**Components:** V, S, F

**Casting Time:** One hour

**Range:** See below

**Target:** One creature

**Duration:** One day

**Saving Throw:** See below

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

In this variation on traditional ‘voodoo dolls,’

‘corn dollies,’ or ‘poppets,’ the ritualist makes use

of the living body of one of the participants in a

blood bond to injure or otherwise harm another

one of the participants.

While a *blood doll* spell is in effect, any hit point

damage or ability damage sustained by the spell’s

focus is also sustained by the target, who may

attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage.

Note that diseases or poisons affecting the focus

will not directly affect the target, except for any

ability damage they may cause. Thus such spells

as *neutralise poison* or *remove disease*, or use of

the Heal skill to treat disease or poison, will not

affect the target, though they would have the usual

effect if used on the focus.

*Focus:* One creature, who must have a blood

bond of some kind with the target (a blood bond

is defined as any of the bloodrites listed in this

chapter).

**Blood Summoning**

*Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting]*

**Level:** Sorcerer/Wizard 2

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** See below

**Target:** One creature of 7 or fewer Hit Dice

**Duration:** See below

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

A blood summoning places a magical command

on a creature to begin immediately travelling

towards the caster at its best possible speed. The

creature must have 7 or fewer HD and the caster

must share a blood bond with the target. This

blood bond can be any of the bloodrites listed in

this chapter.

The summoned creature moves as fast as is

reasonably possible, not necessarily forced

marches, but not travelling in any other direction

or stopping longer than is needed to rest briefly. If

the subject is prevented from travelling towards

the caster for a whole day, he suffers a -1 penalty

on each ability score. Each day, another -1 penalty

accumulates, up to a total of -5. Ability scores are

not reduced below 1. The ability penalties end 1

day after the character resumes travelling towards

the caster.

A blood summoning (and all ability penalties) can

be removed by a remove curse, limited wish, wish,

miracle, or break enchantment spell. As soon

as the subject gets within 10 ft. of the caster, the

blood summoning ends.

**Greater Blood Summoning**

*Enchantment (Compulsion) \[Mind-Affecting]*

**Level:** Sorcerer/Wizard 5

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** See below

**Target:** One creature

**Duration:** See below

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

A greater blood summoning works exactly as a

blood summoning, except that there is no limit

on the target hit dice. Furthermore it may only

be removed with a limited wish, wish, or miracle

spell.
