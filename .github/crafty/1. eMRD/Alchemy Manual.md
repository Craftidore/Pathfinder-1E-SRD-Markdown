# Alchemy Manual
## Overview
**Alchemical Reagents**

The following reagents are purified through long processes from their raw states for use in alchemical recipes. Each alchemical reagent may also be used as an alchemical power component, augmenting the effects of certain spells when used as an additional material component. Alchemical power components were first introduced in Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer’s Armory. Using a reagent as an alchemical power component requires a number of doses of the reagent, affects only spells that meet the listed criteria, and augments only an effect the spell already produces (for example, you can use black powder as an alchemical power component only for a spell that deals energy damage). Reagents do not stack with either themselves or one another, and are expended after use.
