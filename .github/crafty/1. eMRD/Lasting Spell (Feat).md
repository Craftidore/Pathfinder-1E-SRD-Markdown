# Lasting Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You can make a spell last all day.

**Prerequisite:** [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]].

**Benefit:** Spells with a fixed or personal range can have their duration increased to 24 hours. Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged. You don’t need to maintain concentration on lasting *detect* spells (such as *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]*) for you to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the subject detected, but gaining additional information requires concentration as normal.

A lasting spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pg. 81

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from Persistent Spell to Lasting Spell to avoid duplication.

*House Rule:* Touch spells (per WotC forums) are considered fixed range spells; while any spell with a range of xx+yy/level) is not.
