# Infernal (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Infernal**

Somewhere in your family’s history, a relative made a deal with a devil, and that pact has inf luenced your family line ever since. In you, it manifests in direct and obvious ways, granting you powers and abilities. While your fate is still your own, you can’t help but wonder if your ultimate reward is bound to the Pit.

**Class Skill**: [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]].

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Protection From Good (Spell)|protection from good]]* (3rd), *[[Scorching Ray (Spell)|scorching ray]]* (5th), *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* (7th), *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]* (9th), *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]* (11th), *[[Planar Binding (Spell)|planar binding]]* (devils and creatures with the fiendish template only) (13th), *[[Teleport, Greater (Spell)|greater teleport]]* (15th), *[[Power Word Stun (Spell)|power word stun]]* (17th), *[[Meteor Swarm (Spell)|meteor swarm]]* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]], [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], [[Deceitful (Feat)|Deceitful]], [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]], [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]], [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[planes]), [[Spell Penetration (Feat)|Spell Penetration]].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the charm subschool, increase the spell’s DC by +2.

**Bloodline Powers**: You can draw upon the power of Hell, although you must be wary of its corrupting influence. Such power does not come without a price.

*Corrupting Touch (Sp)*: At 1st level, you can cause a creature to become [[Shaken|shaken]] (see page 568) as a melee touch attack. This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). Creatures shaken by this ability radiate an aura of evil, as if they were an evil outsider (see *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]*). Multiple touches do not stack, but they do add to the duration. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Infernal Resistances (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist fire 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws made against poison. At 9th level, your resistance to fire increases to 10 and your bonus on poison saving throws increases to +4.

*Hellfire (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can call down a column of hellfire. This 10-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of fire damage per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Ref lex save for half damage. Good creatures that fail their saves are [[Shaken|shaken]] for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This power has a range of 60 feet.

*On Dark Wings (Su)*: At 15th level, you can grow fearsome bat wings as a standard action, giving you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. The wings can be dismissed as a free action.

*Power of the Pit (Su)*: At 20th level, your form becomes infused with vile power. You gain immunity to fire and poison. You also gain resistance to acid 10 and cold 10, and the ability to see perfectly in darkness of any kind to a range of 60 feet.
