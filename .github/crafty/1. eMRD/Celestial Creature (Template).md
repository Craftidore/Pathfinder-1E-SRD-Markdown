# Celestial Creature (Template)
## Overview
Celestial creatures dwell in the higher planes, but can be summoned using spells such as *summon monster* and *[[Planar Ally (Spell)|planar ally]]*. A celestial creature’s CR increases by +1 only if the base creature has 5 or more HD. A celestial creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the same.

**Challenge Rating:** +0 or +1.

**Rebuild Rules**: **Senses** gains darkvision 60 ft.; **Defensive Abilities** gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; **SR** gains SR equal to new CR +5; **Special Attacks** smite evil 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against evil foes; smite persists until target is dead or the celestial creature rests).

**Celestial Creature Defenses**


| **Hit Dice** | **Resist Acid, Cold,** <br>**and Electricity** | **DR** |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | 5 | — |
| 5–10 | 10 | 5/evil |
| 11+ | 15 | 10/evil |
