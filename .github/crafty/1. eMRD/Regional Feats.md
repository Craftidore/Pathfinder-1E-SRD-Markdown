# Regional Feats
## Overview
A regional feat is a feat that represents a special, exclusive capability or talent found among the people of a particular place, ethnicity, or other specialized grouping. Regional feats are identified by the “Regional” designation following the name of the feat.

Each regional feat specifies one or more character race and region combinations as prerequisites. To select such a feat, your character must meet one such set of prerequisites. For example, to select a feat whose regional prerequisite is Dwarf (Spine of the World), your character must be a dwarf whose home region is the Spine of the World.

When you choose a home region during character creation, you can select one regional feat from the list available to characters of your homeland. Even if you can choose more than one feat at 1st level (a human or strongheart halfling gets two feats at 1st level), you can never have more than one regional feat.

Regional feats are not bonus feats; you must use normal feat slots to select them.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Consider disregarding the final line with regard to Regional feats not being bonus feats. With the incredibly large number of feats available, giving a regional feat as a bonus feat is not overpowered and can provide an incentive for players to provide a deeper backstory. Feel free to adjust the regional prequisites as needed based on your campaign world.

*House Rule:* In campaigns where no regional feats are used, the above feats can be used as general feats.
