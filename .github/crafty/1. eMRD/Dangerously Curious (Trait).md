# Dangerously Curious (Trait)
## Overview
**Dangerously Curious:** You have always been intrigued by magic, possibly because you were the child of a magician or priest. You often snuck into your parent's laboratory or shrine to tinker with spell components and magic devices, and frequently caused quite a bit of damage and headaches for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] checks, and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] is always a class skill for you.
