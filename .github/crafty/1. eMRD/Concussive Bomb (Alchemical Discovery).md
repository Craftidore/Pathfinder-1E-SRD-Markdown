# Concussive Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Concussive Bomb\*:* When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inf lict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.
