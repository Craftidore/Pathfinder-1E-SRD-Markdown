# Proof against Vermin (WondArch)
## Overview
**Proof against Vermin:** This stronghold space cannot be entered by vermin with 2 or fewer HD. Vermin with 3 or more HD can only enter the space if they make a Will save (DC 16). Even if the vermin makes the save, it takes 2d6 points of damage. Pressing against the barrier causes enough pain to drive away nonaggressive vermin.

Builders often employ this wondrous architecture in the lower levels of a stronghold, which tend to be more vulnerable to invasion by vermin. Some stronghold owners include this on their bedchambers and their kitchens as well.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Repel Vermin (Spell)|repel vermin]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
