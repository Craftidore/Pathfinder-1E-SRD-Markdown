# Reining in Magical Crafting
## Overview
The crafter of a magical item loses 1hp permanently. This hp may NEVER be regained; not even through *wishes* or *miracles*. 

It 'might' be possible to use someone else's though; cf. *[[Transference (Spell)|transference]]* spell.

The hp loss cannot be ameliorated by the use of temporary hit points from either items or spells (temporary or permanent).
