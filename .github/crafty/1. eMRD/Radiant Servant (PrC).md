# Radiant Servant (PrC)
## Overview
[[Pelor]] teaches demonstrating the strength of good through charity and modesty. While it seems a contradiction, the point is that the truly strong don’t need to prove their power. [[Pelor]] urges his priests and their flocks to perform so many good acts that evil has no room to exist, but he acknowledges that there are times when evil must be defeated in direct confrontation. The radiant servants of [[Pelor]] put this dogma into living practice. As the name implies, the brothers and sisters of the radiant servants of [[Pelor]] are sworn to serve—to minister to the needs of [[Pelor]]’s followers and goodhearted people everywhere. While combating evil, particularly undead, is an important part of that service, it is by no means the only part. 

Radiant servants of [[Pelor]] are healers, counselors, sources of spiritual and (at times) financial support, and protectors.

Almost all radiant servants of [[Pelor]] spend their prior careers as clerics. Some are multiclassed cleric/paladins or cleric/rangers, or even the occasional cleric/druid.

NPC radiant servants of [[Pelor]] can be found wherever there is human need—in the midst of plague and famine, behind the lines of an army at war, in villages plagued by hauntings, and in cities troubled by crime.

**Adaptation:** As mentioned in the introduction to the chapter, this prestige class doesn’t have to be about [[Pelor]]. It works just as well with any god of the sun whose clerics often turn undead, and given the Sun domain’s granted power, it’d be a strange sun-god that didn’t want his clerics turning undead.

**Hit Die:** d6.

**CLASS FEATURES**

All of the following are class features of the radiant servant of Pelor prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Radiant servants of Pelor are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all armor, and with shields.

**Radiance:** When a radiant servant of Pelor casts any spell with the light descriptor, the radius of illumination is doubled, and the spell is treated as if it were one level higher than it actually is for all purposes, including determining whether it can counter or dispel a spell with the darkness descriptor. Thus, a *daylight* spell cast by a radiant servants sheds light in a 120-foot radius and is treated as a 4th-level spell, allowing it to counter or dispel any darkness spell of 4th level or lower.

**Extra Greater Turning:** The radiant servant of Pelor can perform a greater turning (the granted power of the Sun domain) a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** When a new radiant servant of Pelor level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of radiant servant of Pelor to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and spells known accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which he could cast 1st-level divine spells before he became a radiant servant of Pelor, the player must decide which class to assign each level of radiant servant of Pelor for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**Turn Undead:** A radiant servant of Pelor adds his radiant servant class levels to his cleric levels for all purposes related to turning undead.

**Divine Health (Ex):** A radiant servant of Pelor who is at least 2nd level is immune to all diseases, including magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy.

**Empower Healing (Ex):** When a radiant servant of Pelor of at least 2nd level casts a domain spell from the Healing domain, that spell is affected as though by the Empower Spell feat. This spell does not use up a higher-level slot.

**Aura of Warding (Su):** Starting at 3rd level, a radiant servant and all allies within 10 feet of him gain a +2 morale bonus on all Will saving throws.

**Bonus Domain:** A radiant servant who reaches 5th level is granted another of Pelor’s domains as a third cleric domain, or he can choose the Glory or Purification domain. He can use the granted power of the new domain, and he can choose from the spell lists of three domains when selecting his domain spells for the day.

**Maximize Healing (Ex):** When a radiant servant of Pelor who is at least 6th level casts a domain spell from the Healing domain that spell is affect as though by the Maximize Spell feat. The spell does not use up a higher-level slot. This power supersedes the empower healing ability until the character reaches 10th level.

**Positive Energy Burst (Su):** As a standard action, a radiant servant of Pelor who is at least 8th level can create a positive energy burst that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level to all undead creatures within 100 feet of the character. Undead are allowed a Reflex save (DC equal to 10 + the class level of the radiant servant) to avoid half the damage. This supernatural ability uses up two turning attempts. A radiant servant cannot use this ability if he has fewer than two turning attempts left for the day.

**Supreme Healing (Ex):** When a radiant servant of Pelor who is at least 10th level casts a domain spell from the Healing domain, that spell is affected as though by both the Empower Spell and the Maximize Spell feats. The spell does not use up a higher-level slot.
