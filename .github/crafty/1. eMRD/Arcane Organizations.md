# Arcane Organizations
## Overview
In a world where a relative few possess the ability to slay with a word, to bend the masses to their will, or to gather the secret intelligence that might topple thrones, it’s only natural for others to seek to steal that power for themselves or suppress its spread. In response, wizards and other spellcasters often find it advantageous to create associations dedicated to furthering their art and skill.

An arcane organization offers many advantages to a typical spellcaster, including its availability as a resource for study and research that allows wizards and other arcanists who keep spellbooks to acquire new spells at no (or low) cost. For arcanists active in magical trade, an organization offers a potential network of buyers and sellers for weapons, wondrous items, and valuable arcane lore. More important, an organization can provide a spellcaster with protection. Powerful wizards guilds serve to shield mages from persecution by those who resent or fear their power.

## Wizards Guilds
**Wizards Guilds**

In general terms, a guild is a professional association whose primary concern is fostering the best possible environment for those who follow a particular trade. Skilled artisans and experts of all kinds form guilds in various lands; while mages are fewer in number, their professional needs are much the same. While people generally refer to such organizations as “wizards guilds,” the term is often a misnomer; many guilds make no distinction between arcane spellcasters of different classes. Alternatively, some guilds are exclusively made up of a single type of nonwizard spellcaster, and are dedicated to that class’s specific needs.

Guilds usually charge a steep membership fee (often 10 to 100 gp in monthly dues) in addition to a fee to join. In return, a new member gains the sanction of the guild when casting spells for pay, creating magic items for sale, and engaging in other commercial arcane enterprises. A guild often owns a hall, tower, or retreat where members can reside (at least on a temporary basis), store valuable but unwieldy laboratory equipment, or make use of a common library. Any mage belonging to a guild can use the guild’s facilities (generally at nominal cost) for magic item creation and spell research.

Some of the most common sorts of wizards guilds include the following.

*Protective Guilds:* Guilds formed in order to protect arcane spellcasters against the suspicion and distrust of nonwizards are dedicated to the preservation of knowledge and the study of the art of magic. Guilds of this sort exist to check the otherwise overwhelming power that a crusading church or suspicious tyrant might bring to bear against the practicing arcanists of a realm.

*Regulatory Guilds:* These guilds are formed to provide a legal and recognized forum for arcane study, most often in lands that have stern laws prohibiting the practice of arcane magic by those who don’t belong to a sanctioned organization. Under such systems, arcanists are strongly encouraged to police their own ranks, defending the prerogatives and entitlements of their guild as they fulfi ll their obligation to the ruling powers of the land that grant them the privilege to study magic.

*Secret Cabals:* Operating below the level of the many guilds that exist to regulate and protect arcane spellcasters, a small number of sinister cabals are dedicated to establishing the primacy of arcane spellcasters over all other folk (or, in an antimagocracy, to keeping the persecuted art of free spellcasting alive). Like other types of wizards guilds, secret cabals offer their members collective protection against their enemies, access to magical lore and items, and prospective allies and hirelings. Unlike the open guilds, though, few of these conspiracies openly proclaim their sometimes dark or illicit goals.

## Societies and Orders
**Societies and Orders**

Guilds are associations of mages bound by profession, but groups of arcanists often come together for other purposes, creating a unique society or order dedicated to a particular cause. The demeanor and activities of particular societies or orders vary significantly with their purposes, but because those purposes generally go beyond the simple advancement of arcane knowledge, societies and orders are often less useful than true wizards guilds for acquiring and sharing arcane lore.

Arcane orders don’t normally have special resources such as laboratories or libraries, but neither do they generally charge dues of any sort. Because they have chosen to take up a common cause with their fellows, the members of an order tend to be more than willing to ally with or otherwise assist fellow members (often sharing knowledge and resources on an individual basis).

In some cases, arcane spellcasters might belong to a larger society incorporating different classes, often with a specific cultural or political mandate. For example, an elven kingdom might be home to the Knights of the White Arrow, an order of arcane archers and rangers who serve as elite guards and agents to the elven king.

## Schools and Colleges
**Schools and Colleges**

Becoming an arcanist is rarely as straightforward a process as simply deciding one day to start casting spells. Most arcane characters begin their training as children or young teenagers, spending several years engaged in tedious and difficult studies before being able to successfully cast even the simplest cantrips. Finding the necessary training in the arcane arts is never easy, and many people who might have become skilled mages never follow the arcane path for lack of any opportunity to learn the fundamental skills. Some sorcerers and wizards apprentice themselves to an older, more experienced spellcaster with the time and patience to instruct them, while others enroll in wizard schools or colleges to obtain a formal education in the magical arts.

Wizard colleges run the gamut from royal academies training warmages for the realm’s armies to private schools where the children of nobles learn to tap the power of the arcane arts; from spontaneous classes for the talented youngsters in an elf community to remote towers in which promising children are evaluated as potential members of a secret arcane order. Some schools require a prince’s ransom in tuition, while others teach any and all who can demonstrate even minor magical talent. Still others offer instruction in the expectation that young mages will repay their education with years of unquestioning service.

## Mentors
**Mentors**

As with any art requiring extensive amounts of training and considerable time to master, the knowledge of magic is often passed from one generation to the next by means of a long apprenticeship. The master–apprentice relationship is a time-honored tradition among arcane spellcasters. As with any more mundane vocation, the challenges of arcane apprenticeship begin with finding an experienced mage with an interest in teaching. While few arcanists feel any obligation to take on the task of instructing a neophyte in the ways of magic, most mages (even evil ones) feel at least a vague sense of duty to the arcane arts themselves, and they understand the wisdom of passing on some of their own learning to those who will follow them.

At the same time, even the most willing masters feel entitled to seek some compensation for taking on an apprentice, from the mundane (payment in gold to train the daughter of a wealthy merchant) to the influential (gifts of office or property for mentoring the child of a local lord) to the sinister (the complete and abject servitude of an apprentice from a family otherwise too poor to pay). Evil mages in particular often command the allegiance of their apprentices for years after their formal training ends. While neutral mages usually place less onerous conditions on the teaching of their lore, most will at least ensure that their costs and time are adequately covered while the apprentice in question works hard to earn his keep. Only the most charitable of good mages considers mentoring an apprentice for free.

Even after a relationship is established, the quality of instruction can vary widely from master to master, and, as many hopeful mages have learned, the most powerful wizards are not necessarily the best mentors. Often, a lowlevel spellcaster with patience and a willingness to give of his time and attention makes a better master than an imperious, inattentive archmage quicker to punish than instruct.
