# Blood Magus (PrC)
## Overview
Death is the ultimate risk that spellcasters, like all adventurers,

must contend with. Some are cut down before they

have a chance at true glory; others fi nd true peace only in

the afterlife; and others are brought back from death by

companions with the powerful magical resources to perform

such a miracle. For a rare few such arcanists, this trip

to the great beyond and back brings a new enlightenment—

a comprehension of the body and its individual parts that

transcends the understanding of those who have not experienced

death and returned to tell the tale.

These newly raised spellcasters say that the fi rst sound

they hear upon returning to life is the pulse of life-giving

blood in their veins. To these fortunate few, this fl ow of blood

through their veins is sweet music: the sound of life. They

can feel it reenergizing every particle of their form, fl ushing

death away and leaving life in its place. It is thick and warm,

and they greedily embrace it.

Such arcane spellcasters become blood magi: formerly

deceased spellcasters who, when returned to life, gain an

understanding of their blood’s importance, bequeathed by

their close call. They learn to evoke magic from this vital

fl uid that sustains their lives. Blood magi cannot be trained,

owing to the unusual nature of their enlightenment, and

they are most likely to have fi rst been sorcerers.

NPC blood magi are thus rarely, if ever, found in groups.

They are more likely to be thinly scattered throughout a

region’s spellcaster population.

Adaptation: A twist on the blood magus as presented here

would be to tie the class to some deity or entity. Whenever

the blood magus works his blood magic, he also gives blood

sacrifi ce to the deity or entity so named, and it is through

this bloody patron that the blood magus powers his magic.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the blood magus

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Blood magi gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level except 5th

and 10th, a blood magus gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding

the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such as

the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more

than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a blood

magus, he must decide to which class to add each level for the

purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Blood Component (Su): A blood magus can substitute

a drop of his own blood for a spell’s material components, if

any, and in so doing increase the spell’s power. The pinprick

or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action (just like using material components) that becomes a normal

part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of

damage to the blood magus but raises the spell’s caster level

by 1. Damage reduction, if the character has any, doesn’t apply

to this damage.

If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1

gp), the component must still be provided. If a spell has no

material component, a blood magus can still use this ability

to enhance a spell if he desires.

Durable Casting (Ex): A blood magus has a knack for

being able to concentrate on casting spells and maintaining

them despite taking damage while doing so. For the purpose

of making a Concentration check to cast, concentrate on,

or direct a spell when he might be distracted by damage, a

blood magus subtracts his level from any hit point damage

dealt to him by an attack that strikes him during the action

(or whenever he is subject to a source of continuous damage,

such as *Melf’s acid arrow*). A blood magus still takes all the

damage dealt to him, but the damage is less likely to affect his

ability to cast, concentrate on, or direct spells successfully.

For example, a 1st-level blood magus can “ignore” 1 point

of damage from each source that damages him while casting

a spell for the purpose of determining the DC of his Concentration

check to cast successfully. If struck for 5 points of

damage while casting a spell, he must make a Concentration

check to successfully cast, but the DC is only 10 + 4 (damage

dealt minus 1) + the spell’s level. A 5th-level blood magus

could ignore up to 5 points of damage dealt from each source

that damages him during casting (and thus wouldn’t have to

make a Concentration check if struck for 5 points of damage

or less).

Because of this ability, damage a blood magus takes from

using his blood component and bloodseeking spell special

abilities never requires him to make a Concentration check

to fi nish the spell he is casting.

Stanch (Ex): A blood magus automatically becomes stable

when his hit points drop below 0. He still dies if he reaches

–10 hit points or lower.

Scarifi cation (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a blood magus

can inscribe spells on his own skin for later use. This process

involves deeply scratching the skin (which deals no damage

but often leaves scars). The scratches remain fresh until

the inscribed spell is cast, at which time the wound heals

normally. Effectively, a blood magus gains the Scribe Scroll

feat (see page 99 of the *Player’s Handbook*) using an alternative

medium.

All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Scribe Scroll

also apply to this ability. Likewise, “reading” a scar follows

the same rules as reading a scroll, but only a blood magus

can decipher his own scars. One’s own skin leaves a limited

amount of room to easily inscribe and “read” magical scars.

Thus, a blood magus can have only six of these scars at any

one time.

Death Knell (Sp): At 3rd level and higher, a blood magus

has the ability to use *death knell* as the spell once per day.

Blood Draught (Ex): At 4th level, a blood magus learns

how to store spells of up to 3rd level in his own blood.

Effectively, he gains the Brew Potion feat (see page 89 of the

*Player’s Handbook*) using an alternative medium. All rules,

XP costs, and expenses that apply to Brew Potion also apply

to this ability, with the following exceptions.

Once “brewed,” a blood draught remains in circulation

within a magus’s body. The maximum number of draughts

he can store at one time is equal to his blood magus level +

his Con score, but if he is ever slain, they are all immediately

ruined—even if he is subsequently returned to life. Blood

draughts are never accidentally lost through major blood loss

or by a blood-draining attack.

To consume a draught, a blood magus pricks his skin,

automatically bringing forth the desired effect. This is a

standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, like

drinking a potion. Another individual can partake of a blood

draught (if he or she has a strong stomach) by drinking 1

ounce of the blood magus’s blood as a full-round action. The

blood magus must have an open wound to share the effects

of a blood draught with another creature; if he lacks one, the

creature can infl ict a wound that deals 1 point of damage to

the blood magus as part of the action to consume the draught.

A blood magus cannot store his blood in a container to share

at a later time. The blood draught must be drawn fresh from

his body, or it loses potency within 1 round.

Homunculus (Su): From 5th level on, a blood magus can

use his blood to give life to a new companion creature—a

homunculus (see page 154 of the *Monster Manual*). A blood magus need not meet any of the given prerequisites to create

the homunculus; however, a blood magus must permanently

sacrifi ce 1 hit point as part of the creation process. The process

requires 1 hour.

A blood magus enjoys a stronger than normal link with his

homunculus. By touching the homunculus, a blood magus

can transfer his wounds to the creature (up to 1 hp per level

with each touch). This is a standard action that provokes

attacks of opportunity.

Each time a blood magus gains a class level, his homunculus

advances 1 Hit Die, as described on page 290 of the *Monster*

*Manual,* and it gains all the normal benefi ts of its increased

Hit Dice (increased base attack bonus, saves, and so on). The

homunculus advances to a maximum of 6 Hit Dice when the

blood magus reaches 9th level.

If his homunculus is destroyed, a blood magus takes 2d10

points of damage, as noted in the *Monster Manual.* A blood

magus’s death results in the death of his homunculus.

A blood magus can have only one homunculus at any given

time.

Bloodseeking Spell (Su): Beginning at 6th level, a blood

magus can imbue his spells with the ability to draw blood

from their targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must

infl ict a wound on himself; this is a free action that deals 3

points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal

part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if a blood magus

has any, doesn’t apply to this damage.

A bloodseeking spell deals

an extra 1d6 points of

damage to each

target that takes

damage from the

spell. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit

point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability

drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals,

oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or

a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this

effect.

Thicker Than Water (Su): At 7th level and higher, a

blood magus’s vital fl uids are partially under his control.

When a blood magus is injured, his blood withdraws from

the wound, avoiding some damage that he would otherwise

take. This ability gives the blood magus damage reduction

1/bludgeoning.

Awaken Blood (Su): At 8th level and higher, a blood

magus can bestow momentary consciousness on an

opponent’s blood. If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack,

the opponent’s blood tries to get free of its confi nement—all

at once. The pressure disrupts the victim’s tissues, dealing

10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable only once per

day, but a blood magus can try to use it again later in the day

if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous.

Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any

creatures without blood or a similar substance within their

bodies are immune to this effect.

Infusion (Ex): Upon reaching 9th level, a blood magus

prepares a special one-time distillation of his own blood.

After partaking of the infusion, he gains a 2-point increase

to his Constitution score.

Bloodwalk (Su): At 10th level, a blood magus becomes

perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the supernatural

ability to transport himself great distances via the

blood of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action

that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seamlessly

enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze,

plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar

fl uid) whose size equals or exceeds his own and pass any

distance to another living creature on the same plane in a

single round, regardless of the distance separating the two.

A blood magus merely designates a direction and distance

(“a living creature twenty miles due west of here”), and the

bloodwalk ability transports him to a destination creature

as close as possible to the desired location. He can’t specify

a named individual as the endpoint unless he has previously

obtained a sample of that creature’s blood and has

it preserved in a vial that he carries.

The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar

to the blood magus. A blood magus cannot use himself as

an entry creature. If an intended entry creature is unwilling,

he must make a successful melee touch attack to enter.

(A missed touch attack does not use up the ability for that

day.) When exiting a creature, a blood magus chooses an

adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and exiting a

creature is painless unless a blood magus wishes otherwise

(see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature

fi nds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and

quite unsettling.

If he desires, a blood magus can attempt to make a bloody

exit from the destination creature. He bursts forth explosively

from the creature’s body, dealing 10d6 points of damage

unless the creature makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood

magus’s class level + blood magus’s Con modifi er). When he

makes a bloody exit, a blood magus must succeed on a DC

15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round from the shock

of his expulsion.
