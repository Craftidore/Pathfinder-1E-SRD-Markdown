# Flame Magic
## Overview
**Flame Magic**

You can imbue your fire magic with the power of raging wildfires.

**Benefit:** When you deal fire damage to a foe with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, as a swift action you may also force that foe to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 level + Int modifier) or catch on fire. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
