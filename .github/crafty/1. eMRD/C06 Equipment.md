# C06 Equipment
## Overview
A well-equipped character can take on nearly any challenge, from surviving in the wilderness to making an impression at the kingâ€™s banquet. This chapter presents all manner of mundane and exotic equipment for the PCs to purchase and use, from weapons to armor, alchemical items to masterwork tools, fine wines to trail rations. The equipment presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items. Magic items are much more difficult to purchase (see [[C15 Magic Items|Chapter 15]] of the *PF Core Rulebook*).
