# 3m - The Magdar Kingdom
## Overview
**The Magdar Kingdom**

Today, the rolling hills and grasslands south of Zobeck are the provinces of the Magdar Kingdom: a place rich in traditions of chivalry and warfare, where the good king Stefanos holds tourneys every summer and hires a great many mercenaries from the Ironcrags when war threatens. The Magdar must fight to defend their borders to the east against the wild tribes of the Rothenian Plain and to the south against the akinji, the skirmish troops, and the dragon-blooded sorcerers of the Mharoti Empire. Thanks to this constant conflict, the Magdar have become expert at the use of the war wagon. 

Most armies travel with a baggage train: the dwarves prefer mules, the Rothenian centaurs manage with what they carry on their backs, and the armies of Morgau and Doresh rely on zombies. All carry their weapons, food, tents, and other supplies in some form. The Black Army of the Magdar turned this logistical need into a fortification on the open plains where it most often faces its enemies. Their war wagons are easy to circle into a tall wall of iron-reinforced wood, a bulwark against attack as good as a wooden palisade.

The war wagons bolster the infantry of the Black Army. Crossbows and even ballistae can be mounted and fired from behind their protective firing slits, and they provide defenses kept strong by sharp-eyed gearforged or mountain rangers. This army’s tools and discipline make it doubly effective; it is no peasant army but a professional corps that serves the kingdom year in and out.

The Magdar Kingdom is a monarchy with tight-knit bonds between the throne, the two major knightly orders, and the peers of the realm. All nobles are vassals of the crown and expected to both raise troops in its defense, provide for the common welfare, and serve in the army when called. Most of the land is united in its devotion to the faiths of Khors and Lada.

The result is a stable and strong kingdom that has both good alliances with neighbors and that has absorbed smaller states over time. Among its acquisitions, the kingdom gained a valuable province north of the Argent with the marriage of King Stefanos to Queen Dorytta the Fair of the Barony of Runkelsheim 20 years ago. Their son, Duke Zsigismond, is the heir to the throne and the leader of the realm’s arcane-militant forces, the Wands of Runkelstad.

## King Stefanos
**King Stefanos**

The middle-aged king Stefanos Ywencal (also called Stefanos IV and sometimes spelled Stevanos) is a monarch deeply loved by his people for his generosity, his personal courage, and his confidence in the face of repeated wars with the Mharoti. Though the kingdom has been threatened and invaded three times during his 20-year reign, each time the dragonkin and their allies have been driven back. In addition, the king’s unwavering support for the knightly Order of the Undying Sun has done much to strengthen the Magdar armies, and his use of war wagons and his determination to maintain a professional standing army are achievements that have kept the Magdar people free.

## Cronepisht, the Crown of the Magdar
**Cronepisht, the Crown of the Magdar**

The capital city is a jewel, containing not only the royal seat of King Stefanos and Queen Dorytta, but also the Commandery of the Undying Sun, whose White Riders come and go at all hours to other outposts of the order, bearing news and precious documents that keep the faith of Khors strong. The River Cirkno flows through the city and eventually connects to the Argent and the Ruby Sea. At the same time, the King’s Road connects to Zobeck in the north and the Mharoti and Illyrian lands to the South (where it is called the Sultan’s Road). In all, the kingdom is a fine prospect for trade, surrounded by rich grasslands and rolling hills.

The royal palace (called the Urbittal, or King’s Seat) is small and heavily fortified, with a moat and five great towers around a garden courtyard. Much of the court’s business is done elsewhere, in the Hall of the Bulls (once a cattle market) and in summer on the Field of Khors, where the summer tournaments such as the Kingsmeet are also held. Invitations to joust and to attend as spectators are both highly sought after, and the wounded are tended to by priestesses from Lada’s Temple of the Rosy Dawn.

## Revskaya, Forge of the Magdar
**Revskaya, Forge of the Magdar**

The small city of Revskaya sits directly across the river from Cronepisht and is completely different in character. With its high population of dwarves and the Revskaya Foundry serving as one of the primary temples of Svarog in the kingdom, it is a hub of armor, weapon, wheel, and wagon manufacturing. Its barrels, wheels, and casks carry Magdar wine in all directions, and its finest work is enchanted by the wizards of Runkelstad into the blazing swords of Khors. Despite its small size, the city has well-kept walls and an excellent garrison.

## Khorsburg, City of Light
**Khorsburg, City of Light**

A major settlement on the King’s Road between Cronepisht and Zobeck, Khorsburg is a site of pilgrimages at the solstice and equinoxes, when the priests of Khors dispense blessings and hold services for the nation. The great cathedral of Khors, with its triple towers of gilded white marble, are visible for miles, and the priesthood’s school of theology throngs with novices and initiates. The city also hosts many fine woodcarvers and stonecarvers, who specialize in devotional art.

## Runkelstad, City of Wands
**Runkelstad, City of Wands**

Home to the College of Wands, Runkelstad has always been a place of the arcane, and its armies commonly include not only cavalry and infantry regiments but also the best battle-wizards outside of Bemmea and Friula. The city stands at the confluence of the River Cirkno into the Argent, and it controls the difficult northeastern trade routes over the plains in the shadow of the Cloudwall Mountains to Courlandia, Neimheim, and Vidim. Runkelstad is also the home to the Queen’s summer residence—called the Rose Palace—and it is a likely seat of government if Cronepisht should fall to the dragonkin. The city is peculiar in the Crossroads region for its open worship of Sarastra and the Southern god Thoth-Hermes (see page 250).

## Sveretska, City of Smiths
**Sveretska, City of Smiths**

The largest city of the Magdar Kingdom is also home to its greatest markets and smithies, unifying goods brought along the River Argent from Zobeck and Orkasa with the workmanship of the Magdar. War wagons are built here, a drydock builds nearly all the barges that float on the Argent and its tributaries, and even the cantonal dwarves are happy to buy wheels or axles here, since they are considered “almost as good as dwarven make, and half the price.” The Sveretska coopers and barrel makers also serve the Crossroads region well, and the city’s Ringing Temple of Volund has a roof clad in copper, pillars bound with gold, and bells that chime at dawn, noon, and dusk.

## Zsigistad, City of Wine
**Zsigistad, City of Wine**

A small but important city abutting the Smolten Hills, Zsigistad’s hills are home to the Magdar vineyards of the kingdom, and are also a point of contention with the Free City of Zobeck, which has repeatedly asserted claims to the hills and the Ironcrag lowlands. The city is entirely devoted to viticulture and some basic animal husbandry, and few castles or fortifications dot the land, since the Ironcrag dwarves resent such constructions and have leveled at least two bergfrieds (tall watchtowers) in living memory.

A small shrine to St. Bacca, a demigod of wine, stands at the edge of the city’s vineyards. Entirely made of wood and thatched with trellis vines and straw, the whole shrine is picked up and moved to shelter within the city walls after the harvest each year.

## Castle Valtros
**Castle Valtros**

The castle Valtros is a major commandery of the Order of the Storm, and it has grown far more important as the sultana’s army has taken most of eastern Illyria—bringing the Empire’s border to within a few day’s march of the Magdar capital. Valtros is a not inconsiderable obstacle, since it controls the King’s Road from the Parszan plains over the Ertraya hills to the Magdar plain. With a garrison of thousands, two major keeps, a deep moat, and an army to back it up, Valtros has thus far withstood three attempted sieges by the dragonkin. Its commandery is frequently belittled or thwarted by the Order of the Undying Sun, which covets the castle and frequently claims that Grand Marshall Larina Perunal’s Order of the Storm doesn’t deserve it.

## Smoltenberg
**Smoltenberg**

An old dwarven construction lost to Magdar force of arms at around the same time that Sargau fell into silence, Smoltenberg is a hilltop fortress with excellent walls and a commanding view of the Low Road along the western edge of the Ironcrag Mountains. It is also a check to Zobeck’s desire to expand to the south. The commander is Karlus Gopok (LN male human aristocrat 3/fighter 7), an elderly, foul-mouthed, stubborn genius at defensive warfare. He curses both the dwarves and the Zobeckers with equal gusto, but is not prone to pursue raiders far for fear of traps and ambushes.

## Wagenstein
**Wagenstein**

The lookout from the Magdar Kingdom against the cantons and the Seven Cities sits along the Lowland Road and guards the western frontier against dwarven raids and Triolan aggressions. It is the headquarters of the Order of the Undying Sun and a well-run operation, though much quieter than Valtros.

In part, Wagenstein is also a counterweight to the troublemaking of the wizard of the Scarlet Citadel; even if he were to declare independence or swear fealty to Triolo or Illyria, Wagenstein would help the kingdom’s western border hold.
