# Sigils of Antimagic (WondArch)
## Overview
**Sigils of Antimagic:** An *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* fills the entire stronghold space, as indicated by the arcane sigils inscribed upon the walls. No magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities, work within this space, nor do any other magic items. Elementals, outsiders, corporeal undead, golems, and other magical constructs all function normally within the space, although many of their abilities are suppressed. If a summoned or conjured creature enters the space, it winks out.

Certain spells such as *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]**,* *[[Prismatic Sphere (Spell)|prismatic sphere]]**,* and *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]* are unaffected in this space. This means that itâ€™s possible to have a permanent *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* in an area affected by *sigils of antimagic* without having the place come tumbling down.

The *sigils of antimagic* have no effect on artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**; Market Price:* 66,000 gp.
