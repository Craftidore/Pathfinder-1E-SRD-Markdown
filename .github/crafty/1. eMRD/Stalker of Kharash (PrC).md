# Stalker of Kharash (PrC)
## Overview
Kharash, one of the Five Companions of Talisid, is the greatest

of the wolflike lupinal guardinals. As a fierce opponent of evil,

Kharash acts as patron to those who use stealth to track and

hunt evildoers. The stalkers of Kharash are a loose-knit order of

rangers, rogues, and other characters devoted to fighting evil

under Kharash’s patronage.

Rangers predominate among the stalkers, bringing a combination

of stealth and martial prowess to the class at the outset.

Rogues also commonly adopt the class, and bards occasionally

take it up. Few other characters, except multiclass rangers or

rogues, can meet the skill requirements to become stalkers.

Stalkers of Kharash prefer to work in small groups such as

adventuring parties. Some prefer the company of other stealthy

characters, while others enjoy working as a scout for a group of

normal, noisy characters. Whether PCs or NPCs, stalkers are

usually found in the wilderness, wherever evil foes can be

found.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the stalker of Kharash

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A stalker of Kharash is

proficient with all martial weapons, but no armor or shield.

Spells per Day: Starting at 1st level, and at each stalker of

Kharash level thereafter, the character gains new spells per day

as if she had also gained a level in the ranger class. He does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would

have gained (improved favored enemies and so on). If the character

had no ranger levels before becoming a 1st-level stalker of

Kharash, he gains the spellcasting ability of a 1st-level ranger—

that is, no spellcasting ability—when he takes his first stalker

level. When he becomes a 4th-level stalker, he gains spellcasting

ability (as a 4th-level ranger) assuming his Wisdom score is high

enough to grant him a bonus 1st-level spell.

A stalker of Kharash’s caster level is one-half the sum of his

ranger levels and his stalker levels.

Scent of Evil (Su): A stalker of Kharash has an unusual ability

that combines the scent special quality with the detect evil

spell. The stalker can detect evil opponents within 30 feet by

their scent of evil. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. A strong

aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric of 5–10 HD, an evil elemental

or undead of 10–21 HD, an evil creature of 25–54 HD, or

an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 10–21) can be

detected at twice these ranges. An overwhelming aura of evil

(an evil outsider or evil cleric with 11 HD or more, an evil elemental

or undead with 22 HD or more, an evil creature with 55

HD or more, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of

22 or higher) can be detected at triple normal range.

When the stalker detects a scent, the exact location is not

revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The

stalker can take a move action to note the direction of the

scent. Whenever the

creature comes within

5 feet of the source,

the stalker knows the

source’s location.

Favored Enemy—

Evil (Ex): At 2nd level, a

stalker of Kharash gains evil creatures of

all kinds as a favored enemies. He gains a +1

bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Survival checks when using these skills

against evil creatures. He also gains a +1

bonus on weapon damage rolls against

evil creatures. This bonus stacks with

any other favored enemy bonus

the stalker might have, such as

from the ranger class.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): When a

stalker of Kharash reaches 4th

level, he can use the Hide skill

even while being observed. With

at least one-quarter cover or

one-quarter concealment,

the stalker can hide

from view.

Track Evil (Su): A

5th-level stalker can

use the Track feat to

track an evil creature

by its lingering evil

aura, making a Wisdom

(or Survival) check

to find or follow a track. The

typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no

matter what kind of surface holds the

scent). The DC for tracking a normal aura increases by 2 every

10 minutes, for tracking a strong aura by 2 every hour, and for

tracking an overwhelming aura by 2 every day. This ability otherwise

follows the rules for the Track feat. The stalker can ignore

the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a 6th-level stalker of Kharash

may attempt to smite evil with one normal unarmed

strike. He adds a +4 bonus to his attack roll and deals 1 extra

point of damage per class level. This bonus damage stacks with

favored enemy bonuses. If he accidentally smites a creature

that is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for

that day.

At 8th level, a stalker of Kharash can use this ability

twice per day, and at 10th level he can use it

three times per day.
