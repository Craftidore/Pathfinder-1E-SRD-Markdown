THE CHALICE

Symbol: The symbol of the Chalice is a ruby chalice with

crossed ivory lightning bolts on the cup.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Chalice is an armed

company dedicated to stamping out the infl uence of devils,

demons, yugoloths and other slavering fi ends on the Material

Plane. The paladin Arbinget Ivenay founded the Chalice a millennia

ago with one goal: to recover the Chalice of Heironeous

from Dispater’s Iron City of Dis. Aside from the members of

the group’s Lightning Council, no one knows if the chalice

was recovered or not, but regardless of the chalice’s fate, in

the intervening ages the affi liation’s purpose has broadened

to ending the infl uence of the Lower Planes in the world.

Members: Many members of the Chalice are paladins,

priests, and fi ghters; many of these eventually take levels in

the knight of the Chalice prestige class (see *Complete Warrior*).

Mortality is high among the membership of this combative

affi liation, and as such the Chalice is always looking to induct

new members of suffi cient piety.

The Chalice is not a vengeful organization, and freely

allows members to leave its ranks. If a member departs due to

falling from paladinhood, fi endish possession, or alignment

change—or tries to covertly corrupt the Chalice from within

after suffering one of these fates—the Lightning Council

dispatches an EL 14 exorcism squad (typically a 13th-level

paladin and a 13th-level cleric of Olidammara) that is more

inclined to smite fi rst and ask for repentance by means of

*speak with dead* much later.

Secrets: When you attain the rank of Lightning Councilor,

the other councilors lead you somberly to the Eyrie

of Heironeous. There, among the lightning rods of the

order, under a clouding sky, they inform you of the true

nature of the Chalice of Heironeous. What was stolen from

Heironeous millennia ago—not by Dis, but by Hextor, who

attempted to shirk responsibility for his deed (and to better

secure his prize) by loaning the chalice to the Iron Lord of

the Second—was not a powerful magic item, nor even an

artifact. As revealed to Arbinget Ivenay by the solar Tomal

on the eve of St. Vorgan’s Day 1,223 years ago, the Chalice of

Heironeous is in fact the daughter of Heironeous, a young

goddess-angel now held in durance vile deep in Dispater’s

Iron Tower. Every day, the Lightning Councilors dream of

rescuing her; every day, they come no closer.

Type: Fighting company.

Scale: 12 (multiregional/kingdom).

**Score Title: Benefi ts and Duties**

3 or less No affiliation.

4–10 **Initiate:** The Chalice recognizes you as a

potential ally or enemy in the struggle to

eliminate fi ends from the Material Plane.

11–15 **Defender:** You are inducted into

membership, and can requisition a *potion of*

*protection from evil* 1/week.

16–20 **Thunderer:** Chalice priests cast up to 3rd-level

*cure* spells for free (excluding component

costs) when you visit their temple.

20–24 **Scion of Heironeous:** Chalice priests cast

up to 4th-level spells for free (excluding

component costs) when you visit their temple.

25–29 **Paragon of Heironeous:** By taking a –5 penalty

to your affi liation score, you can gain a *raise*

*dead* spell from a Chalice priest. Fiends can

make a Knowledge (the planes) check (DC 30

minus your character level) to recognize you,

and if they succeed, their frenzy grants them

+2 on damage rolls when attacking you.

30 or higher **Lightning Councilor:** Once per year, you can

borrow for 1 week any magic weapon or

armor with a value of 18,000 gp or less from

the Chalice’s armory. While you do so, the

affiliation takes a –1 penalty to its capital.

Executive Powers: Crusade, inquisition, war.
