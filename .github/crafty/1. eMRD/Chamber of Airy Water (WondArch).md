# Chamber of Airy Water (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of Airy Water:** Anyone in this stronghold space can breathe water as if it were air. Those that can breathe water are unaffected. If a subject doesnâ€™t wish to be affected, it can make a Will save (DC 14) to negate the effect.

Just about every underwater stronghold has at least one such chamber in which to entertain surface-dwelling guests. More ambitious underwater builders use this feature in as much of their stronghold as possible, leaving only the most private areas alone. Some air-breathing builders even use this feature to create underwater portions of their airy strongholds.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]**; Market Price:* 8,500 gp.
