# Fist of Raziel (PrC)
## Overview
The fists of Raziel represent a knightly order dedicated to the

celestial patron of holy warfare against evil. Its members

include large numbers of paladins, as well as lawful good clerics,

fighters, rangers, and occasionally warriors. While Sealtiel

champions those who defend good communities from evil

assault, Raziel’s crusaders lead the charge against evil wherever

it is found. Smiting evil is their mission and their specialty.

To become a fist of Raziel, a character must already possess

some degree of divine spellcasting ability, so members of the

class generally begin as paladins or clerics, less often as

fighter/clerics or ranger/clerics. Perhaps strangely, the order

includes a number of ex-barbarians who first multiclassed as

clerics and then adopted the fist of Raziel prestige class. These

ferocious warriors seem to be drawn to Raziel’s crusading creed.

The fists of Raziel are an elite, ordered, and disciplined fighting

force. To make best use of their power, however, they typically

serve as leaders or advisors to adventuring parties, military

strike teams, or the armies of good kingdoms, working with

members of other classes instead of with each other.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the fist of Raziel prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A fist of Raziel is proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor,

and shields (except tower shields).

Magic Circle (Su): A 1st-level fist of Raziel is constantly surrounded

by a magic circle against evil effect, as the spell cast by

a cleric of the fist’s character level.

Smite Evil (Su):Once per day, a fist of Raziel may attempt to

smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma

bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per

class level. If she accidentally smites a creature that is not evil,

the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. She can

use this ability more times per day as she advances in level, as

shown on Table 5–10.

If the fist of Raziel has paladin levels as well, add the daily

uses from her fist of Raziel levels to the daily uses from her paladin

levels. Her damage bonus equals her fist of Raziel class

level plus her paladin class level. This ability does not stack

with the smite ability granted by the Destruction domain.

In addition to the basic function of smiting evil, a fist

of Raziel gains special abilities that operate whenever

she smites.

Good-Aligned: At 1st level, whenever a fist of Raziel

smites evil, her weapon is considered good-aligned for

purposes of overcoming damage reduction, as if she

had the Exalted Smite feat.

Confirming: At 3rd level, whenever a fist

of Raziel smites evil, all critical rolls are

automatically successful (so

every threat is a critical hit). This

works even if the weapon has a magical

effect related to critical hits, unlike the

similar effect of the bless weapon spell.

Holy: At 5th level, whenever a fist of

Raziel smites evil, her weapon is considered

holy, dealing an extra 2d6

points of damage against evil creatures.

This additional damage stacks with the

extra damage she deals from the smite.

However, it does not stack with the benefit

of the Sanctify Martial Strike feat or

with the extra damage dealt by a weapon

with the holy weapon property.

Fiendsmite: At 7th level, whenever a fist

of Raziel smites evil, her weapon deals an

extra 2d8 points of damage against evil outsiders

and evil undead, instead of the +2d6

normally dealt by a holy weapon. If

she also has the Exalted Smite

feat, this damage is still doubled.

Chain: At 9th level, whenever a

fist of Raziel smites evil, bolts of

holy power erupt from the target creature

and strike up to 5 additional evil targets

within 30 feet, chosen by the fist of Raziel. Targets take 2d6

points of damage, or 2d8 if they are evil outsiders or evil undead.

A successful Reflex save (DC 15 + the fist of Raziel’s Cha modifier)

reduces the damage by half.

Spells per Day: Starting at 2nd level, and at each level thereafter,

a fist of Raziel gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a

level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before

adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any

other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, improved special

mount, and so on). If the character had more than one

divine spellcasting class before becoming a fist of Raziel,

she must decide to which class she adds each fist of

Raziel level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Sanctify Martial Strike: At 4th level, a fist of

Raziel gains the Sanctify Martial Strike feat as a

bonus feat.

Sunder Evil Item (Su): At 6th level, whenever a fist of Raziel

attacks an object that is evil (such as an unholy sword or a darkskull)

or an evil construct (such as a retriever), she deals double damage.

This does not stack with the benefits of the Great Sunder feat.

Holy Martial Strike (Su): Any weapon that a 10th-level fist of

Raziel wields is treated as a holy weapon, dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage to evil creatures, even when she is not smiting

evil. This additional damage does not stack with the benefit of the

Sanctify Martial Strike feat or with the extra damage dealt by a

weapon with the holy weapon property.
