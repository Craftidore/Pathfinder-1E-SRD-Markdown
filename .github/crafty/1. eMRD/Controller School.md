# Controller School
## Overview
**Controller School**

**Associated School**: Enchantment.

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the enchanting smile and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

**Force of Will (Su)**: You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.

**Irresistible Demand (Sp)**: At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the *dominate monster* spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.
