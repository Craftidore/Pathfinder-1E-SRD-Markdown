# Ur-Priest (PrC)
## Overview
Ur-priests despise gods. However, a small number of them

have learned to tap into divine power and use it for their

own needs without praying to or worshiping a god. Instead,

each day they go into a trance and mentally steal the power

that gods normally channel to devout clerics. Ur-priests are

canny and cunning, never stealing too much power from

any one god, but instead metaphysically slipping in, drawing

out the power they need for their spells, and slipping out

again. They learn to be resilient toward divine power and

creative with the energies that they steal. The greatest urpriest

commands the level of power of the most powerful

cleric, although she does not have the cleric’s variety of

spellcasting options.

A member of any class can become an ur-priest, even—

and in fact, especially—an ex-cleric.

Ur-priests frequently work alone, although they occasionally

find partnerships with members of other classes useful.

They do not congregate into anything resembling temples,

for they fear that too many of them in one place might draw

unwanted divine attention. And of course they rarely associate

with clerics or any other divine spellcasters, whom they

see as lackeys and who view them as abominations.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the ur-priest prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An ur-priest is proficient

with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Spells: An ur-priest gains the ability to cast a number of

divine spells. To cast a spell, the ur-priest must have a

Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so an ur-priest

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Urpriest

bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wisdom

modifier. When Table 5–16 indicates 0 spells of a given

level, such as 0 2nd-level spells at 2nd level, the ur-priest

gets only bonus spells. An ur-priest without a bonus spell for

that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level.

The ur-priest’s spell list is identical to the cleric’s spell list.

An ur-priest has access to any spell on the list and prepares

those spells as a cleric, except that she does not pray for

spells, she just takes them. An ur-priest casts spells as a cleric does, except that unlike a cleric, she does not have the ability

to spontaneously cast inflict or cure spells, nor does she

have domain spells or associated domain granted powers.

She does not have restrictions on spells with alignments. To

determine the caster level of an ur-priest, add the character’s

ur-priest levels to one-half of her levels in other spellcasting

classes. (Any levels gained in the cleric class by an ex-cleric

don’t count.)

Rebuke Undead: Like an evil cleric, an ur-priest of 2nd

level or higher can rebuke undead. She uses her ur-priest

level as the cleric level for determining success and damage

(see Turn and Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the Player’s

Handbook).

Divine Spell Resistance (Su): At 4th level, an ur-priest

gains spell resistance 15, but only against divine spells and

the spell-like abilities of outsiders. At 8th level, the urpriest’s

spell resistance increases to 20.

Siphon Spell Power (Ex): Because they steal whatever

power they can, ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy

in ways that confound other casters. A 6th-level ur-priest

can temporarily sacrifice two (or more) lower-level spell

slots and use those slots to prepare a higher-level spell. The

hnigher-level spell must be of a level the ur-priest can cast.

Only one exchange of this sort can be made each day. The

levels of the lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to

three-quarters (round down) to determine the level of the

extra higher-level spell slot. For example, an ur-priest who

sacrifices a 3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use that

spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level spell (3 + 5 = 8,

and 8 × 3/4 = 6).

Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su): The most powerful urpriests

can use the same techniques that siphon off the gods’

spell power to steal the spell-like abilities of another creature.

Once each day, when a creature with spell-like abilities

is within 50 feet of a 10th-level ur-priest, the ur-priest can

choose one of the spell-like abilities of the creature to steal

for herself. The ur-priest can use the spell-like ability as

often as the creature can, or three times per day, whichever

is less. The ur-priest uses the ability as the creature does with

regard to caster level and save DCs. This ability only lasts 24

hours. The creature with the spell-like ability does not lose

the ability when the ur-priest steals it. If the ur-priest tries to

steal a spell-like ability that the creature doesn’t have, or tries

to steal an ability that is supernatural rather than spell-like,

the attempt automatically fails.

For example, if an ur-priest is near a noble salamander,

she can steal fireball and use it three times that day or steal

dispel magic and use it once that day. If she is near a pit

fiend, she could steal teleport without error (self plus 50

pounds of objects only) and use it three times per day,

because the pit fiend can do it at will. She could even steal

the pit fiend’s wish ability, but because a pit fiend can only

use wish once per year, the ur-priest would be similarly

limited. She could not steal that power again from any

creature for one year.
