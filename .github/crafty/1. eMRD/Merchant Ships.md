# Merchant Ships
## Overview
Merchant Ships of Greyhawk

Posted on Fri, September 10, 2021 by LordCeb

Matteus writes "

Sea trade bustles across the [[Azure Sea]], and you’ve encountered a merchant vessel. Perhaps the party are catching a ride on a merchant ship. Perhaps the party have joined a pirate crew and hope to plunder a merchant vessel. Where did it come from? What cargo does it contain? The twelve costal realms of the Azure Sea, Densac Gulf, and Vohun Ocean are listed below. The cargo lists for each realm are mainly drawn from their respective resources listed in the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer. This is especially useful if you're a pirate crew searching for plunder, which was my point in making it.

**Origin of Merchant Ship**


| **d12** | **Port of Origin (By Realm)** |
|---|---|
| 1 | Ahlissa |
| 2 | Domain of Greyhawk |
| 3 | Furyondy |
| 4 | Irongate |
| 5 | Keoland |
| 6 | Nyrond |
| 7 | Onnwal |
| 8 | Pomarj |
| 9 | Scarlet Brotherhood |
| 10 | Sea Princes |
| 11 | Sunndi |
| 12 | Ulek, Principality |

In addition to goods specific to each realm, find below a general list of common goods which might be traded across the sea. The DM can always pick the cargo based on the situation or needs of the story.
