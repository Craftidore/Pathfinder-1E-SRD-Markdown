# Animal Archetypes (Archetype)
## Overview
This section introduces animal archetypes, which modify animal companions' and familiars' standard abilities, similar to how class archetypes modify player characters' class features. These archetypes function by swapping out certain abilities that are common to standard companions or familiars and replacing them with new abilities tailored to a particular theme. Where levels are referenced in archetype descriptions, they refer to the class level of the PC master in whichever class grants the companion or familiar as a class feature.
