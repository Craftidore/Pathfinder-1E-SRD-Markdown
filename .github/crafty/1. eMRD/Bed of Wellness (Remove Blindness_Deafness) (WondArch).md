# Bed of Wellness (Remove Blindness/Deafness) (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bed of Wellness (*remove blindness/deafness*):** This bed works like a *[[Bed of Restoration, Lesser (WondArch)|lesser bed of restoration]]*, but it instead casts *[[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|remove blindness/deafness]]* (one effect per use) on the user. If the subject does not want to be affected, he can make a Fortitude save (DC 14) to negate the effect.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|remove blindness/deafness]]**; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.
