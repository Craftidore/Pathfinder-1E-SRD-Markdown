# Suel Arcanamach (PrC)
## Overview
The ancient Suel Empire was

known for the great and terrible

power wielded by its mighty

archmages. Suloise sorcerers delved

deep into arcane lore that other folk

avoided, unearthing many dark and

dangerous secrets in the process.

The Suel Empire was ruled by

noble families headed by mages

of unsurpassed power, and the

countless rivalries and vendettas

between these families led to the rise of an

elite school of combat training: the way of the

arcanamach. Conditioned for loyalty, determination, and

absolute obedience, arcanamachs were skillful warriors who

studied arcane magic for the express purpose of learning

how to slay powerful wizards.

In the days of the Suel Empire, the arcanamachs were

guards for their archmage masters, serving the greatest Suel

wizards with sword and spell. They were also assassins and

spies trained to slay powerful wizards of rival families, as well

as defend the wizards of their own families. In hundreds of

secret duels of spell and steel, arcanamachs practiced their

arts against others of their kind, learning their skills from

hidden arcanamach academies.

While the Suel Empire is long dead, the tradition of the

arcanamach still survives in a rare set of magical tomes:

the *Grimoire Arcanamacha*. No academies for these warriorwizards

remain, but a skilled swordsman who studies from

the *Grimoire Arcanamacha*—or who learns from a master

who has studied the *Grimoire*—can unlock many secrets

of stealth, alertness, mental fortitude, and combative

spellcasting.

While the arcanamachs formerly

existed as elite guards and agents

for powerful wizards, those who

follow the tradition in the

modern day retain no special

allegiance to other arcanists.

Suel arcanamach NPCs are

spies and assassins, secretive

individuals who excel

at using stealth, spells, and

swordplay to achieve their goals.

Some are dedicated mage-slayers who make

a career out of destroying other spellcasters.

Adaptation: The notion of an elite order of

warrior-mages is not restricted to the Greyhawk

setting. You can easily adapt the arcanamach

to your own campaign, even if you do not

play in Greyhawk. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS

setting, the arcanamach can be a student of

the elite warrior traditions of the Empire of

Netheril, the Imaskari Empire, or even the

realms of Jhaamdath or Mulhorand. Simply

change the language requirement to an

appropriate dead language for the empire

in question (Loross, Roushoum, Thorass, or

Mulhorandi), and the class should work

well with no further modifi cation.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the Suel arcanamach

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Suel arcanamachs gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor. Armor of any type

interferes with an arcanamach’s movements, which can cause

spells with somatic components to fail (but see Ignore Spell

Failure Chance, below).

\* Provided the arcanamach has a high enough Charisma

score to have a bonus spell of this level.

Spells per Day: A Suel arcanamach has the ability to cast

a small number of arcane spells. To cast a Suel arcanamach

spell, he must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s

level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he cannot cast

these spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving

throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + his

Cha modifi er. When he gets 0 spells per day of a given level

(for instance, 1st-level spells for 1st level), he gains only the

bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma

score for that spell level. He has access to any spell of the

abjuration, divination, illusion, and transmutation schools

on the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He casts spells just as a

sorcerer does, including the ability to replace a known Suel

arcanamach spell with a new spell at every even-numbered

class level beginning at 4th.

Ignore Spell Failure Chance (Ex): A Suel arcanamach’s

practice at merging spellcasting and swordplay results in a

reduction in the arcane spell failure chance associated with

using armor or shields. This reduction starts at 5% at 1st

level and increases by 5% every three levels thereafter. The

arcanamach subtracts the given percentage value from his

total spell failure chance, if any. For example, a 1st-level arcanamach

wearing a mithral shirt has a spell failure chance

of 5%, not 10%. This ability only functions when the character

casts a Suel arcanamach spell.

Tenacious Spells (Ex): An arcanamach’s Suel arcanamach

spells are particularly diffi cult to dispel; add 6 to the DC

required to dispel the character’s arcanamach spells.

Dispelling Strike (Su): Once per day, a Suel arcanamach

of 2nd level or higher can attempt a dispelling strike with

one normal melee attack. If he hits, he deals normal damage,

and the victim is subject to a targeted *greater dispel magic.*

The arcanamach’s dispel check is 1d20 + class level + 6. If a

Suel arcanamach makes a dispelling strike against a creature

with no spells or effects to dispel, the dispelling strike has

no effect, but the ability is used up for that day.

At 6th level, an arcanamach can use this power two times

per day, and at 10th level he can use it three times per day.

Extended Spellstrength (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level,

a Suel arcanamach knows how to extend the duration of

spells that he casts on himself. The duration of any of his

Suel arcanamach spells with which he targets himself is

doubled, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat (but without

any adjustment to the spell’s effective level or casting time).

For instance, a *bull’s strength* spell cast by a 3rd-level Suel

arcanamach on himself has a duration of 6 minutes rather

than 3 minutes.

Spells that target multiple targets are affected by this power,

but only the arcanamach gains the extended duration. For

example, a 5th-level arcanamach who casts *haste* would be

hasted for 10 rounds, while his allies would gain the effect

only for the normal 5-round duration.

Spells that do not have a Target entry are unaffected by

this power even if the arcanamach is the only one affected.

Extended Spellstrength (Ex): The duration of any of
