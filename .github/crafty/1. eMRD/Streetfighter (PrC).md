# Streetfighter (PrC)
## Overview
Streetfighters have found a place, and even some small

amount of fame, among the shadowy and dangerous

regions of the world’s great cities. Some leave their

homes, putting their skills to the test against dangerous

monsters in lost tombs or fighting for sport in front of

the nobility, but they always remember the lessons of

the streets.

Streetfighters never rest easy. They have seen violence

and depravity to rival any dungeon adventurer, and they

have survived because they never let their guard down.

Rather than leaving a streetfighter suspicious or spent,

this experience has forged his mind and body into that

of a lean, quick-thinking combatant capable of seizing

any advantage in battle.

Most streetfighters are fighter/rogues who have had to

survive in dangerous urban environments their entire

lives. Perhaps the strangest streetfighters are barbarians

and rangers who adopt urban environments as

their chosen homes. These wild men and women seek

the challenges of the back alleys as a way of testing

themselves and their experience in the wider world

against the street smarts and tough talk of the city. Very

few spellcasters have the bravado or the melee skill to

become streetfighters.

Adaptation: With a few simple changes, the streetfighter

prestige class can be used to represent any group

of opportunistic fighters. Just change the description

of the class, and it might be associated with a school of

gladiatorial training in a city’s elite urban patrol. Adding

the Weapon Focus or Weapon Finesse feats to the requirements

can also bring about large changes in the feel of

the class. Weapon Focus (dagger) turns a streetfighter

into a knife fighter, while Weapon Focus (rapier) makes

the class well suited to a school of fencers from an urban

environment.

Hit Die: d8.

fulfill all the following criteria.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the streetfighter

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Streetfighters gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Always Ready (Ex): A streetfighter knows that an

attack can come from any quarter, and that an innocuous

conversation can turn into a deadly fight in an instant.

Accordingly, he gains a +1 competence bonus on initiative

checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level and to +3

at 5th level.

Streetwise (Ex): A streetfighter knows how to survive

in dangerous urban areas; he gains a +2 competence bonus

on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks.

Stand Tough (Ex): A streetfighter’s toughness has

been honed by years of hard living and dirty fighting.

Starting at 2nd level, a streetfighter can stand tough once

per day. When he would be damaged in combat (from

a weapon or some other blow, but not from a spell or

special ability), he can attempt to shake off the damage. To do this, he must attempt a Fortitude saving throw

against a DC equal to the number of points of

damage dealt. If the save succeeds, he takes

no lethal damage from the blow, instead

taking nonlethal damage equal to half the

amount of damage the blow would have

dealt. If the save fails, he takes damage

normally. A streetfighter need not be

aware of the impending attack to use

this ability.

Starting at 4th level, a streetfighter

can use this ability twice per day.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning

at 3rd level, a streetfighter deals an

extra 1d6 points of damage when

flanking an opponent or any time

the target would be denied its Dexterity

bonus. This extra damage applies to

ranged attacks only if the target is within

30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50

of the *Player’s Handbook*. If a streetfighter

gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses

on damage stack.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, a

streetfighter cannot be caught flat-footed

and reacts to danger before his senses

would normally allow him to do so. See

the barbarian class feature, page 26 of

the *Player’s Handbook.*

If a streetfighter already has uncanny

dodge from a different class,

he gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

See the barbarian class feature, page

26 of the *Player’s Handbook.*

*Languages:* Common, Halfling;

Goblin.

Always Ready (Ex): Barsh gains

a +2 competence bonus on initiative

checks.

Evasion (Ex): If Barsh is exposed

to any effect that normally allows

him to attempt a Reflex saving

throw for half damage, he takes

no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Barsh

deals an extra 3d6 points of

damage on any successful attack

against flat-footed or flanked targets,

or against a target that has

been denied its Dexterity bonus

for any reason. This damage

also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune

to extra damage from critical hits

are all immune to sneak attacks. Barsh can

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with

his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed

for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Stand Tough (Ex): Once per day, Barsh can attempt

to shake off the damage from a single blow. To do this,

he must attempt a Fortitude saving throw against a DC

equal to the number of points of damage dealt. If the save succeeds, he takes no lethal damage from the blow,

instead taking nonlethal damage equal to half the amount

of the damage that the blow would have dealt. If the save

fails, he takes damage normally.

Streetwise (Ex): Barsh gets a +2 competence bonus

on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks.

Trapfinding (Ex): Barsh can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

*+1, ring of protection +1, +1 short sword,* masterwork sling,

2 *potions of bear’s endurance,* 2 *potions of cat’s grace,* 3 *potions*
