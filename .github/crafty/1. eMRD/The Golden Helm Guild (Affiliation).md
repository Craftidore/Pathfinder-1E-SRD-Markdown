THE GOLDEN HELM GUILD

Symbol: A golden helm is the symbol of the guild, naturally.

Working in their smithies and forges, the gnomes often

wear yellow skullcaps to indicate their affi liation.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Golden Helm

Guild is a network of expert master crafters that spans dozens

of gnome communities, making fi ne armor, weapons, and

other gear for the greatest heroes of the gnomes. But the

Golden Helm is no mere blacksmithing guild. It focuses on

creating rare items invested with potent magic, each one a

testament to its maker’s skill and power.

Missions on behalf of the Golden Helm Guild often involve

securing rare ores or fi nding other special ingredients that

the guild can use in its most potent creations.

The guild often commissions its most talented members

to make magic weapons, armor, or other gear to sell or give

to a gnome-allied war effort. Each item you make on the

guild’s behalf worth at least 10,000 gp earns you +1 to your

affi liation score. You can earn this bonus multiple times,

but only if the Golden Helm Guild commissions the items

ahead of time.

Type: Business (racial).

Scale: 10 (regional/march).

Affi liation Score Criteria: Guild membership is open

only to gnomes, but anyone who can swing a hammer is

welcome to sign up for an apprenticeship. Unless you have

some talent for crafting either mundane or magic items, you

won’t derive any benefi t from your affi liation.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Each successful mission +1

Per magic item worth at least

10,000 gp made for guild +1

\* Does not include the item creation feat gained by

someone who becomes a Golden Helm Master (see

Titles, Benefi ts, and Duties: When you’ve earned enough

affi liation to attain new benefi ts, you need only apply for a

promotion at the nearest Golden Helm chapterhouse, which

exists in any gnome community of large town size or larger.

After a series of examinations, the guild will award you the

new rank and hold a lavish feast in your honor.
