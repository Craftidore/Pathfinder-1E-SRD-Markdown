# Sanctified One (PrC)
## Overview
*“I come in the name of the Brawler, and no evil shall stand*

*against me!”*

—Tarrana, sanctifi ed one of Kord

The cleric, the paladin, the priest, and the holy warrior—all

these are classic divine hero archetypes. Whatever differences

they may have, all divine heroes owe their power to deities or

to their faith and devote themselves to the service of powers

beyond the mortal plane.

But not all deities have paladins as their martial champions,

or clerics as their most iconic servants. In some cases, the

sanctifi ed one fi lls both roles.

BECOMING A SANCTIFIED ONE

Among the many roles that deities fi ll in the world, the role

of patron is among the most important. Every deity has its

own portfolio and its own agenda, and each rewards faithful

service differently.

A sanctifi ed one epitomizes the ideals of her own specifi c

deity. Although any deity can sponsor a sanctifi ed one, these

holy servants most often serve deities who lack any other

obvious champions. Few serve deities who attract mostly

lawful good worshipers, for example, since paladins typically

function as the champions of such faiths. Sanctifi ed ones,

on the other hand, fi ll the role of champion for churches

without other obvious choices—typically Ehlonna, Kord,

Olidammara, and Wee Jas.

Unlike members of most other divine prestige classes,

sanctifi ed ones often come from backgrounds other than

clerical. A sanctifi ed one might have been a wizard, a rogue,

or a fi ghter before becoming a champion of her religion.

To become a sanctifi ed one, a character must be of the same

alignment as her deity—a restriction even more stringent

than those governing clerics and paladins. Furthermore, a

deity who favors a particular character class most often draws

its sanctifi ed ones from that class.

**Entry Requirements**

**Base Attack Bonus:** +5.

**Alignment:** Must match that of deity chosen.

**Skill:** Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks.

CLASS FEATURES

As a sanctifi ed one, you gain class features that build upon strengths valued by your deity.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: If you are not already proficient with the chosen weapon of your deity, you gain that proficiency now. You gain no other armor

or weapon proficiencies.

Spellcasting: At 2nd and 4th level, you gain new spells

per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spell casting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige

class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a

character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than one spellcasting class before becoming a sanctifi ed

one, you must decide to which class to add each level for

the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and

spells known.

Additional Class Skills (Ex): Upon becoming a sanctifi ed

one, you gain the additional class skills specifi ed for your

deity in the accompanying table.

Sanctifi ed Ability: At 1st, 3rd, and 5th level, you can

choose a sanctifi ed ability corresponding to your deity from

the accompanying table. Sanctifi ed abilities can be extraordinary,

spell-like, or supernatural, as designated in their

individual descriptions. If a sanctifi ed ability is followed by

an asterisk (\*), you can select it as many times as you wish.

Each time you choose it, the number of times per day that

you can use that ability increases by one.

Sanctifi ed Blessing: At 5th level, you receive a sanctifi ed

blessing based on your deity’s powers and portfolio, as given

on the accompanying table.

Sanctified One Abilities

The abilities to which you have access as a sanctifi ed one are

summarized on the accompanying table and described below,

in the order they appear on the table.

Ehlonna: As a sanctifi ed one of Ehlonna, you gain abilities

relating to light, life, and nature.

*Light of Life (Su):* Once per day as a standard action, you can

call upon Ehlonna’s light to create a consecrated area. This

effect works like the *consecrate* spell, except that the effect is

mobile and centered upon you. In addition, you are treated

as an altar of Ehlonna for the purpose of determining the

bonuses granted. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.

*Nature’s Bounty (Sp):* Once per day, you can use *heroes’ feast*

(caster level equals 6 + your sanctifi ed one level). Instead of

producing tables and chairs, however, this ability produces

blankets and pallets more suited to an outdoor setting.

*Nature’s Holding (Sp):* Once per day, by touching a plant or

a natural earth or stone surface, you create an opening to an

extradimensional space similar to that created by a *rope trick*

spell. When you and your allies enter this space and close

the “door,” no evidence of the opening exists on the outside.

The space remains for 12 hours or until the last creature exits,

whichever comes fi rst.

*Summon Nature’s Mount (Sp):* Once per day as a swift action,

you can summon either a unicorn or a griffon (your choice)

to serve as your mount. For each sanctifi ed one level you

possess, the creature gains 2 Hit Dice and a +2 sacred bonus

to its AC. The mount is immune to fear effects, and it remains

for 1 hour or until slain. You gain a +5 bonus on Ride checks

while riding this creature.

*Fast Healing (Su):* Once per day as an immediate action, you

can gain fast healing 5, which lasts for 10 rounds.

Kord: As a sanctifi ed one of Kord, you gain abilities relating

to strength and chaos.

*Chaos Warp (Su):* Once per day, you can completely ignore

all damage from one critical hit scored against you, as well

as any effects relating to it.

*Holy Fire (Su):* Whenever you cast a spell with the fi re

subtype, you can choose to change all the fi re damage it deals

into raw divine damage that is treated as good-aligned for the

putpose of overcoming damage reduction. This choice must

be made at the time of casting.

*Luck of Battle (Ex):* Once per day, you can choose to roll twice

for any roll normally requiring 1d20 and use the higher of

the two results.

*Sanctifi ed Strength (Su):* Once per day, you can apply twice

your sanctifi ed one level as a sacred bonus to your Strength

for 1 round.

*Blessing of Kord (Su):* At dawn every day, you can choose one

of the following blessings of Kord, which lasts for 24 hours:

+2 bonus to Strength, +2 luck bonus on all saves, or +10-foot bonus to speed. You cannot change this blessing until the

next day.

Olidammara: As a sanctifi ed one of Olidammara, you

gain abilities relating to luck and stealth.

*Chaos Luck (Su):* Once per day as an immediate action, you

can grant yourself and each of your allies within 30 feet the

evasion ability for 1 round. Any recipient of this benefi t

who already has evasion gains improved evasion instead.

Any recipient who already has improved evasion gains no

further benefi t.

*Good Catch (Ex):* Whenever you make a Disable Device

check, you can choose to roll a second time before learning

the result of your check. If you do so, you must use the result

of your second attempt.

*Not in the Face (Ex):* Once per day as an immediate action,

you can apply your base Refl ex save as a bonus to your Armor

Class for 1 minute. Whenever you are denied your Dexterity

bonus, you lose this bonus as well.

*Rogues’ Blessing (Su):* If you have the sneak attack ability,

you gain an extra 1d8 points of sneak attack damage for every

two sanctifi ed one levels you possess.

*Fast Talk (Sp):* Once per combat encounter, you can make

a Diplomacy check as an immediate action to prevent an

enemy within 10 feet from attacking you. The foe must be

attempting an attack against you at the time you use this ability.

If your Diplomacy check result exceeds your opponent’s

Sense Motive check result by at least 1 for every 3 points of

base attack bonus the enemy character possesses, he decides

not to attack you (or anyone else) this round. In subsequent

rounds, he attacks you only if you attack him fi rst or are the

only opponent within sight. If your Diplomacy check fails,

the opponent attacks normally, and you cannot use this ability

again during this combat encounter.

Wee Jas: As a sanctifi ed one of Wee Jas, you gain abilities

relating to death, law, and spellcasting.

*Armor of Law (Su):* If you have an armor bonus (permanent

or temporary), it increases by an amount equal to your class

level. If you have no armor bonus, you can increase your shield

bonus instead. If you have neither, you gain no benefi t.

*Death’s Cloak (Su):* Once per day as a swift action, you can

render yourself immune to poison, magic *sleep* effects, paralysis,

stunning, disease, and death effects for 1 minute.

*Sanctifi ed Fall (Su):* If you are reduced to –1 or fewer hit

points, or even killed outright by a death effect, you can use

an immediate action to either cast a spell or make a single

attack. For this action only, you can increase your either

your effective caster level or your bonus on attack rolls (your

decision) by an amount equal to your sanctifi ed one level.

*Sanctifi ed Spell (Ex):* Once per day, you can increase your

effective caster level by an amount equal to your Intelligence

bonus (if any) for 1 round.

*Ruby Spell (Sp):* Choose a spell that you can cast from the

highest level to which you have access. You can now use this

spell as a spell-like ability once per day. Doing so requires no

material components, unless those components have a gold

piece cost equal to 100 gp or more. You can also still cast this

spell normally as part of your normal spell repertoire.

Each time you gain a new spellcasting level, you can either

retain this spell as a spell-like ability or choose a different

one from the highest level you can cast.

SANCTIFIED ONE OF KORD BENEFITS

Though you have no separate organization, you are entitled

to a variety of benefi ts based on your service to your deity

and church. If you have a rank of 1 or higher, you can live in

a barracks attached to a temple of Kord if you wish. If you

do so, you have access to the attached gymnasiums as well

(see the Kord entry in Deities and Demigods).

Supplicant: At this rank, you can stay in the guest quarters

at any temple to Kord for as long as you wish. In addition,

you receive free healing for any injury you suffer in Kord’s

service. If you are injured while acting on your own, you can

receive one free 3rd-level or lower *cure* spell each day. If you

choose these benefi ts, you also must serve the church for at

least 60 days each year, guarding a temple or other church

property, training other champions, or undertaking quests.

Your days of service need not be continuous.

Competitor: By the time you attain this rank, you have

achieved a degree of renown among worshipers of your deity.

Because you are regularly called upon to perform missions

for your church, you gain a +2 bonus on Strength checks and

Strength-based skill checks.

Master: Your increasing focus on combat in the name of

Kord has earned you a +2 bonus on opposed checks to resolve

grapple, trip, and overrun attempts.

ntitled to use *greater heroism* as a spell-like ability once per

day (caster level equals your character level). This ability is

usable on yourself only.

PLAYING A SANCTIFIED ONE

As a sanctifi ed one, you strive to live up to the moral, ethical,

and religious code of your church. Because you are the

personifi cation of your deity’s best attributes on the Material

Plane, it’s important to act in accordance with your patron’s

wishes at all times. Since accepting the mantle of sanctifi ed

one, you have conducted a thorough study of your deity’s

major characteristics, domains, portfolio, and general philosophy,

and you try to behave in a manner consistent with

those principles at all times.

Chapter 1 of this book discusses in detail how followers

of the various religions tend to act and what they value. You,

however, take these guidelines as law and attempt to live every

moment of your life as your deity’s direct representative on

the Material Plane.

You have no problem working with the followers of other

religions, or even those who worship no deity at all. While

you might (or might not) be an evangelist, you understand

that getting out and adventuring in your patron’s name is

the best service you can render. As a living example of your

deity’s greatness, you can truly showcase the divine power

of your religion.

You also recognize that your deity has particular allies

and enemies within the divine pantheon. As a sanctifi ed

one, you try to keep the churches of friendly deities close

and prevent the churches of rival deities from gaining power

at your patron’s expense. Meeting this goal often means

working with people outside your religion and forging new

friendships with them. Those who share even part of your

religious philosophy are on the right track, even though their

paths occasionally diverge from yours.

Combat

Although your deity might or might not be focused on

combat, you are an adventuring hero—a champion of your

deity. Thus, to a greater or lesser extent, you are expected to

use your abilities in combat to defeat your foes. You might

do so in an entirely different way than another sanctifi ed

one, depending upon your gifts. The following archetypes

describe your combat philosophy, depending upon the deity

you worship.

Storm of Blades (Kord): As a sanctifi ed one of Kord, you

leap into the center of the fi ght, hacking your way toward your

most dangerous foes fi rst. You prefer to draw attention away

from your allies, depending on your deity-granted abilities to

protect you while you strike at the heart of the foe.

If you came from a fi ghting class, you probably possess

good armor or exceptional speed in combat, so you trust in

those defenses to help you avoid the most damaging blows.

Use your *luck of battle* ability to avoid damaging magic, saving

your *chaos warp* ability to help you avoid devastating critical

hits from strong opponents with exceptional weapons. When

you reach your enemy, use your *sanctifi ed strength* to deal extra

damage with a single blow.

Nature’s Protector (Ehlonna): The abilities Ehlonna has

granted you are geared toward readying your allies for a fi ght

and healing them afterward. Thus, you usually concentrate

on protecting and heartening warriors, though you do keep

a few surprises in store for complacent enemies. Whenever

possible, use *summon nature’s mount* to achieve battlefi eld

supremacy, since it lets you stay out of range of your most

powerful enemies and use ranged spells or attacks to harass

them. When possible, dart in to rescue wavering comrades,

either pulling them from the press or healing them on the

spot, depending on the resources you have available.

A Knife in the Dark (Olidammara): You aren’t a battlefi

eld hero. As a sanctifi ed one of Olidammara, you have no

need to prove your valor—only to win. Though some might

call you a coward, you know how to use your wits and abilities

to keep yourself alive and free on the battlefi eld. Your

not in the face and *fast talk* abilities make you diffi cult to

hit, and you can save many lives at a time with your chaos

luck ability. In general, you make yourself innocuous on the

battlefi eld, hoping to deliver a devastating strike—or even a

timely distraction—at just the right moment.

Deathspell (Wee Jas): Though you depend heavily on

your spells, you aren’t a blast-away type of spellcaster. As a

sanctifi ed one of Wee Jas, you prefer to use your powers to

infl uence minds—and sometimes bodies as well. Your resistance

to death effects makes you the ideal person to confront

wayward undead, and your armor of law protects you from

overzealous foes that don’t know any better than to attack

a servant of Death. When the time is right, your sanctifi ed

spell ability can deliver an unexpected, deliberate magical

punch, thereby providing Wee Jas with more company in

the netherworld.

Advancement

When you chose to devote yourself wholly to your deity, you

had to earn the trust and respect of your church’s authorities.

You began to study your deity and the church’s dogma in earnest and take on any missions the church leaders felt

they could entrust to you. In short, you began to serve as a

champion of your deity well before you formally took on the

mantle of sanctifi ed one. When you fi nally did, the entire

congregation knew your reputation and looked up to you as

your deity’s chosen representative.

But your work has only begun. Because you might very

well be the only sanctifi ed one your church has in the area,

you strive harder to advance. You are welcomed into most

organizations sponsored by your deity, but you must be careful

not to focus too heavily on one aspect of your religion at

the expense of another. For example, if you worship Kord,

you certainly value strength, but it would be too easy to

concentrate on refi ning your physical strength at the expense

of the other tenets of your religion.

Try to choose feats that complement your class features and

take advantage of your strengths. Worry less about covering

up your weaknesses; after all, you are only a mortal. If you

worship Wee Jas, take feats that improve your spellcasting

ability and skills that increase your knowledge so that you

can gain a better understanding of the workings of death.

As a follower of Ehlonna, you should work toward becoming

more in tune with nature by learning feats that connect you

with the strengths of animals, plants, and the elements. You

must also continue to increase your knowledge of nature and

its enemies.

Resources

As a sanctifi ed one of your chosen deity, you can expect

respect, recognition, and even assistance from followers of

your religion and those of allied faiths. Your church’s clergy

and congregation trust you as your deity’s representative on

the Material Plane. If you need healing, spellcasting, or other

resources, you have a right to expect the local church or any

nearby worshipers to provide such, even if you cannot offer

compensation immediately.

But being a sanctifi ed one is a double-edged sword. When

asked for assistance by your church or an ally, you cannot

reasonably refuse unless undertaking the requested task

would keep you from performing a greater service for your

deity. Even then, you should try to work out a means of accomplishing

both tasks to prove yourself worthy of your deity’s

trust. You do not expect to go without compensation for your

services—indeed, it would be disrespectful for a church

not to ensure that its sanctifi ed ones were fully equipped.

However, you never demand more than those in need can

afford. Furthermore, when you receive “loans” of services or

goods, you repay them quickly and with interest.

Because of such behavior, you are recognized throughout

the world as a pillar of your religion and few—even the

nonreligious—are disrespectful to you. Your foes might also

treat you with awe, sometimes targeting you more heavily

than they otherwise would. But you are a champion, so you

can withstand your enemies better than most.

SANCTIFIED ONES IN THE WORLD

*”They’re just as committed as paladins—and just as fanatical.”*

—Lars Bentforth, Woldsdown peasant

Sanctifi ed ones are lone champions of their religious beliefs.

While they gain the respect of those around them, they also

fi nd themselves segregated from their fellow worshipers. At

times, sanctifi ed ones can come across as too perfect, or too

intense. Even those who worship “relaxed” deities such as

Olidammara often make others around them feel inadequate

or without purpose. Such reactions stem from the fact that

sanctifi ed ones don’t just believe—they know.

First and foremost, members of this prestige class are adventurers.

However, their patron deities have given them abilities

that enable them to go forth and advance divine agendas

in the world. Few sanctifi ed ones spend their time in large

temples or holy places protected by cities or fortresses. Most

often, they are out in the wild, mingling with the desperate

and the hopeless. Nevertheless, they are seldom out of touch

with their churches, and they are always on call when the

church leaders are in need of heroes. Sanctifi ed ones simply

never get to enjoy the fruits of their labors for long.

In an adventuring party, a sanctifi ed one often serves a

support role because she feels more comfortable helping

others succeed than drawing the glory to herself. Such an

attitude might seem odd to others, especially since sanctifi ed

ones draw so much attention from their foes, but it makes

sense to the holy champion. She knows that someday the

foes sent against her will succeed in destroying her, but she

plans to go down fi ghting and if possible keep her comrades

alive and fi ghting. So while a sanctifi ed one might either

draw fi re or stand back and heal, she doesn’t use her party

members as ammunition or fodder for her enemies’ swords.

Rather, she willingly plays the role her deity has chosen

for her.

Organization

Sanctified ones have no organization of their own, both

because they are so few in number and because they tend

not to bond with characters outside their ranks. And while

sanctifi ed ones of different religions might work together,

they are too committed to the tenets of their individual beliefs

to share any common organizational philosophy or structure.

Thus, sanctifi ed ones often fi nd themselves on the outside

looking in, serving the causes in which they so fervently

believe but isolated from their fellows.

However, each sanctified one automatically belongs to

at least one organization—her church. She might also join

another organization within that church—perhaps one run

by members of a different prestige class. Bu many prestige

classes with religious strictures are too narrow in focus for

a sanctifi ed one. Such a character isn’t interested in just

one aspect of her deity’s portfolio; she wants to promote the

whole package.

NPC Reactions

People fortunate enough to meet a sanctified one of their

own church often treat her as a hero. They see her as someone

their children should look up to and someone they

themselves should venerate, but a measure of desperation

is often intermingled with this hero worship. People have

heard that sanctifi ed ones go only where their church needs

them, and that they settle where the fi re is hottest. Thus,

common folk revere sanctifi ed ones but hope they are simply

passing through, looking for trouble in some faraway land.

Such NPCs usually begin any interaction as helpful, or at

worst friendly.

Clerics react to a sanctifi ed one of their own faith in

similar ways. Most see her as a devoted follower of their religion,

welcome her into their sanctuaries, and share news,

food, and problems with her. Church leaders—be they lay

persons, actual clerics, or other divine casters—recognize

their deity in the face of the sanctifi ed one and see her

presence as a blessing. But they too worry about

trouble. Why is the sanctified one there? What

does the god need done? How is her mission

going to affect the church, the congregation,

and the clergy? Nevertheless, devout

clerics are helpful to sanctifi ed ones on

almost any occasion.

A few clerics, however, disdain and

even envy sanctifi ed ones. Some such

individuals come from fringe sects

or overly structured temples in

which rote has replaced belief in

the hearts of the worshipers, and

others have a slightly different

alignment from their deity. In

such cases, the cleric may view

the sanctifi ed one as too stratifi

ed, or too intensely devoted

to a “narrow-minded view” of

the deity. This situation isn’t

as unusual as it might seem—

plenty of clerics of Kord are

neutral good, and few of them appreciate

hearing a “hero” of the

religion espousing the importance

of chaos, individuality,

and luck. Such clergy members

sometimes mutter against the

sanctifi ed one and can, if left

unchecked, turn her from a

visiting hero into a harbinger

of doom in the minds of the

worshipers. Envious clergy might

appear to be helpful in initial interactions,

but turn out to be unfriendly or

even hostile toward the sanctifi ed one

in the long run.

But the true enemies of the sanctifi ed

one are the foes of her religion. Worshipers of evil deities

put even higher prices on the heads of sanctifi ed ones

than on those of known paladins because they rightly see

a strike against such a hero as a strike against the religion

she represents and the deity she worships. A sanctifi ed one

who lingers too long in one place has more to worry about

than mutterings of envious clergy; she runs a very real risk

of assassination or a strike by her religion’s enemies. Enemies

of the sanctifi ed one’s church are always hostile toward the

champion herself.

Most non-evil members of other religions see sanctifi

ed ones as powerful adventurers and seldom treat them

much differently than they would a high-level paladin or

cleric—usually friendly, though occasionally indifferent.

This attitude can be a relief when the sanctifi ed one simply

wants to rest in a place where her deity isn’t worshiped. But

when the deity calls again, she must ride!

SANCTIFIED ONE LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (religion) can

research sanctifi ed ones to learn more about them. When

a character succeeds on a skill check, the following lore is

revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: A sanctifi ed one is a servant of \[*deity’s name*] and

has achieved a strong connection

to her faith.

DC 15: A sanctifi ed one

almost certainly has at least

one special power granted by

her deity.

DC 20: A sanctifi ed one of

\[*deity’s name*] can use one or more

of the following abilities: \[*special*

*abilities*].

DC 30: Characters who

achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the

sanctifi ed ones in your campaign,

including notable individuals,

the areas where they operate,

and the kinds of activities they

undertake.

Since sanctifi ed ones don’t

have their own special organization,

the best way for a character

to approach membership in this

prestige class is to fi nd a devout

clergy member (usually a cleric)

of the appropriate religion and

ask about champions of the deity.

Several attempts might be

required to gain the appropriate

information. Almost every

member of any organized religion

has heard of sanctifi ed ones,

but few have ever actually met

one. Alternatively, when a character

completes quests in the name of

a deity, she might be approached by a

high-level cleric or even a sanctifi ed one

and offered the opportunity to participate in

the initiation rites.

SANCTIFIED ONES IN THE GAME

If you wish to add sanctifi ed ones to your game, you should

probably include more detailed information about religion

as background for adventuring. Religion is a great motivator

for adventuring in the D&D game, and the quest to

become a sanctifi ed one is a process characters can begin

at any level.

You can introduce sanctifi ed ones as NPC heroes when

your PCs attain the appropriate character levels. Because

of their general attitudes, they make terrific NPCs—they

seldom feel the need to “grab the glory,” and they would

rather help others achieve success than be lauded for doing

it all themselves. A sanctifi ed one wants others to become

heroes, especially if doing so links their names to the worship

of the right deity.

When a player evinces interest in devoting his character to

a deity, introduce the concept of the sanctifi ed one as a goal

and allow the PC to work toward it. Luckily, most of the PC’s

goals probably match those of any other adventurer—namely,

defeat evil and become more powerful. Multiple aspiring

sanctifi ed ones in the same party can make for a fun and

interesting group.

Adaptation

This section presents four examples of sanctifi ed ones using

deities from the core D&D game. You can adapt these to

other campaign settings by matching up fi rst portfolios and

domains, and then alignment. You might need to swap out

one or two powers, but fortunately, most of the powers clearly

link to specifi c domains.

If you wish to create your own sanctifi ed one for a different

deity, start with the following basic guidelines.

• The deity probably doesn’t have any other “mainstream”

champions, such as paladins or members of a notable

prestige class. A religion that already has paladins is less

likely to need a sanctifi ed one. This rule doesn’t always

apply, but it’s a good guideline.

• The sanctifi ed one is a fi ve-level prestige class for a reason.

The deities chosen are usually patrons of other classes,

and obviously so. A patron deity of druids wants its

followers to be druids. Allowing them to deviate for fi ve

levels and gain some appropriate abilities is fi ne, but any

greater investment in another class actually steers the

sanctifi ed one away from the deity’s patronage.

• The sanctifi ed one’s abilities should involve some small

amount of choice. Even though these characters are supposed

to follow their religions’ ideals, no one mortal could

possibly do justice to all of them. So build a short list with

more choices than a character could possibly take, and

see where the concept goes from there.

Sample Encounter

Sanctifi ed ones are most often encountered on missions for

their deities. Because their missions usually involve extreme

danger of some kind, these NPCs can easily sweep PCs along

with them, involving them in adventures.

EL 12: Tarrana, a sanctified one of Kord, has awakened

the sleepy town of Woldsdown, where the PCs have been

staying, at an early hour. Bellowing that evil is afoot, she

rides into town on a weary horse in the predawn hours,

dismounts, and takes a fresh mount from a startled local,

promising him in softer tones that she will bring his prized

horse back safely. Then, eyes fl ashing like diamonds, she asks

for reinforcements. Her gaze settles on the PCs, and she asks,

“Well, are you just going to sit there, or are you ready to save

some lives?”

WHY NO EVIL SANCTIFIED ONES?

The deities of evil have their champions too, but such individuals

share few characteristics with sanctified ones. Even the lawful

neutral worshipers of Wee Jas and the chaotic neutral followers

of Olidammara sometimes work together toward a common

goal, but evil characters can seldom manage viable alliances.

Aside from the fact that evil sanctified ones would usually

be NPCs by default, the evil deities often prefer to reshape the

world, and their worshipers, in their own images without much

of a common bond. An evil champion of Erythnul would find

less in common with a champion of Gruumsh than you might

think, even though both deities are chaotic evil. Sanctified ones,

on the other hand, are unified by their single-minded devotion

to their deities, and even those of differing philosophies and

alignments can work together for extended periods of time. Evil

champions tend to betray each other frequently, and no underlying

bond exists between them.
