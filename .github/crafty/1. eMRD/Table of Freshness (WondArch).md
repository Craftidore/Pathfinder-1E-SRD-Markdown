# Table of Freshness (WondArch)
## Overview
**Table of Freshness:** This table (which seats up to 12 people) automatically purifies any food or drink put upon it (as the *[[Purify Food and Drink (Spell)|purify food and drink]]* spell). This makes it safe to consume, no matter how spoiled or poisonous. If left on the table, the substance rots again naturally. However, if taken from the table and returned, the table again purifies it.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Purify Food and Drink (Spell)|purify food and drink]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
