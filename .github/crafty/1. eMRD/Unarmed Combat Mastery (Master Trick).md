# Unarmed Combat Mastery (Master Trick)
## Overview
*Unarmed Combat Mastery*: A ninja who selects this trick deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were a monk of her ninja level â€“4. If the ninja has levels in monk, this ability stacks with monk levels to determine how much damage she can do with her unarmed strikes. A ninja must have the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat before taking this trick.
