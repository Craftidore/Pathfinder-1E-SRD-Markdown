# Master Transmogrifist (PrC)
## Overview
Perhaps none of an arcane spellcaster’s mighty powers is

so versatile, useful, or spectacular as the ability to change

into something else entirely. The master transmogrifi st is a

sorcerer or wizard who has chosen to specialize in spells that

change his form. The *polymorph* spell and other shapechanging

transmutations offer the master transmogrifi st the ability

to become a fearsome juggernaut of physical battle, a swiftfl

ying traveler, or the perfect spy.

Since a character must achieve a signifi cant

level of competence as an arcane spellcaster to

qualify for this prestige class, virtually all who

choose this path are sorcerers or wizards. Of the

two, sorcerers are more often drawn to the spontaneity

and inventiveness offered by the *polymorph*

spell and other spells like it.

NPC master transmogrifi sts delight in demonstrating

their prowess with their favorite shapes,

and are thus sometimes amenable to putting on a

show for powerful kings, wizards, or other

transmogrifi sts.

Adaptation: The favored shape

ability already provides structure

to this class, but one method to add

more is to decide that a given

transmogrifi st must choose a

creature type, such as animal.

A transmogrifi st gains his enhanced shapechanging abilities

only for shapes he takes of that creature type, though he

can still take other shapes, too, depending on the spell he

casts. He just doesn’t gain the advantages that accrue from

this prestige class while in shapes not of his selected type.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become a master transmogrifi st, a character

must fulfi ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Skills: Bluff 2 ranks, Disguise 5 ranks.

Feat: Eschew Materials.

Spells: Able to cast *alter self* and *polymorph.*

Class Skills

The master transmogrifi st’s class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft

(Int), Disguise (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession

(Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are class features

of the master transmogrifi st

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor

Profi ciency: Master transmogrifi

sts gain no profi ciency

with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells

Known: At each level indicated

on Table 2–14, a master

transmogrifi st gains new spells

per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if he

had also gained a level

in an arcane spellcasting

class to which he

belonged before adding

the prestige class level. He

does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of

that class would have gained

(such as the bonus feat sometimes

gained by a wizard).

If he had more than one

arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a

master transmogrifi

st, he must decide

to which class to add

each level for the

purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Extended Change (Ex): A master transmogrifi st gains the

benefi t of the Extend Spell feat on any transmutation spell he

casts to change into one of his favored shapes (see below). This

benefi t does not increase the spell’s level or casting time, or

require any special preparation. Spells that can benefi t from

this ability include *alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object,*

and *shapechange.*

Favored Shape (Su): A master transmogrifi st chooses

three favored shapes at 1st level. A favored shape is a specifi c

kind of creature whose form he can assume by means of the

*polymorph* spell. He cannot choose a creature of his own type

(humanoid, most likely) as a favored shape. For example, an

8th-level human sorcerer/1st-level master transmogrifi st

might choose pegasus, umber hulk, and bronze dragon as his

favored shapes, though because of the Hit Dice restriction,

he could become only a very young bronze dragon. A master

transmogrifi st gains a number of advantages with his favored

shapes, as noted in the following class feature descriptions.

At every odd-numbered level beyond 1st, a master transmogrifi

st gains one additional favored shape. Thus, he has

four at 3rd level, fi ve at 5th level, six at 7th level, and

seven at 9th level. Furthermore, once per

master transmogrifi st level beyond

1st, a character can choose to

lose a previously chosen

favored shape and select a

replacement.

Manifest Senses (Su): At

2nd level and higher, a master

transmogrifi st gains the senses of

his favored shape when he assumes

its form. Senses include extraordinary

special qualities such

as blindsense, blindsight, darkvision,

low-light vision, scent,

and tremorsense.

Battle Mastery (Ex): At 3rd

level, a master transmogrifi st

gains a +2 competence

bonus on all attack rolls

he makes while in one of

his favored shapes. This bonus

increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at

9th level.

Effortless Change (Ex): At 4th

level, a master transmogrifi st learns

how to change his form

through a simple act of

will. He can choose to

apply the benefi ts of the

Still Spell and Silent

Spell feats (even if he

doesn’t have the feats) to

any transmutation spell he casts to change

into one of his favored shapes. This benefi t

does not increase the spell’s level or casting time, or require

any special preparation. Spells that can benefi t from this

ability include *alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object,* and

*shapechange.*

Shapechanger (Ex): A master transmogrifi st acquires the

shapechanger subtype at 5th level. He also gains the ability

to remain in an assumed form indefi nitely when he casts

*alter self.* This works exactly like the *alter self* spell except

that the duration is permanent. In other words, a master

transmogrifi st can remain in the form he assumes as long

as he wishes, until either he chooses to dismiss it or the *alter*

*self* effect is dispelled.

Refl exive Change (Ex): At 7th level and higher, a master

transmogrifi st has the ability to change into a favored shape via a transmutation spell in response to an opponent’s

action once per day. If he has an appropriate spell prepared

and chooses to use this ability, he can change form as an

immediate action (see page 86) in response to the action

of another creature. For example, a master transmogrifi st

might turn into a dragon turtle to gain a high Armor Class

against an impending attack, or change into a red dragon to

gain immunity to the fi re damage of an enemy’s *fi re storm*

spell. The spell is expended as if the transmogrifi st had cast

it normally, and he remains in his new form until either the

spell’s duration expires or he dismisses it. A transmogrifi st

gives up his next action to make a refl exive change.

If a master transmogrifi st is currently under the effect

of a *shapechange* spell he cast on himself, he can use his

refl exive change ability as often as he likes (although never

more than once per round). Each time he uses it, he loses

his next action.

Manifest Qualities (Ex): At 8th level and higher, a master

transmogrifi st has all the extraordinary special qualities of

any favored shape he assumes. For example, he could change

into a troll to make use of the troll’s regeneration ability, or

take the form of a green hag to gain spell resistance 18.

Infi nite Variety (Su): At 10th level, a master transmogrifi

st gains the ability to create completely imaginary forms

when he casts *polymorph, polymorph any object,* or *shapechange*

on himself. To create an imaginary form, he chooses one of

his favored shapes as a base form. He can then choose a single

aspect of a second monster whose form he could assume

using the spell he is casting and add it to the fi rst creature.

His available options include the following.

• Replace the base form’s natural armor bonus with that of

the second form.

• Add the second form’s movement modes.

• Add one of the second form’s natural attack types (with

the appropriate reach), if the base form doesn’t have that

attack type already.

• Add an extraordinary special attack of the second form.

• Add an extraordinary special quality of the second form.

• Replace one of the base form’s physical ability scores, if

both the base form and the second form are the same size

category.

For example, if a young red dragon is the base form and a giant

octopus is the second, a master transmogrifi st could add the

octopus’s eight tentacle rakes (damage 1d4 + Str bonus) to the

dragon’s available natural attacks.
