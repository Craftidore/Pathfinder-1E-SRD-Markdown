SUN FANE

Symbol: The symbol of the Sun Fane is the same as that of

Pelor: a shining sun.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Sun Fane is a powerful

Pelorite temple. A cyclopean golden dome, representing

the sun, rests atop colossal blue marble walls, representing

the sky, and both are supported by golden fl ying buttresses,

completing the tableau by representing the sun’s rays shining

down on the earth.

The goal of the temple is to witness for Pelor and spread the

glory of its merciful diety. All members of the temple turn a

stern eye on those who disparage Pelor as a “part-time god”

who only works half the day.

The prelates, canons, and bishops of the Sun Fane are all

ardent in their worship of Pelor, but this does not stop them

from engaging in heated internal politics. The One Sun is

the archcanon of the temple, and when a leader steps down

or passes away into the sun’s brilliant radiance, the infi ghting

is fi erce.

Members: Most of the Sun Fane’s members are clerics,

and only a cleric can rise to become the One Sun. Paladins,

rogue scholars, and a few druids also climb the ecclesiastical

ladder of the Sun Fane’s hierarchy.

In keeping with its merciful teachings, the Sun Fane holds

no grudge against those who leave its ranks. The temple is

notoriously persistent, however, in trying to win back souls,

and those who leave the Sun Fane hierarchy can expect many

old friends to come calling with news of brilliant grace and

blessed light.

Type: Temple.

Scale: 12 (kingdom).

Affi liation Score Criteria: The Sun Fane is open only to

those of non-evil alignment.
