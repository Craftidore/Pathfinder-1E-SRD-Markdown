# Morphic Savant (Archetype)
## Overview
A morphic savant is an agent of change who draws power from the Abyss, Elysium, or the Maelstrom to fulfill whatever goals strike his fancy. Chaotic evil and chaotic neutral morphic savants often train with Blackfire Adepts in the hopes of learning greater powers of chaotic unmaking, and chaotic good morphic savants are most common as agents of the Bellflower Network. 

**Alignment**: Any chaotic. 

**Eidolon of Chaos**: A morphic savant’s eidolon must be of a chaotic alignment (if using the summoner from *Pathfinder Unchained*, the eidolon must have the azata, demon, or [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|protean subtype]]). The morphic savant’s eidolon has three base forms: biped, quadruped, and serpentine. Each form has the same feats and skills, but has its own set of evolutions. When the summoner meditates and regains his spell slots for the day, he can select any of the three base forms of his eidolon. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the morphic savant’s summoner level, and has 1 fewer skill point per Hit Die. This ability alters eidolon. 

**Morphic Monsters**: Since a morphic savant’s power is drawn from planar energies aligned with chaos, all the creatures he summons must be of a chaotic alignment. If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead an entropic creature *(Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2* 292). 

This also causes the morphic savant’s summoning power to be less reliable than a standard summoner’s. Each time he uses his *summon monster* spell-like ability to summon multiple creatures, there is a 50% chance he summons one more monster than normal for the *summon monster* spell he uses, in which case the creatures remain for only 1 round per level (instead of 1 minute per level). 

Also, starting at 2nd level, the morphic savant can grant one 1-point evolution to all the creatures he summons with his *summon monster* spell-like ability. He can’t grant an evolution that duplicates the function of, or has the same name as, any ability the summoned creatures already possess (for example, he can’t grant a creature with a bite attack another bite attack), nor can he add an evolution that causes the summoned monsters to have more attacks than his eidolon’s maximum number of attacks. The creatures do not have to be of the correct subtype to gain an evolution, but do have to meet any other prerequisites. 

This ability alters *summon monster*. 

**Chaos Magic**: A morphic savant gains the following bonus spells known at the listed spell level: 1st—*[[Protection From Law (Spell)|protection from law]]*, 2nd—*shard of chaos*UM, 3rd—*[[Magic Circle Against Law (Spell)|magic circle against law]]*, 4th—*[[Chaos Hammer (Spell)|chaos hammer]]*, 5th—*[[Dispel Law (Spell)|dispel law]]*, 6th—*[[Word of Chaos (Spell)|word of chaos]]*. The morphic savant gains one fewer spell known per spell level for spell levels 1–6. This ability alters the summoner’s spells known.
