# Exemplar (PrC)
## Overview
An exemplar is someone who believes that most individuals

and creatures possess a wellspring of untapped talent

and capability, and that the multiverse would be a better

place if only they would all try to live up to their potential.

To her mind, the best way to encourage this behavior in others is to exemplify it herself. An exemplar focuses her

energy on improving the skills she possesses until she

is able to perform them with fluidity, grace, and art. She

believes that even the simplest action (such as climbing

a tree or building a chair) can be done with such skill

and flair as to inspire awe and stimulate a desire for selfbetterment.

No matter what area a particular exemplar

excels in, be it walking a tightrope, deciphering forgotten

languages, or remembering the names of every archfiend

in the Abyss, she performs it with passion and joy.

Bards are the characters most likely to become

exemplars, but wizards, rogues, rangers, and

druids sometimes choose this path as well.

All of these classes have a fair number

of people who believe that their actions

can be viewed as art, and like most artists

they want to inspire others with

their abilities. Clerics, paladins, and

monks also choose this prestige class

on rare occasions, but their dedication

to promoting a philosophy or a higher

power sometimes conflicts with the

exemplar’s belief that the best way to inspire

others is simply to be a good role model.

NPC exemplars often are eccentric characters

who travel the multiverse, stopping

anywhere that catches their interest. Some

might be nobles or members of rich merchant

families who use their reputations to open doors

at the courts of powerful and influential individuals,

hoping that their example will help

their hosts become wiser rulers. Other

exemplars are mendicants or wandering

sages, traveling among the common

folk in the hopes of inspiring the

people to improve their lots

in life. The great majority of

exemplars are just ordinary

characters making livings as

bakers, blacksmiths, merchants,

or even adventurers. No matter what

their jobs, though, at their hearts they are all

educators, hoping to improve the multiverse by setting

a good example.

Adaptation: The easiest way to customize the exemplar

prestige class is to choose one skill that several exemplars

specialize in and describe them as a separate class or

organization. The exemplars of the Spot skill, for example,

might become the Watchers of Ordoanai, a group of

mercenary scouts and bodyguards. The exemplars of

the Tumble skill could be described as the Blue Circle

Acrobats, a troupe of performers who work secretly as

assassins and use their performance as a front.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an exemplar, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Skills: Diplomacy 6 ranks, any other

skill 13 ranks.

Feat: Skill Focus (any).

CLASS SKILLS

All skills are class skills for an exemplar. 

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features

of the exemplar prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Exemplars gain no

proficiency with any weapon

or armor.

Skill Artistry (Ex): An

exemplar is particularly talented

in the use of one of

her skills. Choose one skill

in which the exemplar has

at least 13 ranks. She gains a

+4 competence bonus on all checks involving

that skill.

At 4th, 7th, and 10th levels, an

exemplar gains this ability again.

Each time she selects a different

skill to receive the +4 competence

bonus, provided she has at least 13

ranks in a skill that she has not yet

chosen to benefit from this ability. If

not, she gains no benefit from the ability

until she has 13 ranks in another skill. She can

then immediately apply the benefit of skill artistry to

that skill.

Skill Mastery (Ex): An exemplar is so confident in

the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably

even under adverse conditions. She selects a number

of skills equal to 1 + her Int modifier. When making a

check with one of these skills, she can take 10 even if

stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Each time an exemplar gains a class level, she

can add another skill to the list of skills with which she

has mastery.

Lend Talent (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, an exemplar

can lend some of her skill artistry to allies, allowing them

to exceed their normal talents. By accepting a penalty on

checks using a skill for which she has selected skill artistry,

an exemplar grants a competence bonus on checks

with that skill to all allies within 30 feet. The penalty

can be any number that does not exceed the exemplar’s

class level, and the competence bonus is equal to one-half

the penalty. Activating this ability is a full-round action,

and the effect lasts for as long as the exemplar remains

conscious and within range.

For example, a 4th-level exemplar who has selected

skill artistry with Craft (armorsmithing) can accept a –4

penalty on Craft (armorsmithing) checks to grant all allies

within 30 feet a +2 competence bonus on Craft (armorsmithing)

checks for as long as she remains nearby.

At 8th level, the competence bonus granted by this

ability becomes equal to the penalty accepted by the

exemplar.

Bonus Feat: At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, an exemplar

gains a bonus feat, which must be selected from the following

list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity,

Athletic, Blind-Fight, Combat Casting, Combat Expertise,

Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Improved Initiative,

Improved Swimming†, Investigator, Magical Aptitude,

Negotiator, Nimble Fingers, Open Minded†, Persuasive,

Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus, Stealthy, Track, or Versatile

Performer†. The exemplar must meet all the prerequisites

for the chosen feat.

† New feat described in Chapter 3.

Sustaining Presence (Su): Starting at 4th level, an

exemplar knows how to call upon her force of personality

to help keep herself alive in tense or dangerous situations.

She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her Concentration

checks and Fortitude saves.

Persuasive Performance (Ex): Starting at 5th level,

an exemplar can use her skill artistry to improve the

attitudes of NPCs. To do this, the NPCs must observe

her using one of the skills to which she has applied

skill artistry. Treat this as a Diplomacy check made to

influence NPC attitudes (see pages 71–72 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*), but replace the Diplomacy check with a check

using the chosen skill.

The demonstration must be nonthreatening and

intended to entertain and amuse the onlookers. Viewers

must be within 30 feet of the exemplar, must be able to

see her clearly, and must willingly pay attention to her

actions. This ability requires at least 1 minute to perform,

and it can affect a particular creature only once every 24

hours.

Intellectual Agility (Su): Starting at 8th level, an

exemplar can channel her intellect to more physical

needs. She adds her Intelligence bonus (if any) to her

initiative checks and Reflex saves.

Perfect Self: A 10th-level exemplar has tuned her

body with skill to the point that she becomes a magical

creature. Her type changes to outsider (native). See the

monk class feature, page 42 of the *Player’s Handbook.*
