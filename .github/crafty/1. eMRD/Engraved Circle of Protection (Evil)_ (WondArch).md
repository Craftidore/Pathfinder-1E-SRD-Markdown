# Engraved Circle of Protection (Evil): (WondArch)
## Overview
**Engraved Circle of Protection (evil):** This work is a permanent form of a *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]**.* It is engraved into the floor of the stronghold space that encloses it. It can be any size from 3 feet wide up to a full 20 feet across, taking up most of a stronghold space. Once engraved, the size cannot be changed. Anyone within the *engraved circle of protection (evil)* gains the effects of a *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]* spell.

Alternatively, the engraved circle of protection can be created to serve as a magical prison for a called creature (as *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]*, except that the effect is permanent).

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
