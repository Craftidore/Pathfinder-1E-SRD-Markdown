From the stout dwarf to the noble elf, the races of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game are a diverse mix of cultures, sizes, attitudes, and appearances. After you’ve generated your character’s basic ability scores, the next step in the character creation process is to select your character’s race; this chapter presents seven different options from which to choose. These seven races comprise the most commonly encountered civilized races in the Pathfinder RPG.

Choosing your character’s race is one of the more important decisions you’ll need to make. As your character grows more powerful, you’ll be able to diversify his or her abilities by selecting different classes, skills, and feats, but you only get to pick your race once (unless some unusual magic, like *reincarnation*, comes into play). Of course, each race is best suited to a specific type of role—dwarves make better fighters than they do sorcerers, while half lings aren’t as good as half-orcs at being barbarians. Keep each race’s advantages and disadvantages in mind when making your choice. While it can be fun to play a race against its assumed role, it’s not as fun to get three levels into a character before realizing that the character you wanted to play would have been better off as a different race entirely.

Each of the seven races in this chapter is presented in the same format, starting with a generalized description of the race’s role in the world. This is followed by a physical description of an average member of that race, a brief overview of the race’s society, and a few words about the race’s relations with the other six. Although your race doesn’t force you to choose one religion or alignment over another, the typical choices for each race are mentioned. Next is a discussion of why a member of the race in question might decide to take on the peril-filled life of an adventurer. Finally, we list a few sample names for males and females of each race.

Each of the seven races also has a suite of special abilities, bonuses, and other adjustments that apply to all members of that race. These are your character’s “racial traits.” Each race also has ability score modifiers that are applied after you’ve generated your ability scores, as described in the previous chapter. These modifiers can raise an ability score above 18 or reduce a score below 3—although having such a low score in any of your abilities is something you should avoid, as there’s no surer route to character death than a low Constitution, and no swifter route to frustration than a PC who can’t talk since his Intelligence is lower than 3. You should seek your GM’s approval before playing a character with any ability score of less than 3.

The seven races presented in this chapter have wildly different abilities, personalities, and societies, but at the same time, all seven races are quite similar—none of the races here deviate too far from humanity, and all of their abilities are roughly equal and balanced. Other races, more powerful and more exotic, exist in the game world as well, but the Pathfinder RPG is built and balanced with the expectation that all players start on roughly equal footing. Rules and guidelines for playing more powerful or more unusual races can be found in Chapter 12 of the *Core Rulebook*.

(This document was updated 3/15/04 to include D&D 3.5 terminology.)

If you have taken a look at the *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting* (and with D&D 3.5 it's in the DMG), you've probably seen the section that talks about "powerful races" like [[Drow|drow]] and other monsters, and how to balance them compared to core *Player's Handbook* characters with the "effective character level adjustment" (it's on page 21 of the *FRCS* ... in D&D 3.5 it's just called "level adjustment"). If you look at the numbers and compare them to what's in the *Monster Manual*, you may end up with a question very much like this one:

**Question:** Why is a [[Drow|drow]] CR equal to "class level +1," but its LA is +2? Which should I use?

**Answer:** CR and LA measure different things, and you shouldn't confuse the two. Let's define the terms. (Red sentences

CR (challenge rating) measures how much of a challenge an **NPC** creature (whether a character or monster) is in combat against a group of 4 player characters.

*Example:* A party of 4 5th-level characters is expected to use 20% of its resources (spells, hit points, and other expendable abilities) fighting a single CR 5 monster.

LA (level adjustment) compares how much more powerful a creature is as a **PC** than a same-configuration character with a different PC race.

*Example:* A [[Human (Baklunish)|human]], [[Elf|elf]], [[Dwarf|dwarf]], or other PH-race is LA +0 ... zero is the default/average/normal value. [[Aasimar]] are LA +1, slightly more powerful than LA +0 races. [[Drow]] are LA +2, even more powerful than [[Aasimar|aasimar]].

ECL (effective character level) measures how powerful a creature is if used as a **PC**. ECL = creature's HD + LA.

*Example:* A PC [[Human (Baklunish)|human]] Ftr6 is ECL 6 (6 HD + 0 LA). A PC [[Drow|drow]] Ftr6 is ECL8 (6 HD + 2 LA). A PC [[Doppelganger|doppelganger]] Ftr6 is ECL 14 (4 race HD + 6 class HD + 4 LA).

A 2-HD monster with damage reduction 10/+1 isn't much more powerful than a typical 2-HD monster, such as a [[Gnoll|gnoll]]. The monster is more of a threat to low-level parties, so it might merit a +1 to its CR compared to an [[Gnoll|gnoll]] (giving it a CR of 2).

However, that same creature as a PC race is much more powerful than a [[Human (Baklunish)|human]] or an [[Elf|elf]]. This is because if the creature is a monster for the PCs to fight as an encounter, it only gets the benefit of its damage reduction for a few rounds before the heroes kill it. If it is a player character, it gets its damage reduction *every single combat for the life of its adventuring career*. The monster is effectively immune to the attacks of most normal weapons (since most normal weapons can't do more than 10 points of damage without a critical hit), making the character almost invincible at lower levels. Such a monster should deserve at least a LA of +1, and probably should actually be LA +2 ... the monster is about as tough as a 2nd or 3rd level character.

An example is the drow elf. [[Drow]] have a CR adjustment of "class level +1" and a LA of +2. Thus, an NPC [[Drow|drow]] Ftr5 has a CR of 6. However, that [[Drow|drow]] Ftr5 as a PC is treated as a 7th-level character (5 class levels plus the LA adjustment of +2 = 7). This is because the [[Drow|drow]]'s spell resistance and other magical abilities are more valuable if he gets to use them over and over again, which he *will* get to do as a PC because he's played in multiple sessions, instead of being killed after one fight if he were a "monster."

So don't confuse CR with LA (or ECL). LA tends to be higher than the CR adjustment for a creature because in the long run a PC with special abilities gets to use them more often than a monster with those same abilities.

## Pathfinder Races and ECL adjustments
**Pathfinder Races and ECL adjustments**

The Pathfinder RPG does not use ECL adjustments. This was probably done (along with so many other things) in an effort to simplify the game. In 'pure' Pathfinder games, the races do not need ECL adjustments. Simple as that.

However, in 'legacy' games where 3.5 material is used, ECL adjustments are absolutely needed. Including adjustments for Pathfinder races. The following table supplies those adjustments for when GMs might need them:
