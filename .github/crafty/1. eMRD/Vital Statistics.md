# Vital Statistics
## Overview
The following section determines a character’s starting age, height, and weight. The character’s race and class influence these statistics. Consult your GM before making a character that does not conform to these statistics.

## Age
**Age**

You can choose or randomly generate your character’s age. If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age for the character’s race and class (see Table 7–1). Alternatively, roll the dice indicated for your class on Table 7–1 and add the result to the minimum age of adulthood for your race to determine how old your character is.

With age, a character’s physical ability scores decrease and his mental ability scores increase (see Table 7–2). The effects of each aging step are cumulative. However, none of a character’s ability scores can be reduced below 1 in this way.

When a character reaches venerable age, secretly roll his maximum age (on Table 7–2) and record the result, which the player does not know. A character who reaches his maximum age dies of old age sometime during the following year.

The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the world at large die from pestilence, accidents, infections, or violence before getting to venerable age.

## Height and Weight
**Height and Weight**

To determine a character’s height, roll the modifier dice indicated on Table 7–3 and add the result, in inches, to the base height for your character’s race and gender. To determine a character’s weight, multiply the result of the modifier dice by the weight multiplier and add the result to the base weight for your character’s race and gender.

**Table 7–3: Random Height and Weight**


| **Race** | **Base** <br>**Height** | **Base**<br>**Weight** | **Modifier** | **Weight**<br>**Multiplier** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Human, male | 4 ft. 10 in. | 120 lbs. | 2d10 | × 5 lbs. |
| Human, female | 4 ft. 5 in. | 85 lbs. | 2d10 | × 5 lbs. |
| Dwarf, male | 3 ft. 9 in. | 150 lbs. | 2d4 | × 7 lbs. |
| Dwarf, female | 3 ft. 7 in. | 120 lbs. | 2d4 | × 7 lbs. |
| Elf, male | 5 ft. 4 in. | 100 lbs. | 2d8 | × 3 lbs. |
| Elf, female | 5 ft. 4 in. | 90 lbs. | 2d6 | × 3 lbs. |
| Gnome, male | 3 ft. 0 in. | 35 lbs. | 2d4 | × 1 lb. |
| Gnome, female | 2 ft. 10 in. | 30 lbs. | 2d4 | × 1 lb. |
| Half-elf, male | 5 ft. 2 in. | 110 lbs. | 2d8 | × 5 lbs. |
| Half-elf, female | 5 ft. 0 in. | 90 lbs. | 2d8 | × 5 lbs. |
| Half-orc, male | 4 ft. 10 in. | 150 lbs. | 2d12 | × 7 lbs. |
| Half-orc, female | 4 ft. 5 in. | 110 lbs. | 2d12 | × 7 lbs. |
| Halfling, male | 2 ft. 8 in. | 30 lbs. | 2d4 | × 1 lb. |
| Halfling, female | 2 ft. 6 in. | 25 lbs. | 2d4 | × 1 lb. |

**Bigger and Smaller Creatures**: The figures on Table 7–4 are for Medium bipedal creatures. A larger bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, as follows: Large ×2, Huge ×4, Gargantuan ×8, Colossal ×16. A smaller creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as follows: Small ×3/4, Tiny ×1/2, Diminutive ×1/4, Fine ×1/8.

Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Multiply the values corresponding to the creature’s Strength score from Table 7–4 by the appropriate modifier, as follows: Fine ×1/4, Diminutive ×1/2, Tiny ×3/4, Small ×1, Medium ×1-1/2, Large ×3, Huge ×6, Gargantuan ×12, Colossal ×24.

## Carrying Capacity
**Carrying Capacity**

These carrying capacity rules determine how much a character’s equipment slows him down. Encumbrance comes in two parts: encumbrance by armor and encumbrance by total weight.

**Encumbrance by Armor**: A character’s armor determines his maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, armor check penalty, speed, and running speed (see Table 6–6). Unless your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, that’s all you need to know; the extra gear your character carries won’t slow him down any more than the armor already does. If your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, however, then you’ll need to calculate encumbrance by weight. Doing so is most important when your character is trying to carry some heavy object.

**Encumbrance by Weight**: If you want to determine whether your character’s gear is heavy enough to slow him down more than his armor already does, total the weight of all the character’s items, including armor, weapons, and gear (see appropriate tables in *PF Core Rulebook*, Chapter 6). Compare this total to the character’s Strength on Table 7–4. Depending on the character’s carrying capacity, he or she may be carrying a light, medium, or heavy load. Like armor, a character’s load affects his maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, carries a check penalty (which works like an armor check penalty), reduces the character’s speed, and affects how fast the character can run, as shown on Table 7–5. A medium or heavy load counts as medium or heavy armor for the purpose of abilities or skills that are restricted by armor. Carrying a light load does not encumber a character.

If your character is wearing armor, use the worse figure (from armor or from load) for each category. Do not stack the penalties.

**Lifting and Dragging**: A character can lift as much as his maximum load over his head. A character’s maximum load is the highest amount of weight listed for a character’s Strength in the heavy load column of Table 7–4.

A character can lift as much as double his maximum load off the ground, but he or she can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any Dexterity bonus to AC and can move only 5 feet per round (as a full-round action).

A character can generally push or drag along the ground as much as five times his maximum load. Favorable conditions can double these numbers, and bad circumstances can reduce them by half or more.

**Tremendous Strength**: For Strength scores not shown on Table 7–4, find the Strength score between 20 and 29 that has the same number in the “ones” digit as the creature’s Strength score does and multiply the numbers in that row by 4 for every 10 points the creature’s Strength is above the score for that row.

**Armor and Encumbrance for Other Base Speeds**

The table below provides reduced speed figures for all base speeds from 5 feet to 120 feet (in 5-foot increments).


| **Base** | **Reduced** |  | **Base** | **Reduced** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | **Speed** |  | **Speed** | **Speed** |
| 5 ft. | 5 ft. |  | 65 ft. | 45 ft. |
| 10 ft.–15 ft. | 10 ft. |  | 70 ft.–75 ft. | 50 ft. |
| 20 ft. | 15 ft. |  | 80 ft. | 55 ft. |
| 25 ft.–30 ft. | 20 ft. |  | 85 ft.–90 ft. | 60 ft. |
| 35 ft. | 25 ft. |  | 95 ft. | 65 ft. |
| 40 ft.–45 ft. | 30 ft. |  | 100 ft.–105 ft. | 70 ft. |
| 50 ft. | 35 ft. |  | 110 ft. | 75 ft. |
| 55 ft.–60 ft. | 40 ft. |  | 115 ft.–120 ft. | 80 ft. |
