# Balanced Summoning
## Overview
**Balanced Summoning**

You maintain balance by calling on opposing forces when summoning. 

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a summon monster spell, you can summon two creatures from a single list 1 or more levels lower than the level of the spell. The two creatures must have alignments that are opposite along at least one axis (chaotic and lawful or evil and good). For example, if you cast *[[Summon Monster III (Spell)|summon monster III]]*, you could summon a celestial wolf and a fiendish hyena from the 2nd-level list.

**Source:** Champions of Balance, pg. 20
