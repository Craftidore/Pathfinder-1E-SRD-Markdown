# True Mutagen (Grand Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*True Mutagen:* The alchemist’s mutagen now grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +8 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The alchemist takes a –2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must possess the [[Grand Mutagen (Alchemical Discovery)|grand mutagen]] discovery before selecting this discovery.
