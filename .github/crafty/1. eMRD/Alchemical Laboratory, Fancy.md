# Alchemical Laboratory, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 3,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One alchemist

With this laboratory, the alchemist has every tool he might ever need at his ready disposal. This includes all the things described above, plus an even broader selection of common ingredients and a larger number of tools.

The walls of this place are covered with blackboards upon which all sorts of arcane or obscure notes can be scrawled. The floor is made of rough tile, all the easier to clean chemical spills off while not being too slick to cause slips in such situations. The room includes four basins, each of which has a barrel of water suspended over it, complete with a tap to permit easy access at all times. An emergency barrel mounted on a hinged platform can be tilted to pour water over a person in case of emergency.

A single alchemist using this laboratory and having its resources all to himself receives a +4 circumstance bonus on her Alchemy skill checks (including the assistance of the journeyman alchemist noted below). Alternatively, up to four alchemists can share this space at the same time, and they each receive a +2 circumstance bonus on their Alchemy skill checks.

A journeyman alchemist (Expert 1; Alchemy +7 or alchemist 1+) must be on hand to assist others or to produce for the stronghold.
