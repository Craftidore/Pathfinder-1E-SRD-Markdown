## Background and History
*“When yeh see them yellow sails on the horizon, yeh best turn yer tiller in the other direction and pray that ol’ Gozreh will keep the wind at yer back. Not every slaver ship out o’ Okeno’s Fleshfairs preys on other ships, but then again, not every slaver ship is the Burnt Saffron, and yeh can never be too careful. Better safe than enslaved, I always tell the swabbies. “If yeh can believe such tales, the slaves the Burnt Saffron takes on can never go free, even after death. Howling screams haunt the poor chained souls, who’re forced to row ’til they pass out or die. Even those who manage to escape for a time, they’re still prisoners in their own minds, bewitched into thinkin’ they got to return to the ship and sit right back down at their old oar bench! So, slip up in yer watch at the crow’s nest, and yeh might find yerself—or yer ghost—in a slave collar that only the most powerful magic can break.”*

*—Garuth “Ruddergut” Penswing, coxswain of the Clover Wine*

Most peoples of Golarion have an uneasy relationship with slavery, but to the slavers who sail out of the Katapeshi city of Okeno on yellow-sailed ships, it is a lucrative business indeed. Vessels sailing the Inner Sea generally give Okeno’s ships a wide berth, and few are foolhardy enough to actively seek out and challenge these galleys.

The Burnt Saffron stands out from the Okeno fleet as one of the most belligerent slave galleys in Katapesh’s waters. Its crew harbors a penchant for hunting down other ships and killing more sailors and passengers than they take prisoner.

**Background**

According to common tales, the ship that would become the Burnt Saffron first set sail from Stonespine Island’s Yellow Harbor as the galley White Dawn in 4671 ar. The White Dawn’s pearl-white hull and bright yellow sails made the ship resemble the rising sun when light struck sail and water in the right way. The galley was captained by Farzam Khorsheed, a greedy ex-pirate from the Shackles who had learned firsthand that a ship’s enslaved crew could often fetch a higher price than the plunder from its hold. Khorsheed packed his crew with undesirables who supported his methods, and the Dawn set out to capture the crew and passengers of any ships it encountered.

Despite the ship’s yellow sails, many sailors mistook the brightly colored galley for a simple merchant, never suspecting the cargo it carried. Three years after its maiden voyage, however, the White Dawn departed from the Thuvian port city of Merab with a hold full of slaves. While en route to Okeno, a freak storm caught the ship, smashed its masts and oars, and blew it into Andoren waters. A pair of Gray Corsair ships found the White Dawn adrift on the waves and boarded the crippled ship in hopes of offering assistance. When the Andorens found nearly dead slaves still chained to the Dawn’s ruined oars and crammed into the ship’s hold, they freed the slaves before cutting the galley loose and launching jars of alchemist’s fire to put the haggard crew out of their misery.

Details regarding the White Dawn’s fate are sketchy, but within a few months of its supposed demise, a ship matching the White Dawn’s description was sighted skirting Stonespine Island, but its hull, oars, and masts were onyx instead of white. Its formerly bright yellow sails had darkened to a sickly saffron color, as though the canvas had been left in a dyeing vat for too long. Those fortunate few able to observe the galley up close and survive to tell of it describe a hull blackened by fire rather than paint or pitch.

Since the White Dawn’s alleged reappearance, several flotillas have attempted to hunt down and sink the ship now known as the Burnt Saffron. Some believe the Saffron is just a myth—a sailor’s bogeyman meant to scare craven deckhands. Others maintain that Captain Varixio’s incinerated galley is a ghost ship, reanimated by some infernal pact and commanded to haunt and enslave the fleets of the Inner Sea.

## Ship Description
### Burnt Saffron
![[Burnt Saffron.jpg|Burnt Saffron|300]]
[[Burnt Saffron.jpg|open outside]]

**Ship Description**

The black-hulled galley known as the Burnt Saffron has a beam of 30 feet and stretches nearly 150 feet from bow to stern. With three full decks and two masts flying square sails of burnished yellow, this slave galley is among the most recognizable ships of its kind.

### 1. Sterncastle
**1. Sterncastle**

The Burnt Saffron’s tiller and sole catapult sit atop the sterncastle. Nearby ammunition stores hold 24 stones and eight each of chain shot, liquid ice, and smoke shot. Captain Farzam Khorsheed is usually found here when the ship is coming into port or performing a difficult maneuver. The captain is accompanied by at least three slavers at all times.

### 2. Forecastle
**2. Forecastle**

The Burnt Saffron’s forecastle gives the crew a good perch to observe incoming hazards or ships. Two slavers keep watch here, with an additional four on hand when the ship is actively seeking other vessels to prey upon.

### 3. Main Deck
**3. Main Deck**

Both of the ship’s masts rise from the main deck. A crow’s nest atop the mainmast is accessible by rope ladder or a counterweighted line. The foresail and mainsail riggings are each tied in two clusters of four ropes on either side of the deck’s rails. Each rope’s knot can be untied from the mooring cleats with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check or DC 15 Profession (sailor) check.

Amidships next to the mainmast, the deck hatch (hardness 5, hp 20, break DC 16) lets air and light into the ship, and it can be used as a shortcut to the firing deck (area 7). During battle, the hatch is locked to deny access to boarding parties. Near the forecastle, a pair of stairs on either side of the ship lead down to the stairwell (area 6). Six slavers generally tend to the sails and rigging during normal weather, with an additional dozen on duty in inclement weather.

### 4. Wardroom
**4. Wardroom**

This cabin is where the senior members of the crew carouse and discuss plans.

A large wooden table and some chairs take up most of the space in this cabin. A large parchment map detailing the Katapeshi coastline, Jalmeray, and the nearby ocean covers the table; several X’s mark places where the Burnt Saffron has sunk other ships. Three windows with iron-reinforced shutters (hardness 8, hp 20, break DC 25) on either side of the cabin provide a view of the aft deck and the open ocean beyond.

The door leading into the captain’s quarters (area 5) is locked. Attempting to open the door without speaking the password triggers an alarm trap that silently alerts Captain Khorsheed to the unauthorized intrusion.

### 5. Captain's Quarters
**5. Captain’s Quarters**

A hammock made of luxuriant dhabba pelts hangs on the starboard side of the cabin. On the port side of the cabin, four large iron cages (hardness 10, hp 30, break DC 25) hang from metal hooks in the ceiling. The first cage contains a number of small, vibrantly colored birds. The second cage contains an eagle (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 118). The third cage, the smallest of the group, is home to a gagged and manacled female pixie (Bestiary 228). The fourth and final cage, the largest of the four, contains a mute, malnourished male aasimar (Bestiary 7) in a Saffron slave collar; he barely has enough room to sit up in the cage’s cramped confines.

Two windows with iron-reinforced shutters (hardness 8, hp 20, break DC 25) look out the stern of the ship. 

Khorsheed’s locked chest of valuables is located in a hidden compartment beneath the floorboards (Perception DC 22). Khorsheed holds the only key to this chest, which otherwise requires a successful DC 40 Disable Device check to open and is trapped with a harm trap (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 422).

The chest contains the following: an idol of Asmodeus, a masterwork silver dagger, 3 doses of purple worm poison (Core Rulebook 560), Khorsheed’s journal, Khorsheed’s rutter, and a small sack of valuable gems (one diamond, two rubies, three purple corundum stones, and two blue sapphires) worth 1,000 gp in total.

Khorsheed’s journal appears blank at first. A successful DC 25 Perception check reveals that text has been inscribed with invisible ink. The journal entries recount Khorsheed’s dark past, tales of lost shipwrecks, and other marine oddities, including a list of the most exotic creatures Khorsheed has sold at the Fleshfairs.

Khorsheed’s rutter is a logbook, and the oldest entries date back to before the White Dawn burned. The rutter also includes the locations of several strange, unnamed and otherwise uncharted islands in the southern Obari Ocean.

### 6. Stairwell
**6. Stairwell**

This stairwell heads to the main deck (area 3), and ladders lead down to the rowing benches (area 12). Double doors lead to the firing deck (area 7).

### 7. Firing Deck
**7. Firing Deck**

Six heavy ballistae line either side of this deck. Each ballista has enough ammunition to fire 50 shots (600 bolts in total). Because of the amount of space the siege engines occupy, moving through this area counts as difficult terrain. At least 12 slavers are stationed on this deck at all times. Slavers crewing the ballistae are proficient in the operation of the siege engines and can thus operate the devices without penalties.

### 8. Officers' Quarters
**8. Officers’ Quarters**

Slavemaster Gristlefang and her most trusted underlings bunk here. Six canvas hammocks hang from the ceiling, and five slavers are usually asleep at any given time, resting between their shifts abovedecks or on the firing deck. Below Gristlefang’s sable-lined hammock in the aft port corner sits a wooden chest (hardness 5, hp 15) secured with a good lock (Disable Device DC 30). The chest contains a fire elemental gem, two vials of silversheen, a sack of jewels (two emeralds, three fire opals, five blue star sapphires) worth 1,000 gp in total, and 2,500 gp in coins from across the Inner Sea region.

### 9. Crew Quarters
**9. Crew Quarters**

Fifteen canvas hammocks are crammed into this cabin. The crew sleep in shifts, so each hammock is usually occupied, except in situations that require all hands to be on deck.

### 10. Galley
**10. Galley**

The galley is where the ship’s meals are prepared. This room contains a prep area, barrels and crates of food, a large vat of gruel for the slaves, and a smaller tub of more appetizing food for the rest of the crew.

### 11. Secondary Hold
**11. Secondary Hold**

Crates and barrels of foodstuffs and other standard cargo fill this hold. The hold typically carries between 45 and 80 tons of cargo; its current cargo is worth only 1 point of plunder.

### 12. Rowing Benches
**12. Rowing Benches**

This area is filled with slaves chained to 36 rowing benches, with four slaves per bench. The slaves not on rowing duty sleep underneath their assigned benches. Slavemaster Gristlefang and six slavers keep the slaves under constant watch. These slaves are worth 2 points of plunder.

### 13. Main Hold
**13. Main Hold**

The Burnt Saffron’s primary cargo is the slaves it employs to propel the vessel. Those not currently chained to a bench in area 12 are housed in this cramped cabin, whose walls are lined with rings to which chains can be easily attached. The hold is devoid of furnishings or niceties, and features only a few buckets of either gruel or excrement. Twenty-four frightened and malnourished slaves are chained together and squeezed into this space, along with three corpses of slaves who died in the last few days that have not yet been removed by the Saffron’s crew.

## Ship's Crew
**Ship’s Crew**

Apart from the rowing slaves, 56 slavers call the Burnt Saffron home. Most of the ship’s crew choose to remain with Captain Khorsheed for one reason or another. Some claim this loyalty stems from Khorsheed’s lucrative slaving runs, while others cite more sinister forces at work. The bulk of the ship’s work is done by the scores of slaves in the galley’s holds, the strongest and most docile of which are kept on year after year instead of being sold, to serve as the backbone of the ship’s slave crew.

In addition to Captain Khorsheed and Slavemaster Gristlefang, the Burnt Saffron hosts colorful characters hailing from across the Inner Sea.

**Beng:** This burly Tian slave acts as the slaves’ liaison to the rest of the crew. The position is largely ceremonial, as slaves have no real say in how the ship is run, but the illusion keeps up morale.

**Helmsman Jarva Ellasdotter:** A former Ulfen raider who was stranded in southern Osirion after a shipwreck, Jarva joined the White Dawn’s crew in hopes of earning her way back home. She is one of the few crew members who survived the White Dawn’s transformation into the Burnt Saffron, so she knows more about Khorsheed’s past than Gristlefang. 

**Marine Commander Wedu Tibebe:** This angry and vindictive Garundi, hailing from a longstanding Okeno slaving family, leads boarding parties onto enemy ships. He also coordinates the defense against invaders, and oversees of the Burnt Saffron’s siege arsenal. Wedu is a relatively new addition to the Saffron, his predecessor having died under mysterious circumstances.

Originally a pirate, Farzam Khorsheed was always noted for having eyes the color of burnished gold, and many said he was so greedy that they were surprised he hadn’t gouged out his own eyes to get at the gold in them. Khorsheed’s avarice quickly led him from piracy to the Okeno slave trade, and he has been busy capturing other ships’ crew and passengers and selling them into slavery ever since. 

When the Gray Corsairs sank the *White Dawn*, Khorsheed called upon Asmodeus, god of slavery, to help him, but only Khorsheed knows exactly what deal he struck with the Prince of Lies. What is certain is that the *White Dawn* emerged from the sinking ashes as the *Burnt Saffron*, and Khorsheed has a newfound ability to use divine magic. Together, the *Burnt Saffron* and its captain represent a potent force of slavery on the waters of the Inner Sea. 

Khorsheed treats slaving as his divine mandate, and woe betide any who step in his way. He sees everyone— including himself and his crew—as potential slaves that have not yet been clapped in chains, and he believes that with Asmodeus’s guidance, he will witness the whole world enslaved by his own hand.

Khorsheed’s first mate, Gristlefang, is a gnoll slavemaster with a special talent for breaking slaves who step out of line. She capriciously exercises her cruelty even on obedient slaves, giving her the reputation aboard the vessel as someone whose favor it is wise to earn. 

Gristlefang hails from the deserts of southern Osirion, where she participated in countless raids upon trading caravans and small settlements, and even a few on the fortified city of Ipeq. Dissatisfied with the meager pickings she and her pack were able to claim, Gristlefang set out on her own to pursue a more lucrative slaving career in the markets of Katapesh. 

Within the bustling trade city, Gristlefang found work as an enforcer and slave driver. It wasn’t until she signed on to a mysterious vessel said to be in need of a new slavemaster that she truly found her calling. Accepting Captain Khorsheed’s offer sight unseen, Gristlefang joined the *Burnt Saffron*’s crew shortly after its mysterious transformation, and quickly became the most indispensable member of the crew besides the captain himself.

### Gristlefang

## Ship's Tactics
**Ship’s Tactics**

Whether hugging the Katapeshi coastline, following well-traveled trade routes, or traversing the open waters of the Inner Sea, the Burnt Saffron has rightfully earned its reputation as a scourge against freedom. Any lone ship that crosses the Saffron’s path is potential prey, and the galley’s combination of oars and sails lets the ship overtake all but the most nimble of watercraft.

Captain Khorsheed’s primary goal when approaching another ship is to disable the vessel as quickly as possible. The Saffron’s catapult team employs chain shotUC and regular shot to destroy sails and masts, and follow-up salvos of smoke shotUC throw the enemy crew into disarray. While the enemy panics, the Saffron lashes itself to the limping ship, and boarding party leader Tibebe attacks the enemy crew, using the smoke screen to his advantage. 

Once the captured ship is firmly under Khorsheed’s control, he chooses the most able-bodied survivors, claps them in irons, and throws them in the Saffron’s hold. The rest he commits to the deep or leaves adrift in their ship’s wreckage. Occasionally, however, Khorsheed orders the captured ship—and all of those left aboard—burned. Former Saffron crew members claim that the captain’s orders regarding captured ships are subject to the whims of Asmodeus.

In the rare event that the Burnt Saffron is boarded or infiltrated, the crew sounds the ship’s alarm. The alarm system, which can be triggered by a pull rope in most common areas, consists of a complex series of ropes, chains, and pulleys that ring large, cylindrical bells throughout the ship. Once the alarm sounds, Tibebe’s slavers arrive on the main deck to repel invaders. The slaves’ shackles, years of torture and subjugation, and fear of harsh reprisal prevent them from rising up against their captors unless they are magically compelled to do so.

## Adventure Hooks
**Adventure Hooks**

As one of the most legendary and feared slave galleys on the Obari Ocean and the Inner Sea, the Burnt Saffron can serve as a foe in nearly any campaign, as all ships are potential victims of the sinister vessel. Of the ships in this book, the Burnt Saffron is thus the vessel best suited to serving as a random encounter, though the following plots can also be woven around the ship in order to allow it to play a larger role in an ongoing campaign.

**Dark Dealings:** Sea shanties and barroom whispers explain the White Dawn’s mysterious survival as a result of Khorsheed denouncing Gozreh and calling out to Asmodeus as the Dawn burned and sank around him. Legend tells that the Dawn’s captain entered into a pact with the dark god, and in return, Asmodeus resurrected the ship from its watery grave and imbued it with magical power. The PCs are tasked by the church of a good deity such as Sarenrae or Cayden Cailean to discover the truth of these claims and bring about an end to this dark bargain—if it truly exists.

**No Escape:** Some of the most harrowing tavern tales of the Saffron speak of the slaves that row the ship. According to these accounts, if someone wears a Saffron slave collar for too long, the collar permanently binds his soul to the ship. Even if the collar is removed and the slave is turned free, he will try everything in his power to get back aboard. A close ally of the PCs (perhaps even a PC) has just such a draw to return to the ship, leading the party into a conflict that could result in the entire group coming under Gristlefang’s lash.

**Rescue Operation:** A close associate, family member, or even member of the PCs’ party has been taken captive on a ship described as bearing a striking resemblance to the Burnt Saffron. The PCs must track down the legendary slaver ship to rescue their ally, perhaps across many miles of open ocean. Making the task even more challenging is the fact that Slavemaster Gristlefang is known to execute any slave who seems to be the specific target of a rescue attempt.

**The Unsinkable Ship:** Several times in the last few decades, various Chelish warship and Gray Corsair crews claimed to have sunk a yellow-sailed slave galley matching the Burnt Saffron’s description in a pitched naval battle. The crews witnessed the ship sinking and believed they had defeated the greatest known slaver scourge, only to hear tell of another crew sighting a ship with the same description weeks or months later. The PCs are offered a large bounty by either navy (or an independent party) to sink the Burnt Saffron once and for all.
