# 3j - Empire of the Ghouls
## Overview
Deep under the tiny duchy of Morgau and Doresh lies the heart of a dark empire: the Empire of the Ghouls, home to flesh-eating and blasphemous worshipers of the gods of death, hunger, and darkness, who come to the surface only to feed. Their empire rose more than 100 years ago with the first darakhul to answer a diabolist’s summons.

Well hidden, the empire has bided its time for a century, growing in strength, in knowledge, and in numbers. Speed and ferocity carried the darakhul to their first conquests. Cunning magic and ruthless rage have kept their empire together. Their emperor’s plan and his followers’ unwavering loyalty propel the empire ever forward.

The ghoul reign of conquest against dark elves, dwarves, svirfneblin, dark creepers, and other races of the underworld has not been an accident. The ghouls paralyze their foes, turning enemies into food or into replacements for their losses. Their armies include crawling bone colossi, demonic rams, bat-winged devices trailing fire and smoke, burning skeletons, liquid zombies, and tunneling undead purple worms. Ghouls are inventive soldiers, and they strike quickly: the lightly armored ghoul legions march 72 miles per day in small tunnels (and don’t rest by night), while the heavily armored legions still manage 48 miles per day through difficult tunnels. They either carry their provisions or march alongside them, when the provisions take the form of zombies. In frenzies, ghouls can strip a battlefield clean, down to cracking the bones of the fallen. The only thing preventing the darakhul from swarming the surface world is an aversion to sunlight.

The tactics that have won them city after city and thousands of slaves are simple. They have excellent spies and mindbenders to wrest information from their enemies, undead purple worms and relentless diggers to claw through the earth, mobs of frenzied ghouls, deathcap spores to induce sleep in ranks of breathing foes, and heavy centiles of iron ghouls to destroy foes.

Over time, the legions have learned how to both use their own strengths and exploit their enemies’ need to eat, sleep, and breathe. The ghouls’ modest needs for food allow them to field a much larger army than living creatures. Their lack of any need for air allows them to use fire and smoke with impunity in the confined spaces of the underworld, literally asphyxiating entire settlements and cities that resist them.

The greatest constraints on the use of fire-bat and fireskeleton tactics are not ghoul morality—an oxymoron—but the lack of sufficient fuel to burn in the damp and stony caverns. Ghouls use smoke and fire only for major engagements.

## Darakhan, the White City
**Darakhan, the White City**

Darakhan is besieged by its masses of poor and starving beggar ghouls, kept in line by two powerful legions answerable only to the emperor, and filled with the displays of the rich and powerful. Everyone in the Imperium comes to Darakhan to make a play for power and influence. Most find it a stony place with little room for error.

The approaches to the city are littered with sentries: shriekers, sniffer beetles, and random undead, in addition to being protected by double “airlock” style gates, which are manned by undead at all times.

Bypassing the second gate is a 40-foot section of flooded tunnel. Undead swim through here constantly. Those entering by the main gates are watched with much greater care.

## Fleshbrook
**Fleshbrook**

The settlement of Fleshbrook also dates to the days of the Hundred Kings, before the empire formed. Its single bridge over the Yellow River still makes it a valuable strategic site. The small city is currently ruled by the weakest of the Dukes, Wilmer Corpsefinger, though he has a strong garrison. No legion guards Fleshbrook. 

The village is sometimes called “Beetlebrook” for its greatest product, lamp beetles.

## Fretlock
**Fretlock**

Settled by the strongest of the Hundred Kings, the ancient settlement of Fretlock lies below the largest cemeteries of Morgau and Doresh. It is the staging ground for hunters and profits from the gold, cloth, and meat they bring from crypts, as well as information and contact with the surface world. Currently the city is held by Duke Drago Blackfly, whose Fuligin Manor is visited occasionally by his half-brother, the living necromancer Konrad von Eberfeld in Zobeck. The Wyrmblooded Legion protects Fretlock.

## Gonderif
**Gonderif**

Once a derro city, Gonderif’s stone gates and pillared halls reflect the excellent artistry of its creators. The city is now primarily an armaments center, where iron, mithral, and steel are worked into weapons, equipment, and supplies for the ghoul legions. Most slaves are derro and dwarves, their beards shaven and their foreheads branded as “smith,” “miner,” or “food.” The two types of dwarves despise each other but nevertheless protect each other as much as they can against their common overlords. Gonderif is currently held by the Duke Radu Kopecs. The Corpse Tearers Legion protects Gonderif.

## Gnawbone
**Gnawbone**

Once a drow city, Gnawbone has long since been converted into a center of the priesthood of Anu-Akma, the death god. The ghouls adapted a Spider Goddess shrine to their own uses. The city’s products include the best beetles, finest spider silks, and excellent undead servants, but its true fame is as the site of pilgrimages to the emperor cult, the Anu-Akma shrine, and the tomb of the first emperor. Gnawbone is the current residence of the Hunger Duchess, Orsolla Stritt. The Plaguejoy Legion protects Gnawbone.

## The Necrophagi
**The Necrophagi**

The necromancers of the Imperium have organized into a society of their own, called the necrophagi. They practice necromancy using the available materials, primarily the bones and bodies of non-humanoid creatures. Some work on small useful undead servants (skeletons and zombies), while others work on powerful war machines. They are the technologists of the Imperium, and are respected for that reason. Their mark is a triple skull.

## Vandekhul
**Vandekhul**

Vandekhul is well staffed with slaves and servants because it is the “summer palace” of the emperor, used when he wants to escape the crush of the White City. Set on the shores of the Sulfur Sea, it is a popular locale for darakhul nobles, who outdo each other building elaborate palaces and boathouses along the shore while slaves dig and die in the sulfur mines a few miles inland. Duke Morreto Lichmark, the emperor’s current favorite, rules the city. The 750-member Harvester Legion protects Vandekhul.
