# Dweomerkeeper (PrC)
## Overview
Dweomerkeepers are the shepherds of arcana—priests whose faith grants them an intuitive grasp of the very fabric of magic. Skilled practitioners of both arcane and divine magic, they seek to explore magical theory and create new spells and magic items. As the devoted agents of the deities of magic, dweomerkeepers defend against those who seek to warp, twist, or hoard spells, magic items, and arcane lore.

Most dweomerkeepers are cleric/wizards or cleric/sorcerers, although other class combinations—particularly those that include specialist wizard, bard, and ranger—are not unknown.

Dweomerkeepers can be found throughout the land. Some dwell in lonely, isolated towers and are wholly consumed with their magical studies. Others live in huge cities where all manner of magic can be brought together and shared (willingly or not).

**Adaptation:** Because the dweomerkeeper prestige class intentionally blurs the border between divine and arcane magic, making it specific to clerics of a deity of magic (such as Boccob or Wee Jas) is a good idea. It’s also easy to tie the dweomerkeeper to a specific group of organization—especially one that includes the first spellcasters to figure out how to convert their arcane spells to divine ones (or vice versa). Such an organization might be quite secretive, and its members should be loath to tell others how they managed to manipulate the very fabric of magic.

**Hit Die:** d6.

To qualify to become a dweomerkeeper, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

**CLASS SKILLS**

A dweomerkeeper’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (any) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

**Skill Points at Each Level:** 2 + Int modifier.

**CLASS FEATURES**

All the following are features of the dweomerkeeper prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Dweomerkeepers gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** When a new level of dweomerkeeper is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). The level of dweomerkeeper is added to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then spells per day, spells known, and caster level are determined accordingly. 

If the character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a dweomerkeeper, the player must decide to which class to add each level of dweomerkeeper for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

**Mantle of Spells**: At 1st level, a dweomerkeeper creates a personal mantle of arcane and/or divine spells. She chooses one arcane or divine spell that she can cast, and thereafter she can convert prepared spells of that spell’s type (arcane or divine) into the chosen spell, so long as the level of the spell to be converted is equal to or greater than that of the chosen spell. This ability functions just like a good cleric’s ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into *cure* spells. At every odd-numbered dweomerkeeper level after 1st, the character chooses another spell to add to her mantle.

**Arcane Sight (Su):** Upon attaining 2nd level, a dweomerkeeper can use *arcane sight* at will. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, except that its duration is concentration.

**Supernatural Spell (Su):** At 4th level, the dweomerkeeper is so attuned to the fabric of magic that she can manifest spell effects with almost no effort whatsoever. Once per day as a standard action, she can use any one spell with a casting time of up to 1 standard action as a supernatural ability. The spell chosen must be one that is currently available to the dweomerkeeper (that is, one that she has prepared or that she knows and has a spell slot of the appropriate level available to cast), but she can decide at the moment of casting to use this ability. The spell functions as it normally would and is expended normally, but the dweomerkeeper does not require any components, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and ignores the target’s spell resistance, just as if she were using a supernatural ability instead of a spell. At every even-numbered level after the 4th, the dweomerkeeper gains one additional use of this ability per day.

**Cloak of Mysteries (Su)**: At 10th level, a dweomerkeeper is wrapped in a mantle of ever-flowing magic, and all metamagic feats that she currently knows or learns in the future become easier to use. The spell level increase for applying a metamagic feat to any spell drops by 1 (minimum +1 level, or +0 level if the feat already has a +0 level adjustment). For example, a quickened *fireball* uses a 6th-level slot (+3 levels) instead of the usual 7th-level slot (+4 levels), but a silent *fireball* still uses a 4th-level slot (+1 level). A spell affected by the Heighten Spell feat is unaffected by this ability.

**Gherda Burgstrom:** Female human cleric 4/wizard 4/dweomerkeeper 4; CR 12; Medium humanoid; HD 4d8+4 plus 4d4+4 plus 4d6+4; hp 54; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 17, touch 13, flat-footed 15; Base Atk +7; Grp +7; Atk +7 melee (1d6, quarterstaff) or +10 ranged (1d8/19–20, masterwork light crossbow); Full Atk +7/+2 melee (1d6, quarterstaff) or +10 ranged (1d8/19–20, masterwork light crossbow); SA turn undead 4/day; SQ arcane sight, mantle of spells (*magic missile, see invisibility*), supernatural spell; AL N; SV Fort +7, Ref +5, Will +14; Str 10, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 19, Wis 14, Cha 12.

*Skills and Feats:* Concentration +9, Diplomacy +7, Heal +8, Knowledge (arcana) +14, Knowledge (religion) +10, Listen +6, Profession (scribe) +9, Search +6, Sense Motive +6, Spellcraft +15, Spot +6; Craft Wondrous Item, Dodge, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Scribe Scroll, Silent Spell, Spell Penetration.

**Arcane Sight (Su):** Gherda can use *arcane sight* at will. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, except that its duration is concentration.

**Mantle of Spells:** Gherda can convert any prepared 1st-level or higher arcane spell into *magic missile,* and any prepared 2nd-level or higher arcane spell into *see invisibility.* This ability functions just like a good cleric’s ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into *cure* spells.

**Supernatural Spell (Su):** Once per day as a standard action, Gherda can use any one spell with a casting time of up to 1 standard action as a supernatural ability. The spell chosen must be one that is currently available to her (that is, one that she has prepared), but she can decide at the moment of casting to use this ability. The spell functions as it normally would and is expended normally, but Gherda does not require any components, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and ignores the target’s spell resistance, just as if she were using a supernatural ability instead of a spell.
