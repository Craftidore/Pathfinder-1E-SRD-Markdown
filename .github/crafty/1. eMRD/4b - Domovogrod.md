# 4b - Domovogrod
## Overview
**Domovogrod**

Domovogrod is a bright star in the North, a realm that holds strong against the giants and trolls of the Northlands, and trades with Vidim, the Khazzaki, and with occasional visitors from far Sikkim and the East. It was founded almost by accident by a child of Veles (whom the humans call Ouroboros), a silver dragon who fled the Southern mountains when Mharot convinced others to found an empire.

A few dragons of the South still remember Sivinvoya Vellaraya (Sivin Vellarash in the Southern tongue), a proud silver dragon who sought peace with humans. He took his hoard to the North and settled near a World Tree, in a hidden cavern. He encouraged the healing arts and proper farming of sheep and goats, to supplement the reindeer and mountain goats. Now his descendants rule Domovogrod with a touch of draconic blood.

The land of Domovogrod nestles against the Riphean Mountains, and its heavily wooded taiga is filled with low valleys and plains covered with small rivers and lakes. Its people are farmers in summer, and in winter they are hunters and trappers of fine pelts including arctic hare, ermine, reindeer, and even wolves. The people include the small “winter folk” or halflings, who first brought snow cats (hunting cats similar to small tigers) to the region. Some say the halflings were the region’s first people; others claim they are more recent arrivals. The halflings care mostly about their old gods of forest and mountain.

Domovogrod’s humans and halflings are few in number, but they are tough and devoted to their homes.

## The Prince, Princess, and Duke
**The Prince, Princess, and Duke**

Prince Araka Vellaraya is a man of middle years, who rules in the name of his “grandfather,” the Duke who sleeps in his mountain caverns. Araka’s sister, the Snow Princess Caisa, is much beloved by the people for her role in their religious life, and for her efforts to heal injured animals and help pilgrims find the path to the World Tree. She and her brother both take an active role in the yearly struggle to keep giants out of Domovogrod’s territory.

The Drakon Guards are the heart of Domovogrod’s small army, a company of 20 hand-picked rangers loyal to the crown. They serve as the nobles and officers when an army must be raised against centaurs or giants.

## Vellarsheim and Other Cities
**Vellarsheim and Other Cities**

Vellarsheim is a town of a few thousand people on rich river land below the mountains, prime ground to raise herds of sheep, goats, and reindeer. The prince and princess have a castle here, an onion-domed tower mortared with enchantments and painted red and blue every third year. Below it stands the Summer Hall and the stables, and rooms for servants and a few nobles. It is a modest place by southern standards, though the interior glitters with silver coin mosaics, colorful frescos, and warming tapestries.

**Olersheim:** A center of the fur trade and winter quarters for reindeer herds, Olersheim is hilly enough to provide good defense against nomads, elves, and centaurs from the plains.

**Urdengard:** On the shores of the beautiful Sophiros Lake, Urdengard has excellent fishing, small stocks of caviar-bearing sturgeon, and wooden walls reinforced with ice spikes and thin-ice moats created by Princess Caisa each year.

## The Winter Folk

The halflings of Domovogrod are quiet, hardworking, and retiring. They claim they arrived from Sephaya after the elves released them from service, and they have made a good home for themselves. They blend into the taiga and the valleys and fight off wolves and giants with little more than slings and clever ambushes. The winter folk follow the Old Faiths in various forms, from the elven Freyr and Freyja to the more human Yarila and Porevit, and sometimes the Goat of the Woods or the Green Man or Baldur. Their devotion as clerics, shamans, and druids is strong. Their houses are made of sod or carved out beneath a favored hill.

## The World Tree
**The World Tree**

Vasillisa Vänskä the All Mother (N female human witch 15) looks after the great World Tree of Domovogrod, an enormous mountain ash growing in a sheltered valley. Its branches reach into the Shadow Realm and the Elflands, and many pilgrims can attest that sleeping beneath the boughs provides visions. A well at its roots has healing properties, and the valley of the World Tree is a site of frequent pilgrimages in summer. Several awakened mountain ashes and treants guard the valley of the World Tree. A red hag also haunts the area, bringing darker visions and kidnapping some pilgrims every year.

## Adventures in Domovogrod
**Adventures in Domovogrod**

- Ogres, ettins, and trolls have come down from Jotunheim and the mountains. Are they scouts for an invasion, or hungry savages stealing whatever they can?
- A shadow fey has come to find the World Tree of Domovogrod and drink from its waters. All pilgrims are welcome, but surely this is some plot against the Tree, or some attempt to strengthen the powers of shadow.
- The Master of Demon Mountain has turned his wandering eye on the Snow Princess at the same time as the tsar of Vidim is considering a match. The rival suitors seek the PCs’ help to win the Snow Princess’ heart with exotic gifts—or wish to humiliate their rival.
- The stars in the heavens sometimes give birth to a new one of their number, and the druids of Domovogrod know when this happens. The PCs are invited to witness the birth of a new star—and to defend it from giants who seek to feast on its bones during the week when the star grows from an infant to an adult.

## St. Vadim
**St. Vadim**

Saint Vadim is the Rothenian patron saint of perseverance, redemption, and deliverance. He strengthens his followers against adversity and gives both hope and aid to the oppressed. He intercedes when all hope is lost. Once imprisoned in the Eleven Hells, he suffered many trials and painful revelations before finally emerging victorious. For this and his devotion to his god Volund he ascended and is venerated by many on the plains. His symbols are a circle and a broken shackle, and he has a single major church in Vidim, the Beacon of Hope basilica, and smaller shrines in Domovogrod and elsewhere. The dark gods are especially fond of tormenting his followers, since they are strong and resilient and don’t break easily.
