# Azalaine, the Blade Triumphant
## Overview
**Azalaine, the Blade Triumphant**

Azalaine is a perfectly balanced [[Sword, Dueling|dueling sword]] made of glistening, laminated [[Mithral|mithral]] with a razor-edge. Its grip is tightly wrapped with an exceptionally rough, dark black leather.

*Nonlegacy Game Statistics:* +1 laminated razor-edge [[Mithral|mithral]] [[Sword, Dueling|dueling sword]]; Cost 3,120 gp; Dmg (S) 1d6+2, Dmg (M) 1d8+2; Crit 18-20/x3; Rg -; Weight 2 lbs.; Type S/P

Unlike most bladed weapons, Azalaine was constructed with a small depression on each side of its blade for weapon augments.

*Omen:* Each time Azalaine is drawn, a ripple in space itself seems to occur around its wielder for a split second. This momentary trick of perception causes all within 60 ft of the wielder who witness it to take a -1 penalty on initiative as they pause in surprise.

**History**

Azalaine was forged over two thousand years ago by a legendary smith who was inspired to create it for a forgotten goddess of swordplay (Azalaine) for her mortal lover. She wished to bestow him with a special favor that would enhance his own skills while protecting him from harm. To this end, Azalaine offers diverse enhancements but at a cost.

**Legacy Rituals**

Three rituals are required to unlock all the abilities of Azalaine.

*Red, Red Wine:* Azalaine was a most jealous mistress and the blade which bears her name is no less so. You must give up all beverages save water permanently. You may not use potions and if you try, they have no effect upon you. Cost: 1,500 gp. *Feat Granted:* Least Legacy (Azalaine). This ritual must be completed by 5th level and involves the character drinking no potions or beverages (other than water) for 30 days.

*Alone Again Naturally:* You may never again receive the special attentions of the opposite sex. Even something so slight as a chaste kiss accepted freely will earn Azalaine's ire. The [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat is barred to you. Cost: 13,000 gp. *Feat Granted:* Lesser Legacy (Azalaine). The character may form no attachments (romantic or otherwise); this ritual must be completed by 10th level.

*The Sound of Music:* Music in any form sounds like so much noise to you. Bardic performances provide you with no benefit. Cost: 39,000 gp. *Feat Granted:* Greater Legacy (Azalaine). This ritual must be completed by 15th level and involves the wielder refusing any bardic performances and never sitting willingly through any musical performances.

**Wielder Requirements**

Azalaine is best suited to a martial character though anyone capable of proficiently wielding a dueling blade by 5th level who possesses the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat will find Azalaine suitable.

**Legacy Weapon Abilities**

All of the following are legacy abilities of Azalaine.

*Duelist's Grace (Su):* At 6th level, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. This bonus rises to +4 at 10th level, +6th at 14th level, and +8th at 18th level.

*Lethal is the Lady (Ex):* At 9th level, your critical multiplier increases by 1. This increase rises to +2 at 11th and to +3 at 15th level.

*Parry (Ex):* Once per round when you would normally be hit by an attack (melee or ranged), you may make an attack roll against an AC equal to the opponent's attack roll to deflect the attack with your weapon. You must be aware of the attack and not [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. Doing this does not count as an action and may be done when it is not your turn. At 13th level, you may do this twice per round, and finally, 4 times at 17th.
