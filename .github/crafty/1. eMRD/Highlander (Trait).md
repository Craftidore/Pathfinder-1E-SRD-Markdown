# Highlander (Trait)
## Overview
**Highlander (Hills or Mountain):** You were born and raised in rugged badlands or hills, and you've become something of an expert at evading the predators, monsters, and worse that haunt the highlands. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks, and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] is always a class skill for you. This trait bonus increases to +2 in hilly or rocky areas.
