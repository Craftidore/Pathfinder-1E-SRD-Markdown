# Scryer School
## Overview
**Scryer School**

**Associated School**: Divination.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the divinerâ€™s fortune power of the divination school.

**Send Senses (Sp)**: As a standard action, you place a scrying sensor at a point within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/wizard level) that you can see and have line of effect to. You can see or hear (not both) through this sensor for number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). The sensor otherwise functions as a *clairaudience/clairovoyance* spell with a caster level equal to your wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
