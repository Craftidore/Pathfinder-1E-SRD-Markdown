# Diabolist (PrC)
## Overview
The diabolist is one who has thrown in her lot with the

forces of hell. Unlike the disciples of Asmodeus or other

archdevils, the diabolist is not a servant of a specific powerful

fiend, but instead is usually a mortal being who has seen

the dark path as a means to gaining great power. She does

not serve devils—she wants to be one.

Diabolists are usually wizards, but sorcerers, clerics, and

sometimes bards seek such devilry. Diabolists usually

develop a particular hatred for paladins and bland contempt

for nonspellcasters.

Diabolists are often loners, but they occasionally work in

sinister cabals. They usually seek political power as well as

magical power. Diabolists often use their dire power to

intimidate and destroy their enemies. Because of their diabolism

power, they are particularly skilled at dealing with

good foes, and they focus their power on good-aligned characters

when possible. It is common for a diabolist to have

devils working with her, but it is just as likely to find her

with legions of undead, well-paid mercenaries, or fanatical

cultists.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a diabolist, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful evil.

Base Save Bonus:Will +5.

Skills: Bluff 3 ranks, Intimidate 3 ranks, Knowledge (the

planes) 8 ranks.

Feats: Evil Brand, Corrupt Spell.

Special:Must be able to cast shriveling.

Special: The character must offer her soul—but not necessarily

her loyalty—to the forces of hell in exchange for

power. When the diabolist dies (permanently), her soul

becomes the possession of a powerful devil. The devil uses

the soul as it sees fit.

CLASS SKILLS

The diabolist’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(the planes) (Int), Scry (Int), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

See Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the diabolist prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Diabolists are proficient

with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a diabolist attains 1st level, and at every

level after that, the character gains new spells per day as if

she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she

belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit

points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so

on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

This essentially means that she adds the new level of diabolist

to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the

character has, then determines spells per day, spells known,

and caster level accordingly. For example, if Lady Mandrake,

a 9th-level sorcerer, gains a level in diabolist, she gains new

spells as if she had risen to 10th level in sorcerer, but uses the

other diabolist aspects of level progression such as base

attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level of sorcerer,

making her a 10th-level sorcerer/1st-level diabolist,

she gains spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a sorcerer.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

she became a diabolist, she must decide to which class she

adds the level of diabolist.

Diabolism (Ex): A diabolist can choose to grant one of

her spells greater magical power once per day plus one

additional time for every three class levels. Any spell the

diabolist casts that affects a target or area (one that does not

include herself ) gains the evil descriptor and deals +1d6 points of unholy damage to any good character affected by

the spell. For example, a fireball cast by a 6th-level

wizard/1st-level diabolist deals 7d6 points of fire damage

and 1d6 points of unholy damage. A hold person spell cast

by the same diabolist holds a humanoid target motionless

and deals 1d6 points of unholy damage if the target is good.

At 5th level, the unholy damage increases to +2d6 points.

At 10th level, the unholy damage increases to +3d6 points.

Imp Familiar (Ex): A 2nd-level diabolist gains an imp as a

familiar, whether she wants it or not. If the diabolist already

has a familiar, the imp devours it and takes its place. The imp

is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the diabolist

as the wizard’s level (see the Familiars section in Chapter

3 of the Player’s Handbook for familiar abilities).

Vile Diabolism (Ex): An 8th-level diabolist

can use her diabolism power to deal

half the normal amount of extra unholy

damage as vile damage (see Chapter 2 for an

explanation of vile damage). For example, a

fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard/8th-level

diabolist deals 10d6 points of fire damage

and 2d6 points of unholy damage. If the diabolist

then rolls a 7 for the 2d6 points of unholy

damage, she can (if she chooses) convert the

unholy damage into 3 points of vile damage

instead.
