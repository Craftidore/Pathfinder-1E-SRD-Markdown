# Fiendish Creature (Template)
## Overview
Creatures with the fiendish template live in the Lower Planes, such as the Abyss and Hell, but can be summoned using spells such as *summon monster* and *[[Planar Ally (Spell)|planar ally]]*. A fiendish creature’s CR increases by +1 only if the base creature has 5 or more HD. A fiendish creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the same.

**Challenge Rating:** +0 or +1.

**Rebuild Rules**: **Senses** gains darkvision 60 ft.; **Defensive Abilities** gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; **SR** gains SR equal to new CR +5; **Special Attacks** smite good 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against good foes; smite persists until target is dead or the fiendish creature rests).

**Celestial Creature Defenses**


| **Hit Dice** | **Resist Cold** <br>**and Fire** | **DR** |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | 5 | — |
| 5–10 | 10 | 5/good |
| 11+ | 15 | 10/good |
