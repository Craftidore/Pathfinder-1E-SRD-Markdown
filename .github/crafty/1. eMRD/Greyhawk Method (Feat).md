# Greyhawk Method (Feat)
## Overview
You studied magic at Greyhawk's School of Wizardry, the preeminent institution of arcane study in the entire [[Flanaess]].

**Prerequisite:** Ability to prepare and cast arcane spells.

**Region:** Greyhawk.

**Benefit:** You gain four new spells of your choice to add to your spellbook each time you gain a level in a class that allows you to prepare and cast arcane  spells (such as wizard). These spells represent the results of your research, and must be of spell levels you can cast. If you have chosen to specialize in a school of magic, two of the four free spells must be from your specialty school. Add the following to the list of feats you may select as a bonus wizard feat: [[Combat Casting (Feat)|Combat Casting]], [[Greater Spell Focus (Feat)|Greater Spell Focus]], [[Greater Spell Penetration (Feat)|Greater Spell Penetration]], [[Magical Aptitude (Feat)|Magical Aptitude]], [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]], [[Spell Penetration (Feat)|Spell Penetration]].

**Normal:** If you are a wizard, you normally gain 2 new spells to add to your spellbook each time you gain a level in the wizard class.

**Special:** This feat does not stack with the [[Collegiate Wizard (Feat)|Collegiate Wizard]] feat.
