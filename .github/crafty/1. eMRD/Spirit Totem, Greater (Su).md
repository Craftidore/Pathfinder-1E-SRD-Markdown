# Spirit Totem, Greater (Su)
## Overview
*Spirit Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian become dangerous to any enemy adjacent to the barbarian. Living enemies adjacent to the barbarian at the start of her turn take 1d8 points of negative energy damage. In addition, the spirit wisps can now attack foes that are up to 15 feet away from the barbarian and the slam attack deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage. A barbarian must have the [[Spirit Totem (Su)|spirit totem]] rage power and be at least 10th level to select this rage power.
