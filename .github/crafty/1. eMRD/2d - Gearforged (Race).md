# 2d - Gearforged (Race)
## Overview
**Gearforged**

The gearforged are the children of Rava, the Gear Goddess of Fate and Industry. Her priests were the first to forge bodies of brass and copper with cunningly wrought gears and well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh; a special ritual (see sidebar) is required to transfer a living creature’s soul into the housing that makes it gearforged. Once created, a gearforged can in theory live forever, though in practice most wind down or are destroyed by the ravages of time and the difficulty of surviving as a well-crafted machine.

## Making a Gearforged
**Making a Gearforged**

The most important moment for many gearforged is the moment of their remaking when they leave their flesh body behind and enter their new, clockwork body of brass and steel. One can spend a fortune on these new bodies or simply scrape together something that will work—though only barely—if they are aging or deathly ill. The details don’t matter a great deal, since the iron body can be rebuilt.

Without exception, the gearforged are shaped like humanoids, and the vast majority appears in one of two styles: roughly human-sized, with articulated joints, hands, feet, and magical eyes; or a stouter version made by the dwarves. These dwarflike gearforged are more common in the cantons of the Ironcrags than in the Free City of Zobeck but are accepted as receptacles for dwarf souls. In the South, minotaur gearforged are rare but not entirely unknown. A few gearforged are built in even smaller sizes, intended for kobold souls, but these are subject to frequent failure and even the extinction of the souls they carry.

All gearforged were once other creatures, now inhabiting standardized bodies with cylinders, springs, and articulated joints of varying quality. Each is made of iron, brass, and steel and as distinctive in appearance as other people differ by their hair and eyes. The gearforged are thinking creatures and can serve as city watchmen and soldiers. Gearforged have free will that separates them from other mechanical devices, which are no more than simple servants responsive to orders and capable of little more than a limited amount of memorization.

Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because all gearforged are machines with a soul. Their arms and legs depend on actuators powered by everwound springs. Their minds depend on memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements are all held in a shell of iron, brass, and steel, and the bulk of the things is remarkable. A large and heavily armored gearforged can weigh 400 pounds, since its armor is built in.

## Gearforged Components
**Gearforged Components**

The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts.

**Everwound Springs**

These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged’s limbs and fingers. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb.

**Soul Gems**

The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, and its mind—are retained in one or (for an extra 8,000gp) two soul gems. These are the elements that retain an individual’s spirit or soul, and their destruction means the death of that gearforged.

**Memory Gears**

These are delicate constructions: scroll-like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin-sized holes, and others wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity. The memory of a gearforged for all the days after its creation lives in the memory gears; older gearforged have many such gears, and the material component for the magic to create them requires one new gear/two levels attained or every 10 years of life. Installing one requires one day’s work and 2,000 gp.

Memory gears can be taken from a dead gearforged and read by others. This is a lengthy process and viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is akin to peering into the most private details of a creature’s life.

Installing an existing, used memory gear in a new gearforged requires a new Ritual of Soulforging and at least one week for the recipient to remember and understand the results. The process is dangerous, requiring a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half level of dead gearforged + Cha modifier of dead gearforged) to succeed.

## Gearforged Characters
**Gearforged Characters**

All gearforged have the following racial traits.

**Medium:** As Medium creatures, gearforged have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Gearforged base land speed is 30 feet.

Clockwork Construct Traits: As constructs, gearforged possess no Constitution scores and are immune to disease, poison, magical sleep effects, enchantment effects, paralysis, and effects that require a Fortitude save (unless those effects can also affect objects). They cannot become fatigued or exhausted.

Gearforged do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. As living creatures, though, they do not have any other immunities common to constructs.

Gearforged cannot heal damage on their own. Cure spells, wands, and potions heal gearforged for the minimum amount per charge or dose, and the psionic repair damage power works normally. The mending spell heals a gearforged for 1 point of damage, while the make whole spell heals 2d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +10).

Rather than sleep, gearforged must rewind their springs, repair gears, and oil and clean their parts each day for a 4-hour period to ensure normal functioning. They are fully aware during this period, but any interruption in their routine during these 4 hours requires them to start again from the beginning. Gearforged can function a number of days equal to their character level without performing this maintenance, but each day without such a repair period applies a cumulative –2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If a gearforged neglects his repair period a number of days equal to his character level, he becomes immobile and helpless until repaired by someone else. One 4-hour repair period eliminates all accumulated penalties.

Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (clockwork) and Intimidate checks. Gearforged intimately understand how their own race works and can apply that knowledge elsewhere, while most living creatures find gearforged a little unsettling.

**Automatic Language:** Trade Tongue. Bonus Languages: Draconic and Dwarven.

**Favored Class:** Fighter.

## Ritual of Soulforging
**Ritual of Soulforging**

**School:** Necromancy; Effective Level 5th

**Skill Check:** Craft (clockwork) DC 20, 4 successes; Knowledge (arcana) DC 20, 2 successes (Priests of Rava may substitute Knowledge (religion)

**Components:** M, S, SC, V

**Material Components**—a complete mechanical body of actuators, springs, gears, and engraved gemstones (minimum cost 10,000 gp)

**Secondary Casters**—up to four additional casters are optional; each who makes a successful Knowledge (arcana) or Craft (clockwork) check (DC 20) adds +1 to the primary caster’s check

**Casting Time:** 60 min

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One humanoid creature

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving:** Throw Will negates Spell

**Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 29

You and the subject chant and act in unison to trigger the soul’s migration into the waiting deathless, tireless body of iron and brass. If the incantation succeeds, the subject’s old body dies and the new clockwork body is animated with life. The subject is effectively reincarnated as a gearforged PC and continues adventuring in that form.

**Backlash:** Ghost or wraith. The unbound spirit attacks the primary caster three times as a ghost. A cleric turning the unbound soul can prevent the attacks during the soul transfer process. Failure: After the first failed check, the subject’s soul is removed from his or her body but not yet constrained in the new one. The soul attacks you as a wraith. If a second skill check fails, the incantation fails completely: you and any other casters suffer 3d8 damage (Fort DC 15 + your Int modifier) and the subject dies. If the save is successful, the subject is either imprisoned in a gem (as per magic jar, if a 500 gp or better gem was prepared in advance) or released to the world as a ghost or wraith.
