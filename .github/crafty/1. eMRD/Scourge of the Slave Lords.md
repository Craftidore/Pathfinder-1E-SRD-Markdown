# Scourge of the Slave Lords
## Overview
***Scourge of the Slave Lords*** (A1-4) is an adventure module for the *Dungeons & Dragons* fantasy roleplaying game, published by TSR, Inc. in 1986. The module features the [Slave Lords](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slave_Lords) of the [Pomarj](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Pomarj) as its chief antagonists. It combines the contents of four earlier modules, all set in the [World of Greyhawk](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/World_of_Greyhawk) campaign setting and intended for use with *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* first edition rules:

A1 - ***Slave Pits of the Undercity*** (1980)

A2 - ***Secret of the Slavers Stockade*** (1981)

A3 - ***Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords*** (1981)

A4 - ***In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords*** (1981)

The A series of modules was created for tournament use at Gen Con XIII in 1980 and published for play by mid-level characters. The A1-4 compilation (or "supermodule") was slightly revised for play by higher level characters in order for it to be used as a follow-on in an overall campaign beginning with module T1-4 *[The Temple of Elemental Evil](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil)*. The overall campaign could then be continued into the GDQ1-7 supermodule *[Queen of the Spiders](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Queen_of_the_Spiders)*.

In 2000, Wizards of the Coast released *[Slavers](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slavers)*, a sequel adventure for second edition AD&D rules. The sequel is also set in *Greyhawk* and takes place ten years after the conclusion of the events in A1-4.

*Scourge of the Slave Lords* was ranked the 20th greatest *Dungeons & Dragons* adventure of all time by *[Dungeon](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Dungeon)* magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the *Dungeons & Dragons* game.

## Framing sequence
## **Framing sequence**
The component modules of *Scourge of the Slave Lords* are linked together by a framing sequence not present in the original modules, involving a [Wild Coast](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Wild_Coast) noble known as [Dame Gold](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dame_Gold&action=edit&redlink=1). This sequence also provides a link between *The Temple of Elemental Evil* and this adventure.

In the original modules, the characters are agents recruited to overthrow the Slave Lords by a coalition of lords along the coast of the Sea of Gearnat ("from [Onnwal](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Onnwal) to the [Wild Coast](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Wild_Coast)"). This premise was discarded for the supermodule.

## **Component modules**

### A1 - Slave Pits of the Undercity
### **A1 - Slave Pits of the Undercity**
*Slave Pits of the Undercity* is the first adventure in the "A" series of modules, and bears the code "A1". It was published by TSR in 1980 and written by David Cook. The cover artwork by Jeff Dee, features a drawing of two [aspis](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Aspis)fighting a party of adventurers (including a bearded female dwarf) by Jeff Dee. The interior art was done by Dee, David S. LaForce, Jim Roslof, and Bill Willingham.

As the first module in the series, *Slave Pits of the Undercity* was the first TSR publication to introduce fans of the *Greyhawk* setting to the [Slave Lords](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slave_Lords) and their operations in the central and southwestern [Flanaess](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Flanaess).

**Synopsis**

The events of the adventure are set in 580 [CY](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Common_Year), following four years of raids by slavers on the costal population along the [Sea of Gearnat](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sea_of_Gearnat&action=edit&redlink=1) from [Onnwal](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Onnwal) to the [Wild Coast](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Wild_Coast). Local lords, finally tired of the situation, hire a band of adventurers to attack the slavers in their home. The adventure begins at a ruined temple in the [Pomarj](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Pomarj) city of [Highport](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Highport&action=edit&redlink=1) that serves as headquarters to the ruthless slavers. The module takes the group through the temple and into the sewers below where terrible insect creatures make their lair along with the slave lords.

Eventually the group reaches the prisoners and their captors and finds a map showing the route of the caravans. Following this map leads the group to the second module, *A2 - Secret of the Slavers Stockade*.

**Notable characters**

- [Pieta](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pieta&action=edit&redlink=1), a human cleric of [Gruumsh](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Gruumsh). *([A1](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/A1).10; [A1-4](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/A1-4).35-36; [Slavers](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slavers).2)*

### A2 - Secret of the Slavers Stockade
### **A2 - Secret of the Slavers Stockade**
*Secrets of the Slavers Stockade* is the second adventure in the "A" series of modules, and bears the code "A2". It was published by TSR in 1981 and written by [Harold Johnson](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Harold_Johnson) and [Tom Moldvay](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tom_Moldvay&action=edit&redlink=1). The cover artwork by Jim Roslof features a drawing two [hobgoblins](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Hobgoblin), one of which is a sergeant with a [boggle](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Boggle&action=edit&redlink=1) on a leash, and a party of adventurers. The interior art was done by Roslof, Dee, Willingham, and Erol Otus.

**Synopsis**

The previous adventure (A1) ends with the capture of a map to a fortress citadel used by the slavers. The A2 module gives the Dungeon Master the option to run an overland adventure of 110 miles (177 kilometers) through the [Drachensgrab Hills](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Drachensgrab_Hills) to reach the fort shown on the map, or simply start the adventure with the party overlooking fort itself. The object of the module is to enter the fort through stealthy means and slowly eliminate the slavers before a general alarm can be raised.

Eventually the group of adventurers makes their way through the fort, avoiding hobgoblin patrols, and reaches a dungeon area. After exploring the dungeons, the players eventually learn that this fort is not the headquarters of the Slave Lords. In fact, the real stronghold of the Slave Lords is located somewhere in the Drachensgrab Hills. This revelation leads the adventurers to the third installment in the series.

### A3 - Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords
### **A3 - Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords**
*Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords* is the third adventure in the "A" series of modules, and bears the code "A3". It was published by TSR in 1981 and written by [Alan Hammack](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alan_Hammack&action=edit&redlink=1). The cover artwork by Bill Willingham features a drawing of five of the "The Nine" Slave Lords. These five are [Nerelas](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Nerelas&action=edit&redlink=1) the assassin, [Ajakstu](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Ajakstu&action=edit&redlink=1) the magic-user, [Feetla](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Feetla&action=edit&redlink=1) the master buccaneer, [Mordrammo](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mordrammo&action=edit&redlink=1) the priest, and [Brother Milerjoi](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Brother_Milerjoi&action=edit&redlink=1) the monk. The interior art was done by Dee, LaForce, Otus, Roslof, and Willingham.

**Synopsis**

The first part of the module is relatively short and meant to finish quickly, within 3 hours, in tournament mode. It is a trap filled, monster heavy section used to lure the group into a secret tunnel leading to the hidden city of [Suderham](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Suderham&action=edit&redlink=1).

In the second part of the adventure, the group enters the city of Suderham. This new setting offers the players an opportunity to test their role-playing skills rather than primarily focusing on combat or stealth.

The module provides a number of non-player characters in the city with whom the players can interact and exchange information. To complete the module, the group must find one of several secret entrances to the catacombs beneath the city where the final part of the adventure plays out.

The third section of the adventure also moves at a rapid pace in tournament mode and each room encountered on this level is filled with dangerous creatures. In the final room of this section, the players are captured as a set-up for *In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords*. If this section is played outside of a tournament, however, it is possible for the players to defeat the slavers and exit the area victorious.

*
**Aftermath**

According to *In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords*, Brother Milerjoi dies either in the events of A3 or the events of A4, depending on how the DM chooses to end A3. Eanwulf and Nerelas may similarly die; A4 does not list them among the six Slave Lords who "survived the earthquake and resulting chaos," while A-4 makes their deaths more ambiguous by adding "apparently" before "survived." By 591 CY, Stalman Klim has reformed the Slave Lords and sits at its head, while Davis serves the organization commanding a fleet of raiding vessels out of the [Port of Elredd](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Port_of_Elredd&action=edit&redlink=1). Ajakstu later appears c. [594 CY](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=594_CY&action=edit&redlink=1), working with [drow](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Drow) refugees of [House Eilservs](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=House_Eilservs&action=edit&redlink=1) in the [Underdark](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Underdark) beneath [Sterich](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Sterich)(*[DNG](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/DNG)*#119.43-44).

### A4 - In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords
### **A4 - In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords**
***In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords*** is the fourth and final adventure in the "A" series of modules, and bears the code "A4". It was published by TSR in 1981 and written by [Lawrence Schick](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Lawrence_Schick). The cover artwork by Erol Otus features a drawing of a group of [myconids](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Myconid&action=edit&redlink=1) (fungus men) fighting a party of adventurers. The interior art was done Otus, Roslof, Willingham, Steve Sullivan, [David C. Sutherland III](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/David_C._Sutherland_III), and Jean Wells.

**Synopsis**

The A3 module finishes with the players as captives of the Slave Lords, and they begin module A4 in the same condition. Through a series of incidents they quickly find themselves free but completely bereft of equipment and spells.

The final scenario plays out as a massive earthquake threatens to bring down the tunnels around the group and they must exit the caverns within four hours or perish in the ensuing collapse. The labyrinth is a difficult test for characters without equipment and spells and challenges the players' wits and role-playing ability rather than focusing on traditional combat.

Once the players emerge from the caverns they face a final test in escaping the island itself. This can be accomplished by attacking the surviving Slave Lords, escaping via a different boat, or possibly by swimming.

**Notable characters**

- [Brother Kerin](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Brother_Kerin&action=edit&redlink=1), a human monk of the Scarlet Brotherhood, Milerjoi's assistant and replacement in the Slave Lords' Inner Circle.
- [Edralve](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Edralve), an exiled drow priestess of [Lolth](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Lolth) from [Erelhei-Cinlu](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Erelhei-Cinlu) and member of the Slave Lords' Inner Circle.
- [Lamonsten](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lamonsten&action=edit&redlink=1) the Lazy, an illusionist from [Dyvers](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Dyvers) and member of the Slave Lords' Inner Circle.
- [Selzen Murtano](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Selzen_Murtano&action=edit&redlink=1), a human thief and agent of the Lords of Gearnat. *(A3.19-20)*
- [Slippery Ketta](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Slippery_Ketta&action=edit&redlink=1), a human rogue and member of the Slave Lords' Inner Circle.
- [Stalman Klim](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stalman_Klim&action=edit&redlink=1).
- [Theg Narlot](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Theg_Narlot), a half-orc assassin and member of the Slave Lords' Inner Circle.

**Aftermath**

According to *Slavers*, after the destruction of Suderham and fall of the Slave Lords, Edralve returned to her drow brethren, Lamonsten retired, and Slippery Ketta "disappeared into the Wild Coast" (p. 122). By 591 CY, Klim has reformed the Slave Lords, with Brother Kerin and Theg Narlot as members of its Inner Circle.

## Pre-generated characters
## **Pre-generated characters**
Because the original modules were run as a tournament event, the compilation includes nine pre-generated characters for use in tournament mode. They are [Elwita](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Elwita) (dwarf fighter), ["Ogre"](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/%22Ogre%22) (human fighter), [Freda](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Freda&action=edit&redlink=1) (human ranger), [Karraway](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Karraway&action=edit&redlink=1) (human cleric), [Blodgett](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Blodgett&action=edit&redlink=1) (halfling thief), [Dread Delgath](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dread_Delgath&action=edit&redlink=1) (human magic-user), [Phanstern](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Phanstern&action=edit&redlink=1) (human illusionist), [Eljayess](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Eljayess&action=edit&redlink=1) (half-elf cleric/fighter), and [Kayan Telva](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Kayan_Telva&action=edit&redlink=1) (elf fighter/magic-user). Each of these characters has a standard list of equipment and prepared spells so that tournament players can begin the game with very little preparation.

## Unnamed
## **Scoring**
Due to their design for use at Gen Con XIII, each *A* series module includes a scoring scheme. This scheme essentially takes the number of surviving characters and gives them points for visiting the largest number of areas described in the adventure. Each area contains additional points available for gain or loss based on specific actions by the players.

## Unnamed
## **Reception**
- *Scourge of the Slave Lords* was ranked the 20th greatest *Dungeons & Dragons* adventure of all time by *[Dungeon](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Dungeon)* magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the *Dungeons & Dragons* game.
- According to Lev Lafayette of RPGNet, *Slave Pits of the Undercity* is a fairly good dungeon crawl. It had problems, such as a too small font, and an underdeveloped storyline. On the other hand, Lafayette felt that its difficulty was appropriate for characters level 4-7, and that the tournament scoring system worked well.
- Also according to Lafayette, "*Secret of the Slavers Stockade* is the low point of the four A series modules". Although he liked that it had 40 pages, he also felt the artwork was sparse, and that the module was overly difficult for its intended character levels.

- In 2000, Wizards of the Coast released *[Slavers](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slavers)*, a sequel adventure for second edition AD&D rules. The sequel is also set in *Greyhawk* and takes place ten years after the conclusion of the events in A1-4.
- In 2002, Kenzer and Company published a *HackMaster* module based on *Scourge of the Slavelords*, named *Smackdown the Slavers*.
- All four modules of the A-series were included as part of the *Against the Slave Lords* hardcover collection, released on June 18, 2013. Also included is an all-new fifth adventure -- *A0: Danger at Darkshelf Quarry*, by [Skip Williams](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Skip_Williams). The hardcover includes a foreword written by each of the four surviving designers of the original modules. [David Cook](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/David_Cook) writes: "In the early days of TSR, we were still feeling things out, learning what we could and couldn't do. It was in a previous GEN CON Game Fair that we had heard murmurs that the *AD&D* tournament needed some work. We hadn't realized until then how much the tournament could be, should be, a showcase event. The players who came to Wisconsin deserved a deliberately crafted experience, something that could show TSR and *AD&D* in the best possible way." [Harold Johnson](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Harold_Johnson) writes: "Our goal was to provide a model for a new type of adventure that encouraged DMs to use strategy to challenge the players to think. Up to this point, adventures presented monsters that attacked and fought to the death. We wanted to show that even weak monsters could be dangerous when played intelligently." [Allen Hammack](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Allen_Hammack&action=edit&redlink=1) writes: "Some people have asked about names in the modules. Yes, I have fun with words. Combining Latin and Greek, pulling player and character names from my campaign, and twisting the results so they sounded right when I heard them—all were in the bag of tricks. "Suderham," for example, combined elements that to me meant "south home" (a nod to my Alabama roots), and was also a tip of the hat to my artist friend, the late, great Dave Sutherland. 'Ayares the Cutpurse' reflected my long-standing annoyance with the Internal Revenue Service." [Lawrence Schick](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Lawrence_Schick) writes that he was inspired by an idea from Harold Johnson: "In his campaign one night, Harold had our characters get captured, whereupon he took away all our stuff and threw us in a dungeon. The challenge: escape without relying on all our carefully hoarded adventuring gear. Were our characters people with skills and brains, or were they really just lists of equipment?"
