# Bounty Hunter's Kit (common)
## Overview
This kit provides useful tools for bounty hunters. It includes basic maps showing major landmarks, caltrops, common manacles with an average lock, a net, a sap, and a 10-foot chain. Bounty hunters are notoriously individualistic, so variant kits are common. 

**Price** 105 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.
