# Risen Martyr (PrC)
## Overview
Characters driven by revenge, greed, or other base desires may

return from death as ghosts, revenants, or other undead. By contrast,

a risen martyr is an exalted character who continues in his

earthly existence after his martyrdom, rather than entering the

ranks of the petitioners on the celestial planes, in order to finish

some unfulfilled task. Within a short time of his martyrdom

(usually 1d4+1 days), a risen martyr returns in a spiritual body to

complete the holy task that led to his martyrdom. (See Heroic

Sacrifice in Chapter 2 for more about martyrdom.)

In general, a character who is actively involved in an

adventure that involves an exalted goal, and who is martyred

for the sake of that purpose, has a sufficient holy

purpose to return as a risen martyr. Appropriate holy purposes

for a risen martyr might include aiding in the

downfall of an evil tyrant or villain, locating a relic

or holy artifact in order to stave off a great evil,

or defending a city from a plague of ghosts.

The goal need not be extremely short-term,

and might even be the focus of a whole

campaign. However, a risen martyr’s

time on the Material Plane is limited.

Risen martyrs are very rare, and they

actually appear as player characters more

often than as NPCs, simply because player

characters are generally the ones who

pursue the most important and holy quests

that can lead to a risen martyr’s existence.

Hit Die: d12.

To qualify to become a risen martyr, a

character must fulfill all the following

criteria.

feature of this prestige class, the character rises with the abilities

of a 0-level risen martyr added to the character’s previous abilities.

When the character earns enough experience points to

advance another level, he must become a 1st-level risen martyr.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the risen

martyr prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Risen

martyrs gain no proficiency with any weapon

or armor.

Spiritual Body (Ex): When a martyr rises as

a 0-level risen martyr, he takes on a corporeal

spirit form. His creature type changes to deathless

(see Chapter 8: Monsters), and he gains

the features and traits of the deathless type.

Deathless creatures have no Constitution

score, and the risen martyr rerolls his hit

points using d12s instead of his previous

racial and class-based Hit Dice.

A risen martyr’s spiritual body is formed

of solid, spiritual flesh and is neither

ghostly nor incorporeal. His ability

scores remain unchanged (except for

his Constitution score), and all

his other characteristics

remain the same

except that he is no longer

a living creature.

Charisma Score Increase:

At 1st level, a risen martyr’s Charisma score increases by +2. At 5th level, it

increases by an extra +2.

Deflection Bonus (Su): A 1st-level risen martyr gains a

deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus.

Holy Purpose (Ex): A 1st-level risen martyr receives a +1

sacred bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, and

skill checks that are directly related to the fulfillment of his purpose.

This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and increases by an

extra +1 every 3 levels thereafter.

Bless (Sp): Three times per day, a risen martyr of at least 2nd

level can use bless, as the spell.

Magic Circle Against Evil (Su): At 2nd level, a risen martyr

is continually surrounded by a protective aura that functions as

a magic circle against evil spell.

Daylight (Su): At will as a free action, a 3rd level

risen martyr can use daylight, as the spell.

Acid Immunity (Ex): At 4th level, a

risen martyr gains immunity to acid.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a risen martyr of at

least 4th level can detect evil, as the spell.

Protective Aura (Su): At 5th

level, the risen martyr’s magic circle

against evil is replaced by an effect

that duplicates the protective aura

spell.

Shield Other (Sp): A 6th-level

risen martyr can use shield other, as the

spell, three times per day.

Celestial Brilliance (Sp): A 7th-level

risen martyr can use celestial brilliance,

as the spell, once per

day.

Cold Immunity (Ex): A 7thlevel

risen martyr gains immunity

to cold.

Holy Aura (Su): At 8th level, the risen

martyr’s protective aura is supplemented

by an effect that duplicates the holy aura

spell. The holy aura protects only the

risen martyr, while his protective aura

continues to protect allies within 10

feet as well as himself.

Electricity Immunity

(Ex): At 9th level, a risen

martyr gains immunity to

electricity.

Perfection (Su): A 10thlevel

risen martyr is as close to

celestial perfection as a mortal creature can be.

He is considered a celestial for the purpose of any spell or effect

that has special effects on celestials. If he is lawful, he is also

considered an archon. If he is chaotic, he is also considered an

eladrin. If he is neutral, he is also considered a guardinal. If he is

a spellcaster, he can cast spells that have the Celestial, Archon,

Guardinal, or Eladrin components, as appropriate.

Final Ascension:When a 10th-level risen martyr has earned

enough experience points to gain his next level, his perfected,

spiritual body is taken whole into the upper planes.

A risen martyr cannot advance in any class other than risen

martyr in order to delay his final ascension. Once he rises and

adopts this prestige class, he must continue to gain risen martyr

levels and no levels in any other class.

Code of Conduct: A risen martyr who willfully performs an

evil act is immediately destroyed and goes to face his judgment

on the Upper Planes.
