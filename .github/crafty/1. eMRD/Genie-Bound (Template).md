# Genie-Bound (Template)
## Overview
A genie-bound is a creature who sold himself into the service of a powerful genie in exchange for a granted *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or another service. If the genie fulfills all the victim’s requests, the genie-bound creature must then serve the genie as a slave for a year and a day per desire fulfilled.

Djinn treat their slaves fairly well. Each genie-bound creature is a partner to them, a creature with whom they struck a fair bargain. A djinn usually sends its genie-bound creatures on errands or quests that are simply beneath the djinn’s dignity.

Efreet, on the other hand, treat their genie-bound creatures poorly and often demand that they perform dangerous tasks. An efreeti does what it wills with them for the duration of their bondage.

Jann put their slaves in whatever role is needed for them by the individual janni or for the jann caravan at the time. A jann-bound creature often finds itself in many roles during his servitude: valet, groom, worker, warrior, concubine, and more

How marids treat the genie-bound depends on the individual marid’s mercurial nature. Some treat their slaves with great care, much like pampered pets, while others treat them no better than toys for abuse. Sometimes individual marids take a great liking to their bound servants, even falling in love with them. For these individuals the marid’s attention is both a blessing and curse. If they return the marid’s affection, their servitude is easy; if not, they find a marid’s feelings are not to be trifled with.

Shaitan often use their bound slaves as workers in their mines, or, for the talented individuals, as gem and jewelry crafters. Whatever their role, it is something that directly affects the shaitan’s wealth and status. Shaitans treat their bound charges as well as they perform for the genie. Those who are lazy or fail to meet the shaitan’s expectations find themselves working in the worst part of the mines, or even entombed in the earth for the duration of their servitude.

When the genie-bound creature’s period of service ends, it loses this template and all the changes it imposed. If the genie is killed before the term of servitude expires, the genie-bound creature’s period of servitude is transferred to any genie of the same kind who claims the geniebound within 24 hours. If claimed, the genie-bound’s period of service increases by an additional year and a day. If the genie-bound is not claimed at the end of 24 hours, it is set free and its period of servitude is over. A genie can free its bound servant early if it wishes, but such freedom must be of the genie’s free will and not coerced by most magical or any physical means. The use of any coercion (other than a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*) has the same result as the premature death of the genie.

**Creating a Genie-Bound Creature**

“Genie-Bound” is an acquired template that can be added to any nongenie who has made a bargain with a genie in exchange for one or more *wishes* or other requests (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A genie-bound creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Janni-bound—as base creature +2; all others—as base creature +3.

**Type:** A genie-bound creature gains the native subtype when on the plane of origin of the genie it is bound to.

**Senses:** A genie-bound creature gains darkvision +60 feet. 

**Armor Class:** A genie-bound creature gains an Armor Class bonus depending on the type of genie he is bound to.

- **Djinni:** A djinni-bound creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class.
- **Efreeti:** Same as the base creature.
- **Janni:** Same as the base creature.
- **Marid:** Same as the base creature.
- **Shaitan:** Natural armor class increases by +4 as their skin hardens like stone.

**Defensive Abilities:** The genie-bound creature gains energy resistance depending on the type of genie he is bound to.

- **Djinni:** acid 20.
- **Efreeti:** fire 20.
- **Janni:** fire 5.
- **Marid:** cold 20.
- **Shaitan:** electricity 20.

Additionally a genie-bound creature (except for the janni-bound) gains the following:

*Genie Grace (Su):* A genie-bound creature is immune to the planar effects of the genie’s home plane, but is still susceptible to damage from non-planar sources. For example, an effreeti-bound creature is immune to the damaging effects from the Plane of Fire but still takes damage from fire from other sources, such as *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*.

The genie can revoke this benefit at will.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** A genie-bound creature gains the following.

*Genie Magic (Sp):* A genie can allow its genie-bound creature to use its spell-like abilities, but not spells from classes or magic items, as though it werze a genie of the appropriate kind. The genie-bound creature can use these spells in any manner it chooses. However, as a free action, the genie can revoke or reinstate its ability to cast them, prematurely end their durations, or spoil their effects (by changing the wine created with *create wine* to vinegar, for example). The exact spell-like abilities bestowed depend on the kind of genie with which the genie-bound creature made its bargain. The genie-bound’s caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice. All the save DCs are Charisma-based.

- **Djinni:** At will—*[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* (self only); 1/day—*[[Create Food and Water (Spell)|create food and water]], create wine* (as *[[Create Water (Spell)|create water]]* but wine instead), *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]], [[Major Creation (Spell)|major creation]], [[Persistent Image (Spell)|persistent image]], [[Wind Walk (Spell)|wind walk]]*
- **Efreeti:** Constant—*[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*; At will—*[[Produce Flame (Spell)|produce flame]], [[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]], [[Scorching Ray (Spell)|scorching ray]]* (1 ray only); 3/day—*[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]], [[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]]*; 1/day—*[[Enlarge Person (Spell)|enlarge person]], [[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]], [[Permanent Image (Spell)|permanent image]], [[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]* (self only), *[[Reduce Person (Spell)|reduce person]].*
- **Janni:** 3/day—*[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* (self only), *[[Speak with Animals (Spell)|speak with animals]]*; 1/day—*[[Create Food and Water (Spell)|create food and water]]*
- **Marid:** Constant—*[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]], [[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]], [[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]], [[Water Walk (Spell)|water walk]]*; At will—*[[Create Water (Spell)|create water]], [[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]], [[Purify Food and Drink (Spell)|purify food and drink]] (liquids only), [[Quench (Spell)|quench]]*; 5/day—*[[Control Water (Spell)|control water]], [[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]], [[Obscuring Mist (Spell)|obscuring mist]], [[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]*; 3/day—*[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]*; 1/day—*[[Persistent Image (Spell)|persistent image]]*
- **Shaitan:** At will—*[[Meld Into Stone (Spell)|meld into stone]], [[Soften Earth and Stone (Spell)|soften earth and stone]], [[Stone Shape (Spell)|stone shape]], [[Veil (Spell)|veil]]* (self only); 3/day—*[[Glitterdust (Spell)|glitterdust]], [[Stoneskin (Spell)|stoneskin]], [[Rusting Grasp (Spell)|rusting grasp]], [[Stone Tell (Spell)|stone tell]], [[Wall of Stone (Spell)|wall of stone]]*; 1/day—*[[Transmute Mud to Rock (Spell)|transmute mud to rock]], [[Transmute Rock to Mud (Spell)|transmute rock to mud]]*

**Abilities:** The genie-bound creature gains 6 points to add to its ability scores as it chooses.

**Special Qualities:** A genie-bound creature retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains the following.

*Genie Boon (Su):* A genie-bound creature is bestowed a boon as long as it’s in servitude to its genie master. The genie can remove this boon at will. The exact boon depends on the kind of genie with which the genie-bound creature made its bargain.

- **Djinni:** A creature bound to a djinni gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack, damage, CMB, and CMD rolls.
- **Efreeti:** An efreeti-bound creature gains extra hit points equal to the creature’s Charisma bonus (minimum 0) for each Hit Die the creature possesses.
- **Janni:** A janni-bound creature is immune to the damaging effects of desert environments, including dehydration and heat exposure. Magical effects of this nature still affect the janni-bound creature.
- **Marid:** A marid-bound creature gains *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]* as a supernatural ability and a +4 circumstance bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks.
- **Shaitan:** A shaitan-bound creature gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack, damage, CMB and CMD rolls.

*Genie-Bond (Su):* The genie is in constant telepathic communication with the bound creature, imparting its thoughts and desires regardless of language or distance, even if its servitor is on another plane. The genie is constantly aware of its servant’s actions (but not its thoughts) and its condition (as though via a *status* spell). The servant has no special awareness of the genie but can communicate with it telepathically.

Because of this bond, the genie can use *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* at will to move to any location on the Inner or Astral planes that its servitor occupies. Further, a genie-bound creature can use *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* at will, but only to and from a location specified by its genie master.

A genie that is displeased with its genie-bound creature can use a standard action to deal 1d6 points of damage to it or 1d4 points of damage to any one of its ability scores. The genie can also heal a like amount of damage (regardless of its source or type) at will as a standard action.

While bound, a genie-bound creature does not suffer from normal aging, but still can be affected by aging magic. If released from the genie’s servitude, the base creature starts to age as normal as if no time has passed.

*Genie-Empowered (Su):* Three times per day a geniebound creature can choose to gain a +10 bonus on any one skill check, gain a +5 bonus on a single saving throw it is required to make, or double its speed for a round. The genie-bound creature may choose to gain the bonus on its saving throw even on another creature’s turn.
