# Illiterate (Trait)
## Overview
**Illiterate**

You cannot read, but you have devoted yourself to learning other skills.

**Benefit:** Choose any one skill except Decipher Script or Forgery. You gain a +1 bonus on checks using that skill

**Drawback:** You are illiterate.

**Special:** You can eliminate the negative effect of this trait by spending 2 skill points to become literate. Unlike with the barbarian, you cannot become literate by taking a level in any class other than barbarian.

You can't select this trait if your character is already illiterate because of race, class, or any other reason.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be sensitive about not being able to read, or they might not value "book learnin'."
