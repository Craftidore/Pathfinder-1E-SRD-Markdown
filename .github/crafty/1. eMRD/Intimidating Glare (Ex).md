# Intimidating Glare (Ex)
## Overview
*Intimidating Glare (Ex)*: The barbarian can make an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check against one adjacent foe as a move action. If the barbarian successfully demoralizes her opponent, the foe is [[Shaken|shaken]] for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which the barbarianâ€™s check exceeds the DC.
