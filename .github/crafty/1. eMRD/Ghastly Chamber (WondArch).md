# Ghastly Chamber (WondArch)
## Overview
**Ghastly Chamber:** Any person entering this space is immediately [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1d6+2 rounds (as if affected by a *[[Ghoul Touch (Spell)|ghoul touch]]* spell), and exudes a nauseating stench that deals a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks to all within 10 feet. This stench (and effect) lasts as long as the person remains [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]]. A successful Fortitude save (DC 13) by the person entering negates the paralysis and stench, while the same save negates the nausea.

This effect is best used in conjunction with either a number of guards or some kind of alarm. Otherwise, the victims may be able to simply suffer through the paralyzation and walk away.

The creator may make the area of effect for this chamber smaller than the standard 400 square feet (as small as a 5-foot-by-5-foot square).

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Ghoul Touch (Spell)|ghoul touch]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
