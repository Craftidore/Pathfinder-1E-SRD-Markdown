# Constructing Vehicles
## Overview
Sometimes, a team will steal a vehicle, or purchase a basic or used vehicle that a builder has on hand. At these times, the adventurers have very little say as to what is available to them, and can only choose from the options made available by the GM. Other times, however, adventurers who know exactly what they want will either commission the vehicle they wish, or if they possess the skill, construct it themselves.

When a team of adventurers decide to commission or build the vehicle they want, they may either choose a vehicle from this book, or design their vehicle from scratch. This chapter is designed to for those adventurers who want to design a vehicle themselves, be it an airship, galley, steam walker, or more.

**Commissioning a Vehicle**

If the players wish to design their own vehicle, but do not possess the skill to build it themselves, they must commission someone to build it for them. Finding a builder with the skill to fascilitate their design can be difficult, but workshops dedicated to vehicle construction can be found in most cities. When commissioning a vehicle, the players add up the total cost of their design (including hull, engines, weapons, rooms, etc.) and pay the builder half to begin construction (which covers the cost of materials and labor). Once the vehicle is complete, they pay the second half.

A vehicle and each of its component parts are constructed using the basic item crafting rules. However, unless the plot requires the GM to play out the builder’s work for one reason or another, assume a vehicle takes 1 week of work per 1,000 gp in the vehicle’s cost (minimum: 1 week). At the GM’s discretion, large workshops might halve this production time, but might also demand more for their work.

## Building a Vehicle
**Building a Vehicle**

If a PC does not want to commission a vehicle and instead wants to build it himself, He may craft.a vehicle as he would any other item: he must pay 1/3rd the vehicle’s base cost to acquire raw materials, and must spend time and make [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] checks to complete it. Because of their sheer size, PCs wishing to build their own vehicle cannot do so on the road. Instead, they must find a workshop.

**Workshop:** Any workshop can be used to construct any vehicle, provided it is larger than the vehicle in question (although unless the workshop is a drydock located next to the water’s edge, transporting a large water vehicle from workshop to water may prove difficult). Purchasing a workshop costs 100 gp for a Large-sized, 250 gp for a Huge-sized, 500 gp for a Gargantuan-sized, and 1000 gp for a Colossal-sized workshop. For every 1000 gp spent beyond the 1st, the workshop can facilitate the construction of a vehicle with an additional location in its size. 

Players looking to construct a vehicle may also rent workshop space, usually at 1/10th the price of purchase per month.

**Crafting:** Vehicles require the use of an appropriate [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill to construct, dependent on the type of vehicle being crafted. [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (wagon) is used for land vehicles, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) for water vehicles, and [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (airship) for air vehicles. This only applies to crafting the vehicle’s hull and most internal rooms; [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (siege engines) is required to create most vehicle weapons, and certain other vehicle components or pieces of vehicle equipment require unique [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills, which are listed with the equipment in question.

Every component a vehicle possesses must be crafted or bought individually, including engines, weapons, armor, rooms, etc. It is not uncommon for someone crafting a vehicle to hire outside help or simply purchase certain vehicle components that are outside the crafter’s area of expertise.

Because of the sheer size and price of particularly large vehicles, few PCs will attempt it without a dedicated crew of helpers working alonside them. Rules for hiring and using crews can be found in the Skybourne Player’s Guide.

## Designing a Vehicle
**Designing a Vehicle**

The process of designing a vehicle involves deciding the vehicle’s size, templates, materials, and layout. After that, the only thing remaining is to flesh the vehicle out with equipment, including propulsion, weapons, etc., which are described in detail in the next chapter.

## Vehicle Size
**Vehicle Size**

A vehicle has two sizes: The size of its hull, and its ‘effective’ size, which includes its sails and dirigible, if it possesses these things. The size of a vehicle’s hull determines how expensive some templates are, while effective size determines factors such as maneuverability. A vehicle’s size can be Large, Huge, Gargantuan, Colossal, or Colossal+, and is determined by the number of Hardpoints/Decks it possesses. A vehicle’s hull size also determines the cost of applying templates.

Each size category has a minimum and maximum number of Hardpoints it can possess before the vehicle becomes a larger size category.


| **Vehicle** <br>**Size** | **Minimum** <br>**Number of** <br>**Hardpoints** | **Maximum**<br>**Number of**<br>**Hardpoints** |
|---|---|---|
| Large | 1 | 2 |
| Huge | 3 | 4 |
| Gargantuan | 5 | 8 |
| Colossal | 9 Hardpoints, <br>or 1 Deck | 45 Hardpoints, <br>or 5 Decks |
| Colossal+ | 45+, or any ship <br>with multiple locations | --- |

**Smaller Vehicles:** It is possible for vehicles to be even smaller than 1 Hardpoint; Large (long) vehicles that are 1/2 a Hardpoint big, Medium-sized vehicles designed for Tiny creatures, etc.. These vehicles divide the cost of creation and templates, as well as the effectiveness of their rooms, engines, and other components, by their size: 1/2 for Large (long) vehicles, 1/4th for Medium vehicles, etc. Hit points, on the other hand, are reduced to 75% for Large (long) vehicles, and 50% for Medium vehicles. Examples of these smaller vehicles are found in the Sample Vehicles chapter at the end of this book.

## Vehicle Templates
**Vehicle Templates**

After determining the vehicle’s hull size, the next step is to determine what vehicle template or templates it will possess. This includes determining if it will be a land vehicle, a water vehicle, or an air vehicle. Each vehicle template possesses its own concerns, and has access to unique equipment.

Each vehicle begins with either the land vehicle, water vehicle, or air vehicle template. This initial template costs nothing, but giving a vehicle a second or third movement template, whether at creation or after, costs 500 gp for a Large vehicle, 1,000 gp for a Huge vehicle, 2,000 gp for a Gargantuan vehicle, and 4,000 gp for a Colossal vehicle or for each location for a Colossal+ vehicle, and requires a DC 30 [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check using whatever Crafting skill is connected to the new medium ([[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (wagon) for land vehicles, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) for water vehicles, and [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (airships) for air vehicles).

## Vehicle Layout
**Vehicle Layout**

Once a vehicle’s size and template is known, it becomes possible to design the vehicle itself. While for the most part this is simply aesthetics (what do the players want their vehicle to look like, where do they want the rooms and windows, etc.), for Colossal+ vehicles this is especially important, as the way the locations are put together determines what spaces the vehicle fills during combat. Generally speaking and with only few exceptions, a vehicle must be longer than it is wide, and wider than it is tall. Half of the vehicle’s Hardpoints/Decks are considered ‘uncovered’, to a maximum of 1 Deck per space.

## Vehicle Material
**Vehicle Material**

By default, a vehicle’s hull is assumed to be constructed out of wood. However, in a world of great magic and mysterious alchemy, it is not unheard of to find a vehicle made out of stone, iron, or even more exotic materials like mithril, greenwood, or [[Adamantine|adamantine]]. The number of Hardpoints/Decks a vehicle has in its hull and the material the hull is made from determines the vehicle’s hit points, weight and mass, etc.

Some materials use a price other than their own when determining how much time they take to craft. For example, an [[Adamantine|adamantine]] ship is worth a king’s ransom, but still takes no more time to construct than a ship made of iron.

**Finding Materials:** Not all materials will be available in all locations. A Forest-top tribe would have quite a bit of difficulty securing enough stone for meaningful construction, while [[Adamantine|adamantine]] is rare everywhere. While the exact details are left up to the GM, players must first have access to a material before it may be used in construction, which could involve scouring markets, long-distance travel, or questing.

Discovering materials is the realm of plot and adventure, and it is never easy to gather enough [[Darkwood|darkwood]], mithril, etc. for meaningful construction. However, if players manage to gather enough material through adventuring, they can then construct a vehicle without worrying about the cost of raw materials. Indeed, gathering the materials is often the only way a character would be able to craft with several of the following materials, and players looking to amass such rare materials could spend entire gaming sessions just searching out enough raw materials. It takes 1 ton per Hardpoint (9 tons per Deck) of raw material to build a vehicle’s hull.

| **<sup>1</sup> Mass:** Some materials weigh considerably less than wood, others considerably more. If a material is so light or so dense that it counts differently than normal for weight and mass calculations listed in the vehicle basic rules, the number is listed here. For example, every Hardpoint built from a material with a mass of 1/2 would only count as 1/2 a Hardpoint when calculating weight and mass. Every Hardpoint built from a material with a mass of 2, on the other hand, would count as 2 Hardpoints when calculating weight and mass. ||||||||
| **<sup>2</sup> Crafting DC:** This is the DC that the head builder of the vehicle must meet in order to facilitate a week’s construction, using either the Craft.(wagon), Craft.(ship), or Craft.(airship) skills. ||||||||

**Bone:** While it can be difficult to construct an entire vehicle from bone, sometimes necromancers will build from this material, both because it is plentifully found in their cryptyards, and as a means to declare their identities and to intimidate their enemies. Bone is as hard as wood, but more brittle. Bone is not readily available for construction purposes; a creature wishing to build from bone must have access to a suitably large cryptyard,  or another source of bone.

Some merfolk build vehicles out of shells. This is considered the same as bone.

**Wood:** As both the most common building material and certainly the most plentiful, most vehicles are built from wood, and wood is the material all other materials must be measured against to see if they are a worthy building material.

**Stone:** Heavy but strong, stone is not considered a practical building material for most vehicles, but that doesn’t stop some creatures from making use of it, especially traditional dwarves who always find the material easier to work with than wood. A creature must have access to a quarry to gain enough stone for constructing a vehicle.

**Iron:** Vehicles made of iron are heavy but extremely durable, and many wealthy nations will build their largest military airships of iron to better protect them.

**Glass:** Glass is unsuitable for most large vehicles, but some larger ships will keep smaller vessels built of glass for use in stealth missions. Creatures suffer a -8 penalty to any Perception checks made to notice a vehicle made of glass.

**Darkwood:** Darkwood is as strong as regular wood, but much lighter. Darkwood is rare and can only be found in special locations of the Forest, or occasionally in large markets. 

Darkwood uses the same price as regular wood when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Greenwood:** Greenwood is a special type of wood harvested from treants by dryad hands. Greenwood remains alive as long as it is doused or submerged in at least one ton of water per Hardpoint once per week, and allowed to rest for an hour in contact with fertile soil. When damp and in contact with fertile soil, living greenwood heals damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point per Hardpoint per hour, even repairing breaks and regrowing missing pieces.

Greenwood vehicles take only one-quarter damage from fire, and any wood-shaping magic used on it (such as the *ironwood* or *shape wood* spells) or enhance it has double the usual duration. Greenwood can only be obtained from druidic woods and the fey realms, although it is sometimes found in large markets.

Greenwood uses the same price as regular wood when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Gold:** Gold is a terrible building material, but is still sometimes crafted into the shape of wagons, airships, or other vehicles as a sign of extreme wealth.

Gold uses the same price as iron when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Living Steel:** A vehicle made from living steel heals itself over time, to the amount of 2 hit points per Hardpoint or 18 hit points per Deck per day. Living steel is gathered from the inside of unusually powerful trees (ones that suck up living energy and rare minerals from the soil), and can only be found in special locations of the forest, or occasionally in large markets.

Living Steel uses the same price as iron when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Mithral:** Mithral is a strong and remarkably light metal, although very rare. It is rarely found outside of the deep earth, and the marketplaces where miners sell this magical metal.

Mithral uses the same price as iron when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Adamantine:** The rarest of all metals, adamantine is heavy and extremely powerful. The knowledge of how to create or gather adamantine was lost with the ancient dwarf empire, but bits and pieces of it are still found occasionally by adventurers. some of which are taken to large markets for sale.

Adamantine uses the same price as iron when determining how long it takes to construct.

**Diamond:** A vehicle made of diamond is carved from giant diamonds found only in the deepest caverns under the earth.

A diamond vehicle suffers 1/4th damage from energy attacks instead of 1/2. In addition, any ray or other magical touch attack targeting the vehicle has a 50% chance of being reflected back upon the caster. If a diamond vehicle is used to perform a ramming maneuver, it ignores all armor bonuses and deflection bonuses, and deals an extra +4d8 damage.

Additionally, the sheer magical resonance of that much pure diamond together endows diamond vessels with special powers. 1 time per day, a spellcaster aboard a diamond vehicle Location may cast a ritual or spell as a standard action, without spending a spell slot, and without spending any material components. The location can fascilitate 2 spell/ritual levels and 20,000 gp of cost per Deck (9th level and 100,000 gp per 5 Decks).

Diamond uses the same price as stone when determining how long it takes to construct.

## Outfitting
**Outfitting**

Once a vehicle has been designed, it lacks only a means of propulsion to be complete. However, many PCs are not satisfied until they have customized a vehicle thoroughly either at creation or after a few adventures, adding weapons, armor, component rooms, and more to better fit their needs. The various pieces of equipment a vehicle might have are explained in detail in the following chapter.
