# Smuggling Compartments
## Overview
**Smuggling Compartments**

The ship’s bulkheads are modified so that gaps between them can serve as hidden cargo storage areas.

**Benefit:** This does not change a ship’s cargo capacity. A smuggling compartment can hold anything that fits within a 5-foot cubic space. If you are using the plunder rules (see the Pirate Campaign Compendium from Legendary Games for details on the plunder system), in general, two smuggling compartments are required to hold 1 point of plunder. A DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check is required to locate smuggling compartments in a search of the ship.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 19; Cost: 500 gp per 5-foot-square compartment
