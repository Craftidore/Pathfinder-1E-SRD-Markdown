# Theurge
## Overview
**Theurge**

You are realizing that, at its root, all magic is the same.

**Prerequisite:** Int 15

**Benefit:** Select a spell from a class list other than your own that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. You learn this spell, and it is added to your class list as a spell 2 levels higher than its normal level.

**Special:** You may take this arcane discovery more than once. Itâ€™s effects do not stack. Each time you select it, you choose a different spell from another class list.
