# False Divine Magic
## Overview
The ruler of Razmiran is not only one of the Inner Sea region’s most aggressive masters, but also one of the region’s greatest con artists, having convinced thousands of followers of his divinity. With a skilled synthesis of glib lies and powerful arcane magic, Razmir sits atop a pyramid of faith behind an impassive mask—only the highest-ranking members of his cult know the truth, that their “god” is in fact a mortal man fast approaching the end of his life. Over the years, Razmir and his masked priests have developed and perfected a new form of arcane magic—false divine magic. 

Razmir relies upon skilled liars (mostly bards, rogues, and sorcerers) to pose as his priests. When “miracles” are required, he relies upon his bards to create them with arcane magic disguised as divine magic. Certain sorcerers have also developed powers to aid them in this pursuit (see the Razmiran priest archetype on page 39), but most utilize the following feats to pull off their deceptions.
