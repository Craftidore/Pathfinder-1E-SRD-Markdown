# Emissary of Barachiel (PrC)
## Overview
Ruler of the first heaven of Celestia, Barachiel is patron of lawful

good heralds and messengers. He is charged with the defense of

Celestia and the promulgation of law and goodness on the

Material Plane, and his emissaries help him carry out this

latter mission. The emissaries of Barachiel are peacemakers,

diplomats, and evangelists, as well as staunch

opponents of evil and corruption.

Emissaries of Barachiel are often clerics, paladins, or

even rogues, but members of almost every other class

sometimes take up Barachiel’s mission as well.

Centers of population are the natural habitat of

most emissaries of Barachiel, whose primary

purpose involves encouraging people toward

lawful good behavior. Some emissaries,

however, gravitate toward real challenges:

preaching Barachiel’s cause among traditionally

hostile or evil humanoids, from

lizardfolk to orcs. The fact that some of

these emissaries even survive is testament

to their power and conviction.

While few emissaries have the fortitude

to work for long among evil humanoids,

many others make shorter forays into

hostile territory; most player character

(PC) emissaries would fall into this

category.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the emissary of

Barachiel prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Emissaries of Barachiel

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: An emissary of Barachiel has the ability to cast a small

number of divine spells. To cast an emissary of Barachiel spell,

the emissary must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the

spell’s level, so an emissary with a Charisma of 10 or lower

cannot cast these spells. Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are

based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have

a DC of 10 + spell level + the emissary’s Charisma modifier.

When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance,

1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only

the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma

score for that spell level. The emissary’s spell list appears below.

An emissary of Barachiel casts spells just as a bard does, except

that his spells are divine and not arcane.

Calling (Su): An emissary of Barachiel’s most fundamental

ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience

of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day

per class level, spending a full-round action to issue the call.

Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially

affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is

the DC for affected creatures’ Will saving throws. Creatures that

fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as

follows:

Alignment Effect

Lawful good Inspired

Neutral good or chaotic good Blessed

Lawful neutral Enthralled

Neutral or chaotic neutral Enthralled,

disheartened

Any evil Stunned, demoralized

Inspired: Affected creatures receive a +2 morale bonus on

attack rolls, saving throws, skill and ability checks, and weapon

damage rolls for 10 minutes.

Blessed: Affected creatures receive a +1 morale bonus on attack

rolls and on saving throws against fear effects for 10 minutes.

Enthralled: Affected creatures act as if subject to an enthrall

spell for as long as you continue to speak and for 1d3 rounds

thereafter. For the duration of the effect and for 1 day afterward,

affected creatures take a –1 penalty on Will saves related to

redemption (see Chapter 2).

Disheartened: Affected creatures take a –1 penalty on attack

rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 10

minutes.

Stunned: Affected creatures are stunned for 1 round.

Demoralized: Affected creatures take a –2 penalty on attack

rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and weapon

damage rolls for 10 minutes (including the 1 round during

which they are stunned).

Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires

the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of nonlethal

damage to the emissary. Calling is an Enchantment

(Compulsion) \[Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting] effect.

Conversion (Su): A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use

his calling ability to facilitate actual conversion of nongood

humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability

(see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the

same—except that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal

damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, however,

all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling

(except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw.

Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were

one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral,

neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act

chaotic neutral. Lawful neutral and neutral good creatures act

lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral

good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good.

Creatures affected by this temporary alignment shift can

make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the

emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it

receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this

bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which

the emissary is not present.

During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to

any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a different

one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed

with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a

caster level check against a DC equal to the emissary’s original Diplomacy check result. Also during this time, an atonement

spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the

creature from making any additional saving throws.

If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving

throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent.

At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either

through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual

manner, as alignment change normally works—the creature

cannot simply decide to be evil again).

Sustenance (Su): At 5th level, an emissary of Barachiel can

help to keep good creatures good. As a use of his calling ability,

he can produce one of the following effects:

• Duplicate the effects of an atonement spell.

• Reverse any magical alignment change (such as that

produced by a helm of opposite alignment or a morality

undone spell).

• Dispel a charm or compulsion effect cast by an

evil creature upon a good target, by making a

dispel check (1d20 + character

level against a DC of 11 + evil

caster’s level).

These effects require the emissary

of Barachiel to touch the

target creature.
