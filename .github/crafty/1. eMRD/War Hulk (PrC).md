# War Hulk (PrC)
## Overview
Against the marshaled forces of the enemy army, the war hulk

stands tall, confident in his power against lesser soldiers. And

why not? He is a creature of great size and talent who is specifically

trained to shock and awe opposing massed troops. A hulk

indeed, he knows how to spread his mighty blows across a wide area, creating carnage on the battlefield. While a single opponent

might evade this massive attack, a massed unit of terrified soldiers

are meat on the pounding block.

Drawn most often from more intelligent individuals among

the various giant kinds, war hulks are trained to fight by similarly

large tutors. Other than being big, a war hulk must come to the

training already knowing how to fight. Thus, the martial classes,

such as fighter, ranger, paladin, and barbarian, are most often promoted

into this prestige class—although many giants meet the

requirements with no class levels at all.

When an NPC war hulk is spied at the head of an army, the

event is too significant to call it merely an omen. Instead, it is a

clear sign of deadly peril.

Hit Die: d12.

following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Special: Must be Large or larger.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the war hulk.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: War hulks gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Ability Boost (Ex): As a war hulk gains levels in this prestige class, his Strength score increases as noted in Table 1–12: The War Hulk. These increases stack.

No Time to Think (Ex): A character with levels in the war hulk prestige class is considered to have 0 ranks in all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills (whether or not he has bought ranks in them previously). The only exception is the Intimidate skill, which works normally.

Great Swing (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a war hulk is able to

make a great, sweeping swing with a melee weapon. As a full-round

action, the war hulk can choose three squares adjacent to one

another (he must threaten all of them). His attack applies to all creatures

in those squares. Make one attack roll and apply that roll as an

attack against each defender. If the war hulk uses a special attack

(such as disarm, trip, or sunder), this special attack affects only the

first target; the other creatures are attacked normally.

Walls and similar obstacles can block a great swing. Start with

one square that the war hulk threatens. Each successive square

chosen must be adjacent to the previous square and have line of

effect from that square. Two squares separated by a wall, for

instance, can’t be chosen as adjacent squares for a great swing.

The war hulk may skip creatures, attacking only those he wants

to. For example, if there are three creatures in a row—an enemy, an

ally, and another enemy—the war hulk can choose those three

squares for the great swing but strike only the two enemies.

If a war hulk drops one of his foes with a great swing, he may

make a cleave attack normally. However, he may do so only once

for every time he swings, even if he drops more than one foe.

Mighty Rock Throwing (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a war hulk

gains a powerful rock throwing ability. The character can throw

rocks that deal 2d8 points of damage with a range increment of

50 feet. (Like all thrown weapons, they have a maximum range

of five range increments.) The war hulk uses his Strength modifier

instead of his Dexterity modifier on the attack roll. The rock

must weigh approximately 50 pounds.

Mighty Swing (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a war hulk can make

a mighty swing. A mighty swing is like a great swing, except that

it is a standard action rather than a full-round action. Thus, the

character can move and make a mighty swing or (if he can make

multiple attacks) make multiple mighty swings in a single round.

Sweeping Boulder (Ex): Starting at 6th level, a war hulk is

able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect two adjacent

squares. (The second square must be farther away from the

war hulk than the first—they cannot be equidistant from him.)

Make one attack roll and apply the result to each target.

As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from

one square to the next.

Toughness: At 8th, 9th, and 10th level, a war hulk gains

Toughness as a bonus feat.

Massive Sweeping Boulder

(Ex): Starting at 8th level, a war

hulk is able to throw his

rocks with such

force that they

affect four

squares in

a line. (Each successive square chosen must be farther away from the

character.) Only the first creature can be subject to damage from

a critical hit or a sneak attack.

As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from

one square to the next.

Massive Swing (Ex): A 10th-level war hulk can lash out all

around himself with a single attack. Massive swing works like

mighty swing, except that its effect is not limited to three squares.

The war hulk’s swing affects all squares he threatens.
