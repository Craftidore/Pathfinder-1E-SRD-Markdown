# C00 - Introduction
## Overview
The ancient practice of blood magic has been outlawed in many civilised societies, for though it allows access to staggering levels of magical power the price can be very high. Savage tribes often respect blood magic, though even they tend to fear and avoid it where possible – its power is the stuff of legend, to be invoked only by those who expect to achieve great things or die in the attempt. A few warriors of the old school will swear blood brotherhood or other blood oaths but learning much more than that is generally the province only of primitive sorcerers or the most vile and despicable wizards. Those who go into blood magic with good intentions often find themselves seduced by its savage power, and soon want more – at whatever cost, up to and including dozens or hundreds of innocent lives.

The power inherent in sentient blood has been recognised by many of the great philosophers and sages throughout history, both religious and secular. Whether spilling his own blood to fuel his spells, creating a ritual to bond two comrades in blood brotherhood, or sacrificing enemies for magical power, the practitioner of blood magic is drawing upon that ancient, primal force, and must take great care that he can control it, and not vice versa.

**Encyclopaedia Arcane**

Blood Magic – Oaths and Sacrifice is the latest volume in the Encyclopaedia Arcane series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system, these sourcebooks enhance and expand all arcane spellcasting classes, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Each book of the Encyclopaedia Arcane is of use to players and Games Masters alike, presenting full and detailed information on the new system of magic and ideas as to how to incorporate it into the repertoire of both new and existing arcane spellcasting characters.

**Blood Magic – Oaths and Sacrifice**

This volume of the Encyclopaedia Arcane series gives players and Games Masters alike the information they need to begin using blood magic within their campaign. You will find chapters devoted to learning blood magic from a teacher or by experiment, the perils of the bloody art, and items created by or to enhance blood magic. Plus, of course, this book presents new feats and spells with which to achieve mastery of blood magic, and new creatures associated with the practice.

Both sorcerers and wizards can attempt to learn blood magic. Finding a teacher in civilised lands can be tricky, though it is also possible to teach oneself through trial and error. Many teachers of blood magic demand a far higher price than the student’s diligence and gold, though, and the would-be student must approach the matter with great caution.

For the blood magician who is either very strong-willed and capable of resisting the more dangerous temptations of that path, or who is prepared to simply launch himself headlong into the most unpleasant aspects of blood magic, this can be a worthy addition to his arsenal of magical powers, allowing him to be a great deal more versatile than the more formulaic wizard or sorcerer. On the other hand, those who simply dabble with blood magic, learning a little here and a little there, believing they can control their habit, are often those most at risk of being either totally corrupted by it, or destroyed by one of the primal forces that seem attracted to it...
