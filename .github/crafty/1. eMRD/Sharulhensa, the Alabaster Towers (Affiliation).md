SHARULHENSA,

THE ALABASTER TOWERS

Symbol: Sharulhensa has no particular symbol, but many

of the buildings within the neighborhood have fonts and

fountains incorporated into their design—a architectural

nod to the magic pools.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Sharulhensa is a halfelf

enclave built within the walls of a human metropolis.

Raised on the ruins of an ancient elf empire, the enclave

holds onto its magical heritage even as other cultures have

supplanted elves as the dominant humanoids across the

land. The half-elves of Sharulhensa remember the mighty

magic of their forebears, and they pass along ancient traditions

to the new generation in an effort to connect their

dual heritage.

Secrets: Throughout the city of Sharulhensa are sacred

pools believed to hold the spirits of departed half-elves in a

quiescent state. When a half-elf drinks of these waters, he

or she gains a measure of magical power and a sense of the

eldritch tapestry that weaves together residents of Sharulhensa,

no matter how far they roam. The enclave’s elders

keep the locations of the sacred pools a secret even from the

ordinary residents of Sharulhensa, so the only way to get

access to the pools is by garnering favor with Sharulhensa’s

elders—earning affi liation, in other words.

The movers and shakers within Sharulhensa have intense

academic rivalries with each other as they vie to recapture

more of their elven heritage.

Type: College (racial).

Scale: 2 (neighborhoods).

Affi liation Score Criteria: Only half-elves are eligible to

join this affi liation. Sharulhensa residents regard full-blooded

elves as lacking suffi cient vitality and energy to guard the

heritage of their ancient forebears.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Character level +1/2 PC’s level

Wizard +2

Other spellcaster +1

10 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana) +2

Each successful mission +1

Recovers a magic item worth 30,000 gp or more +2

Recovers a spellbook with at least 7th-level spells +1

Titles, Benefits, and Duties: Sharulhensa sometimes

needs adventurers to undertake missions on its behalf. If you

complete such an adventure successfully, you can increase

your affi liation score with the half-elf enclave. But moreso

than the standard “Stop the orc horde marching toward the

city” mission, recovering the elves’ ancient heritage earns

favor with Sharulhensa’s elders—even if you’re recovering

that heritage from the elves themselves. In particular, you can

improve your status with Sharulhensa if you retrieve major

magic items crafted by the elves long ago and grimoires with

high-level arcane spells. Not any magic sword or spellbook

will do, however—Sharulhensa is interested only in items

steeped in elven history.

The reward of Sharulhensa affi lation—access to the magic

pools—is great, but earning affi liation with Sharulhensa is

more diffi cult than most other racial affi liations. Those who

persevere find their ability to wield magic, especially the

subtle enchantments of the elves, vastly improved.
