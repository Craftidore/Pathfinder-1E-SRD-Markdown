# Seekers of the Arcane
## Overview
The Seekers of the Arcane, commonly called simply the Seekers, are a loose organization of treasure hunters, scholars, and explorers, with lodges throughout the [[Flanaess]] and beyond. They scour the world for artifacts, magic, and treasure, prominent among these is the [[Throne of the Gods]]. Though often described as unscrupulous and self-centered, some Seekers claim high-minded goals.

The symbol of the Seekers, known as the Seeker's Signet, is eight triangles arranged in a star around a circle. The eight triangles represent the octychs, metal plates that fit into the star design in Maure Castle.

## Profile
Known Seekers include Lashton of Grayhill, Tibarian Matreyus of Gradsul, the former Seer of Urnst, Baron Malweig of Dilwych, Khellek of Greyhawk, Baltron of the Hool Marshes, Ulavant (presumably of Greyhawk, deceased), the renegade Eli Tomorast, and a deceased magician named Zatar, who once found the [[Throne of the Gods]].

## Relationships
The Seekers have acted as a foil to the Silent Ones of Keoland for two centuries now, often contending for the same items. The Silent Ones strive to keep certain things undisturbed and hidden from the world at large, while the Seekers share a more egalitarian view. 

As they have begun exploring the southern seas and the jungles along the Amedio coast, the Seekers have attracted the emnity of the Scarlet Brotherhood, who share their interest in ancient secrets and ruined tombs. 

Some Seekers share sympathies with the Skeptics of Nellix.

## Organization
Lodges, or clubhouses, owned by the Seekers are mostly secret and often disguised as more mundane establishments, such as drinking houses, cartography businesses, or social clubs. They can be found in such widely separated cities as Gradsul, the [[Free City of Greyhawk (GHC)|Free City of Greyhawk]], Irongate, Rel Astra, and Sasserine. In Nellix, the Seekers meet with the Skeptics in the home of one Quintus Marius of Seltaren (a descendant of Jonus Marius).

## Background
The Seekers were founded in the early fourth century CY by Jonus Marius, who gathered together the royal explorers and surveyors who had served the Great Kingdom during its expansionist phase. As the kingdom's expansion declined, so did the Throne of the Sun's need for such specialists. Marius gave these individuals a purpose, suggesting they could explore (and plunder) the treasures of the [[Flanaess]] together. Though Marius and his comrades lacked the creativity of the Company of Seven, they made up for it by pooling their resources and research, occasionally reproducing the efforts of others.
