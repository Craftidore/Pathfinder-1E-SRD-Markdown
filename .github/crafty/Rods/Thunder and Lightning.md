# Thunder and Lightning
## Overview
**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none

**Price** 33,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a *+2 light mace*. Its other powers are as follows.

- **Thunder**: Once per day, the rod can strike as a *+3 light mace,* and the opponent struck is [[Stunned|stunned]] from the noise of the rodâ€™s impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.
- **Lightning**: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a *+2 light mace* (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.
- **Thunderclap**: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a *[[Shout (Spell)|shout]]* spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target [[Deafened|deafened]] for 2d6 rounds).
- **Lightning Stroke**: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.
- **Thunder and Lightning**: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]],* as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.

**Requirements** [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], [[Craft Rod (Feat)|Craft Rod]], *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]*, *[[Shout (Spell)|shout]]*
