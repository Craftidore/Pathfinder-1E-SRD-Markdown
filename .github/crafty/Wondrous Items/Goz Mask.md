**Campaign History: Golarion**

Shortly after the Eye of Abendego began, a fanatical splinter-cult of [[Gozreh]] known as the Storm Kindlers flocked to the region, convinced the Eye was a manifestation of the Storm Lord himself. The upper tier of this group created enchanted masks to aid in the navigation of the often storm-lashed swamps. The Storm Kindlers, however, were unprepared for the savagery and evil that had claimed the Sodden Lands, and they and their home were quickly wiped out. Today, many of these distinctive masks remain, now worn by humanoid chieftains and Koboto witch doctors. The masks are often defaced, with the original appearance twisted into a monstrous or demonic visage. Their new owners refer to them as goz masks.
