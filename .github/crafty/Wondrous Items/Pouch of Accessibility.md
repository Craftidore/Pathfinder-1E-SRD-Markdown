This normal-seeming pouch is actually a strongly magicked item which can contain up to 300 lbs. in 30 specially constructed pockets within it. Each pocket, in turn, holds a maximum of 10 lbs., or one cubic foot of volume, whichever is reached first. This device also enables the possessor to open it and call forth the item(s) desired. Merely speaking the name of a desired object causes it to appear at the top of the pouch, ready for instant grasp. These items are similar to bags of holding and portable holes, and the strictures about placement within such magical spaces apply fully. The pouch weighs 1 lb. empty and 4 lbs. when filled.
