# Ioun Stone, golden rhomboid
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 32,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

A rare example of an intelligent *ioun stone*, these *ioun stones* were originally embedded in the hilts of enchanted swords and many are still found in this form. Each stone has the following ability scores: Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 12. They are of neutral alignment, can see and hear to a range of 30 ft., and can communicate empathically with their owner. The stone has 10 ranks in [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] (+11 modifier in all), which it uses to size up any creatures within 30 ft., communicating what it notices to its owner. While the stone cannot communicate specific details, it communicates a sense of “danger” if it gets a hunch that something is wrong or that an ally’s behavior is affected by an enchantment. It also communicates a sense of pride when a hard-fought battle is won and a sense of joy if another *gold ellipsoid* *ioun stone* comes within 30 ft.

Having experienced decades of combat, the stones can mentally advise their owner to make a sudden attack when an opponent presents an opening.

Whenever the stone’s user makes a full attack, she may make one extra attack at her highest base attack bonus. She may make up to five such attacks per day. This extra attack is not cumulative with the extra attack provided by *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* or a *[[Speed (MagWpnSpcAb)|speed]]* weapon; the extra speed confuses the stone’s instinctive perception of the flow of battle. The *ioun stone* is always steadfastly loyal to whomever owns it at the time.
