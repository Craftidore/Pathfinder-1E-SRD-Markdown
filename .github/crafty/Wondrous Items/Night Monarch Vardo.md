# Night Monarch Vardo
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration and transmutation; **CL** 13th 

**Slot** —

**Price** 22,750 gp

**Weight** 400 lbs.

**Description**

Varisians prize these brightly colored wagons for their usefulness in transport and consider them a sign of Desna’s favor. 10 feet wide by 20 feet long, a *night monarch vardo* functions as a magically treated Heavy Wagon (hardness 10 and 240 hit points). However, the inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Two additional rooms equivalent in size to the first are accessible from the interior of the wagon and are treated as extradimensional spaces. The atmosphere in these adjoining rooms is clean, fresh, and warm regardless of outside conditions. Each has a capacity of 5,000 pounds and 1,000 cubic feet (10 feet wide by 20 feet long).

A greater boon is revealed when an animal animated from a *figurine of wondrous powe*r is harnessed to the wagon. A *night monarch vardo* does not encumber these creatures, provided they are at least large size. Moreover, if the animated animal takes flight, the wagon can accompany the creature without hindrance. A *night monarch vardo* can even follow an *[[Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Steed)|obsidian steed]]* during its *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* and *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]* powers.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Several modifications have been tried (some without success) to the *night monarch vardo*; each successful modification adds +1 to the *vardo's* caster level (remember this is not a construction requirement but rather provides the *vardo's* caster level for *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* checks*.* The cost here for such modifications is the same whether they are incorporated into the *vardo's* construction or added later on. This is an exception to the normal crafting rule with regards to adding a later enchanment. Here are some of the successes:

Adding the *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but adds an *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* to the *vardo's* interior.

Adding the *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but doubles its hardness and hit points and adds +20 to the break DC of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but stabilizes its interior (to include the addtional rooms) so that items that use an extradimensional space as a part of their function (cf. *bag of holding)* function normally.

Adding the *[[Disguise Caravan (Spell)|disguise caravan]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but it appears as a completely different vehicle allowing it to seamlessly blend in with the culture and environment around it. Remember it does not disguise those driving or riding in it.

Adding the *[[Alarm, Greater (Spell)|greater alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 1 point per 2 caster levels of the *vardo's* caster level.

Adding the *[[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but prevents it from being detected by all but magical means.

Adding the *[[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but increases its interior, changing the right side additional room into a 30 x 30 foot chamber with a sturdy door and a small fireplace. It is furnished with eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. If this spell is added to the *vardo's* construction twice, the left side chamber is altered to mirror the right side one.

Adding the *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *vardo*, as well as around the exterior so long as it remains within 60 feet of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 10 to a total of 20 and gives it fire resistance 10.

Adding the *[[Ironwood, Greater (Spell)|greater ironwood]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but gives it DR 5/[[Adamantine|adamantine]] and immunity to fire.

Adding the *[[Mage's Faithful Hound (Spell)|mage's faithful hound]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the exterior of the *vardo* within 30 feet when it is not moving as that spell.

Adding the *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the interior as that spell.

Adding the *[[Mirror Hideaway (Spell)|mirror hideaway]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but creates a 10 feet by 20 feet extradimensional space. This modification and the space it creates can only be used if a mirror at least 2 feet by 4 feet is present (and remains at all times) in the *vardo.* (Multiple spaces could be chained together or could be linked from a single space holding multiple mirrors. This modification can be used multiple times.)

Adding a second casting of the *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but causes it to fly at a speed of 30 feet as that spell.

Adding the *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but gives it a driver that makes all driver skill checks (no matter what skills are needed to drive the vehicle) as your caster level + your Intelligence modifier at the time you created the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but give it the additional powers and capabilities of that spell (any improvement in an ability, capability, or power, use the better of the two).

Adding the *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 18,000 gp but allows it to move from plane to plane as if a *[[Plane Shift, Greater (Spell)|greater plane shift]]* were cast upon it.

Adding the *[[Power Craft (Spell)|power craft]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but causes it to move at a speed of 50 feet as that spell.

Adding the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but creates an extradimensional space that is accessible through a trapdoor in one of the *vardo's* three rooms. This vault is equal in size to 10 cubic feet per CL of the *vardo.* Once the location of this trapdoor is decided upon, it cannot be changed.

Adding the *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* *spell* to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but gives it the additional power to shrink down to a tiny six inches wooden model of itself upon command. Saying the same command word in reverse causes the *vardo* to return to its original size. If the *vardo* also has the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* modification, then any materials or persons within it remain inside, otherwise they are ejected when it transforms.

Adding the *unseen attendant* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *unseen attendant* to act as your valet while in the interior of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* to assist in any crafting (magical or mundane) while in the interior of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *vardo*.

Substituting [[Darkwood|darkwood]] for more common woods results in the following: 

HP/inch 10; Hardness 5; Cost To determine the price of a [[Darkwood|darkwood]] item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.

This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light.

Any wooden or mostly wooden item made from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] is considered a masterwork (+1 AC if relevent) item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.

**Vardo of the Wandering Wizard**

**Aura** strong conjuration and transmutation; **CL** 21th 

**Slot** —

**Price** 98,750 gp

**Weight** 400 lbs.

**Description**

This drab colored wagon appears to made from some light colored wood; in fact is made from magically hardened glass that has been even further reinforced through the use of the *[[Glassteel|glassteel]]* spell. 10 feet wide by 20 feet long, the* vardo* functions as a magically treated Heavy Wagon (hardness 20 and 480 hit points). However, the inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Two additional rooms equivalent in size to the first are accessible from the interior of the wagon and are treated as extradimensional spaces which have been stabilized using *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]**.* The atmosphere in these adjoining rooms is clean, fresh, and warm regardless of outside conditions. Each has a capacity of 10,000 pounds and 2,000 cubic feet.

A greater boon is revealed when an animal animated from a *figurine of wondrous powe*r is harnessed to the wagon. The* vardo* does not encumber these creatures, provided they are at least large size. Moreover, if the animated animal takes flight, the wagon can accompany the creature without hindrance. A *night monarch vardo* can even follow an *[[Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Steed)|obsidian steed]]* during its *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* and *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]* powers.

Upon word of command, the vardo vanishes from the sight, sound and smell of those more than 30 feet away from it. 

The vardo has been magically hardened and its structure augmented; add +20 to the DC to break it. Its interior is warded as if by a *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell.

Upon word of command, a *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* appears as does a team of four quasi-real horse-like creatures (cf. *[[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]]*). These pull the vardo effortlessly over any hindering terrain and even allow it to fly.
