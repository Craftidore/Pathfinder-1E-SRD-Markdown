# Pearl of Power (6th)
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 17th

**Slot** —

**Price** 36,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells (clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). Once per day on command, a *pearl of power* enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a different level, 6th or lower).

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled

**Cost** 18,000 gp

**GM Note**

Taken from PF1 FAQ ([https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9n8m](https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9n8m)):

## ***Pearl of Power*: What is the caster level required to create this item?**
Though the listed **Caster Level** for a *pearl of power* is 17th, that caster level is not part of the **Requirements** listing for that item. Therefore, the only caster level requirement for a *pearl of power* is the character has to be able to cast spells of the desired level.

However, it makes sense that the minimum caster level of the pearl is the minimum caster level necessary to cast spells of that level--it would be strange for a 2nd-level pearl to be CL 1st.

For example, a 3rd-level wizard with [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] can create a 1st-level pearl, with a minimum caster level of 1. He can set the caster level to whatever he wants (assuming he can meet the crafting DC), though the pearl's caster level has no effect on its powers (other than its ability to resist *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*). If he wants to make a 2nd-level pearl, the caster level has to be at least 3, as wizards can't cast 2nd-level spells until they reach character level 3. He can even try to make a 3rd-level pearl, though the minimum caster level is 5, and he adds +5 to the DC because he doesn't meet the "able to cast 3rd-level spells" requirement.

Also note that there are numerous item crafting feats and even a couple of traits which affect the cost of crafting an item. These also should be used to calculate an item's cost.
