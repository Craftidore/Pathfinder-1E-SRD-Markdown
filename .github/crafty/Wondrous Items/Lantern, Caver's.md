Once activated by a command word, it burns continuously. While in darkness (magical or mundane), the possessor of the lantern can see as if it were brightly lit ( within the cone) though no light shines to the eyes of others (cf. *[[Darklight, Greater (Spell)|greater darklight]]*)*.* The *caver's lantern* burns for up to 12 hours a day and then shuts down for 8 hours.
