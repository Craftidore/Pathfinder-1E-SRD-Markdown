# Ioun Stone, marble sphere
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 6,500 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Rather than protect the person using it, this stone protects all *ioun stones* orbiting the character, including the *marble sphere ioun stone* itself. All affected *ioun stones* have double the normal hp and hardness, increasing to 20 hp and hardness 10, and are immune to shatter. In addition, the stones are affected as if by *[[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]]*, giving all attempts to strike or grasp them a 50% miss chance. An illusory glamour also switches the color of each stone to a different one, preventing knowledgeable opponents from identifying them. These defenses do not hinder the owner of the stones, who can snatch and identify each stone normally.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 3,250 gp

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 37

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This ioun stone continues to function (and affect other ioun stones its owner possesses) even when it (or they) have been implanted into the owner or joined with another item such as an *[[Ioun Ring|ioun ring]]* or *iounic bracer.*
