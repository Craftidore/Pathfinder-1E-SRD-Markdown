# Ioun Stone, powder blue sphere (The Master's Finch)
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** Legacy item

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

While this spherical powder blue ioun stone functions like others of its kind, it is actually a unique stone known as The Master’s Finch. This ioun stone has a personality similar to a trained finch that is a loyal and caring companion to its owner. It possesses all of the functionality of the aforementioned type of ioun stone, however it has additional functions that manifest themselves as the owner of the Master’s Finch reaches the levels indicated below.

At 3rd level, the ioun stone gains the ability to be teleported to areas outside the line of sight, as per the spell *[[Teleport Object (Spell)|teleport object]]*. It is still restricted to teleporting between its owner and those designated by its owner. The range of this ability is up to 2,000 miles from the owner. Also, its ability to relay information is increased to three separate messages, each up to 140 spoken words, and/or brief moving images. This teleportation is only capable of teleporting the ioun stone itself, and nothing or no one else.

At 6th level, the ioun stone gains the ability to project an illusion similar to those crafted a *[[Minor Image (Spell)|minor image]]* spell. This projection can also be done from orbit around its owner. For purposes of effect, range, and save the caster level of this spell is 20th.

At 9th level, the ioun stones ability to project an illusion becomes the equivalent of those crafted by *[[Major Image (Spell)|major image]]*.

At 12th level, the ioun stone is no longer restricted to people that have been designated by its owner, and can now be teleported to an area within 2,000 miles of its owner, and to people and places that the owner knows or have been, respectively.

At 15th level, the ioun stone gains the ability to teleport itself, its owner, and up to give additional willing creatures or objects, per the *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell. These creatures or objects must be touching the owner of the ioun stone, whom the ioun stone is currently in orbit of. 

**Lore**

*DC 5:* This is The Master’s Finch crafted for a druid who could not part with his animal companion, a blue-gray finch named Taes. It is a messenger ioun stone, similar to others of its color and shape, except that it has the spirit of the finch named Taes.

*DC 10:* The Master’s Finch possesses the intelligence of a trained bird and is a pleasant companion to have, not to mention useful. It is said that not only can this ioun stone relay messages, but it can cast illusions of various complexity if its owner is of stout capability and bearing.

*DC 15:* It is spoken that The Master’s Finch can teleport to places and people that its owner knows, and not just to members of their party, relaying messages or images as needed.

*DC 20:* Purportedly, The Master’s Finch also has the potential to teleport not only itself, but its owner and a small number of allies, as well.

*DC 25:* While The Master’s Finch has many abilities, it is told that each new ability came under the ownership of other than its original master. With each new master, in time, The Master’s Finch may gain new powers, either in addition to others, or in place of them.

**Destruction**

If an unfathomable secret is spoken into the master’s finch by a sphinx it will turn dull grey, and become forever useless.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** Legacy item
