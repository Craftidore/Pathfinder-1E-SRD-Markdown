# Carpet of Fortunate Passage
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

A lightweight carpet bearing a sunrise or animal motif, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is a great boon to travelers. Once per day, after the command word is spoken, the carpet may be unfurled across any space up to 150 feet across, creating a 10-foot wide path which lasts for 10 minutes. The path may support any weight and may even take the form of a spiral stair for tight quarters.

If the space to be bridged is greater than 150 feet, the carpet fails to activate.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *shadow step*

**Cost** 6,000 gp

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 121
