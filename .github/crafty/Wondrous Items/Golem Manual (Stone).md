# Golem Manual (Stone)
## Overview
**Aura** strong abjuration and enchantment; **CL** 14th

**Slot** —

**Price** 22,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

A golem manual contains information, incantations, and magical power that help a character to craft a golem (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem’s body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem.

The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem’s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book’s ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.

*Stone Golem Manual:* The book contains *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas/quest]], [[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]], [[Polymorph Any Object (Spell)|polymorph any object]],* and *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]*. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be caster level 14th, *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]], [[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas/quest]], [[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]], [[Symbol of Stunning (Spell)|symbol of stunning]]*

**Cost** 11,000 gp
