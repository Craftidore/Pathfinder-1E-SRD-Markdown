# Rug of Safe Haven
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation\* (see description); **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 7 lbs.

**Description**

A small, 3-foot by 5-foot area rug, woven with a tree motif or a tasseled fringe, this item does not radiate magic when detected, as per *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]*. However, when the command word is spoken and an edge of the carpet is lifted, an entrance to an extra-dimensional space becomes accessible, as per *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]].* This space remains in existence as long as a creature occupies it, and cannot be used to store unattended goods. A creature inside the space may utilize the rug as a trap door at any time while it lies flat.

The same extra-dimensional space is accessed no matter where the rug lies. If someone within the extra-dimensional space wishes to escape the rolled rug, they must succeed against a 17 CMD while trying to open the trapdoor inside the space. Success indicates the escapee is spit out and arrives prone, adjacent to the bearer of the rolled rug. If the rug is being actively held shut, use the possessor’s CMD.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]], [[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp
