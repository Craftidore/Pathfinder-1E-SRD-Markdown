# Ioun Stone, clear spindle (flawed) (alt)
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 1,260 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Although this stone appears at first glance to be a *[[Ioun Stone, clear spindle|clear spindle ioun stone]]*, a DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] or [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] check reveals that it contains tiny air bubbles. Not only does this stone fail to sustain its user without food or water as a normal *[[Ioun Stone, clear spindle|clear spindle ioun stone]]* would, but it also prevents its user from being nourished by any food or drink consumed.

The item is not cursed and can be removed normally. However, the stone has an unexpected magical corollary that gives the user a +3 resistance bonus to saves versus disease and ingested poison. Although users cannot be nourished by normal food and drink, they can still use spells or items that nourish them, such as a *[[Ioun Stone, clear spindle|clear spindle ioun stone]]*. Negating the stone’s starvation and thirst in this way comes at a cost, though, as doing so creates a magical resonance that has a 10% chance per day of destroying the *[[Ioun Stone, clear spindle (flawed)|flawed clear spindle ioun stone]]*.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 630 gp
