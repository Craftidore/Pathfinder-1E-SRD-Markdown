# Wand Bracelet
## Overview
**Aura** moderate tranmutation (DC 18); **CL** 13th

**Slot** wrist

**Price** 12,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

*This golden chain bracelet has a number of small metal objects hanging from it like charms.*

A *wand bracelet* can store up to four items, which appear as charms along the bracelet. You can grab one of the charms from the bracelet as a swift (manipulation) action, causing it to appear in your hand.

If you have an item in hand, you can use a move (manipulation) action to store the item in the bracelet or to switch a held item for a stored item by touching the item to the charm representing the stored item. Storing an item causes it to shrink down and appear as a charm hanging from the bracelet. Any item stored can weigh no more than 3 pounds and must be able to be held in one hand, such as a wand or a light weapon. Only the wearer of the bracelet is able to retrieve or store items.

**Lore:** The name *wand bracelet* describes the most common use of this item. Originally designed to hold small keepsakes as charms, and crafted to be appropriate for formal gatherings, *wand bracelets* have found popularity among artificers who favor spell trigger devices ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 15).

These bracelets are also sometimes known as *assassins’ charms,* because small weapons can easily be concealed within them ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 20).

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]*

**Cost** 6,000 gp
