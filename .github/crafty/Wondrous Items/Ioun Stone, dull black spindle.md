**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone appears as pure, dull black at all times, even in the presence of bright light. The user is granted darkvision to a distance of 60 ft. as well as low-light vision. They can see through non-magical fog, mist, and smoke without penalty to a distance of 60 ft. The user is also immune to being [[Dazzled|dazzled]], such as by light sensitivity or the spell *[[Flare (Spell)|flare]]*.
