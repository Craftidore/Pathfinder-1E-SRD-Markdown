**Description**

This potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.

A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if [[Pinned|pinned]]) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. *Iron bands of binding* are usable once per day.
