# Well of Many Worlds
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** —

**Price** 82,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily—it is a two-way portal.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]*

**Cost** 41,000 gp

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 532
