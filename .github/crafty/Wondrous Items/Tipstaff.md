# Tipstaff
## Overview
**Aura** minor enchantment; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 6,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

This short, ebony baton, equivalent to a Small club, has a cord-wrapped handle and silver-capped tip bearing the seal of Zobeck. To the uninitiated, this appears as a heavy-duty truncheon, but the Watch use them to ambush and immobilize enemies. After a successful attack or touch attack, as a free action, the wielder may say the command word to expend a charge and target their opponent with *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]*, 1/day (lasts 3 rounds, DC 13 Will save negates). An officially-issued warrant slipped under the cords of the grip adds a +2 to the save DC for persons named in the warrant. A tipstaff may have only one warrant on it at a time, naming no more than three people. A tipstaff has 50 charges when first constructed and provides a +2 equipment bonus to CMB to initiate or maintain a grapple. It cannot be recharged outside of [[Blue House]], but an ‘empty’ tipstaff retains its CMB bonus. The Watch works vigorously to keep these items out of private hands.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]*, craft (woodwork) 3 ranks

**Cost** 3,000 gp
