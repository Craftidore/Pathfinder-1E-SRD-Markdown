# Ioun Stone, pale yellow cabochon
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 250 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This simple stone glows brightly, shedding light equal to a sunrod (30 ft. of bright illumination, 60 ft. of shadowy illumination). It ceases glowing when not in orbit around a character’s head. 

The magical light from this *ioun stone* counters or dispels any darkness spell of second level or lower.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 125gp

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 37

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Changed from pale yellow prism to pale yellow cabochon to avoid duplication.
