# Stalker's Flet
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 144,000 gp

**Weight** 50 lbs (when collapsed).

**Description**

When the command word is spoken while standing next to any tree whose trunk is 5 feet in diameter and which is at least 30 feet high, it causes this ordinary appearing bundle of small, 5 foot long planks, canvas and rope to transform into a flet at least 20 feet above the ground. This ordinary-looking, windowless tent sits on a wooden plank floor  with a wooden trapdoor set within and covers a 30 feet by 30 feet area. The platform and camouflaged canvas tent encircles the trunk of the tree and any distance of more than 50 feet, the flet is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 50 feet is entitled to a DC 30 [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check to spot the hidden flet as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape. 

The temperature inside the flet is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. For every degree the exterior temperature is below 0° or above 100°, the interior temperature decreases or increases, respectively, by 1°. The flet also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The flet withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force causes it to collapse and transform back into a bundle of small planks, canvas and rope resting at the base of the tree.

When erected around a tree whose trunk is more than 5 feet in diameter at the height of the flet a small (5 foot) natural cavity forms behind a concealed ([[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] DC 20 to notice) seam in the trunk which can be accessed via a second command word. This cavity can only be accessed from the outside and only has enough air to sustain a Medium creature for 2 hours. A *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* *[[Find Traps (Spell)|find traps]]**,* or *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* spell automatical locates the seam but does not provide the word necessary to open it.

The flet can be set up and/or taken down up to 3 times per week, requiring 10 minutes to erect or dismantle. If the flet is dismantled while foreign objects or creatures are still inside they immediately spill out, falling to the ground below.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]]*, *[[Tiny Hut (Spell)|tiny hut]]*

**Cost** 72,000 gp

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

There are several possible modifications to the *flet* that are possible and even desirable.

Adding an *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell (or any of its variants) to the construction requirements can make it much more secure.

Adding a *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* spell to the construction requirements reduces the flet's size to 3 and 1/2 inches and its weight to less than an ounce.

Adding a *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]* spell to the construction requirements causes a knotted rope reaching to the ground to appear any time the trapdoor is opened. This rope disappears when the trapdoor is closed.

Making any of these additions causes the value of the *flet* to increase.
