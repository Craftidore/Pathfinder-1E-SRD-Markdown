# Strand of Prayer Beads
## Overview
**Aura** moderate or strong (many schools); **CL** 5th (healing), 7th (smiting), 9th (karma)

**Slot** —

**Price** 45,800 gp gp

**Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand’s special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list.


| **Special Bead Type** | **Special Bead Ability** |
|---|---|
| *Bead of healing* | Wearer can cast his choice of *[[Cure Serious Wounds (Spell)\|cure serious wounds]]**,* *[[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)\|remove blindness/deafness]]**,* or *[[Remove Disease (Spell)\|remove disease]]**.* |
| *Bead of karma* | Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. |
| *Bead of smiting* | Wearer can cast *[[Chaos Hammer (Spell)\|chaos hammer]]**,* *[[Holy Smite (Spell)\|holy smite]]**,* *[[Order's Wrath (Spell)\|order’s wrath]]**,* or *[[Unholy Blight (Spell)\|unholy blight]]* (Will DC 17 partial). |

A *strand of prayer beads* has a *bead of healing*, a *bead of karma*, and a *bead of smiting*. 

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the *bead of summons*, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The *beads of blessing, smiting,* and *wind walking* function as spell trigger items; the *beads of karma* and *summons* can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the *strand of prayer beads* in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a *strand of prayer bead*s that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: *bead of blessing* –600 gp, *bead of healing* –9,000 gp, *bead of karma* –20,000 gp, *bead of smiting* –16,800 gp, *bead of summons* –20,000 gp, *bead of wind walking* –46,800 gp.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], one of the following spells per bead, as appropriate: *[[Cure Serious Wounds (Spell)|cure serious wounds]]**,* *[[Remove Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|remove blindness/ deafness]]**,* or *[[Remove Disease (Spell)|remove disease]]* (healing); *[[Righteous Might (Spell)|righteous might]]* (karma); *[[Chaos Hammer (Spell)|chaos hammer]]**,* *[[Holy Smite (Spell)|holy smite]]**,* *[[Order's Wrath (Spell)|order’s wrath]]**,* or *[[Unholy Blight (Spell)|unholy blight]]* (smiting)
