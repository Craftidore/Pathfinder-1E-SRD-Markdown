# Crystal Cabinet

**Description**

This ordinary looking wooden and glass booth is much more than its simple appearance implies. The *crystal cabinet's* true appearance is that of a shimmering crystalline structure 12 feet tall, 8 feet wide and 4 feet deep. Its outer walls and door are made of 2 inches thick [[Obdurium|obdurium]] which has been magically augmented using *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]**,* then hardened using *[[Hardening, Greater (Spell)|greater hardening]]* and then finally transformed into *[[Crysteel (Spell)|crysteel]]* using the spell of the same name. This has resulted in *crysteeled* [[Obdurium|obdurium]], which has a hardness of 80 and 120 hit points per inch with a Break DC of 100. The outer size and appearance of the *crystal cabinet* is highly morphic: it can appear as a simple rock 3 feet tall and 3 feet in circumference with a 2 1/2 foot tall cleft with a hairline crack running down one side to a large wooden armoire with two wooden doors with shiny brass handles to simple wood and stone booth that might be found along side any road collecting tolls to a small tidy little ship. No matter its appearance, its actual material substance is always *crysteeled* [[Obdurium|obdurium]]; the outermost veneer is all that actually changes.

The *crystal cabinet* changes to blend in with its surroundings and this is directed and controlled by its own intelligence and perceptions of those surroundings. As the physical veneer of the *crystal cabinet* alters itself, powerful illusions cloak it also making it extremely hard to discern as anything out of the ordinary ([[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] DC 45 then Will save DC 35 must be physically interacted with).

The door to the *crystal cabinet* (no matter its appearance) is always sealed with a *[[Arcane Seal, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane seal]]* whose conditions are decided by its own intelligence in conjunction with its present master. This door has never been breached. All attempts to bypass the door or go through the walls of the crystal cabinet using teleportation magicks (cf. *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**,* *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]**,* etc.) or interdimensional travel (cf. *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]*), as well as by going ethereal (cf. *[[Etherealness (Spell)|etherealness]]*) result in the trespasser being redirected to one of several special cells that are extremely difficult to extricate one's self from.

The door may be opened only by its owner (using his voice or by his key), others using copies of the master key given to them by the *crystal cabinet's* owner or by the *crystal cabinet* itself. No matter what the external environment is, the interior of the *crystal cabinet* is never affected by it nor does it enter in when door is opened (ie. water will no enter if the *crystal cabinet* should appear at the bottom of an ocean and its door be opened, etc.). The door opens into an extradimensional space known as the console room.

**The Console Room**

This large octagonal chamber is walled in large (12 ft. x 12 ft.) mirrored octagons and is over 80 feet across and 40 feet high. In the center of the chamber is a 4 foot high octagonal control surface. This crystalline construct is made up of hundreds of various colored crystals. Touching a crystal (or more often, a series of them) controls various functions withing the *crystal cabinet.* Above the control surface is a large holographical representation of wherever the *orrey of worlds* is presently focused. This holograph also morphs into a vaguely feminine face of faintly glowing silvery blue. This is how Krystalle, the controlling intelligence of the *crystal cabinet,* most frequently manifests itself, though its true form is that of a ghostly sapphire great wyrm.

Each of the mirrored octagonal wall section can act as doorway into a specific area within the *crystal cabinet.* Some are smaller extradimensional spaces while others are full blown demiplanes.

**The Construction Hall**

Immediately opposite the entrance into the *crystal cabinet,* on the far side of the control surface is the mirrored octagon that leads to the construction hall. Within is a small demiplane that resembles a vast (24 ft tall x 36 ft wide by 500 ft long) workshop. Along its sides are areas for magical construction. Each of these areas is similar to a *[[Portable Room|portable room]]* of the same focus.

**The Healing Hall**

The temperature in this small chamber is always a balmy 72 degrees and its lighting is indirect and just slightly dimmer than normal. In it are several normal beds and linen. At the far end, opposite each other are a *[[Bier of Resurrection (WondArch)|bier of resurrection]]* and a *[[Bed of Restoration (WondArch)|bed of restoration]]*.

**The Scriptorium**

This library and scriptorium are where the master of the *crystal cabinet* keeps all of its major written works. In a small niche in the north end of it is an *[[Autoscribe|autoscribe]]**.*

The Vivarium

The mirrored octagon that opens onto the Vivarium is located to the right of the Construction Hall. This chamber is actually a demiplane within the Crystal Cabinet. It is believed that the cabinet's creator used a *[[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]]* spell in conjunction with a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell to form it within the Cabinet. It is not connected to any other plane or place save the Console Room of the Cabinet.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]**,* *[[Create Sanctum Sanctorum (Spell)|create sanctum sanctorum]]**,* *[[Crysteel (Spell)|crysteel]]**,* *[[Arcane Seal, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane seal]]**,* *[[Hardening, Greater (Spell)|greater hardening]]**,* *[[Plane Shift, Greater (Spell)|greater plane shift]]**,* *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]**,* *[[Mirror of All Worlds (Spell)|mirror of all worlds]]**,* *[[Planar Bastion (Spell)|planar bastion]]**,* *[[Polymorph Any Object (Spell)|polymorph any object]]**,* *[[Programmed Image (Spell)|programmed image]]**, ,* *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]**, teleport lair, teleport trap,*
