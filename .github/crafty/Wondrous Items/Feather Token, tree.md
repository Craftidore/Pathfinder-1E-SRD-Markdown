# Feather Token, tree
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 400 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed—even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance.

*Tree*: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Major Creation (Spell)|major creation]]*

**Cost** 200 gp

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 512
