# Airship, Folding
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** —

**Price** 220,500 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

A *folding airship* looks like a small wooden puzzle box carved from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] and about 4 inches on each side when it is inactive. When the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a [[Theurgeme|theurgeme]] 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet in depth. 

Within the [[Theurgeme|theurgeme]] is an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

A second word of command causes the airship to fold itself into a cube once again, but only when it is unoccupied by living creatures (except for those in the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|magnificent mansion]]* section).

A significant part of the cost of the construction of a *folding airship* is that each comes with a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]* built into the ship's hull. This is why the requirements include the spells *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* and *[[Suspension (Spell)|suspension]]**.*

### Folding Airship (Theurgeme)
![[Folding Airship.png|Folding Airship (Theurgeme)|300]]

The theurgeme airship is a vessel powered by magic. Without sails or rowers it moves swiftly and tirelessly across the sky. This theurgeme is powered by a magical device known as a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]*. The *theurgeme airship* is luxuriously appointed with comfortable cabins and exotic décor, as befits the wealthy wizard who owns such a vessel.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The command words for such vessels is often some variant of their name and can be frequently found carved onto the box somewhere.  A favorite of some GMs is to use *[[Illusory Script (Spell)|illusory script]]* for the command words; doing so adds that spell to the requirements for construction and increases the price to 7,500 gp. Another often used is to make the command words invisible and/or to place them on the underside of a sliding lid. 

*House Rule:* There are rumored to be other, larger variants of the *folding airship*; some of which use the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell as a part of their construction. Such a *folding airship* would have increased storage capacity, even when folded. 

A significant part of the cost of the construction of a *folding airship* is that each comes with a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]* built into the ship's hull. This is why the Requirements includes the spells *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* and *[[Suspension (Spell)|suspension]]**.*

The cost of the *folding airship* is decreased by 30% due to it having only one ship (shape) rather than two.
