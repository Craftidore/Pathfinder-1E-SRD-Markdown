# Apparatus of the Crab
## Overview
**Aura** strong evocation and transmutation; **CL** 19th

**Slot** —

**Price** 90,000 gp

**Weight** 500 lbs.

**Description**

At first glance, an inactive *apparatus of the crab* appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus’s movements and actions.


| **Lever (1d10)** | **Lever Function** |
|---|---|
| 1 | Extend/retract legs and tail |
| 2 | Uncover/cover forward porthole |
| 3 | Uncover/cover side portholes |
| 4 | Extend/retract pincers and feelers |
| 5 | Snap pincers |
| 6 | Move forward/backward |
| 7 | Turn left/right |
| 8 | Open/close “eyes” with *[[Continual Flame (Spell)\|continual flame]]* inside |
| 9 | Rise/sink in water |
| 10 | Open/close hatch |

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.

When active, an *apparatus of the crab* has the following characteristics: **hp** 200; **hardness** 15; **Spd** 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; **AC** 20 (–1 size, +11 natural); **Attack** 2 pincers +12 melee (2d8); **CMB** +14; **CMD** 24.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]**,* *[[Continual Flame (Spell)|continual flame]]**,* creator must have 8 ranks in [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (engineering)

**Cost** 45,000 gp
