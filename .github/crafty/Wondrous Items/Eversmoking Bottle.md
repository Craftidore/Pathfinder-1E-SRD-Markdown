# Eversmoking Bottle
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 5,400 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This metal urn is identical in appearance to an *[[Efreeti Bottle|efreeti bottle]]*, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered. 

The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]]*

**Cost** 2,700 gp
