# Ship in a Bottle, warship
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 18th

**Slot** —

**Price** 75,000gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

*Inside this clear glass bottle is a meticulously-crafted model ship.*

When you lay a *ship in a bottle* upon the water and speak the command word, the bottle becomes filmy and pliable, eventually vanishing as the ship inside grows into a full-sized craft after 1 minute. There are four known varieties: the keelboat, sailing ship, warship, and galley. When the command word is again spoken, the vessel shrinks and returns to its sealed bottle form. Any creature on board the ship is shunted aside as the vessel shrinks. Cargo and nonliving matter on board are shrunk along with the vessel, and the entirety of the bottled ship is held in stasis—food does not spoil, wood does not rot, and even the brass stays polished.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*

**Cost** 32,500 gp

**Source:** Freeport Companion (Green Ronin), pg. 71

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* A ship (magical or mundane) is put into the bottle initially by striking the ship with the bottle as the command word is spoken. Once a ship has been keyed to the bottle, it may only be unkeyed by speaking the command word backwards. A bottle may only be keyed once a year to a new ship. A ship may only be keyed to a bottle if it is unoccupied by any creatures having an Intelligence of 3 or higher.

The costs above reflect only the cost of the bottle, not the ship inside. Adjust the total cost for a *ship in the bottle* to include any vessel found within if discovered with a ship inside. The costs above for the specific type ships found within a *ship in a bottle* reflect their size (not only their specific type). It is rumored there are other *ship in a bottles* that can affect other types (and sizes) of vessels.
