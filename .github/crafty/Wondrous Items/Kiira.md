# Kiira
## Overview
**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 11th

**Slot** —

**Price** 7,500 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

These smooth hemispherical precious stones are known by their elven name, which means “lore gem.” While more powerful versions of these items known as *greater kiira* exist, those date to the empire of Cormanthor, can only be used by elves of particular families, and risk causing madness and feeblemindedness in those not of the proper bloodline and without the necessary intelligence. The *kiira* that can be found in the world are weaker but safer versions of these devices.

The *kiira* is worn on the forehead (it affixes itself if placed there and can be removed easily by its wearer). It allows its wearer to better focus her mind and memory, allowing her to better remember information. In game terms, this results in a +2 competence bonus on all [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] skill checks, though the wearer must spend a full round of contemplation to gain this bonus.

Furthermore, a *kiira* acts as a spellbook, allowing a wizard (or any other spellcaster who requires a spellbook) to record spells into and prepare spells from a *kiira* as if it were a spellbook (holding up to thirty spells of any levels), requiring the normal amount of time and expense. While a newly created *kiira* is empty of spells, a *kiira* recovered as part of a treasure hoard is likely to have spells recorded within it at the DM’s option. If so, the value of the item should increase as if it were a spellbook.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]]*,* *[[Legend Lore (Spell)|legend lore]]**,* *[[Secret Page (Spell)|secret page]]*

**Cost** 3,750 pg

**Source:** Magic of Faerun (WotC), pg. 162

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** Removed the head slot prerequisite.

The racial restrictions on wearing a *kiira* can bypassed with a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 35, not the usual DC 25 to emulate a race). This must be done each time the *kiira* is removed and then placed back on. 

*Kiira* may be further enchanted using the normal rules.
