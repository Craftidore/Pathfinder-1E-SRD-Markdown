# Airship, Folding (Scales)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** —

**Price** 220,500 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

A *folding airship* looks like a small wooden puzzle box carved from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] (which has been soaked in *[[Unguent of Timelessness|unguent of timelessness]]*; giving the puzzle box and the *folding airship* itself a +1 resistance bonus to all saving throws and causing it to age only one day for each year that passes) and about 4 inches on each side when it is inactive. When the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a [[Theurgeme|theurgeme]] 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet in depth. 

Within the [[Theurgeme|theurgeme]] is an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

A second word of command causes the airship to fold itself into a cube once again, but only when it is unoccupied by living creatures (except for those in the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|magnificent mansion]]* section).

A significant part of the cost of the construction of a *folding airship* is that each comes with a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]* built into the ship's hull. This is why the requirements include the spells *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* and *[[Suspension (Spell)|suspension]]**.*

### Scales' folding airhip
![[folding airship 2.jpg|Scales' folding airhip|300]]
[[folding airship 2.jpg|open outside]]

The theurgeme airship is a vessel powered by magic. Without sails or rowers it moves swiftly and tirelessly across the sky. This theurgeme is powered by a magical device known as a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]*. The *theurgeme airship* is luxuriously appointed with comfortable cabins and exotic décor, as befits the wealthy wizard who owns such a vessel.

A small writing desk is nearby (actually this an [[Autoscribe|autoscribe]]) with the following spells: *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]], [[Create Demiplane, Greater (Spell)|create greater demiplane]], [[Genesis (Spell)|genesis]], [[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]],* ).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The command words for such vessels is often some variant of their name and can be frequently found carved onto the box somewhere.  A favorite of some GMs is to use *[[Illusory Script (Spell)|illusory script]]* for the command words; doing so adds that spell to the requirements for construction and increases the price to 7,500 gp. Another often used is to make the command words invisible and/or to place them on the underside of a sliding lid. 

*House Rule:* There are rumored to be other, larger variants of the *folding airship*; some of which use the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell as a part of their construction. Such a *folding airship* would have increased storage capacity, even when folded.

A significant part of the cost of the construction of a *folding airship* is that each comes with a *[[Skyhelm|skyhelm]]* built into the ship's hull. This is why the Requirements includes the spells *[[Fly (Skill)|fly]]* and *[[Suspension (Spell)|suspension]]**.*

The cost of the *folding airship* is decreased by 30% due to it having only one ship (shape) rather than two.

**Mk II**

The second round of construction for *Scale's folding airship* was completed a month after its initial construction. All wooden portions of the *folding airship* were transmuted from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] to *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* and then the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* was changed into colored *[[Crysteel (Spell)|crysteel]]*. Afterwards, a *[[Hardening, Greater (Spell)|greater hardening]]* spell was used to increase the hardness of the *folding airship's* decks, hull, and structural members. Cost: 32,000 gp

**Mk III**

Starting on the first day of the new year, Scales began adding the *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* ability (cf. *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* spell) (3 times/day) to his folding airship at a cost of 84,000 gp (*[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* and *[[Cynosure (Spell)|cynosure]]* spells). Price: 306,000 gp

Conjuration (teleportation); Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will negates; Spell Resistance: Yes; CL 17

You move yourself and the contents of your entire ship to another plane of existence. When you begin using this ability, a fog descends about the vessel, and clears within a minute. The ship always appears on above 500 feet a body of water large enough for the ship to sit in safely, unless the destination plane has no body of water large enough to hold the ship, in which case the ship simply materializes 500 feet above the largest city available. If the destination plane is one that possesses an ocean, the ship automatically appears there. 

Note that this ability does not grant the ship or its inhabitants any ability to survive on the destination plane—the ship simply appears in the plane above a body of water (or, in the case of planes that are made up of nothing but water, in the water). 

Any characters or creatures aboard unwilling to move to the new plane are entitled to a Will saving throw to resist the effect, but might find themselves floating in the water when the ship vanishes from around them.

Note that this ability can only be activated by wizards.

Scales also enchanted his ship to have the ability to hide it and those aboard from the perception of others three times per day by adding the *[[Cloak Ship (Spell)|cloak ship]]* ability (cf. *[[Cloak Ship (Spell)|cloak ship]]* spell) at a cost of 35,000 gp. Price: 225,000 gp.

**[[Cloak Ship (Spell)|Cloak Ship]]**

Illusion (glamer); Duration: 12 hours; Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with); Spell Resistance: No; CL 12

You make the area around your ship invisible (cf *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* spell). Creatures more than 30 feet from your ship cannot sense any activity going on inside the area—they cannot smell cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those onboard your ship can see out normally. Once a creature comes within 30 feet of your ship, it can see everything in and around the ship normally. Unlike *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, a cloaked ship is not given away by the appearance of apparently displaced water, fog, or mist since the power of the illusion makes the area occupied by the ship appear as its surroundings. The *[[Cloak Ship (Spell)|cloak ship]]* spell does not prevent detection by magical means such as *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]**,* *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*.

An individual aboard a ship cloaked by this illusion may attack freely, but doing so removes the invisibility effect of this spell with regard to him (and only him). The round in which he attacks he treats his target as if it were [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

Note that this ability can only be activated by wizards.

Spells to consider:

*[[Detect Ship (Spell)|Detect ship]]*

DETECT SHIP 

Divination; Duration: 1 day (D);  Saving Throw: None

You gain the ability to discern the presence of ships around you while grasping the Gift's wheel. You perceive ships located within a distance of 20 miles, regardless of current visibility (or even whether or not they are beyond the horizon). You need not be seeking them to become aware that they are there. Exactly what can be ascertained depends on whether the ships in question are within sight or not yet visible. 

Not Visible: You sense only the presence of ships other than your own in the area. A DC 15 Profession (sailor) check allows you to determine the number, direction, and range to each new ship you sense. If you sense a ship’s direction and range, you continue to be aware of this information until the other ship is no longer in range of the spell. 

Within Sight: If a ship is actually within sight, you can gain additional information by studying the vessel for 1 round. You need not be able to see the vessel clearly—a spot on the horizon is sufficient. A Profession (sailor) check gives you information about the ship or ships: 


| **Check Result** | **Information** |
|---|---|
| 10 | Type of ship |
| 12 | Course, speed, and time to intercept (if possible) |
| 15 | What kind of weaponry the ship is carrying |
| 18 | Ship’s name |
| 20 | Any signs of allegiance (pirate flags, symbols of nation of origin, etc.) |
| 25 | Port of call of the sighted ship |

This power cannot penetrate illusions. 

*[[Disguise Ship (Spell)|Disguise ship]]*

DISGUISE SHIP 

Illusion (Glamer); Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with) 

You cloak the ship in illusion, making it appear as a ship of another type of your choice. You can choose what it appears as down to small details such as what weaponry it bears and what flags it is flying. You can make the ship to be any other water-going vessel, though it cannot seem to be more than 50% smaller or larger. Creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance, nor are their possessions. 

*Pacify Storm (Seas of Blood)*

Planar adaptation

ADAPTATION 

Transmutation; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None 

Upon activating this power you must select a plane. The ship now grants immunity to the selected plane's negative or harmful environmental effects, including such things as toxic air, temperature extremes, lack of air, or any other planar trait otherwise harmful to anyone in contact with the ship. This ability has no effect when used on the native Plane of the person activating it. 

*Power craft*

POWER CRAFT 

Transmutation; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None 

You provide a source of locomotion for your ship. The ship can move at any speed up to its normal maximum speed as if it had a natural source of locomotion. Thus, your ship moves as if powered by a favorable wind. Prevailing conditions—wind, currents, and so on—affect movement normally. Thus, this power cannot move your ship against a gale-force wind. 

*Repair ship (Seas of Blood)*

*[[Stormrunner's Ward (Spell)|Stormrunner's ward]]*

*Submersion*

SUBMERGE SHIP 

Evocation \[Water]; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None

Grasping the Gift's wheel, you invoke this power and immediately you feel connected to it, knowing the intricate details of its construction. You sense an invisible aura surrounding the ship and permeating its every space. Although it seems to be riding lower in the water than its weight would suggest, you instinctively know that you can control its every movement. You grant the ship touched a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to move beneath the surface of the water. You can control the ship’s speed and direction as a free action. All interior spaces of the ship remain dry even if a doorway or porthole is open while the ship is underwater. Any creature aboard the ship when the spell is cast can move about the ship with ease (including climbing and jumping) as if it were afloat on a calm sea. Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement. 

You can transfer control of the ship to another individual by having that individual take over the ship's wheel. Someone must have control of the ship's wheel at all times or the magic ends. 

Once the magic ends (either because the duration expired, the wheel becomes unattended, or the magic was successfully dispelled), the magic lingers for 10 rounds. During this time, the ship ascends toward the water’s surface at a rate of 60 feet per round. If the ship is still underwater when this additional time runs out, it immediately sinks, and its passengers risk drowning. 

*Teleport Ship (Seas of Blood)*
