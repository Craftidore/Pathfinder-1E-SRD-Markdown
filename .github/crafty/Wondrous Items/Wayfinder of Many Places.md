# Wayfinder of Many Places
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 18th

**Slot** none

**Price** 75,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The Wayfinder of Many Places behaves like a normal wayfinder, allowing it to shine (as the *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell) on command and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to avoid getting lost. However, it is much more versatile (and powerful) than a normal wayfinder.

When the cover of the Wayfinder of Many Places is slid open, it reveals two concentric gear-like wheels; one set within the other. Evenly spaced around the face of the outer (fixed) [[Mithral|mithral]] ring are 24 small (16th of inch in size) indentations. An ioun stone may be placed in this small indentation by holding it against it and saying a command word; doing so causes the stone to shrink in size until it fits snugly within. Once slotted in an indentation, a stone may only be replaced by another stone and doing so causes it to turn a dull gray and then fade into nothingness; it may not be removed without destruction, even by magics a powerful as *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spells.

Once a stone has been slotted into an indentation on the outer wheel, it may be attuned to a specific location by touching it and speaking a second command word. Once so attuned to a location, it cannot be changed; only reattuned to a new stone in that slot. Once per day on command, a Wayfinder of Many Places may use an attuned ioun stone to create a 5-to-20-foot-diameter gateway, similiar to the spell *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]*. The exact destination depends on where the individual stone is attuned to. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the gateway may be dispelled before that.
