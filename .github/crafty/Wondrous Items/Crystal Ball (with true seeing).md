# Crystal Ball (with true seeing)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 80,000 gp

**Weight** 7 lbs.

**Description**

This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

This more advanced form of crystal ball has an additional power that allows the user to use *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* (as the spell) on the target viewed.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*

**Cost** 40,000 gp
