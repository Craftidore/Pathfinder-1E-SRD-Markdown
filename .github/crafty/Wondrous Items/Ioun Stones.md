# Ioun Stones
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** varies

**Weight** —

These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time.

Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. 

Moderate varied; CL 12th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level. 

**CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS**

[[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level; Cost half the market price

## Advanced Ioun Stones
**Advanced Ioun Stones**

Most ioun stones use the normal pricing rules for magic items; the major difference is that they all use the ×2 modifier for not using a magic item space on the body. For example, figuring out the price of upgrading a *[[Ioun Stone, deep red sphere|deep red sphere ioun stone]]* from a +2 enhancement bonus to a +4 enhancement bonus is just a matter of using the formula (bonus squared × 1,000 gp × 2), which gives a final price of 32,000 gp; the difference between that and the standard item cost of 8,000 gp is 24,000 gp, so a qualified character with the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feat can upgrade the stone by spending half that amount (12,000 gp) in materials.

## Facts About Ioun Stones
**Facts About Ioun Stones**

Ioun stones only float when sent spinning around the head of an intelligent (Int 3+) creature; otherwise they are as inert as common stone. They have no effect on animals, mindless constructs, and other non-sentient creatures; comatose intelligent creatures and those with significant Intelligence damage or drain cannot use ioun stones. An ioun stone has no particular affinity for the living—intelligent undead and the rare intelligent construct can make full use of them.

Despite their ability to float, ioun stones cannot support more than their own weight. They cannot be used to anchor ropes or support creatures. An ioun stone must be able to orbit freely around a creature’s head (or placed in a specialized matrix like a wayfinder) for its power to be active. Creatures without heads usually cannot use ioun stones. The orbit of an ioun stone reflects the thoughts and emotions of its owner; particularly intense emotions have been known to reverse a stone’s orbit or even momentarily stop it in its path.

Ioun stones in orbit never collide with other stones or creatures by chance, and automatically change course to avoid any obstacles in their path. This in large part explains the difficulty of striking an ioun stone in battle. An ioun stone in orbit counts as an attended object, and benefits from any magical protections possessed by its owner.

The shape of an ioun stone can help classify it and thus its powers; the first step is recognizing what each of the shapes means. Cabochon and spherical stones are usually smooth and the others are usually faceted.

**Cabochon:** A convex top with a flat bottom. Most are elliptical or tear-shaped. Shaped and polished as opposed to faceted.

**Disk:** A flat circle, typically convex on both sides but sometimes in a lens-like shape.

**Ellipsoid:** An elongated sphere, sometimes tapering at one end to a tear-like shape.

**Nodule:** Asymmetrical but generally rounded.

**Pentacle:** A type of disk, but with five sides rather than being round. The sides are usually straight rather than curved.

**Prism:** A long stone where the top and bottom ends have the same number of sides (such as a hexagram). The width and angle of each side is usually the same as all other sides.

**Pyramid:** A cone-like shape with a point at one end, a flat base, and long facets connecting the two. Typical pyramids have three or four-sided bases, but some have a dozen or more.

**Rhomboid:** A type of prism with sides of unequal widths or angles, giving it a flattened cross section.

**Sphere:** Essentially round in all dimensions.

**Spindle:** A kind of prism with 10 or more sides, giving it a nearly round cross section.

**Trillian:** A type of disk, but with three sides (either straight or curved outward) rather than being round.

Creating an ioun that grants the abilities of a feat requires that the creator have access to the feat (either by having it as personal feat or through any number of spells which allow the caster to access the skills and abilities (feats) of another who does. It costs 5,000 gp to enchant the stone (giving a sale price of 10,000 gp) and otherwise follows the normal rules for enchanting an item. Adding secondary feats with a prerequisite feat requires that each prerequisite feat be paid for (5,000 gp); each prerequisite feat is then granted as well as the secondary feat.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The reason for the Charisma check after fasting to implant an ioun stone goes back to Cha being the ability that modifies [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]]; many GMs prefer to use Constitution instead of this as a house rule since it is a surgical procedure.

*Note:* Many of those who seek to implant ioun stones usually begin with a [[Ioun Stone, clear ellipsoid|clear ellipsoid ioun stone]] (which sustains a creature in any environment without food, water, or air) since this makes the necessary fasting checks irrelevant.

*Note:* It is rumored (and true at the GM's discretion) that implanting ioun stones in the owner's chakra points can allow resonance powers just as if the various ioun stones were each in a wayfinder. Otherwise, the same effect may be obtained using the *[[Ioun Circuit (Spell)|ioun circuit]]* spell.

*Note:* Unless a given ioun stone's description states otherwise, all ioun stones are 1 inch in size. Some crafty spellcasters have been known to use *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* and then *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spells (at a cost of 7,500 gp per each stone) on their ioun stones making them much more difficult to hit (AC changes from 24 to 40; from Fine to Miniscule \[ie., 1/16th of an inch]). A very few magical crafters have been known to incorporate the *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* spell as a part of their crafting process (at an additional cost of 2,500 gp to the stone's price) resulting in a stone that is little more than a tiny jeweled mote barely visible to the naked eye as it orbits its owner ([[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check DC 45).

*Note:* Here are the known shapes of the various ioun stones: anhedron, briolette (faceted pear shape), cabochon, cone, cube, cylinder, dipyramid, disc, dodecahedron, ellipsoid, isocagon, nodule, octahedron, ovoid, pentacle, prism, pyramid, rhomboid, rod, scalahedron, shard, sphere, spindle, star, thorny, torus, triangle, trillian.

## Implanted Ioun Stones
**Implanted Ioun Stones**

Not all the secrets of the ioun stones lie with the Ancients. While the First Humans mastered the intrinsic powers of the stones, uncovering new attributes and binding them to devices, the Second Empire explored the interaction of ioun stones and the mind and body, and in time devised a means of implanting an ioun stone within the flesh. This process, originally believed to be irreversible, protected the ioun stone from harm and theft while still providing its full powers to the owner.

Binding a stone to a single owner is a lengthy process. To begin the ritual, the owner meditates with but a single stone in orbit around him. The body must be cleansed by fasting for a period of at least 3 days. If the fast is broken or interrupted, the process must begin anew. At the end of the fast, the owner makes a DC 20 Charisma check; taking 10 is not permitted on this check. Success indicates the stone has bonded with the owner, and may be implanted. Extending the fasting increases the chance of bonding with the stone, but the character may suffer the effects of starvation and thirst if he persists after several failures; the character gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the Charisma check for each full day past the third spent in fasting, to a maximum of +5. Failing the check means the owner must start over.

Once the owner establishes this bond with the stone, he can have it implanted in his body, which takes 1 hour. This requires a DC 25 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (with a –5 penalty if the owner is the one performing the surgery) and a DC 25 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) check to succeed. Failure inflicts 1d6 points of Constitution damage and means the implantation process must start again. Success binds the stone on the surface of the owner’s skin in a location of his choice (usually the head, arm, or hand), where it becomes one with the owner’s flesh, deals him 1d2 points of Constitution damage (which he can heal naturally or with magic), and gives him the full benefits of the ioun stone. Once implanted, an ioun stone may not be sundered or targeted by effects and cannot be removed without the owner’s consent while he is alive (barring complete removal of the implanted body part).

Rumors exist of stranger, darker magics that allow spellcasters to channel spells through their implanted stones, or that cause the stones to shatter if the owner is killed, but those with any actual knowledge of these procedures are dead, hidden, or not talking.

## Inferior Ioun Stones
**Inferior Ioun Stones**

There are very few reports of ioun stones that have negative side effects; even those created by incompetent item-crafters merely create inferior specimens—still valuable to poor adventurers who cannot afford the normal variety. They fall into one of the following categories.

**Cracked:** These stones bear an obvious crack, whether as a result of the crafting process, because the raw stone was already cracked, or because the stone has been damaged (for example, if it gains the broken quality). A cracked stone’s power is usually the same as an undamaged stone, but weaker.

**Flawed:** These stones have a flaw other than a crack, such as irregular faceting or impurities in the crystal. A flawed stone’s power is usually similar to and weaker than a normal ioun stone, but sometimes it has side effects or slightly different effects than its normal counterpart.

**Scorched**: These stones are depleted somehow, but not so much as to render them completely burned out and powerless; some achieve this state from damaging exposure to extreme heat or electricity. A scorched stone’s power functions erratically (typically a 50% chance per day for constant-effect items, or 50% chance per use for use-activated items) but is essentially the same as an intact stone of the same type. For example, a scorched pearly white spindle ioun stone might give the wearer a 50% chance per 10 minutes to regenerate 1 hit point.

**Cursed Stones:** When a magic item creation skill check to create an ioun stone fails by 5 or more but less than 15, there is a 50% chance the result is a cracked stone and a 50% chance the result is a flawed stone. If the check fails by 15 or more, the stone is actually cursed; roll on Table: Common Item Curses to determine the effects of the stone’s curse.

**Resonant Powers:** When an ioun stone is set within the special indentation in a wayfinder, a secondary resonant power sometimes manifests to augment the ioun stone's powers, though this suppresses the wayfinder's normal magical abilities. This minor function is in addition to the stone's normal abilities, which continue to affect the wayfinder's bearer as though the stone were orbiting her head. Two resonating wayfinders wielded by the same character suppress one another's abilities, but both return to normal when one wayfinder is set aside. 75% of ioun stones grant resonant powers when placed in a wayfinder. 25% of cracked or flawed ioun stones have resonant powers (see Wayfinders and Ioun Stones) compared to the 75% chance for typical ioun stones; only 10% of scorched ioun stones have resonant powers.

## Feats and Ioun Stones
**Feats and Ioun Stones**

~~Metamagic feats should adjust the level of the spells to which they apply, and thus change the price. While this is still a matter of judgment, consider increasing all the spell levels by +1 if the item affects spells of 0–3rd level, by +2 if the item affects spells of 0–6th level, and by +4 if the item affects spells of any level.~~

A general guideline for other kinds of feats is that they cost 10,000 gp (5,000 gp in crafting cost; cf. White Prism, [[Improved Turning (Feat)|Improved Turning]] \[as the feat], 10,000 gp, Inkwell Ideas.com 9), plus another 5,000 gp to 10,000 gp per prerequisite.

**Source:** Arms and Equipment Guide (WotC), pg. 128

An ioun stone granting a feat with prerequisites also grants those prerequisite feats. Its cost should reflect each prerequisite feat and its cost; for example, an ioun granting [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]] (cf. *[[Ioun Stone, indigo cabochon|indigo cabochon ioun stone]])* would also grant [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]] and [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]] and its cost would be 30,000 gp (10,000 gp for each feat). Improving an ioun stone that grants a feat so that it grants another feat requiring the first stone's prerequisite will cause it to change shape and possibly color.

Much like metamagic rods, ioun stones that grant a metamagic feat do not cause a change in the cast spell's level. This is a change from the 3.5 guidelines given above under **Feats and Ioun Stones**.

## Spells and Ioun Stones
The base cost for crafting an ioun stone with a continuous spell effect is listed below with an example (if one exists in core materials):


| Spell<br>Level | Cost | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4,000 gp | *eastern star ioun stone* |
| 1 | 8,000 gp | *[[Ioun Stone, amethyst pyramid\|amethyst pyramid ioun stone]]* |
| 2 | 24,000 gp |  |
| 3 | 60,000 gp |  |
| 4 | 112,000 gp |  |
| 5 | 180,000 gp | *[[Ioun Stone, forest green scalahedron\|forest green scalahedron ioun stone]]* |
| 6 | 264,000 gp |  |
| 7 | 364,000 gp |  |
| 8 | 480,000 gp |  |
| 9 | 612,000 gp |  |

Don't forget to adjust for the duration of the base spell!

If a continuous item has an effect based on a spell with a duration measured in rounds, multiply the cost by 4. If the duration of the spell is 1 minute/level, multiply the cost by 2, and if the duration is 10 minutes/level, multiply the cost by 1.5. If the spell has a duration 1 hour/level, multiple the cost by 1.25. If the spell has a 24-hour duration or greater, divide the cost in half.

## Ioun Stones and Resonant Powers
**Wayfinders and Ioun Stones**

Within each *wayfinder* is a fine lattice of wires that serve to channel the power of *ioun stones*, allowing the owner of a *wayfinder* to benefit from a stone’s power without the attendant risk of having a valuable item orbiting around her head. In addition, the magic worked into the *wayfinder* amplifies the power of the *ioun stone*, usually (about 75% of the time) unlocking new abilities in addition to the stone’s normal power. Unfortunately, the energy required is such that the magical properties of the *wayfinder* itself are diverted to power the *ioun stone*, temporarily negating the *wayfinder*’s normal abilities. The mechanism of using a *wayfinder* to boost the power of an *ioun stone* is usually called augmenting, channeling, enhancing, or resonating. The resonant aura of a *wayfinder* interacting with an *ioun stone* can be detected and identified with *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* magic item.

The auras of multiple augmenting *wayfinders* tend to interfere with each other; a person with one who tries to hold or carry a second usually finds that both sputter out in just a few seconds, but activate again once the second one is set aside. Some advanced, expensive *wayfinders* may hold more than one *ioun stone* at the same time and still function (though another *wayfinder* can interfere if brought too close).

To determine what effect a *wayfinder* has on an *ioun stone*, select one of the following methods.

**Method 1, The Static Assignment**: All *ioun stones* of a particular color and shape react exactly the same way to all *wayfinders*. This is the easiest and fastest method, but lacks variety and allows the PCs to easily predict what a new stone or device will do when combined. For a listing of these combinations, see below.

**Method 2, The Random Roll**: Each combination of an *ioun stone* and a *wayfinder* requires a roll on a table to see what resonant power it gains. This methods allows for a lot of variety but requires bookkeeping to track each unique stone’s augmented power, and also makes it difficult for the PCs to predict what any particular combination may be. See the table on page 53. Resonant Powers (Method 1)

The resonant powers of the most common forms of *ioun stones* are listed below. If the power is a feat, the bearer gains that feat as a bonus feat even if he does not meet its prerequisites. Spell effects with uses per day are spell-like abilities.

**Amber spindle**: 5% chance per Reflex saving throw of granting the wearer evasion against that effect; bonuses from multiple *amber spindles* stack.

**Clear spindle**: Protection from possession and mental control (as *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]*).

**Crimson sphere**: +1 competence bonus on single [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill (chosen by the stone’s creator).

**Dark blue rhomboid**: The wearer no longer suffer penalties on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks for being distracted or asleep; during sleep the wearer may remain open-eyed and fully aware of his environment, though he is still helpless against undetected threats until he actually wakes up.

**Deep red sphere**: [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]].

**Dull gray stone**: *[[Read Magic (Spell)|Read magic]]* 1/day day for 10 minutes.

**Dusty rose prism**: +2 insight bonus on CMB and to CMD.

**Emerald ellipsoid**: 5 additional temporary hit points.

**Gamboge nodule**: +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease.

**Incandescent blue sphere**: [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]].

**Iridescent spindle**: *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|Endure elements]]*, as the spell, as well as protection against exposure to vacuum and underwater pressure.

**Lavender and green ellipsoid**: If the bearer is holding the *wayfinder*, he may use the stone’s absorption ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action.

**Mossy disk**: +1 competence bonus on [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] checks.

**Mulberry pentacle**: +2 competence bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks.

**Nacreous gray sphere**: Miss chance against incorporeal creatures decreases to 25%.

**Onyx rhomboid**: *[[Virtue (Spell)|Virtue]]* at will (self only).

**Opalescent white pyramid**: [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] with the stone’s keyed weapon.

**Orange prism**: Every time the bearer casts a spell, roll 1d4–2 and add this (and the +1 caster level granted by the normal power of the *ioun stone*) to his caster level. If this modified caster level is too low to cast the spell, the spell fails and is lost.

**Pale blue rhomboid**: +1 bonus on Fortitude saves.

**Pale green prism**: Twice per day as a free action the bearer may remove the [[Fatigued|fatigued]] condition from himself as a free action (or reduce the [[Exhausted|exhausted]] condition to [[Fatigued|fatigued]]).

**Pale lavender ellipsoid**: If the bearer is holding the *wayfinder*, he may use the stone’s absorption ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action.

**Pale ruby trillian**: Increase by 10 feet the distance the bearer may fall safely (stacks with other effects that increase this distance, such as making [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks or falling into water).

**Pearly white spindle**: +1 sacred bonus on saves against attacks that rely on negative energy.

**Pink and green sphere**: +1 bonus on Will saves.

**Pink rhomboid**: +1 bonus on Reflex saves.

**Scarlet and blue sphere**: +1 bonus on Will saves.

**Scarlet and green cabochon**: +5 bonus on Constitution checks made to stabilize.

**Turquoise sphere**: +2 competence bonus on [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] checks.

**Vermilion rhomboid**: Breathe water for up to 10 minutes per day, useable in 1-minute increments.

**Vibrant purple prism**: The bearer may use a standard action to expend one stored spell level in the stone, refreshing a cast 1st-level spell as if using a *pearl of power*.

**Resonant Powers (Method 2)**

The resonant powers of the most common forms of *ioun stones* are listed below. If the power is a feat, the bearer gains that feat as a bonus feat even if he does not meet its prerequisites.

## Embedded Ioun Stones and Resonant Powers
**Embedded Ioun Stones and Resonant Powers**

When an ioun stone is embedded in one of the 14 chakra points (only stone per chakra point), by either the surgical method or by the spell *[[Embed Ioun Stone (Spell)|embed ioun stone]]**,* there is a 25% chance that it will resonant with the user's nervous system and gain a resonant power. The GM should, in advance, decide if Method I or Method II will be used. Unlike a *wayfinder,* there is no chance of the auras of multiple augmenting embedded stones interfering with each other; so long as each stone is embedded in a chakra point. Ioun stones embedded in non-chakra points give a 1% cumulative chance per non-chakra embedded stone that all resonant stones will cease to resonant.

## Variant Rule: Ioun Stone Crafting
**Variant Rule: Ioun Stone Crafting**

To make ioun stone crafting more interesting, GMs should consider adding a prerequisite spell to each.

Another thing that can be added to ioun stone crafting is the *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* spell. This shrinks the ioun stone to 1/16th inch in size (this is fine size +8 size AC adjustment) and adds an additional 1,000 gp to stone's cost (not sale price). Spells which affect the hardness and hit points of an item have also been used in the construction of ioun stones; this also adds to the individual stone's cost.

## Variant Rule: Ioun Stone Orbits
**Variant Rule: Ioun Stone Orbits**

Many spellcasters, and others, are known for using a number of ioun stones. These rapidly dancing stones are able to confuse attackers from attacking or plucking one out of the air, when there are large numbers of them. For each ioun stone beyond the third, each ioun stone gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its Armor Class (24).

**Source:** The Real Arcane Story: Ioun Stones (LPJ Design), pg. 2

## Variant Rule: Mounted Ioun Stones
**Variant Rule: Mounted Ioun Stones**

Ioun stones can be crafted into weapons, armor, headgear, or even rings and still impart their magical abilities. Adding an existing ioun stone to a newly crafted magic item costs an additional 1,000 gp and is considered to add 1 to the caster level of the item. In the event of missile weapons, this does not allow them to return automatically to the user. Constructs, [[Gearforged|gearforged]], [[Warforged (Domain)|warforged]], and other such creatures often make use of this rule to physically embed a stone onto their body.
