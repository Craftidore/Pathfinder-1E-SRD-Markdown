# Figurine of Wondrous Power (Onyx Dog)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 15,500 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *figurine of wondrous power* appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a *figurine of wondrous power* is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

**Onyx Dog:** When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]*. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]*

**Cost** 7,750 gp
