# Simulacrum Suit
## Overview
**Aura** Strong illusion; **CL** 13th

**Slot** Body

**Price** 60,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The unworn suit appears as a deflated balloon of skin of the type of creature it represents.

A *simulacrum suit* is a potent magical disguise that can be used to defeat even the most minute inspection. When created, the user must collect a body part from a donor creature, as if she were preparing to cast *[[Simulacrum (Spell)|simulacrum]]*. The creator then builds a rough costume that approximates the donor creature's shape, size, and appearance, incorporating the body part into the costume in some manner. The donor creature must be an aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin, and cannot have more Hit Dice than the creator's caster level.

Once created, a *simulacrum suit* may be worn by any creature that is within at least one size category of the suit. Thus, a *simulacrum suit* of a human could be worn by a Small, Medium, or Large creature. When a creature wears a *simulacrum suit*, he is physically transformed into that creature as if by a *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]* spell. Once the suit is worn, the powerful magic cloaks itself from detection. Divination spells cannot detect the magic of a worn *simulacrum suit*, and even *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* is defeated by the suit's potent warding. For all this, however, the suit can still be recognized as a disguise with a successful [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check made against the wearer's [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check. The suit does grant a +10 circumstance bonus on the wearer's [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check, but if an observer detects the ruse he can tell that the wearer is disguising his appearance somehow.

A creature can remove a *simulacrum suit* from a helpless target with a full-round action by pulling forcefully on the person's flesh and clothing. The wearer of a *simulacrum suit* may remove it as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity.

An unworn *simulacrum suit* looks like a deflated skin of the creature it represents.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Simulacrum (Spell)|simulacrum]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*

**Cost** 30,000 gp

**Source:** Shackled City HC, pg. 338

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Items worn by the creature in his original form are subsumed and become none functional when the *simulacrum suit* is donned unless the wearer casts *[[Polymorph, Adaptive (Spell)|adaptive polymorph]]* prior to putting the *simulacrum suit.* Once the *simulacrum suit* is donned, the wearer may put on (slotted) items as they desire and they function normally. Theoritically a wearer could have functional slotted items in excess to what is normally possible.
