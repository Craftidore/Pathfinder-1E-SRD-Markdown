# Wagon, Folding
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** —

**Price** 5,000 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

A *folding wagon* looks like a small wooden box about 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a vardo (heavy wagon) 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet in depth. The *folding wagon* cannot unfold if there isn’t enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside it.

In its wagon form, it is shaped like a vardo (a covered heavy wagon). A vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the eaves. Beyond this characteristic, the various types of vardos can differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, depending upon where it was made, and by whom. The roof is made wood. A vardo frequently has a door in the front as well as one in the rear.

A small cast-iron cooking stove is a common fixture of the vardo. A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A caravan's chimney is always on its right side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the right side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position. The stove rests in a small metal fireplace.

The wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, and a chest of drawers. There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have clerestories (skylights which let in light and air). A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table. Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colors, and sheathed in places with gold leaf.

Saying the word of command in reverse causes the wagon to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The command words for such vehicles is often some variant of their name and can be frequently found carved onto the box somewhere.  A favorite of some GMs is to use *[[Illusory Script (Spell)|illusory script]]* for the command words; doing so adds that spell to the requirements for construction and increases the price to 7,500 gp. Another often used is to make the command words invisible and/or to place them on the underside of a sliding lid. 

*House Rule:* There are rumored to be other, larger variants of the *folding wagon*; some of which use the *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]* spell as a part of their construction. Such a *folding wagon* would have increased storage capacity, even when folded.
