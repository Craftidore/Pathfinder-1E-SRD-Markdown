# Necklace of Fireballs (type III)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck (does not take up slot)

**Price** 4,350 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This item appears to be a string of beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character’s worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell (Reflex DC 14 half).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals. 

Each *necklace of fireballs* contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. 

**Necklace of Fireballs (Type III)**


| **Necklace** | **10d6** | **9d6** | **8d6** | **7d6** | **6d6** | **5d6** | **4d6** | **3d6** | **2d6** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type III | — | — | — | 1 | — | 2 | — | 4 | — |

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*

**Cost** 2,175 gp
