**General Properties of Portable Rooms**

Unless otherwise stated in a room's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a *portable room* is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The *portable room* blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a *portable room*, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a *portable room*, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- Rooms left activated automatically deactivate after 12 hours. (*House Rule:* This means the portal to the extradimensional space closes; the room itself continues to exist.)
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the rooms automatically deactivate (if active) and the items become non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items (including other *portable rooms*) using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the items crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
