# Bracers of Wands, Greater
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** wrist

**Price** 90,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

*Greater bracers of wands* are magical leather armbands that extend from wrist to elbow. Equally spaced around each are six small (3 inch long by 1/2 inch wide and 1/25 inch deep) indentations, each of which can hold a standard (sized) magic wand.

*Greater bracers of wands* can be 'attuned' to different wands. Immediately after being placed in one of the slots of the bracers, a charge is harmlessly drained from the wand. The wand is then attuned to the slot, shrinking to fit it and remains so until removed. Wands in a bracer slot can be used without the need to draw them and without the need to hold the wand in a hand. 

Wands can be removed and replaced from slots in *bracers of wands,* but each time a wand is attuned to a slot on a bracer, it loses another charge. Both bracers must be worn for the *bracers of wands* to function. A wand stored within a *greater bracer of wands* can be activated as a move action. In addition, the wielder can call upon the effects of the [[Staff-Like Wand]] feat with any wand located in one the bracers.

Unlike the *bracers of wands* , a wand in a *greater bracer of wands* cannot be attacked or broken, and characters using the bracers cannot be disarmed of wands. 

The *greater bracers of wands* do not grant a character the ability to use a wand if the character is not normally able to do so. Rogues attempting to use a wand in *bracers of wands* with their [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] skill must first make a skill check to use the bracers (DC 20) and then a second check to use the wand.

For purposes of the [[Wand Parry (Feat)|Wand Parry]] feat and any of its subsequent higher tier feats, a character wearing a *greater bracers of wands* is considered able to parry and is not considered unarmed while doing so.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Staff-Like Wand]], *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]**,* *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]*

**Cost** 45,000 gp
