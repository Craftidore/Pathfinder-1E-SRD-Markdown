**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone makes it user feel comfortably warm at all times. First, she is permanently protected as by an *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]]* spell, protecting her from severe heat or cold environments. Secondly, the character gains fire resistance 5, and any equipment she carries and the clothes she wears are immune to catching on fire. Finally, the character gains cold resistance 5 and suffers no penalty to movement or skill checks for walking on ice.
