# Cube of Frost Resistance
## Overview
**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 27,000 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]*

**Cost** 13,500 gp
