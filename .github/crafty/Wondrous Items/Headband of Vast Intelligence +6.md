## Overview

**Slot** headband

**Price** 36,000 gp

**Description**

This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and deep purple gemstones. The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to Intelligence of +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. A *headband of vast intelligence* has one skill associated with it per +2 bonus it grants. After being worn for 24 hours, the headband grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the wearer’s total Hit Dice. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses. These skills are chosen when the headband is created. If no skill is listed, the headband is assumed to grant skill ranks in randomly determined [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills.
