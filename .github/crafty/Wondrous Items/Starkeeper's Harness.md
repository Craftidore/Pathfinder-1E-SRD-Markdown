# Starkeeper's Harness
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** Body

**Price** 5,000 gp

**Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This thin cloth wrap fits well under armor. Although solid objects can be felt inside it, it never rattles or jangles when the wearer is moving.

The wearer can pull from the harness an unlimited supply of non-magical shuriken, though any shuriken produced by the harness disappear at the start of the wearer’s next turn. Retrieving a shuriken is the same action as drawing a weapon (a move action normally, but a free action for someone with [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] for instance). Casting a spell on the *starkeeper’s harness* that enhances projectiles, such as *[[Magic Weapon (Spell)|magic weapon]]*, enhances all shuriken drawn from the harness until the spell ends.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]**,* *[[Abundant Ammunition (Spell)|abundant ammunition]]*

**Cost** 2,500 gp
