# Dust of Appearance
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 1,800 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]* and *[[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]]*. In this, it works just like the *[[Faerie Fire (Spell)|faerie fire]]* spell. The dust also reveals figments, *mirror images*, and *projected images* for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks. The dust’s effect lasts for 5 minutes.

*Dust of appearance* is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Glitterdust (Spell)|glitterdust]]*

**Cost** 900 gp
