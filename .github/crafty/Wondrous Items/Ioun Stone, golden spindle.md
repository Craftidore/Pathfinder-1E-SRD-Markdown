# Ioun Stone, golden spindle
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 7,200 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone glitters and dazzles when set into motion. Anyone trying to look at the owner of this stone suffers a -6 penalty to [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to recognize them (such as when disguised), read their lips, or see through an illusion centered on the character (but not to notice that they are there or to oppose a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check)*,* while it is orbiting.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 3,600 gp

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 37

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Changed from golden sphere to golden spindle to avoid duplication.
