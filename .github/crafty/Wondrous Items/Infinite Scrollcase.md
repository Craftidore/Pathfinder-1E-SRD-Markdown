*This elaborate mahogany tube has a slit that runs along its length. A wooden dowel, capped on the ends with gold, fits against the slit, locking into place with jeweled clasps.*

An *infinite scrollcase* holds up to fifty scrolls or other parchments, which can be placed within it or removed as with any normal scrollcase.

If you have at least a +1 base attack bonus, you can retrieve a scroll from an *infinite scrollcase* as part of a move action, similar to drawing a weapon.
