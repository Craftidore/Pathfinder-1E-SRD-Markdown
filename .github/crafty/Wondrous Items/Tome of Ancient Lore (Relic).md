# Tome of Ancient Lore (Relic)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** —

**Price** relic (22,000 gp)

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

Allegedly penned by [[Boccob]] himself and “borrowed” from his library, this leather-bound book is overstuffed with yellowing sheets of parchment. Its magical pages contain every conceivable spell, but the *tome of ancient lore* (and copies made since the original left [[Boccob]]’s library) is cursed with a deliberately confusing, everchanging system of cross-referencing. The pages within the tome rearrange themselves, apparently at random. Finding anything useful by browsing is impossible, but a reader who uses the index at the back has a 90% chance of finding any arcane spell within the tome’s pages (retries for the same spell within 24 hours fail). Spells read from the *tome of ancient lore* take half as long to prepare as normal.

To use this relic, you must worship [[Boccob]] and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Sanctify Relic (Feat)|Sanctify Relic]], *[[Secret Page (Spell)|secret page]]**,* creator must worship [[Boccob]]

**Cost** 11,000 gp

**Source:** Complete Divine (WotC), pg. 103

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Wizards using this tome add their Intelligence modifier to the 90% chance of finding a specific arcane spell. Once a spell has been located in the tome, it can always be found again without searching.

Archivists, clerics, mystic theurges and wizards who worship [[Boccob]] frequently create this relic and then make specific individual adjustments to it; in effect, customizing it to their individual needs.

In other campaign worlds, such a relic would be appropriate for gods of magic.
