# Eyes of Doom
## Overview
**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 11th

**Slot** eyes

**Weight** —

**Description**

These crystal lenses fit over the user’s eyes, enabling him to cast *[[Doom (Spell)|doom]]* upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the *[[Doom (Spell)|doom]]* spell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual *[[Deathwatch (Spell)|deathwatch]]* effect and can use *[[Fear (Spell)|fear]]* (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Doom (Spell)|doom]], [[Deathwatch (Spell)|deathwatch]], [[Fear (Spell)|fear]]*

**Cost** 12,500 gp
