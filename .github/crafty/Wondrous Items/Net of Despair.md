# Net of Despair
## Overview
**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 10th

**Slot** —

**Price** 150,000gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This net is crafted from the silk of a drider. The silk is harvested, woven, and then blackened by infusing charred bone powder in with the fibers. The net absorbs light and has a visible aura of darkness. It continuously radiates darkness in a 20-foot radius as the *[[Darkness (Spell)|darkness]]* spell.

Creatures that the user catches within the net begin to experience rapid decomposition and decay as though they are aging at a massively accelerated rate (see page 117 of the Player's Handbook for net statistics A creature [[Entangled|entangled]] in the net must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) each round or suffer 2 points of ability damage. The specific ability affected depends on the result of a d6 roll:

1 -- Strength

2 -- Dexterity

3 -- Constitution

4 -- Intelligence

5 -- Wisdom

6 -- Charisma

A creature caught within the net for 3 uninterrupted rounds suffers accelerated deterioration. Starting on the third round of entanglement, the [[Entangled|entangled]] creature gains one negative level in addition to ability damage. The creature continues to take ability damage and negative levels each round the creature remains [[Entangled|entangled]]. A creature that escapes the net is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for a number of rounds equal to the number of ability points drained. A creature that survives entanglement in the net can heal ability damage and recover negative levels from the net in the normal manner. The save DC to remove a negative level is 15. In the hands of a nonevil PC, this functions as a normal masterwork net.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Darkness (Spell)|darkness]]*, *[[Enervation (Spell)|enervation]]*, *[[Ray of Exhaustion (Spell)|ray of exhaustion]]*; cleric must worship [[Tharizdun]]
