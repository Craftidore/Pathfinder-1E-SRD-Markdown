# Robe, Monk's
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** body

**Price** 13,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This simple brown robe, when worn, confers great ability in unarmed combat. If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the [[Stunning Fist (Feat)|Stunning Fist]] feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the monkâ€™s AC bonus.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Righteous Might (Spell)|righteous might]]* or *[[Transformation (Spell)|transformation]]*

**Cost** 6,500 gp

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 528
