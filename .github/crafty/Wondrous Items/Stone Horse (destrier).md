# Stone Horse (destrier)
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 14th

**Slot** —

**Price** 14,800 gp

**Weight** 6,000 lbs.

**Description**

This item is a roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind. A *stone horse* is combat-trained.

A *stone horse* can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem) or by casting *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]]*, then using healing spells until it reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically returns to its stone form.

*Destrier*: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse with hardness 10.

**Special Abilities**

**Docile (Ex)** Unless specifically trained for combat (see the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill on page 97 of the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook*), a horse’s hooves are treated as secondary attacks. Horses stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. 

A heavy horse gains the advanced simple template. In addition, it also gains a bite attack that inflicts 1d4 damage, and its hoof damage increases to 1d6. As with a light horse, a heavy horse can be specifically trained for combat with the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill.
