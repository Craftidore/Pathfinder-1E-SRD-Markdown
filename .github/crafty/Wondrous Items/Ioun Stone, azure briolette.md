# Ioun Stone, azure briolette
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This pear-shaped *ioun stone* sparkles in a brilliant blue color. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell cast by this *ioun stone*’s user, the user gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the targeted creature’s Charisma bonus (minimum 0) until the start of the user’s next turn. These temporary hit points do not stack. The user doesn’t gain temporary hit points from a creature that voluntarily fails its saving throw against the spell.

**Resonance:** This stone allows the user to pick up on psychic resonance from corpses. So long as the user has carried the *ioun stone* continuously for at least 24 hours, the first three corpses touched by the user each day babble residual psychic impressions into the bearer’s mind. This functions as the *grave words* spell, except that only the user can hear the corpse speak. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 7,500 gp
