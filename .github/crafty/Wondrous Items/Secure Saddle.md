# Secure Saddle
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** –

**Price** 300 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

This saddle can be plain or ornate, but it appears to have no special features. Once a rider sits on it and speaks the command word, she cannot be unseated from the saddle until she (or someone else) says the deactivating command word. Although popular with horse-mounted cavalry or jousting knights, a *secure saddle* is an essential piece of tack for those who ride pegasi, griffons, or other flying mounts.

Secure saddles have two drawbacks: an attack that would normally knock a rider out of the saddle (for example, a successful Unseat attempt) does double damage because she can’t roll with the blow; and if the rider falls asleep, is knocked [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or dies in the saddle, she remains there if she didn’t share the command word with a comrade.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]*

**Cost** 150 gp
