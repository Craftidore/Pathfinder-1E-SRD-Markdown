# Bag of Tricks, tan
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 16,000 gp

**Description**

This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill. Each of the three kinds of *bags of tricks* produces a different set of animals. 

The heavy horse appears with harness and tack and accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to 10 animals can be drawn from the bag each week, but no more than two per day. Statistics for these animals can be found in the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*.


| **d%** | **Animal** |
|---|---|
| 01–30 | Grizzly bear |
| 31–60 | Lion |
| 61–80 | Heavy horse |
| 81–90 | Tiger |
| 91–100 | Rhinoceros |

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Summon Nature's Ally V (Spell)|summon nature’s ally V]]*

**Cost** 8,000 gp
