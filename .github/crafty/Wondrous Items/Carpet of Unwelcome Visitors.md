# Carpet of Unwelcome Visitors
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

A thick, plush carpet woven with an intricate serpentlike design, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is laid out across an entryway or similar traffic bottleneck. It can be set in one of two ways. First, the carpet can be keyed to a specific passphrase, enabling those who cross it while saying the phrase to travel unmolested. Those who fail to correctly say the phrase are affected by a *[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*, requiring a DC 16 Will save or become frozen in place for 1d4+5 days. Second, it can be set to affect anyone who walks on the carpet until the phrase is spoken a second time. Up to 20 Medium-sized (or 40 Small or 4 Large) humanoids can be frozen on the carpet before it is too crowded to allow further passage.

The effect cannot be disarmed via [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]]. However, an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell can safely roll an unsecured carpet, allowing one to cross the space unaffected. For this reason, many owners affix their carpets in place with trapped, concealed latches.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp
