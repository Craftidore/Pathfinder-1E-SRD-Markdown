# Chime of Opening
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** —

**Price** 3,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *chime of opening* is a hollow [[Mithral|mithral]] tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A *chime of opening* also automatically dispels a *[[Hold Portal (Spell)|hold portal]]* spell or even an *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]* cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.

The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime’s caster level of 11th. The DC of this check is equal to the [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and *arcane locked,* it takes four successful uses of a *chime of opening* to get it open. A *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell negates the power of the device. A brand new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]*

**Cost** 1,500 gp
