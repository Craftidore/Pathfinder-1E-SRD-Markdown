# Bear Cloak of Bareicks
## Overview
**Aura** Moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** shoulders

**Price** 16,000 gp

**Weight** 4 lb.

**Description**

This thick bear-fur cloak provides excellent protection against the cold in the form of cold resistance 10. In addition, the cloak also allows you to change into a brown bear (Bestiary 1), as the spell *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]*. You may assume bear form no more than once per day, but you may stay in the form indefinitely. If killed, you revert to your normal form.

Your armor and equipment become part of your body and are nonfunctional. Whenever you shift forms, you regain lost hit points as if you rested for a night.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]], [[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]*

**Cost** 8,000 gp

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 65
