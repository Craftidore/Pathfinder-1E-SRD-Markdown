# Compass and Square of the Mason
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** —

**Price** 91,600 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

Floating in the air are two separate pieces, a square and a compass, each composed of gold and intricately designed colored glass. Inside the glass can be seen a number of small runes floating in the light.

**Lore**

**DC 10:** These vessels of eldritch might sparked a vicious debate over magically constructed architecture, land use, planar access, and the rights to airspace within the Protectorate of Questhaven when over 300 magic castles were created within one year’s time. When the item disappeared, use of the item (and its underlying spell) was under deliberation by the Circle of Heroes. However, when the items disappeared, The First Hero postponed his ruling. He had much more pressing matters to deal with, such as floating castles that collapsed when their owners died.

**DC 15:** The runes are: castle, stone, wood, portal, float, barrier, death, and the numerals 2, 1,000, and 100,000. It is through the use of this item that Questhaven and its protectorate is dotted with disputed, abandoned, collapsed, and/or extra-planar magical castles.

**DC 20:** This pair of objects are highly sought after, by dragons and wealthy stonewarden gargoyles; Jotun Giants distain their use, saying “We build with our own two hands.” The great wyrm pyroclastic dragon Ardonnue “The Breaking Fire,” and The Last Warlord, who threatens the southern Protectorate, both possess a pair of these. For some reason these items are considered a delicacy by the Riven creatures (accursed beings who feed upon magic), while their products are considered an abomination.

**DC 25:** The stonewarden gargoyles refer to this as *Fargan* “Of the Stronghold Builder” while its draconic name is Majiermurh “The Slumbering Fortress,” but the ironborn name *Compass and Square of the Mason* is the most widely accepted. Three of these were crafted by the ironborn construct known as Firstbuilt apparently at the request or demand of the great wyrm pyroclastic dragon *Ardon-nue “The Breaking Fire”*

**DC 30:** On the day Firstbuilt was to deliver them, thieves stole them. Firstbuilt defended them to breaking and near ruin, but one of the thieves escaped with the collection. When Ardon-nue arrived, disguised in human form to collect them, she rebuilt the shattered ironborn, rewarded his loyalty by paying for the eldritch items, and set about hunting down the thieves.

**DC 35:** The Silver Stalkers of The Questor’s Society accidentally recovered one, and began using it, which is what brought it to the attention of the Council, but they also earned the attention of Ardon-nue and did not survive it. Since then, Firstbuilt has refused to create any more and destroyed all his notes. Many believe Ardonnue has lain some kind of obscuring magic upon these items to keep other seekers from recovering them. The original thieves are long since dead, along with their friends, family, loved ones, and business associates (some are now undead servants tasked with washing The Breaking Fire’s scales for all eternity). There is at least 1 remaining lost set, and the pieces may be separated.

**DC 40:** Ardon-nue does not really care about the remaining set; it is simply that someone dared to steal from her. Now that she has carried out her vengeance, she no longer cares about who possesses it unless they make such a possession so public that it becomes an affront she cannot ignore.

**Abilities**

Once per day, when the square and compass are placed so as to form a hexagram, and a special ritual that takes 30 minutes is performed, there is a grand display of magical energies, instantaneously creating a castle of the wielder’s design that has up 34 rooms. The entire square footage of the castle cannot exceed 100,000 square feet. The castle walls are made of stone, the doors of wood (with DC 30 locks), although the hardness of all materials is increased by 5. The interior of the castle is fully furnished, and each room is magically lit with a brightness level that varies with the original wielder’s whim (from daylight to magical darkness). The castle also automatically contains weapons (melee and ranged) and chain hauberks enough to outfit 50 guards or defenders. In addition, the wielder can choose one of the following options:

- The castle exists on another plane (an otherwise empty pocket dimension), with the only doorway existing on the plane on which you cast the spell. The doorway the wielder attaches to this effect to must be within 1,000 ft. at the time of activation or the item creates a freestanding doorway to the wielder’s specifications.
- The castle floats in the air at a height of the original wielder’s choosing. The magic keeping the castle in the air cannot be dispelled or suppressed.
- The castle is surrounded by a ward through which one general type of creature, chosen by the wielder, cannot pass (undead, aberrations, humanoids, etc.).

Lastly, the wielder can choose to have any portion of the castle disappear or fall apart upon the original wielder’s death, or the wielder can choose to have the whole place collapse at the time of the wielder’s demise. If the castle floats, the wielder can have it fall when the original wielder dies.
