# Quiver of Arrow Creation
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 1,500 gp

**Weight** 1 lb. 

**Description**

This simple quiver appears to hold 20 masterwork arrows within it. However, each arrow exists in a state of flux within the quiver, its physical properties not yet fully determined. When the wearer draws an arrow (a free action, as normal), he mentally chooses the material from which the arrowhead is forged ([[Adamantine|adamantine]], alchemical silver, or cold iron, as described in the Core Rulebook). Once drawn, the arrow exists for only one minute, but for that minute functions exactly as a masterwork arrow of the chosen material and of an appropriate size for the user. Once all 20 arrows have been drawn, the quiver loses its power. Additional arrows cannot be added to the quiver. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]*

**Cost** 750 gp
