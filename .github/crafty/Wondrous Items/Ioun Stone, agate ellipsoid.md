# Ioun Stone, agate ellipsoid
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 1,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone gives a single use of the *[[Augury (Spell)|augury]]* spell with 100% success rate.

**Construction**

**Cost** 500 gp

**Source:** Pathfinder Society Primer, pg. 22

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This stone's power may only be used once per month.
