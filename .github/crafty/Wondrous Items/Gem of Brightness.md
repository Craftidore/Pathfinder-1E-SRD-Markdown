# Gem of Brightness
## Overview
**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** —

**Price** 13,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem’s facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

- One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.
- Another command word causes the *gem of brightness* to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
- The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]*

**Cost** 6,500 gp
