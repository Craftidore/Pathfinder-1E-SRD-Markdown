# Ioun Stone, ochre spindle
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 17,200 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone spins swiftly when it orbits a character’s head. Its user is granted all-around vision. He cannot be flanked and enjoys a +4 competence bonus to [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 8,600 gp

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 39

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The rapid orbiting around the owner's head is merely a visual affect, the magic of the stone itself is what grants the user all-around vision so this stone continues to function even if implanted or joined with an item.
