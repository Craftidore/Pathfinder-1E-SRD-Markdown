# Portable Room (Mineral Ring)
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** —

**Price** 12,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Appearance**

This glittering ring of salt crystals (hardness 10, hp 15, break DC 18) is enameled with tiny staves in all colors of the rainbow and even smaller magical symbols. If the wearer twists the ring three times round his finger a narrow door made of spinning salt appears beside him.

**Description**

The salt door has the characteristics of an everburning torch that cannot be moved. If someone reaches into the spinning salt and opens the door, a well lit workshop is revealed, with racks of tools and benches covered in equipment. A book on a lone lectern provides detailed instructions on the crafting of magical staves. Translating the symbols on the ring ([[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] DC 12 with the book, DC 20 without) reveals which tools must be used and how in order to create the desired staff. This information grants a +5 insight bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks and allows up to two staves to be crafted at once.

This ring is actually a wondrous item that must be worn on a finger (with no other adornment) for 24 hours before it is attuned to the wearer. Once attuned, no one but the attuned user can use this item.

Only the attuned user, his familiar(s), animal companion and one other designated by him can occupy this space. The item(s) being crafted, as well any materials needed can be stored in this space. No other storage of items or materials are allowed in this space.

Due to their nature, homunculi (including dedicated wrights), do not count against the total number of creatures which can occupy this space and may remain in a crafting space even after it has been closed; continuing to work on their assigned task.

This space will automatically (at the user's desire) connect to other elemental ring spaces (that are active) so long as they come from the same attuned user.

Extradimensional items brought within this stabilized space function normally and have no chance of rupturing.

**General Properties of Portable Rooms**

Unless otherwise stated in a room's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a *portable room* is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The *portable room* blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a *portable room*, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a *portable room*, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- Rooms left activated automatically deactivate after 12 hours. (*House Rule:* This means the portal to the extradimensional space closes; the room itself continues to exist.)
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the rooms automatically deactivate (if active) and the items become non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items (including other *portable rooms*) using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the item's crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
- If the *portable room* allows an additional item to be crafted that crafting is done in the same 8 hour block as the first one. The second item does not have to be same as the first one.
