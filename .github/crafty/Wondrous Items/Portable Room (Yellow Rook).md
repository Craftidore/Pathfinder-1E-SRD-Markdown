# Portable Room (Yellow Rook)
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 13th

**Slot** none

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Weight** â€”

**Appearance**

This small wooden rook or castle from a chess set is painted a bright yellow rather than white or black.

**Description**

On command, the rook swells to become a 10 foot high tower (Hardness 5, hp 15, break DC 18) containing a single almost bare room, with a fireplace in one wall and murals showing various individuals training at various skills. The outer wall is bright yellow with a metallic sheen, the inner ones look like mortared stone but feel like carved wood to touch. Sleeping in this room refreshes the body and mind, so that its owner needs only sleep 4 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. Anyone sleeping for 4 hours discovers upon awakening that they dreamed of retraining a desired ability score, archetype, class feature, class level, feat, hit points, new level, racial trait, skill ranks or spells known and it is just as if they had spent 8 hours doing so.  

Should they wish to, they can immediately sleep for an additional 4 hours and gain the benefits of another 8 hours of retraining. They may only do this once per day.

**History**

*DC 10:* Bardic tales tell how it was used by the wizard Shadow and allowed her to constantly retrain her skills so that anyone attacking her could never be certain as to what they faced.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp

**GM Note**

**General Properties of Portable Rooms**

Unless otherwise stated in a room's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a *portable room* is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The *portable room* blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a *portable room*, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a *portable room*, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- Rooms left activated automatically deactivate after 12 hours. (*House Rule:* This means the portal to the extradimensional space closes; the room itself continues to exist.)
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the rooms automatically deactivate (if active) and the items become non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items (including other *portable rooms*) using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the item's crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
