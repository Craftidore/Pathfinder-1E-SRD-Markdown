# Figurine of Wondrous Power (Ebony Fly)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 10,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *figurine of wondrous power* appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a *figurine of wondrous power* is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

**Ebony Fly:** When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a [[Pegasus (Bestiary PF1)|pegasus]] but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]*

**Cost** 5,000 gp
