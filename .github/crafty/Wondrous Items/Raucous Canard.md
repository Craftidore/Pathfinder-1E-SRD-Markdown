**Description**

Scheming nobles like to use *raucous canards* to spread gossip about their enemies. An inactive *raucous canard* appears to be a small, nondescript piece of rolled-up parchment. Unrolling the parchment allows you to record a messages up to 25 words long. Once you record a message, you can throw the parchment into the air, causing it to animate, sprout small feathery wings, and circle overhead for 10 minutes while loudly repeating the message over and over in a booming voice. Alternatively, you can close the scroll, causing the animation to be triggered the next time someone opens the scroll. After 10 minutes, the *raucous canard* disappears in a small shower of sparks and is destroyed.
