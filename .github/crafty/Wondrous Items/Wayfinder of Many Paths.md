# Wayfinder of Many Paths
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 18th

**Slot** none

**Price** 57,750 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The Wayfinder of Many Paths behaves like a normal wayfinder, allowing it to shine (as the *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell) on command and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to avoid getting lost. It has a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone, and when an ioun stone is placed within, the owner of the wayfinder gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head.

Once per day on command, a Wayfinder of Many Paths with an implanted ioun stone can be used to create a 5-to-20-foot-diameter gateway, similiar to the spell *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]*. The exact destination depends on the type of ioun stone slotted into the wayfinder; ioun stones of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds. If fitted with an ioun stone while in that stone's attuned location, a Wayfinder of Many Paths can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used, allowing its user to make a return trip after 24 hours.

**History**

Since the first decades of its existence, the Pathfinder Society has used the wayfinder as its badge of office.

Early Pathfinders reverse-engineered the technology from ancient Azlanti magic, and these innovators soon began creating variants that could tap into the resonance of ioun stones in different ways. One such curiosity is the Wayfinder of Many Paths, a wayfinder with the remarkable ability to create gateways on command to certain archaeological sites for easy exploration and recovery of treasures and items of academic interest. The wayfinder proved reliable, yet it could travel to only a handful of locations-many of them inhospitable, long ago emptied of goods, or otherwise inexplicable. Some point out that many of the destinations have some significance regarding the Society, to the point that some Pathfinder lodges are known destinations. Whether this is a matter of the variant wayfinder connecting to lodges or lodges arising where it travels, only the Decemvirate knows.


| **Known loun Stones** | **Destinations** |
|---|---|
| Clear spindle | A long-since-despoiled tomb in the Alabastrine Peaks in the Crown of the World |
| Dark blue rhomboid | The basement of a flooded museum in Hyrantam |
| Deep red sphere | A third-floor room in an inn in the City of Brass's Common Quarter |
| Dusty rose prism | The Thuvian desert, about 150 miles west of Lamasara |
| Incandescent blue sphere | The roof of Farseer Tower in Katapesh |
| Pale blue rhomboid | A small hill in the Cairnlandm outside Absalom |
| Pale lavender ellipsoid | The eastern precipice of a canyon in the Mana Wastes |
| Pink and green sphere | Miregrold Manor, the Pathfinder lodge in Karcau |
| Pearly white spindle | A copse of trees 1 mile west of Kalabuto |

**Legacy**

The Wayfinder of Many Paths sits in a lead-lined box in one of the Grand Lodge's vaults, unused except by those trusted by the Decemvirate. The brief duration of the gateways means that any expedition must be either painfully short or equipped to survive until return is possible.

**Doorway to Adventure:** Recent efforts to turn the Hao ]in Tapestry into a means of quickly traveling vast distances still rely on extensive work to set up permanent gateways into and out of the tapestry's demiplane, whereas the Wayfinder of Many Paths not only enables instant transportation, but also connects to unknown locations. Any Pathfinder agent would leap at the chance to use the Wayfinder of Many Paths, but few are actually aware it exists.

**Failed Explorations:** The most recent expedition was conducted by then Master of Spells Sorrina Westyr, who disappeared into an untested gateway with her party of four elite agents and the Wayfinder of Many Paths. Inexplicably, the wayfinder reappeared in the Grand Lodge a week later without any clue as to how it returned, what became of Sorrina, or where the fitted ioun stone went. Divinations continually fail to discern the whereabouts of Sorrina Westyr and her companions or the type of ioun stone they had been testing at the time, but it has been only a dozen years since they disappeared. It is possible that they are still alive, though where and in what condition is anyone's guess.
