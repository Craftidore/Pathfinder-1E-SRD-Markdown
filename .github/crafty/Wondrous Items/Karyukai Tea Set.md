# Karyukai Tea Set
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th

**Slot** —

**Price** 38,160 gp

**Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

This tea set includes an array of utensils, painted with pictures of willows and flowers, used in traditional tea ceremonies: a small teapot, three bowls of various sizes and shapes, six cups, bamboo utensils (a ladle, a scoop, and a whisk), and several smaller containers, all stored in a wooden box. Once per day, a user can spend 1 hour performing a tea ceremony with the tea set. At the end of this time, the user must make a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check. The tea used in the ceremony must be green tea of exceptional quality (worth a minimum of 10 gp per dose) or the user takes a –4 penalty on her [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] roll to perform the ceremony. Up to six creatures (including the user) can drink the tea brewed during the ceremony. The tea’s aroma arouses a sense of serenity in those who drink it, as they receive an impression of the sights, sounds, and smells of a blooming willow grove at sunset. The result of the user’s [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check determines the effects of the tea on those who drink it.
