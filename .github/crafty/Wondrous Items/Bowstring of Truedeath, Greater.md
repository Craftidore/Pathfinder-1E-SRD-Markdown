## Overview
**Aura** faint; (DC 17) evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 10,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This silver bowstring is worked with amethyst and crafted to aid in sending undead to their final rest. It causes all arrows fired from the weapon it is fitted to do an extra 1d6 points of damage to undead and to function as a *[[Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* weapon. Additionally the weapon it is strung on can deliver sneak attacks and critical hits against undead as if they were living creatures.

A *bowstring of greater truedeath* functions only when attached to a bow with a magical enhancement bonus of +3 or higher. The bow’s “effective” bonus; for example, a +1 *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]] [[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]] [[Flaming Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming burst]]* shortbow all count towards this requirement.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]*

**Cost** 5,000 gp
