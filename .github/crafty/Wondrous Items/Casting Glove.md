**Description**

A casting glove is a spellcaster’s best friend. Like a *[[Glove of Storing|glove of storing]]*, a *casting glove* stores one item weighing up to 20 pounds. However, the wearer can make use of a stored potion, rod, scroll, staff, or wand without retrieving it. The major reason that adventurers prefer to channel the magic of stored items is that doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

A *casting glove* is a black leather gauntlet with small silver and gold runes around the tip of each finger. Because the magic used in its creation smooths out any imperfections in the leather and eliminates any seams, the glove feels smooth to the touch. When the wearer snaps her fingers, the runes on the fi ngertips flash briefly. When she uses the glove to summon or store an item, arcane energy crackles between her fingers.

A *casting glove* has two functions. Storing or retrieving an item requires a command word but is a free action. Using a magic item without first retrieving it requires a standard action.

On the wearer’s command, one item held in the hand wearing the glove disappears and is stored in it, as with a *[[Glove of Storing|glove of storing]]*. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds, and the wearer must be able to hold it in one hand. The item is actually shrunk down so small that it cannot be seen and is held in stasis within the glove. While thus stored, the item has negligible weight. By snapping the fingers of the hand wearing the glove, the wearer causes the item to reappear. A glove stores only one item at a time. Spell durations are not arrested; any active spell effects continue to run normally. If an effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item reappears instantly. The effect that distinguishes a casting glove from a *[[Glove of Storing|glove of storing]]* is the former’s ability to channel the magic of certain items without retrieving them. Once per round, the wearer of a *casting glove* can call upon one effect of a stored potion, rod, wand, scroll, or staff as if he were holding the item in his hand. Potions function as if the wearer had drunk them, and scrolls function as if the wearer had read them. (Later, when the wearer retrieves these items, the scroll page is blank, and the potion vial is empty.) Channeling the power of a rod, staff, or wand in this way expends charges from it normally, and the effect is generated as if the wearer were holding the item. If the item has multiple functions, the wearer chooses one in the normal fashion.
