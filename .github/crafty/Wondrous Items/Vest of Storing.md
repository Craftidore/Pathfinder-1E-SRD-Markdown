# Vest of Storing
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 6th

**Slot** chest

**Price** 4,000 gp

**Weight** â€”

**Description**

This soft leather vest has four distinct "emblems" sewn into it. When the wearer touches an item to an emblem (a move-equivalent action), the item disappears into an extradimensional space. If the wearer later touches the emblem (another move-equivalent action), the item appears in that hand. Only one item can be "stored" in each emblem, and each item must weigh no more than 20 pounds and be able to be held in one hand. If the vest's power is suppressed or dispelled, the items appear and fall to the floor. Neither storing nor retrieving an item provokes attacks of opportunity, making it an ideal storage space for otherwise hard-to-retrieve items such as scrolls or musical instruments. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]*

**Cost** 2,000 gp
