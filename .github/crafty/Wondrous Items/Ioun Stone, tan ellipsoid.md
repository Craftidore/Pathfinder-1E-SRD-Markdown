# Ioun Stone, tan ellipsoid
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,240 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Primarily of use to spellcasters who engage in mage duels, this stone affords a +4 enhancement bonus to [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks made to identify a spell being cast, identify a spell effect in place, or determine an aura’s school when using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 1,120 gp
