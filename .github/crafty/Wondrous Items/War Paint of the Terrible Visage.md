# War Paint of the Terrible Visage
## Overview
**Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 1st 

**Slot** none

**Price** 100 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has enough material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one creature’s face. Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly mélange of colors, making her appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see her painted face within 30 feet to be affected by *[[Cause Fear (Spell)|cause fear]]* (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint’s magic; otherwise it fades away.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Cause Fear (Spell)|cause fear]]*

**Cost** 50 gp

**Source:** Ultimate Equipment, pg. 324
