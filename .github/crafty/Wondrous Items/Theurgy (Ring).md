# Theurgy (Ring)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 12th

**Slot** ring

**Price** 20,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

Often carved from a single piece of polished coral, a ring of theurgy functions differently depending on which type of arcane spellcaster wears it. For wizards and other characters who prepare spells, the ring serves as a small and quickly accessible spellbook capable of storing up to three spells of any level the wearer can cast. As a move action, the wearer can transfer any spell in the ring to an empty spell slot of the appropriate level, with the spell instantly ready to be cast as if previously prepared. The wearer can’t transfer a spell from a *ring of theurgy* to an expended spell slot, but only to a spell slot that he deliberately left empty in order to prepare a spell, providing some degree of spontaneity in the spells he has available even though he gains no additional spells per day. For example, a 5th-level wizard might store *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]], [[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]],* and *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* in the ring, then leave one 3rd-level spell slot open to be used for offense, defense, or escape as necessary.

Sorcerers and other characters who don’t prepare spells gain a different benefit from a *ring of theurgy*. Each spell stored in the ring is usable as an additional spell known as long as the character has an unused spell slot of the appropriate level. The stored spell disappears from the ring when cast, but the wearer can then have spells not on her spell list cast into the ring to be used again. For example, a bard who doesn’t have *[[Invisibility Sphere (Spell)|invisibility sphere]]* on her list of spells known could have the spell put into a ring of theurgy by her party’s wizard so that both characters have the spell available if needed.

Any material components or XP components are provided at the time the spell is cast from the ring, not at the time it is put into the ring to be stored for later retrieval.
