# Bag of Tricks, rust
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 8,500 gp

**Description**

This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill. 

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to 10 animals can be drawn from the bag each week, but no more than two per day. Statistics for these animals can be found in the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*.


| **d%** | **Animal** |

| 61–85 | Boar |
| 86–100 | Leopard |

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Summon Nature's Ally III (Spell)|summon nature’s ally III]]*

**Cost** 4,250 gp
