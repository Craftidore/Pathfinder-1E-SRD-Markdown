# Tomebound Eye
## Overview
**Aura** Faint; (DC 17) enchantment; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 7,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

*The watchful eye of the god of magic stares out from this seal.*

When affixed to a wizard’s spellbook, this seal provides a focus for arcane energy. A *tomebound eye* has 3 charges, which are renewed each day at dawn. Spending 1 or more charges when you prepare your wizard spells from a spellbook to which a *tomebound eye* is attached grants one or more spells a competence bonus on caster level checks to overcome a target’s spell resistance.

*1 charge:* Gain a +4 competence bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance.

*2 charges:* Gain a +6 competence bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance.

*3 charges:* Gain a +8 competence bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance.

You can divide the 3 charges between spells, or spend all three to enhance a single spell. For example, you could grant three spells each a +4 bonus, one spell a +6 bonus and another a +4 bonus, or a single spell a +8 bonus. No spellbook can have more than one of these items affixed to it, and you can’t gain benefits from more than one eye in a given day.
