# Hand of Glory
## Overview
**Aura** faint varied; **CL** 5th

**Slot** neck

**Price** 8,000 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This mummified human hand hangs by a leather cord around a characterâ€™s neck (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* and *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* each once per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]], [[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]], [[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]*

**Cost** 4,000 gp
