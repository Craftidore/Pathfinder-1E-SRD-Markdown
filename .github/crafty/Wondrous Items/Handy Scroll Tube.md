# Handy Scroll Tube
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 6th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 8,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb. 

**Description**

This [[Adamantine|adamantine]] tube will hold up to 100 scrolls or similar items (anything of the size and flexibility of a sheet of parchment). When the owner reaches into it for a scroll, that scroll is always the first one he finds. Thus, no searching through the pages is ever necessary. Drawing a scroll from the tube is a move-equivalent action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 

In addition, the caster level of any spell cast from a scroll taken from this tube is increased by +1 for all purposes. This increase only applies if the owner begins casting the spell on the same turn he pulled the scroll from the tube (even if the casting time is longer than one standard action, as long as the casting begins on the same turn, the effect applies). If a scroll has more than one spell, it must be put back into the tube before the caster level increase will apply again.  

The tube has a hardness of 20 and 20 hp, making it an excellent safeguard for its contents as well. If the tube's power is suppressed or dispelled, the scrolls remain within, but cannot be accessed until the item functions once again.  

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* 

**Cost** 4,000 gp
