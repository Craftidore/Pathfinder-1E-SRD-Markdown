# Ritual of Soulforging
## Overview
Ritual of Soulforging

[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]]; Level 5th

**Casting Time:** 5 hours

**Components:** V, S, M (engraved gemstones worth at least 10,000 gp), F (a complete mechanical body made of actuators, springs, 

                           and gears worth at least 5,000 gp), SC (up to 4)

**Skill Checks:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) DC 28, 3 successes; [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) DC 28, 2 successes (Priests of Rava may substitute [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[religion]); see text

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One humanoid creature

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Midgard Player's Guide (Open Design), pg. 16

You and the subject chant and act in unison to trigger the soul’s migration into the waiting deathless, tireless body of iron and brass. If the incantation succeeds, the subject’s old body dies and the new clockwork body is animated with life. The subject is effectively reincarnated as a [[Gearforged (Race)|gearforged]] PC and continues adventuring in that form.

**Failure:** After the first failed check, the subject’s soul is removed from his or her body but not yet constrained in the new one. The soul attacks you as a [[Wraith (Bestiary PF1)|wraith]] (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). If a second skill check fails, the incantation fails completely: you and any other casters suffer 3d8 damage (Fort DC 15 + your Int modifier) and the subject dies. If the save is successful, the subject is either imprisoned in a gem (as per *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]*, if a 500 gp or better gem was prepared in advance) or released to the world as a [[Ghost (Domain)|ghost]] or [[Wraith (Bestiary PF1)|wraith]].

**Backlash:** The unbound spirit attacks the primary caster three times as a [[Ghost (Bestiary PF1)|ghost]]. A [[Cleric|cleric]] can use the [[Turn Undead (Feat)|Turn Undead]] feat to prevent the [[Ghost (Bestiary PF1)|ghost]] from attacking during the soul transfer process. In this case, the [[Ghost (Bestiary PF1)|ghost]] is simply docile and does not attempt to flee during the ritual.
