# Disable Device (Skill)
## Overview
**Disable Device (Dex; Armor Check Penalty; Trained Only)**

You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.

**Check:** When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded.

The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).


-tx-
| |  | **Disable**<br>**Device DC\*** |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Device** | **Time** | **Example** |
| Simple | 1 round | 10 | Jam a lock |
| Tricky | 1d4 rounds | 15 | Sabotage a wagon wheel |
| Difficult | 2d4 rounds | 20 | Disarm a trap, reset a trap |
| Extreme | 2d4 rounds | 25 | Disarm a complex trap, cleverly sabotage a clockwork device |
| \* If you attempt to leave behind no trace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC. ||||

**Open Locks:** The DC for opening a lock depends on its quality. If you do not have a set of thieves’ tools, these DCs increase by 10.


| **Lock Quality** | **Disable Device DC** |
|---|---|
| Simple | 20 |
| Average | 25 |
| Good | 30 |
| Superior | 40 |

**Action:** The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. A tricky or difficult device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a full-round action.

**Try Again:** Varies. You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less. You can retry checks made to open locks.

**Special:** If you have the [[Deft Hands (Feat)|Deft Hands]] feat, you get a bonus on Disable Device checks (see Chapter 5 of the PFRG Rulebook 1).

A rogue who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it without disarming it. A rogue can rig a trap so her allies can bypass it as well.

**Restriction:** Characters with the trapfinding ability (like rogues) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

The spells *[[Fire Trap (Spell)|fire trap]]**,* *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]**, symbol*, and *[[Teleportation Circle (Spell)|teleportation circle]]* also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. *[[Spike Growth (Spell)|Spike growth]]* and *[[Spike Stones (Spell)|spike stones]]*, however, create magic hazards against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

You can reduce the amount of time it takes to disable a device or add a bypass element to an existing trap.

**Bypass Trap:** You try to incorporate a bypass element enabling you to avoid a trap’s effects if you encounter it again later. Doing this imposes a –10 penalty on your Disable Device check. If you succeed, you can not only bypass a trap without disarming it (just as if you had beat the trap’s DC by 10 or more—but also add a bypass element allowing you or your companions to avoid triggering the trap again later. For example, you could insert a wedge that blocks the gears of a mechanical trap, or pick out a narrow path between the pressure plates that trigger poison darts from the wall.

**Quick Disable:** You can try to disable a device more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to disable any device to a full-round action, add +20 to the DC. For example, a trap that normally requires a DC 20 check and 2d4 rounds to disarm could be disabled in 1 round with a successful DC 40 check.

You can rush an Disable Device (v3.5 Open Lock) attempt, reducing the amount of time it takes to perform the attempt.

**Quick Lockpick:** You can try to open a lock more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to open any lock to a move action, add 20 to the DC. For example, opening an average lock normally requires a DC 25 check and requires a full-round action. To open the lock as a move action requires a DC 45 check.
