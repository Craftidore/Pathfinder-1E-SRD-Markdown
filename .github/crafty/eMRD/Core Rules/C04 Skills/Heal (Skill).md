# Heal (Skill)
## Overview
**Heal (Wis)**

You are skilled at tending to wounds and ailments.

**Check**: The DC and effect of a Heal check depend on the task you attempt.


| **Task** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| First aid | 15 |
| Long-term care | 15 |
| Treat wounds from caltrops, *[[Spike Growth (Spell)\|spike growth]]**,* or *[[Spike Stones (Spell)\|spike stones]]* | 15 |
| Treat deadly wounds | 20 |
| Treat poison | Poison’s save DC |
| Treat disease | Disease’s save DC |

*First Aid*: You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see Appendix 2 for rules on bleed damage).

*Long-Term Care*: Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.

You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

*Treat Wounds from Caltrops,* *[[Spike Growth (Spell)|Spike Growth]]**, or* *[[Spike Stones (Spell)|Spike Stones]]*: A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.

A creature wounded by a *[[Spike Growth (Spell)|spike growth]]* or *[[Spike Stones (Spell)|spike stones]]* spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.

*Treat Deadly Wounds*: When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer’s kit to perform this task. You take a –2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer’s kit that you lack.

*Treat Poison*: To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.

*Treat Disease*: To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.

**Action**: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a *[[Spike Growth (Spell)|spike growth]]* or *[[Spike Stones (Spell)|spike stones]]* spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.

**Try Again**: Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.

**Special**: A character with the [[Self-Sufficient (Feat)|Self-Sufficient]] feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see Chapter 5 of the PFRG Core Rulebook 1).

A healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.

You can use the Heal skill to determine what killed a dead creature. The difficulty of this task depends on the nature of the death itself, as shown on the table below.


| **Cause of Death** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Physical wounds | 0 |
| Environmental (fire, suffocation, etc.) | 5 |
| Spell with visible effects | 10 |
| Poison | 15 |
| Spell with no visible effects | 20 |

Each day that passes between the time of the creature’s death and the time the examination is made increases the DC of the Heal check to determine the cause of death by 5.

**Action:** Making a Heal check to determine the cause of a creature’s death takes 10 minutes.

**Try Again:** Yes, but it takes 10 more minutes for each check.
