# Linguistics (Skill)
## Overview
**Linguistics (Int; Trained Only)**

You are skilled at working with language, in both its spoken and written forms. You can speak multiple languages, and can decipher nearly any tongue given enough time. Your skill in writing allows you to create and detect forgeries as well.

**Check**: You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.) 

Both the Linguistics check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly by the GM, so that you can’t tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.


| **Condition** | **Linguistics** **Check Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Type of document unknown to reader | –2 |
| Type of document somewhat known to reader | +0 |
| Type of document well known to reader | +2 |
| Handwriting not known to reader | –2 |
| Handwriting somewhat known to reader | +0 |
| Handwriting intimately known to reader | +2 |
| Reader only casually reviews the document | –2 |
| Document contradicts orders or knowledge | +2 |

*Create or Detect Forgeries*: Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person’s handwriting is needed.

The Linguistics check is made secretly, so that you’re not sure how good your forgery is. As with [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]], you don’t make a check until someone examines the work. Your Linguistics check is opposed by the Linguistics check of the person who examines the document to verify its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers if any of the conditions are listed on the table found on the previous page.

*Learn a Language*: Whenever you put a rank into this skill, you learn to speak and read a new language. Common languages (and their typical speakers) include the following.

- Abyssal (demons and other chaotic evil outsiders)
- Aklo (derros, inhuman or otherworldly monsters, evil fey)
- Aquan (aquatic creatures, water-based creatures)
- Auran (flying creatures, air-based creatures)
- Celestial (angels and other good outsiders)
- Common (humans and the core races from Chapter 2 of the **PFRG Core Rulebook**.)
- Draconic (dragons, reptilian humanoids)
- Druidic (druids only)
- Dwarven (dwarves)
- Elven (elves, half-elves)
- Giant (cyclopses, ettins, giants, ogres, trolls)
- Gnome (gnomes)
- Goblin (bugbears, goblins, hobgoblins)
- Gnoll (gnolls)
- Halfling (halflings)
- Ignan (fire-based creatures)
- Infernal (devils and other lawful evil outsiders)
- Orc (orcs, half-orcs)
- Sylvan (centaurs, fey creatures, plant creatures, unicorns)
- Terran (earth-based creatures)
- Undercommon (drow, duergar, morlocks, svirfneblin)

**Action**: Varies. Deciphering a page of ordinary text takes 1 minute (10 consecutive rounds). Creating a forgery can take anywhere from 1 minute to 1d4 minutes per page. Detecting a forgery using Linguistics takes 1 round of examination per page.

**Try Again**: Yes.

**Special**: You must be trained to use this skill, but you can always attempt to read archaic and strange forms of your own racial bonus languages. In addition, you can also always attempt to detect a forgery.

You can use the Linguistics skill to create a private cipher. This code system allows you (or anyone with the proper key) to record information without the risk of others reading it. Any document you create using your private cipher can be read only by you or someone who has the proper decoding information. Other characters with ranks in the Linguistics skill can attempt to decipher the code. The DC for such a decoding attempt is 10 + your total skill modifier at the time that you create the cipher. (In effect, you “take 10” on a skill check to create the cipher, and those attempting to decode it make a Linguistics check opposed by your take 10 result.)

**Action:** Creating a cipher takes a week of uninterrupted work. The first attempt to decipher a code system created by the Linguistics skill requires a day of uninterrupted work, and subsequent retries each take a week’s time.

**Try Again:** You can attempt to decipher a private cipher more than once, but you must spend a great deal of time on each retry attempt. Each attempt to decipher a code beyond your first attempt takes a week’s worth of uninterrupted work. The first attempt to decipher a code system requires only one day’s work.

In addition to the common languages summarized in the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook,* Freeport is home to a smattering of other languages as described on Table 3–1: Freeport Languages.

**Naval Code**

An ancient alphabet code with roots in the great elven navies that flourished before the sinking of Valossa, naval code has since been modified to the Common alphabet and is ubiquitous throughout the human kingdoms.

The naval code substitutes long and short pulses of light for letters, using a signal lantern or heliograph for transmission. A signal lantern can reliably communicate up to 3 miles during the day and 10 miles at night or in overcast conditions. A heliograph disk can transmit messages over the horizon by projecting light against the bottom of clouds. Its use is limited by weather conditions, but reliable communication at 20 or more miles is not uncommon.

**Semaphore**

The semaphore flag code is an alphabet signaling system based on the waving of a pair of hand-held flags in a particular pattern. It can be used to communicate in any language based on the Common alphabet, though variants may exist for other alphabets. The range of this communication is limited to line of sight, but is relatively swift: a full sentence can be communicated with a full-round action.

Semaphore is in common use by merchant seamen, who frequently maintain a signal officer on longer voyages. The code is widely disparaged by pirates, whose idea of signaling with a flag is hoisting the skull and crossbones.
