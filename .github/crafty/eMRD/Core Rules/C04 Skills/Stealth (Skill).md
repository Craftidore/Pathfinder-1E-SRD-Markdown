# Stealth (Skill)
## Overview
**Stealth (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)**

You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip past foes or strike from an unseen position. This skill covers hiding and moving silently.

**Check**: Your Stealth check is opposed by the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check of anyone who might notice you. You can move up to half your normal speed and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than half but less than your normal speed, you take a –5 penalty. It’s impossible to use Stealth while attacking, running, or charging.

A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Stealth checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.

If people are observing you using any of their senses (but typically sight), you can’t use Stealth. Against most creatures, f inding cover or concealment allows you to use Stealth. If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check), you can attempt to use Stealth. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Stealth check if you can get to an unobserved place of some kind. This check, however, is made at a –10 penalty because you have to move fast.

*Sniping*: If you’ve already successfully used Stealth at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack and then immediately use Stealth again. You take a –20 penalty on your Stealth check to maintain your obscured location.

*Creating a Diversion to Hide*: You can use [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] to allow you to use Stealth. A successful [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.

**Action**: Usually none. Normally, you make a Stealth check as part of movement, so it doesn’t take a separate action. However, using Stealth immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.

**Special**: If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if you’re moving.

If you have the [[Stealthy (Feat)|Stealthy]] feat, you get a bonus on Stealth checks (see Chapter 5 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*).

You can blend into a crowd, slip between areas of cover or concealment to maintain secrecy, sneak up on a foe, or tail a target.

**Blend into a Crowd:** You can use the Stealth (v3.5 Hide) skill to blend into a crowd, but doing so conceals you only from someone scanning the area to find you. You remain visible to everyone around you, and if they happen to be hostile they’re likely to point you out.

**Move between Cover:** If you’re already hiding (thanks to cover or concealment) and you have at least 5 ranks in Stealth (v3.5 Hide), you can make a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check (with a penalty) to try to move across an area that does not offer cover or concealment without revealing yourself. For every 5 ranks in Stealth (v3.5 Hide) you possess, you can move up to 5 feet between one hiding place and another. For every 5 feet of open space you must cross between hiding places, you take a –5 penalty on your Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check. If you move at more than one-half your speed, you also take the normal penalty on Stealth (v3.5 Hide) checks when moving quickly (–10 for moving faster than normal speed, or –5 for moving between half speed and normal speed).

You can also use this option to sneak up on someone from a hiding place. For every 5 feet of open space between you and the target, you take a –5 penalty on your Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check. If your Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check succeeds, your target doesn’t notice you until you attack or make some other attention-grabbing action. Such a target is treated as being [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] with respect to you.

For example, Lidda the 2nd-level rogue could attempt to dash across a 5-foot-wide doorway without revealing her presence to the orcs inside. Even though the open doorway provides no cover or concealment, she can attempt a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check as normal, opposed by the orcs’ Spot checks. She takes a –5 penalty on her check because of the distance involved. If she moved at more than half her speed, she would take an additional –5 or –10 penalty on the check depending on how fast she moved (see above).

**Tail Someone:** You can try to follow someone while remaining unseen. If you stay at least 60 feet away from your quarry, you must succeed on a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check (opposed by your quarry’s [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5Spot check) once every 10 minutes. At a distance of less than 60 feet, you must make a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check each round. Extraordinary actions on your part (such as spellcasting or attacking) may disrupt this attempt even if you do not fail a check.

Tailing someone still requires cover or concealment, as normal for attempting a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check. A moderately crowded street provides sufficient cover and concealment to accomplish this goal. Alternatively, you can duck between areas of cover or concealment, as described in Move between Cover (see above).

Even if you fail a Stealth (v3.5 Hide) check while tailing someone or you are spotted while moving too great a distance between hiding places, you can attempt a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check opposed by your quarry’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check to look innocuous. Success means your quarry sees you but doesn’t realize you’re tailing him; failure alerts him that you’re actually following. A modifier may apply to the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check, depending on how suspicious your quarry is. The table below provides [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] modifiers for particular situations.


| **[[Sense Motive (Skill)\|Sense Motive]]** |  |
|---|---|
| **Your Quarry...** | **DC Modifier** |
| Is sure nobody is following | –5 |
| Has no reason to suspect anybody is following | +0 |
| Is worried about being followed | +10 |
| Is worried about being followed and knows you’re an enemy | +20 |
