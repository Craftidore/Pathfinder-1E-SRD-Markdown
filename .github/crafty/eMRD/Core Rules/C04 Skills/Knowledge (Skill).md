# Knowledge (Skill)
## Overview
**Knowledge (Int; Trained Only)**

You are educated in a field of study and can answer both simple and complex questions. Like the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], and [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of different specialties. Below are listed typical fields of study.

- Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
- Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)
- Engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)
- Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
- History (wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
- Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)
- Nature (animals, fey, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
- Nobility (lineages, heraldry, personalities, royalty)
- Planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the [[Astral Plane]], the [[Ethereal Plane]], outsiders, planar magic)
- Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)

**Check**: Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions). You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR, or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information. Many of the Knowledge skills have specific uses as noted on Table 4–6.

**Action**: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).

**Try Again**: No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.

**Untrained**: You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10. If you have access to an extensive library that covers a specific skill, this limit is removed. The time to make checks using a library, however, increases to 1d4 hours. Particularly complete libraries might even grant a bonus on Knowledge checks in the fields that they cover.

**GM Note**

The following was taken from the Paizo forums regarding Knowledge checks vs monsters:

**Knowledge Checks vs Monsters in Pathfinder**

Knowledge skills are one of the most useful skills a Pathfinder can have. They allow you to identify the qualities and powers of enemy creatures (or supposed friendly ones) as a free action, on sight (or other means of detection as the GM rules).

This is a small explanation for both GMs and for players when attempting to use a Knowledge check.

The DC for a Knowledge check versus a monster is the creature's CR (often somewhere around its HD) plus 10. 

For a common monster (such as goblins), decrease the DC of the Knowledge check by 5. (GMs are encouraged to define monsters as common, rare, very rare, or unique for their own campaigns.)

For especially rare monsters (such as the tarrasque), increase the DC of the Knowledge check by 5 (if a GM has defined the rarity of monster within his campaign, then each increase in rarity should result in an increase of the DC of the Knowledge check by 5). 

The type of Knowledge check depends on the monster. 

- Arcana (constructs, dragons, and magical beasts)
- Dungeoneering (aberrations and oozes)
- Local (humanoids)
- Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, and vermin)
- Planes (outsiders)
- Religion (undead)

A successful Knowledge check yields the following information: the creature's Challenge Rating, Type, and Class ("This is a CR 2 Goblin Fighter")

Additionally, success automatically grants you one of three categories of knowledge: Defense, Offense, and Special Abilities. 

- Defense includes: Hit Dice Breakdown ("1 Hit Dice of Zombie, 2 Hit Dice of Cleric"), AC (Including Touch and Flat-Footed), Immunities, Weaknesses, Damage Reduction, Saves, and Defensive Abilities. 
- Offense includes: Speed, Attacks (natural and constructed, but does not include weapons you cannot see on the enemy if they're not visible), Special Attacks, Spell-Like Abilities, Domains, Schools (Specialty and Opposition), and Bloodlines.
- Special Abilities includes: Defensive Abilities, Special Attacks, Spell-Like Abilities, Extraordinary Abilities, Supernatural Abilities, and Senses.

For every 5 you exceed the DC of the check by, you may ask for another category of knowledge about the creature. 

You may not re-try a Knowledge check against a creature or a creature of the exact same type AND class.

## Forbidden Lore
**Forbidden Lore (Knowledge)**

You are familiar with That Which Should Not Be Known, having encountered the awful through various writings, meetings with madness-inducing abominations, and a general exploration of the forbidden in all its unspeakable forms. Since these revelations defy logic or commonly accepted fact, your acquisition of forbidden knowledge depends solely only how much exposure you have to these dark secrets you have experienced.

**Check:** Answering a question about the horrible gods and secrets that lurk at the edges of reality has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for elementary questions), or 20 to 30 (for difficult or really tough questions). Unlike other fields of study, there are almost no really easy questions associated with this dark knowledge.

As with other Knowledge skills, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s Challenge Rating. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the GM can give another piece of useful information. Such information is usually features common to all monsters of that type, with higher check results revealing more of the monster’s capabilities. Monsters, for the purpose of these checks, include aberrations, oozes, undead, and any creature with the extraplanar subtype. At the GM’s option, characters with high ranks (5 or more) in the Knowledge skills appropriate to these monster types may receive a +2 bonus to their Knowledge (forbidden lore) checks.

Knowledge (forbidden lore) checks are also used in conjunction with some spells.

**Action:** Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action—you simply know the answer or you don’t.

**Try Again:** Usually no. If you are trying to identify a creature whose type is covered by another Knowledge skill, such as outsiders and Knowledge (planes), you must choose which skill to use when making this check.

**Special:** You do not place ranks in this skill. Instead, you gain free ranks through exploring forbidden concepts, places, reading forbidden manuscripts, and so on. Regardless of how much material you devour, your Knowledge (forbidden lore) ranks cannot exceed your character level.

**Untrained:** Unlike other Knowledge skills, you cannot make untrained Knowledge (forbidden lore) checks since there are no really easy questions when it comes to this discipline of knowledge.

## Recall Intrigues
**Recall Intrigues (Knowledge)**

You can identify feats and the class features of various classes with successful Knowledge checks when you observe the feats or class features being used.

**Check**: You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the Knowledge check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using [[Cleave (Feat)|Cleave]]) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as [[Arcane Strike (Feat)|Arcane Strike]], [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], or [[Enlarge Spell (Feat)|Enlarge Spell]]), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]] or [[Lightning Reflexes (Feat)|Lightning Reflexes]]), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.

The Knowledge skill required to identify a feat or class feature varies depending on the type of feat or class feature to be identified and is outlined in the Recall Intrigues (Knowledge) table below, along with the DCs of such skill checks.


| **Task** | **Knowledge Skill** | **DC** |
|---|---|---|
| Identify a class feature from a class that grants arcane or psychic spells | Arcana | 10 + class level when feature is granted\* |
| Identify a class feature from a class with access to the druid or ranger spell list | Nature | 10 + class level when feature is granted\* |
| Identify a class feature from another class that grants divine spells | Religion | 10 + class level when feature is granted\* |
| Identify a class feature from any other class | Local | 10 + class level when feature is granted\* |
| Identify a combat feat being used | Local | 10 + character’s level |
| Identify a metamagic feat being used | Arcana | 10 + character’s level |
| Identify a teamwork feat being used | Nobility | 10 + character’s level |
| Identify any other feat being used | Local | 15 + character’s level |
| \* Add 10 to the DC if the class is a prestige class. |  |  |

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Special abilities, attacks and qualities given by templates and archetypes obviously are considered to be class features of the character they have been modified. Adding 5 to the DC for such abilities is a viable house rule.
