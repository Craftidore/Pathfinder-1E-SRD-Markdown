# Craft (Skill)
## Overview
**Craft (Int)**

You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], and [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]], Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.

A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill.

**Check:** You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)

The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.

In some cases, the *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]* spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.

When casting the spell *[[Minor Creation (Spell)|minor creation]]*, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. 

All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.

1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).

2. Find the item’s DC from Table 4–4.

3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.

4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.

**Table 4–4: Craft Skills** 


-tx-
| **Item** | **Craft Skill** | **Craft DC** |
|---|---|---|
| Acid | Alchemy | 15 |
| Alchemist’s fire, smokestick, or tindertwig | Alchemy | 20 |
| Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone | Alchemy | 25 |
| Armor or shield | Armor | 10 + AC bonus |
| Longbow, shortbow, or arrows | Bows | 12 |
| Composite longbow or composite shortbow | Bows | 15 |
| Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating | Bows | 15 + (2 × rating) |
| Mechanical trap | Traps | Varies\* |
| Crossbow, or bolts | Weapons | 15 |
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weapons | 12 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weapons | 15 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weapons | 18 |
| Very simple item (wooden spoon) | Varies | 5 |
| Typical item (iron pot) | Varies | 10 |
| High-quality item (bell) | Varies | 15 |
| Complex or superior item (lock) | Varies | 20 |
| \* Traps have their own rules for construction (see Chapter 13 of the PRPG Rule Book 1). |||

If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

*Progress by the Day:* You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.

*Create Masterwork Items:* You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Chapter 6 for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

*Repair Items:* You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.

**Action:** Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).

**Try Again:** Yes, but each time you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

**Special:** You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.

To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.

A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skill of her choice.

**Simple Rules for Gem Cutting:**


| **Quality** | **Crafting**<br>** DC** | **Increase** <br>**in Value** | **Time Spent** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Very Simple | DC 5 | 0 | 1 hour per 50 gp value/gem |
| Typical | DC 10 | 50% | 2  hours per 50 gp value/gem |
| High-Quality | DC 15 | 100% | 4  hours per 50 gp value/gem |
| Complex | DC 20 | 150% | 6 hours per 50 gp value/gem |
| Superior | DC 25 | 200% | 8 hours per 50 gp value/gem |

+10 increments for speed OR value (double per +10 increment)

Take a raw (previously) uncut gemstone valued at 5 gp in it's uncut state; Very Simple (DC 5) leaves its value unchanged (5 gp); Typical (DC 10) increases its value by 50% (7 gp 5 sp); High Quality (DC 15) increased its value by 100% (10 gp); Complex (DC 20) increases its value by 150% (15 gp); and Superior (DC 25) increases the value by 200% (20 gp).

Since it is likely that the player will spend hours rather than days or weeks cutting individual gems, it is recommended that the GM allow them to do so. 

An uncut gem may only be cut once; the character must state the quality they are attempting otherwise it is always typical. Any roll below the intended quality reduces the value by half instead of increases and a roll of 1 on the DC ALWAYS destroys the uncut gem!

Gems may be recut; doing so quarters the value of the original cut stone and results in 1d4 lesser stones. The process of recutting allows that value of these lesser stones to be increased just as if working with raw stones. Recutting stones is a Complex (DC 20) procedure and requires 6 hours per 50 gp value of the gem. Again, the character cannot take 10, they must roll.

### Book of Gemstones
![[Book of Gemstones.pdf]][[Book of Gemstones.pdf|open outside]]

By voluntarily raising the difficulty of the task before you, you can craft items more quickly than normal. This option first appeared in the *Epic Level Handbook*, but this use of the Craft skill is open to characters of any level provided that they are willing to accept the appropriate penalty.


| **Task** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Quick creation | +10 or more to DC |

**Quick Creation:** You can voluntarily increase the DC of crafting an item by any multiple of 10. This tactic allows you to create an item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your check result to determine progress). You must decide the increase before you make the check.

**Craft (Poisonmaking):** The fine art of refining raw materials into effective poisons requires both patience and care (not to mention discretion, in areas where poisons are outlawed). Making poisons with the Craft (poisonmaking) skill follows the rules in the *Player’s Handbook* for all Craft skills, with the following exceptions.

**Table 3–1: Craft (Poisonmaking) DCs**


-tx-

| \*Ability drain, not ability damage. |||||||

*Price:* The cost of raw materials varies widely depending on whether the character has access to the active ingredient—that is, the venom or plant that actually provides the toxin. If a supply is readily available, the raw materials cost one-sixth of the market price, not one-third. Otherwise, the raw materials cost at least three-quarters of the market price—assuming the substance in question is for sale at all.

*Amount:* To figure out how much poison you are able to create in a week, make a Craft (poisonmaking) check at the end of the week. If the check is successful, multiply the check result by the DC for the check. That result is how many gp worth of poison you created that week. When your total gp created equals or exceeds the market price of one dose of the poison, that dose is fi nished. (You may sometimes be able to create more than one dose in a week, depending on your check result and the market price of the poison.) If you fail the check by 4 or less, you make no progress that week. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to buy them again.

## Create Laminated Steel weapon
*Create Laminated Steel weapons:* Another special type of weapon can only be created by weaponsmiths wilh at least 7 ranks of Craft (weaponsmith) skill. This type of weapon is created using a special forging process, where multiple layers of steel are interspersed with layers of a softer, more pliable metal, such as nickel. These layers are then welded and folded several times. Each fold doubles the number of layers in the steel, until they are practically microscopic. The end effect is a weapon that is both flexible and extremely hard. The soft metal provides the flexibility, and the steel provides the hardness. When the steel is polished and given its edge, the grinding reveals a distinctive wood-grain like pattern in the metal created by the dozens of layers. This process not only increases its durability but also its slicing power, because the numerous micro-thin layers create an invisible serrated edge.

This can be done with any type of slashing or piercing weapon. Weapons must be created with this method; they cannot be modified once they have been forged. The exception to this are the spells *[[Masterwork Transformation (Spell)|masterwork transformation]], [[Fold Steel (Spell)|fold steel]],* and *serration.*

**Benefits of a Laminated Steel Weapon:** A laminated steel weapon gains +1 to all its damage rolls and its critical hit multiplier goes up by one as well. For example, a laminated steel longsword deals 1d8+1 damage and has a x3 critical hit multiplier. Furthermore, the weapon gains +5 to its normal hardness.

**Creating Laminated Steel Weapons:** You can create a laminated steel weapon with a Craft (weaponsmith) check if you have at least 7 ranks in the skill. To create a laminated version of a weapon in the table below, you create the laminated steel component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The laminated steel component has its own price (900 gp) and DC (23). Once both the standard component and the laminated steel component are completed, the item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the laminated steel component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the price of the raw materials.)

However, creating a laminated steel weapon is more difficult and delicate than other special types. Any errors result in a complete loss of raw materials and time spent. If the check to create the laminated sreel component of the weapon fails, the entire process is a complete loss, and you must start completely over.

**TABLE 6-8: LAMINATED WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Slashing)** | **DC (Piercing)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 | 20 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 | 23 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 20 | 25 |

## Create Razor-edge Weapon
*Create Razor-edge Weapon:* A special type of edged weapon can be forged by a skilled weaponsmith, similar to masterwork weapons, wherein the blade of the weapon has a razor-edge to increase its cutting power. This can be done with any type of slashing weapon. Weapons must be created with a razor-edge; they cannot be modified to have a razor-edge once they have been forged, because doing so would destroy the integrity of the blade.

**Benefits of a razor-edge weapon:** A razor-edge weapon has its critical hit threat range increased by +1 (this increase stacks with *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* or [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], but not both (save for specific house rules). For example, a razor-edge longsword has a critical threat range of 18-20, instead of 19-20.

**Creating Razor-edge Weapons:** You can create a razor-edge weapon with a Craft (weaponsmith) check. To create a razor-edge version of a weapon in the table below, you create the razor-edge component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The razor-edge component has its own price (300 gp) and DC (20). Once both the standard component and the razor-edge component are completed, the razor-edged item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the razor-edge component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the price of the raw materials.)

Razor-edge weapons cannot also have a serrated edge; though the razor-edge component can be applied to a laminated weapon.

**TABLE 6-9: RAZOR-EDGE WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Slashing)** |
|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 12 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 |

**Source:** Mercenaries (AEG), pgs. 91-92, AEG website, Mage's Tower website

## Create Serrated Weapon
*Create Serrated Weapon:* A special type of edged weapon can be forged by a skilled weaponsmith, similar to masterwork weapons, wherein the blade of the weapon is serrated to increase its cutting power. This can be done with any type of slashing or piercing weapon. Weapons must be created with a serrated edge; they cannot be modified to have a serrated edge once they have been forged, because doing so would destroy the integrity of the steel.

**Benefits of a serrated weapon:** A serrated weapon has its critical hit threat range increased by +1 (this increase stacks with *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* or *[[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]]*, but not both (save for specific house rules).. For example, a serrated longsword has a critical threat range of 18-20, instead of 19-20.

**Creating Serrated Weapons:** You can create a serrated weapon with a Craft ·(weaponsmith) check. To create a serrated version of a weapon in the table below, you create the serrated component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The serrated component has its own price (300 gp) and DC (20). Once both the standard component and the serrated component are completed, the serrated item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the serrated component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the price of the raw materials.)

**TABLE 6-9: SERRATED WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Slashing)** | **DC (Piercing)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 12 | 17 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 | 20 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 | 23 |

Combining Special Weapon Types: You can combine the effects of masterwork, serrated, and laminated steel. Treat each special type as its own component that must be created separately. Add the extra gold piece cost of each type separately and multiply that by the total number of components. For example, if you wish to create a masterwork serrated laminated steel longsword, the cost would be increased by masterwork (+300), serrated (+300), and laminated steel (+900) times 3. The result would be a masterwork longsword with a hardness of 15, 1d8+1 damage, critical threat range of 18-20, and x3 critical damage multiplier, for 4,545 gp.

Note that the serrated or laminated steel weapon qualities must be added to the masterwork weapon quality.

## Create Tempered Weapon
*Create Tempered Weapon:* A special type of piercing weapon can be forged by a skilled weaponsmith, similar to masterwork weapons, wherein the tip of the weapon has been hardened to increase its piercing power. This can be done with any type of piercing weapon. Weapons must be created with a tempered point; they cannot be modified to have a tempered point once they have been forged, because doing so would destroy the integrity of the blade.

**Benefits of a tempered point weapon:** A tempered point weapon has its critical hit threat range increased by +1 (this increase stacks with *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* or [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], but not both (save for specific house rules). For example, a tempered point [[Rapier|rapier]] has a critical threat range of 17-20, instead of 18-20.

**Creating a Tempered Point Weapon:** You can create a tempered point weapon with a Craft (weaponsmith) check. To create a tempered point version of a weapon in the table below, you create the tempered point component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. tempered point component has its own price (300 gp) and DC (20). Once both the standard component and the tempered point component are completed, the tempered point item is finished. (Note: the price you pay for the tempered point component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the price of the raw materials.)

Tempered point weapons cannot also have a serrated edge; though the tempered point component can be applied to a laminated weapon.

**TABLE 6-9: TEMPERED POINT WEAPONS CREATION**


| **Item** | **Craft** | **DC (Piercing)** |
|---|---|---|
| Simple melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 12 |
| Martial melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 15 |
| Exotic melee or thrown weapon | Weaponsmith | 18 |
