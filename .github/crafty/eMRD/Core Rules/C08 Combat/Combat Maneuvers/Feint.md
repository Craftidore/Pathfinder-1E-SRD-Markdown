# Feint
## Overview
**Feint**

Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s base attack bonus + your opponent’s Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] bonus, if higher. If successful, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

When feinting against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a –8 penalty. Against a creature lacking an Intelligence score, it’s impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Feinting as a Move Action**: With the [[Improved Feint (Feat)|Improved Feint]] feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action.
