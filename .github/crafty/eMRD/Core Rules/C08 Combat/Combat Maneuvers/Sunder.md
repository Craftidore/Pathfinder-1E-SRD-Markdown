# Sunder
## Overview
**Sunder**

You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent as part of an attack action in place of a melee attack. If you do not have the [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]] feat, or a similar ability, attempting to sunder an item provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack is successful, you deal damage to the item normally. Damage that exceeds the objectâ€™s Hardness is subtracted from its hit points. If an object has equal to or less than half its total hit points remaining, it gains the [[Broken|broken]] condition (see Appendix 2). If the damage you deal would reduce the object to less than 0 hit points, you can choose to destroy it. If you do not choose to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 hit point and the [[Broken|broken]] condition.
