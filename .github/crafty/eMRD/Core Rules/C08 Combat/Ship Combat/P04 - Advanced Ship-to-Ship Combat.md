# P04 - Advanced Ship-to-Ship Combat
## Overview
**Advanced Ship-to-Ship Combat**

A pirate ship can be as much of a character as the scoundrels crewing it, and once the PCs get their own ship, it will likely see as much action as do the PCs themselves. Whether the PCs are fighting rival pirates in hand-to-hand combat on the deck of a sailing rig, attacking a merchantman with a hold full of riches to plunder with their own pirate ship, or sending an entire fleet of ships against an enemy armada, naval combat plays a significant role in a nautical campaign. Generally speaking, naval combat is handled in one of three ways: shipboard combat (normal combat on board a ship), ship-to-ship combat (combat between two or more individual ships), and mass naval combat (combat between two or more fleets of multiple ships). The rules for these three types of naval combat are detailed in the following section.

## Shipboard Combat
**Shipboard Combat**

Shipboard combat is just like any other combat between the PCs and their opponents, except the encounter takes place on board a ship, rather than in a dungeon or on a forest path. For the most part, shipboard combat can be resolved normally. The only constraints are the size of the ship (and therefore, the size of the battlefield), the danger of falling overboard into the water, and the effects of weather on the ship.

If the combat happens during a storm or in rough seas, treat the ship’s deck as difficult terrain. Remember to take into account the effects on spellcasters’ concentration checks due to weather or the motion of the ship’s deck. If a combatant falls overboard, see the rules for aquatic terrain and water dangers. In all other ways, shipboard combat functions no differently than combat on land.

## Ship-to-Ship Combat
**Ship-to-Ship Combat**

When ships themselves become a part of a battle, combat becomes unusual. The following rules are not meant to accurately simulate all of the complexities of ship-to-ship combat; rather, they represent an attempt to strike a balance between verisimilitude and ease and speed of play during combat, and can be applied to a vessel of any size, from a simple dinghy to a multi-deck man-o’-war. These rules are a modified version of the vehicles rules found in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat, focusing only on piloting and fighting with a ship on the water. Alternatively, if you’d prefer a quicker and easier way of resolving ship-to-ship combat, you can instead use the fast-play ship combat rules found in the GameMastery Guide. It is important to note that while ships can be attacked in combat, it is difficult to significantly damage such large vehicles. In addition, a captured ship is usually worth more as a prize to be towed or sailed home than sunk to the bottom of the sea. As a result, most ship-to-ship combat ends when the crew of one ship boards another to fight the enemy crew in hand-to-hand combat (see Boarding and Grappling).
