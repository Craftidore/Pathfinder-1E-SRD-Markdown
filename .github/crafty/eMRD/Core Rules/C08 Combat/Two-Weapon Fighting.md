# Two-Weapon Fighting
## Overview
**Two-Weapon Fighting**

If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways. First, if your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light. Second, the [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6. Table 8–7 summarizes the interaction of all these factors.

**Double Weapons**: You can use a double weapon to make an extra attack with the off-hand end of the weapon as if you were fighting with two weapons. The penalties apply as if the off-hand end of the weapon was a light weapon.

**Thrown Weapons**: The same rules apply when you throw a weapon from each hand. Treat a dart or shuriken as a light weapon when used in this manner, and treat a [[Bolas|bolas]], [[Javelin|javelin]], [[Net|net]], or [[Sling|sling]] as a one-handed weapon.

**Table 8–7: Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties**


| **Circumstances** | **Primary Hand** | **Off Hand** |
|---|---|---|
| Normal penalties | –6 | –10 |
| Off-hand weapon is light | –4 | –8 |
| [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)\|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat | –4 | –4 |
| Off-hand weapon is light and [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)\|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat | –2 | –2 |
