# Injury and Death
## Overview
Your hit points measure how hard you are to kill. No matter how many hit points you lose, your character isn’t hindered in any way until your hit points drop to 0 or lower.

**Loss of Hit Points**

The most common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal damage and lose hit points.

**What Hit Points Represent**: Hit points mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow into a less serious one.

**Effects of Hit Point Damage**: Damage doesn’t slow you down until your current hit points reach 0 or lower. At 0 hit points, you’re [[Disabled|disabled]].

If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you are [[Unconscious|unconscious]] and [[Dying|dying]].

When your negative hit point total is equal to your Constitution, you’re [[Dead|dead]].

### Massive Damage
**Massive Damage (Optional Rule)**: If you ever sustain a single attack that deals an amount of damage equal to half your total hit points (minimum 50 points of damage) or more and it doesn’t kill you outright, you must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this saving throw fails, you die regardless of your current hit points. If you take half your total hit points or more in damage from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt more than half your total hit points (minimum 50), the massive damage rule does not apply.

**Massive Damage (Alternate Optional Rule)**: Massive damage scales based on size and the total damage that is incurred. The minimum damage for a Medium size creature is 50 points, for a Large creature is 75 points, for a Huge creature is 100 points, etc., scaling up by 25 points for each increase in size. The Fortitude save DC also scales up based on damage; increasing by +5 for each 5 points of damage over the base for the creature's size. For example, a Medium creature that takes 78 points of damage in a single attack must make a DC 40 Fortitude save.

It should be noted that this alternate rule increases the lethality of the game and should only be used in games where other alternate rules (such as material from third party sources) are allowed that give the players increased options for survival.

## Disabled (0 Hit Points)
**Disabled (0 Hit Points)**

When your current hit point total drops to exactly 0, you are [[Disabled|disabled]].

You gain the [[Staggered|staggered]] condition and can only take a single move or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can you take full-round actions). You can take move actions without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. Unless your activity increased your hit points, you are now at –1 hit points and [[Dying|dying]].

Healing that raises your hit points above 0 makes you fully functional again, just as if you’d never been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.

You can also become [[Disabled|disabled]] when recovering from [[Dying|dying]]. In this case, it’s a step toward recovery, and you can have fewer than 0 hit points (see Stable Characters and Recovery).

## Dying (Negative Hit Points)
**Dying (Negative Hit Points)**

If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you’re [[Dying|dying]].

A [[Dying|dying]] character immediately falls [[Unconscious|unconscious]] and can take no actions.

A [[Dying|dying]] character loses 1 hit point every round. This continues until the character dies or becomes [[Stable|stable]].

## Dead
**Dead**

When your character’s current hit points drop to a negative amount equal to his Constitution score or lower, or if he succumbs to massive damage, he’s [[Dead|dead]]. A character can also die from taking ability damage or suffering an ability drain that reduces his Constitution score to 0 (see Appendix 1 of the *PF Core Rulebook*). Certain types of powerful magic, such as *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* and *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]*, can restore life to a dead character. See Chapter 9 (of the *PF Core Rulebook)* for more information.

## Stable Characters and Recovery
**Stable Characters and Recovery**

On the character’s next turn, after being reduced to negative hit points (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check to become stable. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is stable does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. An [[Unconscious|unconscious]] or [[Dying|dying]] character cannot use any special action that changes the initiative count on which his action occurs.

Characters taking continuous damage, such as from an *[[Acid Arrow (Spell)|acid arrow]]* or a [[Bleed|bleed]] effect, automatically fail all Constitution checks made to stabilize. Such characters lose 1 hit point per round in addition to the continuous damage.

You can keep a [[Dying|dying]] character from losing any more hit points and make him [[Stable|stable]] with a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check.

If any sort of healing cures the [[Dying|dying]] character of even 1 point of damage, he becomes [[Stable|stable]] and stops losing hit points.

Healing that raises the [[Dying|dying]] character’s hit points to 0 makes him conscious and [[Disabled|disabled]]. Healing that raises his hit points to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he’d never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 hit points.

A [[Stable|stable]] character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit points naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.

**Recovering with Help**: One hour after a tended, [[Dying|dying]] character becomes [[Stable|stable]], the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check to become conscious. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Conscious characters with negative hit point totals are treated as [[Disabled|disabled]] characters (see page 189 of the *PF Core Rulebook*). If the character remains [[Unconscious|unconscious]], he receives another check every hour to regain consciousness. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. Even if [[Unconscious|unconscious]], the character recovers hit points naturally. He automatically regains consciousness when his hit points rise to 1 or higher.

**Recovering without Help**: A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance of recovering on his own. Treat such characters as those attempting to recover with help, but every failed Constitution check to regain consciousness results in the loss of 1 hit point. An unaided character does not recover hit points naturally. Once conscious, the character can make a DC 10 Constitution check once per day, after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become [[Unconscious|unconscious]]. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing hit points naturally.

## Healing
**Healing**

After taking damage, you can recover hit points through natural healing or through magical healing. In any case, you can’t regain hit points past your full normal hit point total.

**Natural Healing**: With a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per character level. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing that night.

If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice your character level in hit points.

**Magical Healing**: Various abilities and spells can restore hit points.

**Healing Limits**: You can never recover more hit points than you lost. Magical healing won’t raise your current hit points higher than your full normal hit point total.

**Healing Ability Damage**: Temporary ability damage returns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected ability score. Complete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each affected ability score.

## Temporary Hit Points
**Temporary Hit Points**

Certain effects give a character temporary hit points. These hit points are in addition to the character’s current hit point total and any damage taken by the character is subtracted from these hit points first. Any damage in excess of a character’s temporary hit points is applied to his current hit points as normal. If the effect that grants the temporary hit points ends or is dispelled, any remaining temporary hit points go away. The damage they sustained is not transferred to the character’s current hit points.

When temporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as real hit points can be, even by magic.

**Increases in Constitution Score and Current Hit Points**: An increase in a character’s Constitution score, even a temporary one, can give her more hit points (an effective hit point increase), but these are not temporary hit points. They can be restored, and they are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

**Temporary Hit Points: Do temporary hit point from the same source stack?**

No. Generally, effects do not stack if they are from the same source (Core Rulebook page 208, Combining Magical Effects). Although temporary hit points are not a "bonus," the principle still applies.

This prevents a creature with [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]] (which grants the creature 5 temporary hit points when used) from draining an entire village of 100 people in order to gain 500 temporary hit points before the PCs arrive to fight it.

Temporary hit points from different sources (such as an *[[Aid (Spell)|aid]]* spell, a use of [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]], and a *[[Vampiric Touch (Spell)|vampiric touch]]* spell) still stack with each other.

## Nonlethal Damage
**Nonlethal Damage**

Nonlethal damage represents harm to a character that is not life-threatening. Unlike normal damage, nonlethal damage is healed quickly with rest.

**Dealing Nonlethal Damage**: Certain attacks deal nonlethal damage. Other effects, such as heat or being [[Exhausted|exhausted]], also deal nonlethal damage. When you take nonlethal damage, keep a running total of how much you’ve accumulated. Do not deduct the nonlethal damage number from your current hit points. It is not “real” damage. Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you’re [[Staggered|staggered]] (see below), and when it exceeds your current hit points, you fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]].

*Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Lethal Damage*: You can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, but you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll.

*Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage*: You can use a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll.

**Staggered and Unconscious**: When your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you’re [[Staggered|staggered]]. You can only take a standard action or a move action in each round (in addition to free, immediate, and swift actions). You cease being [[Staggered|staggered]] when your current hit points once again exceed your nonlethal damage.

When your nonlethal damage exceeds your current hit points, you fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]]. While [[Unconscious|unconscious]], you are [[Helpless|helpless]] (see page 567 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

Spellcasters who fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]] retain any spellcasting ability they had before going [[Unconscious|unconscious]].

If a creature’s nonlethal damage is equal to his total maximum hit points (not his current hit points), all further nonlethal damage is treated as lethal damage. This does not apply to creatures with regeneration. Such creatures simply accrue additional nonlethal damage, increasing the amount of time they remain [[Unconscious|unconscious]].

**Healing Nonlethal Damage**: You heal nonlethal damage at the rate of 1 hit point per hour per character level. When a spell or ability cures hit point damage, it also removes an equal amount of nonlethal damage.

## Movement, Position, and Distance
**MOVEMENT, POSITION, AND DISTANCE**

Miniatures are on the 30mm scale—a miniature of a 6-foot-tall man is approximately 30mm tall. A square on the battle grid is 1 inch across, representing a 5-foot-by-5-foot area.

## Moving Through a Square
**Moving Through a Square**

You can move through an unoccupied square without difficulty in most circumstances. Difficult terrain and a number of spell effects might hamper your movement through open spaces.

**Friend**: You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn’t provide you with cover (see page 195 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

**Opponent**: You can’t move through a square occupied by an opponent unless the opponent is [[Helpless|helpless]]. You can move through a square occupied by a [[Helpless|helpless]] opponent without penalty. Some creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even when [[Helpless|helpless]]. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.

**Ending Your Movement**: You can’t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is [[Helpless|helpless]].

**Overrun**: During your movement, you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent (see page 201 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

**Tumbling**: A trained character can attempt to use [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move through a square occupied by an opponent (see the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill).

**Very Small Creature**: A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.

**Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller**: Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than itself.

A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is. Creatures moving through squares occupied by other creatures provoke attacks of opportunity from those creatures.

**Designated Exceptions**: Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill or similar special abilities.

## Big and Little Creatures in Combat
**BIG AND LITTLE CREATURES IN COMBAT**

Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.

**Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures**: Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. 25 Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can’t flank an enemy.

**Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures**: Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.

Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.

Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.

Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less.

## Combat Modifiers
**COMBAT MODIFIERS**

A number of factors and conditions can influence an attack roll. Many of these situations grant a bonus or penalty on attack rolls or to a defender’s Armor Class.

### Cover
**Cover**

To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).

When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from any corner of your square to the target’s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.

**Low Obstacles and Cover**: A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he’s closer to the obstacle than his target.

**Cover and Attacks of Opportunity**: You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.

**Cover and Reflex Saves**: Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.

**Cover and Stealth Checks**: You can use cover to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check.

**Soft Cover**: Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check.

**Big Creatures and Cover**: Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.

**Partial Cover**: If a creature has cover, but more than half the creature is visible, its cover bonus is reduced to a +2 to AC and a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws. This partial cover is subject to the GM’s discretion.

**Total Cover**: If you don’t have line of effect to your target (that is, you cannot draw any line from your square to your target’s square without crossing a solid barrier), he is considered to have total cover from you. You can’t make an attack against a target that has total cover.

**Improved Cover**: In some cases, such as attacking a target hiding behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks.

### Cover
![[Cover 2.png|Cover|300]]
[[Cover 2.png|open outside]]

### Concealment
**Concealment**

To determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target’s square passes through a square or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment.

When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that isn’t adjacent to you, use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks. 

In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.

**Concealment Miss Chance**: Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. Make the attack normally—if the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance d% roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.

**Concealment and Stealth Checks**: You can use concealment to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check.

**Total Concealment**: If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight, he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can’t attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).

You can’t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.

**Ignoring Concealment**: Concealment isn’t always effective. An area of dim lighting or darkness doesn’t provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance than other characters with the same light source. Although *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks when not moving (even though opponents can’t see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual or auditory clues).

**Varying Degrees of Concealment**: Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.

### Flanking
**Flanking**

When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by another enemy character or creature on its opposite border or opposite corner. 

When in doubt about whether two characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two attackers’ centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent’s space (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.

*Exception*: If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.

Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.

Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can’t flank an opponent.

### Helpless Defenders
**Helpless Defenders**

A [[Helpless|helpless]] opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or otherwise at your mercy.

**Regular Attack**: A [[Helpless|helpless]] character takes a –4 penalty to AC against melee attacks. In addition, a [[Helpless|helpless]] character is treated as having a Dexterity of 0, giving him a –5 penalty to AC against both melee and ranged attacks (for a total of –9 against melee and –5 against ranged). A [[Helpless|helpless]] character is also [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

#### Coup de Grace
**Coup de Grace**: As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace (pronounced “coo day grahs”) to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target. You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.

Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.

You can’t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to “find” the creature once you’ve determined what square it’s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).

## Special Attacks
**SPECIAL ATTACKS**

This section discusses all of the various standard maneuvers you can perform during combat other than normal attacks, casting spells, or using other class abilities. Some of these special attacks can be made as part of another action (such as an attack) or as a attack of opportunity.

### Aid Another
**Aid Another**

In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you’re in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent’s next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.

You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or to assist another character’s skill check.

**Expanding the Aid Another action**

The *Player’s Handbook* describes how a character can help another character achieve success by aiding him with a skill check of the same type; a successful DC 10 check by the first character grants a +2 circumstance bonus on the second character’s check to use the same skill (see pages 65–66 of the *Player’s Handbook*). This section expands on that rule by allowing more skilled characters to grant greater assistance.

When a character with 5 or more ranks in a skill uses the aid another action to assist another character’s skill check, he can grant a higher bonus than that described in the *Player’s Handbook*. For every 10 points of the helper’s check result above 10, the circumstance bonus increases by 1. Thus, a result of 10–19 would grant a +2 circumstance bonus (as normal), a result of 20–29 would grant a +3 circumstance bonus, a result of 30–39 a +4 circumstance bonus, and so on. (To determine the circumstance bonus quickly, simply divide the helper’s check result by 10, round down, and add 1.)

This higher bonus is available only to helpers with at least 5 ranks in the skill being used. Only experienced characters have the ability to provide the extra assistance offered by this rule.

At the DM’s option, this rule can also be extended to using the aid another action in combat to improve an ally’s attack roll or AC. Any character with a base attack bonus of +5 or higher can grant a greater bonus on an ally’s attack roll or AC as described above. This rule rewards the tactic of experienced combatants helping each other in a fight (often the best option when fighting a monster with an extremely high AC or attack bonus).

### Charge
**Charge**

Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the action. Charging, however, carries tight restrictions on how you can move.

**Movement During a Charge**: You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent. If you move a distance equal to your speed or less, you can also draw a weapon during a charge attack if your base attack bonus is at least +1.

You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). You must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can’t charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can’t charge. [[Helpless]] creatures don’t stop a charge.

If you don’t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can’t charge that opponent.

You can’t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge. 

If you are able to take only a standard action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed) and you cannot draw a weapon unless you possess the [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] feat. You can’t use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard action on your turn.

**Attacking on a Charge**: After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll and take a –2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. A charging character gets a +2 bonus on combat maneuver attack rolls made to [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] an opponent (see [[Bull Rush]] on page 199 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough base attack bonus or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.

**Lances and Charge Attacks**: A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.

**Weapons Readied against a Charge**: Spears, tridents, and other weapons with the brace feature deal double damage when readied (set) and used against a charging character.

## Combat Maneuvers
**Combat Maneuvers**

During combat, you can attempt to perform a number of maneuvers that can hinder or even cripple your foe, including [[Bull Rush|bull rush]], disarm, grapple, overrun, sunder, and trip. Although these maneuvers have vastly different results, they all use a similar mechanic to determine success.

**Combat Maneuver Bonus**: Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Bonus (or CMB) that represents its skill at performing [[Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuvers]]. A creature’s CMB is determined using the following formula:

**CMB = Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size modifier** 

Creatures that are size Tiny or smaller use their Dexterity modifier in place of their Strength modifier to determine their CMB. The special size modifier for a creature’s Combat Maneuver Bonus is as follows: Fine –8, Diminutive –4, Tiny –2, Small –1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMB when performing specific maneuvers.

**Performing a Combat Maneuver**: When performing a combat maneuver, you must use an action appropriate to the maneuver you are attempting to perform. While many [[Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuvers]] can be performed as part of an attack action, full-attack action, or attack of opportunity (in place of a melee attack), others require a specific action. Unless otherwise noted, performing a combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of the maneuver. If you are hit by the target, you take the damage normally and apply that amount as a penalty to the attack roll to perform the maneuver. If your target is immobilized, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated, your maneuver automatically succeeds (treat as if you rolled a natural 20 on the attack roll). If your target is [[Stunned|stunned]], you receive a +4 bonus on your attack roll to perform a combat maneuver against it.

When you attempt to perform a combat maneuver, make an attack roll and add your CMB in place of your normal attack bonus. Add any bonuses you currently have on attack rolls due to spells, feats, and other effects. These bonuses must be applicable to the weapon or attack used to perform the maneuver. The DC of this maneuver is your target’s Combat Maneuver Defense. [[Combat Maneuvers|Combat maneuvers]] are attack rolls, so you must roll for concealment and take any other penalties that would normally apply to an attack roll.

**Combat Maneuver Defense**: Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Defense (or CMD) that represents its ability to resist [[Combat Maneuvers|combat maneuvers]]. A creature’s CMD is determined using the following formula:

**CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + special size modifier**

The special size modifier for a creature’s Combat Maneuver Defense is as follows: Fine –8, Diminutive –4, Tiny –2, Small –1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMD when resisting specific maneuvers. A creature can also add any circumstance, deflection, dodge, insight, morale, profane, and sacred bonuses to AC to its CMD. Any penalties to a creature’s AC also apply to its CMD. A [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creature does not add its Dexterity bonus to its CMD.

**Determine Success**: If your attack roll equals or exceeds the CMD of the target, your maneuver is a success and has the listed effect. Some maneuvers, such as [[Bull Rush|bull rush]], have varying levels of success depending on how much your attack roll exceeds the target’s CMD. Rolling a natural 20 while attempting a combat maneuver is always a success (except when attempting to escape from bonds), while rolling a natural 1 is always a failure.

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pgs. 198-201

### Bull Rush
**[[Bull Rush]]**

You can make a [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] as a standard action or as part of a charge, in place of the melee attack. You can only [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. A [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] attempts to push an opponent straight back without doing any harm. If you do not have the [[Improved Bull Rush (Feat)|Improved Bull Rush]] feat, or a similar ability, initiating a [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack is successful, your target is pushed back 5 feet. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent’s CMD you can push the target back an additional 5 feet. You can move with the target if you wish but you must have the available movement to do so. If your attack fails, your movement ends in front of the target.

An enemy being moved by a [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] does not provoke an attack of opportunity because of the movement unless you possess the [[Greater Bull Rush (Feat)|Greater Bull Rush]] feat. You cannot [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle. If there is another creature in the way of your [[Bull Rush|bull rush]], you must immediately make a combat maneuver check to [[Bull Rush|bull rush]] that creature. You take a –4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If you are successful, you can continue to push the creatures a distance equal to the lesser result. For example, if a fighter bull rushes a goblin for a total of 15 feet, but there is another goblin 5 feet behind the first, he must make another combat maneuver check against the second goblin after having pushed the first 5 feet. If his check reveals that he can push the second goblin a total of 20 feet, he can continue to push both goblins another 10 feet (since the first goblin will have moved a total of 15 feet).

### Disarm
**Disarm**

You can attempt to disarm your opponent in place of a melee attack. If you do not have the [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]] feat, or a similar ability, attempting to disarm a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. Attempting to disarm a foe while unarmed imposes a –4 penalty on the attack.

If your attack is successful, your target drops one item it is carrying of your choice (even if the item is wielded with two hands). If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). If your attack fails by 10 or more, you drop the weapon that you were using to attempt the disarm. If you successfully disarm your opponent without using a weapon, you may automatically pick up the item dropped.

### Grapple
**Grapple**

As a standard action, you can attempt to grapple a foe, hindering his combat options. If you do not have [[Improved Grapple (Feat)|Improved Grapple]], grab, or a similar ability, attempting to grapple a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. Humanoid creatures without two free hands attempting to grapple a foe take a –4 penalty on the combat maneuver roll. If successful, both you and the target gain the [[Grappled|grappled]] condition (see the Appendices). If you successfully grapple a creature that is not adjacent to you, move that creature to an adjacent open space (if no space is available, your grapple fails). Although both creatures have the [[Grappled|grappled]] condition, you can, as the creature that initiated the grapple, release the grapple as a free action, removing the condition from both you and the target. If you do not release the grapple, you must continue to make a check each round, as a standard action, to maintain the hold. If your target does not break the grapple, you get a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against the same target in subsequent rounds. Once you are grappling an opponent, a successful check allows you to continue grappling the foe, and also allows you to perform one of the following actions (as part of the standard action spent to maintain the grapple).

*Move*: You can move both yourself and your target up to half your speed. At the end of your movement, you can place your target in any square adjacent to you. If you attempt to place your foe in a hazardous location, such as in a *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]]* or over a pit, the target receives a free attempt to break your grapple with a +4 bonus.

*Damage*: You can inf lict damage to your target equal to your unarmed strike, a natural attack, or an attack made with [[Armor spikes|armor spikes]] or a light or one-handed weapon. This damage can be either lethal or nonlethal.

*Pin*: You can give your opponent the [[Pinned|pinned]] condition (see Appendix 2). Despite pinning your opponent, you still only have the [[Grappled|grappled]] condition, but you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

*Tie Up*: If you have your target [[Pinned|pinned]], otherwise restrained, or [[Unconscious|unconscious]], you can use rope to tie him up. This works like a pin effect, but the DC to escape the bonds is equal to 20 + your Combat Maneuver Bonus (instead of your CMD). The ropes do not need to make a check every round to maintain the pin. If you are grappling the target, you can attempt to tie him up in ropes, but doing so requires a combat maneuver check at a –10 penalty. If the DC to escape from these bindings is higher than 20 + the target’s CMB, the target cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.

**If You Are Grappled**: If you are [[Grappled|grappled]], you can attempt to break the grapple as a standard action by making a combat maneuver check (DC equal to your opponent’s CMD; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check (with a DC equal to your opponent’s CMD). If you succeed, you break the grapple and can act normally. Alternatively, if you succeed, you can become the grappler, grappling the other creature (meaning that the other creature cannot freely release the grapple without making a combat maneuver check, while you can). Instead of attempting to break or reverse the grapple, you can take any action that requires only one hand to perform, such as cast a spell or make an attack with a light or one-handed weapon against any creature within your reach, including the creature that is grappling you. See the [[Grappled|grappled]] condition for additional details. If you are [[Pinned|pinned]], your actions are very limited. See the [[Pinned|pinned]] condition in Appendix 2 for additional details.

**Multiple Creatures**: Multiple creatures can attempt to grapple one target. The creature that first initiates the grapple is the only one that makes a check, with a +2 bonus for each creature that assists in the grapple (using the Aid Another action). Multiple creatures can also assist another creature in breaking free from a grapple, with each creature that assists (using the Aid Another action) granting a +2 bonus on the [[Grappled|grappled]] creature’s combat maneuver check.

### Overrun
**Overrun**

As a standard action, taken during your move or as part of a charge, you can attempt to overrun your target, moving through its square. You can only overrun an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. If you do not have the [[Improved Overrun (Feat)|Improved Overrun]] feat, or a similar ability, initiating an overrun provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. If your overrun attempt fails, you stop in the space directly in front of the opponent, or the nearest open space in front of the creature if there are other creatures occupying that space. 

When you attempt to overrun a target, it can choose to avoid you, allowing you to pass through its square without requiring an attack. If your target does not avoid you, make a combat maneuver check as normal. If your maneuver is successful, you move through the target’s space. If your attack exceeds your opponent’s CMD by 5 or more, you move through the target’s space and the target is knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the DC of the combat maneuver attack roll for each additional leg it has.

### Sunder
**Sunder**

You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent as part of an attack action in place of a melee attack. If you do not have the [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]] feat, or a similar ability, attempting to sunder an item provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack is successful, you deal damage to the item normally. Damage that exceeds the object’s Hardness is subtracted from its hit points. If an object has equal to or less than half its total hit points remaining, it gains the [[Broken|broken]] condition (see Appendix 2). If the damage you deal would reduce the object to less than 0 hit points, you can choose to destroy it. If you do not choose to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 hit point and the [[Broken|broken]] condition.

### Trip
**Trip**

You can attempt to trip your opponent in place of a melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. If you do not have the [[Improved Trip (Feat)|Improved Trip]] feat, or a similar ability, initiating a trip provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack exceeds the target’s CMD, the target is knocked prone. If your attack fails by 10 or more, you are knocked prone instead. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the DC of the combat maneuver attack roll for each additional leg it has. Some creatures—such as oozes, creatures without legs, and flying creatures—cannot be tripped.

## Feint
**Feint**

Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s base attack bonus + your opponent’s Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] bonus, if higher. If successful, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

When feinting against a nonhumanoid you take a –4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a –8 penalty. Against a creature lacking an Intelligence score, it’s impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Feinting as a Move Action**: With the [[Improved Feint (Feat)|Improved Feint]] feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action.

## Mounted Combat
**Mounted Combat**

These rules cover being mounted on a horse in combat but can also be applied to more unusual steeds, such as a griffon or dragon.

**Mounts in Combat**: Horses, ponies, and riding dogs can serve readily as combat steeds. Mounts that do not possess combat training (see the [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] skill) are [[Frightened|frightened]] by combat. If you don’t dismount, you must make a DC 20 [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] check each round as a move action to control such a mount. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full-round action, and you can’t do anything else until your next turn.

Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move.

A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount’s space during combat.

**Combat while Mounted**: With a DC 5 [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action. When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can’t make a full attack. Even at your mount’s full speed, you don’t take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted. If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).

You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a –4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed) at a –8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally.

**Casting Spells While Mounted**: You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you’re casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).

**If Your Mount Falls in Battle**: If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.

**If You Are Dropped**: If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you’re in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage. Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.

## Throw Splash Weapon
**Throw Splash Weapon**

A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown splash weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don’t take the –4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. Splash weapons cannot deal precision-based damage (such as the damage from the rogue’s sneak attack class feature).

You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. You can’t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you’re aiming at the creature.

If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw. After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in that square and in all adjacent squares.

## Two-Weapon Fighting
**Two-Weapon Fighting**

If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways. First, if your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light. Second, the [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6. Table 8–7 summarizes the interaction of all these factors.

**Double Weapons**: You can use a double weapon to make an extra attack with the off-hand end of the weapon as if you were fighting with two weapons. The penalties apply as if the off-hand end of the weapon was a light weapon.

**Thrown Weapons**: The same rules apply when you throw a weapon from each hand. Treat a dart or shuriken as a light weapon when used in this manner, and treat a bolas, [[Javelin|javelin]], [[Net|net]], or sling as a one-handed weapon.

**Table 8–7: Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties**


| **Circumstances** | **Primary Hand** | **Off Hand** |
|---|---|---|
| Normal penalties | –6 | –10 |
| Off-hand weapon is light | –4 | –8 |
| [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)\|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat | –4 | –4 |
| Off-hand weapon is light and [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)\|Two-Weapon Fighting]] feat | –2 | –2 |

## Special Initiative Actions
**SPECIAL INITIATIVE ACTIONS**

Here are ways to change when you act during combat by altering your place in the initiative order.

### Delay
**Delay**

By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative result or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.

You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what’s going to happen. You also can’t interrupt anyone else’s action (as you can with a readied action).

**Initiative Consequences of Delaying**: Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don’t get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).

If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.

### Ready
**Ready**

The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you ready might do so).

**Readying an Action**: You can ready a standard action, a move action, a swift action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the conditions under which you will take it. Then, anytime before your next action, you may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character’s activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your readied action.

You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don’t otherwise move any distance during the round.

**Initiative Consequences of Readying**: Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.

**Distracting Spellcasters**: You can ready an attack against a spellcaster with the trigger “if she starts casting a spell.” If you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to cast (as determined by her [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check result).

**Readying to Counterspell**: You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger “if she starts casting a spell”). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (and are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster’s spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.

A spellcaster can use *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn’t always work.

**Readying a Weapon against a Charge**: You can ready weapons with the brace feature, setting them to receive charges. A readied weapon of this type deals double damage if you score a hit with it against a charging character.

## Tactical Movement
**Tactical Movement**

Your speed is determined by your race and your armor (see Table 8–3). Your speed while unarmored is your base land speed.

**Encumbrance**: A character encumbered by carrying treasure. a large amount of gear, or fallen comrades may move slower than normal (see Chapter 7 of the *PF Core Rulebook*).

**Hampered Movement**: Difficult terrain, obstacles, or poor visibility can hamper movement.

**Movement in Combat**: Generally, you can move your speed in a round and still do something (take a move action and a standard action).

If you do nothing but move (that is, if you use both of your actions in a round to move your speed), you can move double your speed.

If you spend the entire round running, you can move quadruple your speed (or three times your speed in heavy armor). If you do something that requires a full round, you can only take a 5-foot step.

**Bonuses to Speed**: A barbarian has a +10-foot bonus to his speed (unless she’s wearing heavy armor). Experienced monks also have higher speed (unless they’re wearing armor of any sort). In addition, many spells and magic items can affect a character’s speed. Always apply any modifiers to a character’s speed before adjusting the character’s speed based on armor or encumbrance, and remember that multiple bonuses of the same type to a character’s speed don’t stack.

**Table 8–3: Tactical Speed**


| **Race** | **No Armor or Light Armor** | **Medium or Heavy Armor** |
|---|---|---|
| [[Human (Baklunish)\|Human]], [[Elf\|elf]], [[Half-Elf\|half-elf]], [[Half-Orc\|half-orc]] | 30 ft. (6 squares) | 20 ft. (4 squares) |
| [[Dwarf]] | 20 ft. (4 squares) | 20 ft. (4 squares) |
| [[Halfling]], [[Gnome\|gnome]] | 20 ft. (4 squares) | 15 ft. (3 squares) |

### Tactical Movement
![[tact mvt 2.jpg|Tactical Movement|300]]
[[tact mvt 2.jpg|open outside]]

## Measuring Distance
**Measuring Distance**

As a general rule, distance is measured assuming that 1 square equals 5 feet.

**Diagonals**: When measuring distance, the first diagonal counts as 1 square, the second counts as 2 squares, the third counts as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on.

You can’t move diagonally past a corner (even by taking a 5-foot step). You can move diagonally past a creature, even an opponent.

You can also move diagonally past other impassable obstacles, such as pits.

**Closest Creature**: When it’s important to determine the closest square or creature to a location, if two squares or creatures are equally close, randomly determine which one counts as closest by rolling a die.

## Terrain and Obstacles
**Terrain and Obstacles**

From tangled plants to broken stone, there are a number of terrain features that can affect your movement.

**Difficult Terrain**: Difficult terrain, such as heavy undergrowth, broken ground, or steep stairs, hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can’t run or charge across difficult terrain.

If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.

Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.

**Obstacles**: Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn’t completely block it, each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the obstacle, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don’t have sufficient movement to cross the obstacle and move into the square on the other side, you can’t cross it. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.

On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can’t move through a blocking obstacle.

Flying and incorporeal creatures are able to avoid most obstacles.

**Squeezing**: In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn’t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC.

*House Rule:* Creatures are considered [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] while squeezing.

When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that’s 1 square wide, the creature’s miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into. A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can’t end its movement in an occupied square.

To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space’s width, you must use the [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] skill. You can’t attack while using [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a –4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.

## Special Movement Rules
**Special Movement Rules**

These rules cover special movement situations.

**Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space**: Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it’s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there’s a legal position that’s closer.

**Double Movement Cost**: When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares ( just as two diagonal moves normally do).

If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.

**Minimum Movement**: Despite whatever penalties to movement you might have, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn’t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn’t a 5-foot step).

**Things that make the aid another action more powerful:**

Classes and PrCs

Battle Herald (Advanced Player's Guide) is a class that is geared almost expressly toward helping the party achieve its full potential. A combination bard/cavalier (Order of the Dragon is a good base to work with, as well), the Battle Herald gains the Inspiring Command ability. While there's a laundry list of commands it's the Teamwork command that applies to this guide. This ability provides anyone using the Aid Another action with a competence bonus equal to the Battle Herald's inspiring command bonus, and if the ally is successful then the Aid Another bonus also increases by the Battle Herald's inspiring command bonus. That's an additional +1 at first level, and another +1 for every 3 levels after.

Cavalier 2 provides an additional +1.

Clerics who take the Strategy option for variant channeling (Ult Magic) increase Aid Another bonus as their level increases.

Pathfinder Chronicler 3 (PrC) provides +4 instead of +2.

Steel Falcons (Pathfinder Companion: Andoran, Spirit of Liberty) gain superior aid at level 2. This ability allows them to grant a +4 instead of a +2 on Aid Another actions.

Magic Items

benevolent (wpn and armor) (Ult Equip)

gloves of arcane striking

ring of tactical precision 

[[Teamwork Feats]]

Bonded Mind > Exceptional Aid

[[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]] > Open Up

Traits

[[Adopted (Trait)|adopted]] > helpful trait

Fools for Friends (Second Darkness)

Other Stuff

One interesting possibility would be to use an attack-trained pet to Aid your own attack. You’d need to command the animal to attack (using Handle Animal); if the animal knows the Attack trick this is a move action (or a free action for druids and rangers), and you need to succeed at a DC10 [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] check.

TRAITS:

Helpful (Halfling) - Increases the bonus from Aid Another to +4.

[[Battlefield Disciple (Trait)|Battlefield Disciple]] - Increases the bonus by +1 for attack boosts, thus making it +5.

FEATS

[[Bodyguard (Feat)|Bodyguard]] - Aid Another as AOO to grant AC to allies. Requires [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], which helps it out anyway.

Harrying Partners - Teamwork feat, makes your Aid Another last a whole round.

E. Wpn. Prof.: Whip - 15 foot reach for Aid Another.

Along with some halfling-specific stuff and monk stuff that kicks ass:

Cautious Fighter - Increases your AC when defensively fighting by 2 dodge AC.

Blundering Defense - Grants adjacent allies +1/2 my dodge AC bonus as luck AC bonus. Nice.

[[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]] - Depending on who you talk to, this may stack with Cautious Fighter / Fighting defensively and thus grant more Luck AC.

Crane Style - Only take a -2 penalty to attack rolls when fighting defensively... and grants +1 more dodge AC from fighting defensively.

\*Swift Aid - Not sure on this one. It lets you perform Aid Another as a swift action, but your bonus won't benefit from the Helpful Trait by RAW (it grants +1, not +2, and so there's no +2 to replace). Also, Swift Actions are pretty important in Pathfinder, and it'd get in the way of Arcane-Strike-to-Aid-Another shenanigans with any bard build.

Potentially, I'd take the following feats as well:

Nature Soul > Animal Ally > Boon Companion - Gives me an animal companion that can give flanking benefits to whoever I want to give it to. Since you can gain traits via feats, this animal companion could potentially get the Blundering Defense stuff as well.

ITEMS:

A whip - Because whips rock for this.

Benevolent weapon + armor - Grant weapon bonus to Aid Another actions (attack for weapon, AC for armor).

Ring of Tactical Precision - 11k cost ring that grants +1 to Aid Another. Pricey, so it's a buy for later in the game.

\*Gloves of Arcane Striking - Not usable with every Aid Another build, but any that can grab Arcane Strike can get their Arcane Strike bonus to Aid Another actions.

## ***It All Adds Up***
So how much of a bonus can you really give another player with the Aid Another action? What do the numbers really look like? Well, here's an example using the above rules and focusing on combat bonuses.

Let's begin with a halfling character who takes the *helpful* halfling trait. Right out of the gate he can provide a +4 bonus to his allies.

Take 3 levels of bard.

At level 6 take a level of Battle Herald. Learn the Teamwork Command for a +5 on Aid Another. This goes up to +6 at 10th level and +7 at 13th level.

Purchase a benevolent weapon (preferably a lance or whip so you can aid from a distance). If you have a +1 weapon at level 6 it provides a +6 bonus. If you advance this weapon to a +3 item then at level 10 you can provide a +9 bonus to your allies in combat. If you use your arcane strike to add onto your aid another bonus, that's more than a +10.

I cannot think of a single level where a +10 bonus to either attack or armor class is not a major game changer.

### ***Post Edit Suggestion: Bodyguard***
I continually thought this was part of the guide, but apparently it wasn't. The *Bodyguard* feat (*Advanced Player's Guide*) allows you to use attacks of opportunity to provide an *aid another* action to a party member you're adjacent to. Since the prerequisite is *Combat Reflexes* it's entirely possible that you can save the entire front line from a world of hurt without even taking up your actual action during the round.

You can also add *Harrying Partners*, which says once given, your aid another bonus lasts for a round instead of that single action.
