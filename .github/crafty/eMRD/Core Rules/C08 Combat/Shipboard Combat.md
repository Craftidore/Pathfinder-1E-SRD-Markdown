# Shipboard Combat
## Overview
**Shipboard Combat**

Shipboard combat is just like any other combat between the PCs and their opponents, except the encounter takes place on board a ship, rather than in a dungeon or on a forest path. For the most part, shipboard combat can be resolved normally. The only constraints are the size of the ship (and therefore, the size of the battlefield), the danger of falling overboard into the water, and the effects of weather on the ship.

If the combat happens during a storm or in rough seas, treat the ship’s deck as difficult terrain. Characters climbing into the rigging or diving into the sea to swim from one ship to another or to climb out of the water up an anchor chain or up the hull of a ship must succeed on Climb checks, while moving across a crowded deck, leaping across open hatches or from mast to deck, or negotiating pitching boards slick with spray must succeed on Acrobatics checks. The DC of such checks depends on how severe the wave and weather conditions are and how great a challenge you want the environment to be. Experienced sailors and aquatic races may have advantage on such checks, while creatures unsuited to shipboard combat like horses or large creatures may have disadvantage. The sample DCs and modifiers in Table 4-1: Typical Shipboard DCs can be used to adjudicate movement on board a ship.

**Table 4-1: Typical Shipboard DCs**


| **Acrobatics**<br>**DC** | **Task** |
|---|---|
| 10 | Move at normal speed on a cluttered deck |
| 15 | Stand or move, heeling deck (a sloping or slanted deck, such as in high winds or sharp turns) |
| 15 | Swing on ship’s rigging to another location on the same ship. |
| 20 | Swing on ship’s rigging to land on a different ship grappled or rammed by your ship. |
| 20 | Stand or move, rolling deck (violently rocking back and forth, as in a severe storm) |
| 25 | Swing on ship’s rigging to a nearby ship that has not been grappled or rammed. |
| 30 | Stand or move along a yardarm or rope. |
| |  |
| **Climb**<br>**DC** | **Task** |
| 5 | Climb anchor chain |
| 5 | Climb ship’s rigging |
| 10 | Climb ship’s mast |
| 15 | Climb onto horizontal spar or yardarm |
| 20 | Climb hull |
| |  |
| | **Modifiers** |
| +2 | Wet surface |
| +2 | High winds |
| +2 | Rolling deck |
| +5 | Icy surface or wave surge (1 foot deep or less) |
| -2 | Use one hand to brace yourself |
| -5 | Use both hands to brace yourself |
| -10 | Use both hands and a rope (does not apply to climbing the rigging) |

If a combatant falls overboard, use the standard rules for aquatic terrain and water dangers from swimming and possibly drowning. In all other ways, shipboard combat functions no differently than combat on land.
