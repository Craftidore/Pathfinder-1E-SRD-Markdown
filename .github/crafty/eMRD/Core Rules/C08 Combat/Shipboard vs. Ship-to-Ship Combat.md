# Shipboard vs. Ship-to-Ship Combat
## Overview
**Shipboard Combat**

A typical nautical campaign presupposes that assumes that the PCs are more interested in capturing enemy ships than in sinking them. After all, if they sink a ship, they can’t plunder its cargo, ransom its crew and passengers, and sell (or use) the ship themselves. So once a ship has been boarded, ship-to-ship combat ends and shipboard combat begins on whichever ship was boarded first.

Shipboard combat is normally a battle between the “primaries” of the two ships—usually meaning that the PCs fight the enemy ship’s captain and any other major NPCs on the enemy ship in normal combat. Meanwhile, the two ships’ crews are assumed to be fighting each other in the background.

Whoever wins the “primary” combat (either the PCs or the enemy NPCs) wins the entire battle. In other words, a ship’s crew is victorious over an enemy crew if their captain defeats the enemy captain. While a ship’s crew will likely take losses in a battle, it is assumed that enough members of the defeated crew join the victorious crew to replenish any losses. This keeps the PCs from having to play out combat between large numbers of low-level opponents, and from needing to track exactly how many casualties their crew takes in each battle.

The PCs earn normal XP for the foes they defeat in shipboard combat. In most circumstances, a ship-to-ship battle just serves as a prelude to the main combat. If, however, the PCs decided to fight out an entire ship-to-ship battle and they sink or destroy a ship without ever fighting the ship’s captain and key NPCs, then they should be awarded XP based on the captain’s CR, as the captain is the only one piloting the enemy ship in ship-to-ship combat).
