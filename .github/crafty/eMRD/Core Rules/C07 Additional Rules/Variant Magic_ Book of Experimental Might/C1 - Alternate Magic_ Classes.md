# C1 - Alternate Magic: Classes
## Overview
**Classes**

*Anyone with experience in esoteric matters knows that the practice of magic takes many forms. Spells are only the*

*most obvious and straightforward way to harness arcane and divine power. Runes, disciplines, magic items, rituals,*

*skills, and inherent abilities are other ways—each with its own set of attendant strengths and weaknesses.*

*—Malhavoc*

This chapter presents some exciting new options for

various magic-using core classes. Traditional clerics,

druids, and wizards have been heavily modified to

utilize twenty levels of spells rather than just nine. In addition,

these classes—as well as the paladin and ranger—have been

adjusted to allow for the introduction of magical disciplines.

You won’t find full versions of any of these classes in this

chapter, but instead you’ll see guidelines for revising each one

in play. Consider this chapter more of a guide to changing the

core classes for your own games the way I have in mine.

The changes to these classes form the crux of much of the

material in this book. The fact that the alternate cleric, druid,

and wizard use twenty levels of spells affects many other

aspects of the game, so all the material presented in later

chapters stems from the assumption that the twenty-level

spell progression is in place.

Please note that the class revisions offered here are

designed to *replace* the core versions of those classes. They

do not supplement them, nor should they be used in addition

to the core versions.

In addition to the modifications to various core classes,

this chapter contains one new class in its entirety: the

runeblade. This nonspellcasting class is designed for you to

add to any campaign.

Clerics, Druids,

and Wizards

This section describes a new way of handling the major spellcasting

classes in the game: clerics, druids, and wizards. The

flavor and basic mechanics (Hit Dice, saving throws, base

attack bonuses, etc.) do not change from what you see in the

Core Rules. Everything that *does* change is described here.

• Clerics, druids, and wizards can cast spells of level 1 to

20. The spell levels correspond exactly to their experience

level. Spell lists and descriptions appear in

Chapter Five: Magic.

• These classes also gain special magical abilities called *disciplines*.

Disciplines—abilities spellcasters can use whenever

they wish—replace all level-based abilities the classes

normally would gain. Thus, clerics do not gain the Turn or

Rebuke Undead ability, although they can choose the Turn

Undead discipline instead. Druids gain disciplines instead

of class abilities like Animal Companion, Nature Sense,

Wild Empathy,Woodland Stride, Trackless Step, Resist

Nature’s Lure, Wild Shape, Venom Immunity, A Thousand

Faces, or Timeless Body. Wizards gain disciplines instead

of Summon Familiar or bonus feats, including Scribe

Scroll. Disciplines are detailed starting on the next page.

• There are no 0-level spells.

• There are no specialist wizards.

• Clerics still get domain spells and abilities as described

in the Core Rules. They receive domain spells at oddnumbered

levels; for instance, at 1st level, a cleric gains

a domain spell that appears in the Core Rules as 1st

level, as normal. Then he gains the Core Rules 2nd-level

domain spell at 3rd level, the Core Rules 3rd-level

domain spell at 5th level, and so on through 17th level.

• To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the caster must have a key

ability score (Wisdom for clerics and druids, Intelligence

for wizards) of 10 + half the level of the spell, rounded up.

• The saving throw DCs to resist spells are 10 + half spell

level (rounded up) + key ability modifier (Wisdom for

clerics and druids, Intelligence for wizards).

Spells per Level

Clerics, druids, and wizards have a new spell level progression,

based on the assumption that they can cast spells of level 1 to 20,

rather than levels 1 to 9.

Bonus spells from high ability scores remain unchanged. That

means a wizard with Intelligence 17 gains bonus spells of levels

1, 2, and 3, even though those levels represent very different spells

in this alternate system. (This fact decreases the emphasis of

high ability scores in the game.)

**Design Decisions: New Spell Progression**

This new spell progression plays with the power level of spellcasters a bit. Overall, they end up with more spells once they get to the middle experience levels. Coupled with disciplines, this certainly makes them more powerful than the original versions. However, because they operate with twenty levels of spells, they always acquire their most powerful spells a full level later than previously. Wizards don’t get *fireball* until 6th level, rather than at 5th level like they used to.

While this fact might seem to make spellcasters less powerful than before, it more than evens out in the end. Real gameplay impact manifests itself not in the amount of power a character can wield at one time, but in how long the character is able to keep functioning as a viable spellcaster over the course of the day. And, ultimately, it’s more fun to keep the game going rather than force it to stop while the casters rest to regain their spells.

Cleric Disciplines

Disciplines are abilities that clerics can use as often as they wish.

Their effects are spell-like abilities, which means they can be dispelled

or suppressed. Some discipline effects must be activated as

described below, while others—such as Godhammer—function

all the time.

Activating a discipline provokes attacks of opportunity.

However, some disciplines, like Debilitating Touch, count as

armed attacks and thus do not provoke attacks of opportunity

when used. Should a discipline effect that normally requires no

activation be dispelled, it must be activated using a full-round

action to resume functioning.

A cleric chooses one discipline at 1st level; at all even-numbered

levels thereafter, instead of gaining a feat at that level, he or she

may choose a new discipline or an enhancement to an existing one.

(Note that all characters using this book gain a feat each level; see

Chapter Three.) Each discipline enhancement has a minimum level

requirement as described below.

Debilitating Touch

Using a free action and at least one free hand, you arm yourself

with harmful magical energies. Your next touch inflicts 1d6 points

of negative energy damage + 1d6 points per three caster levels.

Further, targets who fail a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half

your level + your Wisdom bonus) become fatigued. The damage

heals undead creatures, although in a given day you can use it to heal only a number of different undead individuals equal to 1 + your

Wisdom modifier + your level.

You may enhance Debilitating Touch as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Exhaustion: The target is exhausted rather than fatigued.

6th Enhanced potency: The Fortitude DC is +3 higher than

normal.

10th Greater damage\*: The target suffers an additional 1d6

points of damage (total damage dice cannot exceed 1d6 per

two caster levels).

12th Stun: If the saving throw fails, the target is stunned 1 round

in addition to other effects.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Divine Inspiration

Using a standard action, you grant all allies within 30 feet a +1 luck

bonus to the following:

• attack and damage rolls; or

• saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or

• Armor Class

This bonus increases by +1 every five levels. The effect lasts for

1 round per level before it must be renewed.

You may enhance Divine Inspiration as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Continuous: Although the bonus is only half normal, putting

it into effect requires no action. Designating which

bonus to grant is a free action that can be performed once

each round.

8th Two choices: The luck bonus applies to two of the three

choices listed above.

14th All choices: The luck bonus applies to all three choices.

Divine Presence

When allies touch you, or even the hem of your clothing, they are

blessed with healing. This requires no action on your part but calls

for a standard action on their part. Affected allies gain 1d6 hit points

+ 1 point per cleric level. While there is no limit to the number of

times each day you can heal in this fashion, in a given day you can

use this discipline to heal only a number of different individuals

equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier + your level (see “Healing”

sidebar, next page).

You may enhance Divine Presence as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Holy water: With a touch requiring a full-round action, you

transform one ounce of water into holy (or unholy) water.

4th Greater healing\*: You add 1d6 points of healing to each

touch (total healing dice cannot exceed 1d6 per two caster

levels).

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Divine Senses

You sense moderate or stronger magical auras on creatures and

objects within 60 feet that you can see. This is not an action. You

can feel dim (lingering) or stronger magical auras on creatures and

objects you touch using a standard action.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical

emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Enchantments and

illusions cannot be seen or felt in this way. *Nyst’s magic aura* often

hides magical traps.

You may enhance Divine Senses as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Detection: Using a standard action, you can detect magical

auras through barriers: up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common

metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

2nd Reading: You can automatically read all scrolls or other

common magical writings.

4th Enhanced aura vision: You can sense faint or stronger magical

auras.

6th Enchantment sight: You can sense enchantment auras.

12th Illusion sight: You can sense illusion auras.

**Aura Strength:** An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning

spell level or an item’s caster level as follows:

5th or lower Faint aura

6th–11th Moderate aura

12th–20th Strong aura

21st+ (artifact or deity level) Overwhelming aura

If an aura falls into more than one category, Divine Senses indicates

the stronger of the two.

**Lingering Aura:** A magical aura lingers after its original source

dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a

magic item). A lingering aura has an aura strength of dim (even

weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level

depends on its original power:

Faint lingers 1d6 rounds

Moderate lingers 1d6 minutes

Strong lingers 1d6 × 10 minutes

Overwhelming lingers 1d6 days

Godhammer

Once per round, a melee weapon sacred to your deity inflicts +1

point of damage + 1 point per three levels in your hands. This effect

applies to your first attack with the weapon in the round.

You may enhance Godhammer as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

6th Ranged attacks: The damage bonus applies to ranged

attacks as well as melee attacks.

10th Weapon empowerment: The damage bonus applies to all

attacks made with the weapon in a round.

Healing Touch

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you heal another

living creature 1d8 points + 1 point per level. While there is no

limit to the number of times each day you can use this ability, in a

given day you can use it to heal only a number of different individuals

equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier + your level.

You may enhance Healing Touch as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Harm undead: You can use this ability to harm undead,

inflicting with a touch attack the amount of damage you

normally would heal.

4th Greater healing\*: You add 1d8 points of healing to each

touch (total healing dice cannot exceed 1d8 per two caster

levels).

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

8th Healing link: Rather than convey this effect by touch, you

heal at a range of up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Turn Undead

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you force one

undead target to flee. The undead creature’s total Hit Dice cannot

be more than 2 HD higher than your own. This creature is frightened

and forced to flee for 1 round + 1 round per three caster levels.

No attack roll is necessary, but the target may attempt a Will saving

throw to negate the attack (DC 10 + half your level + your

Charisma bonus). The range of the turning is 25 feet + 5 feet

per two levels.

You may enhance Turn Undead as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Damage: Rather than fleeing, the target suffers 1d6 points

of damage + 1d6 points per two caster levels.

4th Medium range: The range of the turning increases to

100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.

4th Immobility: The target is held motionless rather than

afraid; the effect lasts as long as you concentrate plus

1 round.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke an

attack of opportunity.

6th Enhanced potency\*: The Will save DC is +2 higher than

normal.

8th Any target: You can affect any undead regardless of Hit

Dice.

10th Demons: You can affect evil outsiders as well as undead

with this discipline.

14th Evil casters: You can affect evil divine spellcasters with this

discipline.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Druid Disciplines

Disciplines are abilities that druids can use as often as they wish.

Their effects are spell-like abilities, which means they can be dispelled

or suppressed. Some discipline effects must be activated as

described below, while others—such as Animal Companion—

function all the time.

Activating a discipline provokes attacks of opportunity. However,

some disciplines, like Debilitating Touch, count as armed attacks

and thus do not provoke attacks of opportunity when used. Should

a discipline effect that normally requires no activation be dispelled,

it must be activated using a full-round action to resume its functioning.

Druids begin the game with the Animal Companion discipline,

and at 2nd level they automatically gain the Nature’s Affinity discipline

for free. They also choose one other discipline at 1st level; at

every even-numbered level thereafter, instead of gaining a feat at that

level, they may choose a new discipline or an enhancement to an

existing one. (Note that all characters using this book gain a feat

each level; see Chapter Three.) Each discipline enhancement has a

minimum level requirement as described below.

Animal Companion

You may select an animal companion from the following list:\*

• Badger

• Camel

• Dire rat

• Dog or riding dog

• Eagle

• Hawk

• Horse (light or heavy)

• Owl

• Pony

• Snake (Small or Medium viper)

• Wolf

*\* If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment,*

*the DM may add the following creatures to the druid’s options: crocodile,*

*porpoise, Medium shark, and squid.*

This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies you on your

adventures as appropriate for its kind. Your companion is completely

typical for its kind, gaining one additional Hit Die and a +1 bonus

to natural armor for every druid level above 1st. At every evennumbered

level, you can teach the animal companion an additional

trick, as described in the Handle Animal skill description in Chapter

Four of the *Player’s Handbook*.

You can handle your animal companion as a free action or push it

as a move action, even if you don’t have any ranks in the Handle

Animal skill.

At your option, any spell (but not any spell-like ability) you cast

upon yourself may also affect your animal companion. The animal

companion must be within 5 feet of you at the time of casting to

receive the benefit. Spells or effects with a duration other than

Instantaneous stop affecting the animal companion if it moves farther

than 5 feet away. They will not affect the animal again, even if it

returns to you before the duration expires. Additionally, you may cast

a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a Touch

range spell) instead of on yourself. You and your animal companion

can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of

the companion’s type (animal).

If you release your companion from service, you may gain a new

one by performing a ceremony requiring twenty-four hours of uninterrupted

prayer. This ceremony also can replace an animal companion

that has perished.

When you reach 4th level or higher, you may select a companion

from the alternate lists of animals below. Should you select from

one of these alternate lists, the animal gains additional Hit Dice

and natural armor bonuses as if your druid level were lower than

it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list’s

header from your druid level. (If this adjustment would reduce

your effective level to 0 or lower, you can’t take that animal as a

companion.)

Dexterity increase by +2.

4th Evasion: The animal companion gains the Evasion ability.

8th Damage reduction: The animal companion has DR 5/silver.

10th Second companion: You gain an additional companion appropriate for

your level. You cannot have more than two.

12th Spell resistance: The animal companion has SR equal to 11 + your

druid level.

18th Third companion: If you chose the second companion enhancement,

you may have a third companion. You cannot have more than three.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Debilitating Touch

Using a free action and at least one free hand, you arm yourself with harmful

magical energies. Your next touch inflicts 1d6 points of negative energy damage

+ 1d6 points per three caster levels. Further, targets who fail a Fortitude saving

throw (DC 10 + half your level + your Wisdom bonus) become fatigued. The

damage heals undead creatures, although in a given day you can use it to heal

only a number of different undead individuals equal to 1 + your Wisdom

modifier + your level.

You may enhance Debilitating Touch as follows:

 **Level Enhancement**

4th Exhaustion: Target is exhausted rather than fatigued.

6th Enhanced potency: DC is +3 higher than normal.

10th Greater damage\*: Target suffers an additional 1d6 points

of damage (total damage dice cannot exceed 1d6 per two

caster levels).

12th Stun: If saving throw fails, target is stunned for 1 round in

addition to other effects

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Healing Touch

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you heal another

living creature 1d8 points + 1 point per level. While there is no limit

to the number of times each day you can use this ability, in a given

day you can use it to heal only a number of different individuals

equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier + your level.

You may enhance Healing Touch as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Harm undead: You can use this ability to harm undead,

inflicting with a touch attack the amount of damage you

would normally heal.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke an

attack of opportunity.

6th Greater healing\*: You add 1d8 points of healing to each

touch (total healing dice cannot exceed 1d8 per two caster

levels).

8th Healing link: Rather than convey this effect by touch, you

heal at range up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once;*

*its effects stack.*

Magic Senses

You sense moderate or stronger magical auras on creatures and

objects you can see within 60 feet. This is not an action. You can feel

dim (lingering) or stronger magical auras on creatures and objects

you touch using a standard action. Magical areas, multiple types of

magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal

weaker auras. Enchantments and illusions cannot be seen or felt in

this way. *Nyst’s magic aura* often hides magical traps.

You may enhance Magic Senses as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Detection: Using a standard action, you can detect magical

auras through barriers: up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common

metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

2nd Reading: You can automatically read all scrolls or other

common magical writings.

4th Enhanced aura vision: You can sense faint or stronger

magical auras.

6th Enchantment sight: You can sense enchantment auras.

12th Illusion sight: You can sense illusion auras.

**Aura Strength:** An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning

spell level or an item’s caster level as follows:

5th or lower Faint aura

6th–11th Moderate aura

12th–20th Strong aura

21st+ (artifact or deity level) Overwhelming aura

If an aura falls into more than one category, Magic Senses indicates

the stronger of the two.

**Lingering Aura:** A magical aura lingers after its original source

dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a

magic item). A lingering aura has an aura strength of dim (even

weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level

depends on its original power:

Faint lingers 1d6 rounds

Moderate lingers 1d6 minutes

Strong lingers 1d6 × 10 minutes

Overwhelming lingers 1d6 days

Nature’s Affinity

You have a particular affinity with nature, which grants you a +2

bonus to Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks and a +4 bonus

on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as

dryads, pixies, and sprites).

Further, you can use body language, vocalizations, and

demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or

monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check

made to improve the attitude of a person; roll 1d20 and add your

druid level + your Charisma modifier. The typical domestic animal

has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually

unfriendly.

To use this ability, you and the animal must be able to study each

other, which means that you must be within 30 feet of one another

under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this

way takes one minute but, as with influencing people, it might take

more or less time, depending on the situation. 

You can also use this ability to improve the attitude of a magical

beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or girallon),

but you suffer a –4 penalty on the check.

You may enhance Nature’s Affinity as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Woodland stride: You may move through any sort of

undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown

areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and

without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that

have been magically manipulated to impede motion still

affect you. You leave no trail in natural surroundings and

cannot be tracked. (You may choose to leave a trail if so

desired.)

2nd Greater influence\*: You gain a +2 bonus to checks to

improve the attitude of animals and magical beasts.

4th Mending: You can repair small breaks or tears in objects

made from organic materials or stone, but not metal.

Using mending, ceramic or wooden objects with multiple

breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A

hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed

over. You can repair a magic item, but the mending does

not restore the item’s magical abilities. You cannot affect

creatures (including constructs) or mend warps, such as

those caused by a *warp wood* spell. Mending takes a half

hour.

4th Speak with animals: You can communicate with animals.

6th Speak with plants: You can communicate with plants,

including plant creatures.

8th Immunity to venom: You are immune to poison.

10th Elemental resistance: You gain cold resistance 10, electricity

resistance 10, and fire resistance 10.

*. \* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Wild Shape

You can turn yourself into any Small or Medium animal and back

again. Your options for new forms include all creatures with the

animal type (see the MM), but the new form’s Hit Dice can’t exceed

your druid level. Once you choose a particular form for the day, you

can shift back and forth between that form and your own, but you

can assume no other forms that day. For example, if you choose to

become a lion in the morning, you cannot become a hawk later in

the day.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the

new form but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

scores. You also gain all the animal’s extraordinary special attacks

(such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but not its extraordinary

special qualities (such as blindsense, fast healing, and

scent). You gain the animal’s feats and racial skill bonuses, but not

its skill ranks. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard

action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The chosen

form must be that of an animal you are familiar with. For example,

if you have never been outside a temperate forest, you could not

become a polar bear.

You lose your ability to speak while in animal form because you

are limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can

make. However, you can communicate normally with other animals

of the same general grouping as the new form; for example, if you

take on the shape of a bird, you can talk with all other birds. (Note

that a wild parrot’s normal sound is a squawk, so changing to this

form does not permit speech.) While in animal form, you cannot

cast spells or use disciplines other than this one, Animal

Companion, and Nature’s Affinity.

You may enhance Wild Shape as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Speech: You can speak, cast spells, and use disciplines

normally while in animal form.

6th Additional form\*: You can take an additional animal

shape in a given day.

8th Large and Tiny: You can take on the shape of Large and

Tiny creatures, although this discipline’s other limitations

still apply.

12th Plants: You can take the shape of plant creatures.

14th A thousand faces: You can change your appearance as the

spell *alter self* at will, but only in your normal form.

16th Elementals: You can take the shape of elementals (and

gain all their extraordinary, supernatural and spell-like

abilities while in that form).

20th Huge: You can take on the shape of Huge creatures,

although this discipline’s other limitations still apply.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Using this system in a Pathfinder game necessitates some adjustments. Since a BoXM wizard gets a feat every level, it should replace the feat every other level that is normally used in Pathfinder. In a Pathfinder game that is using the feat every level house rule, then a BoXM wizard should get an additional feat every other level (but these additional feats can only be used for the enhancement of disciplines or to take an additional discipline. The wizard feats gained at 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th should also still be given, but only for arcane discoveries, item creation feats, and metamagic feats.

The alternate metamagic feat system created by J. Butler should also be used by BoXM wizards as a further way to differentiate them from normal Pathfinder wizards.

Wizard Disciplines

Disciplines are abilities that wizards can use as often as they wish.

Their effects are spell-like abilities, which means they can be dispelled

or suppressed. Some discipline effects must be activated as

described below, while others—such as Shield of the Seraphim—

function all the time.

Activating a discipline provokes attacks of opportunity.

However, some disciplines, like Debilitating Touch, count as

armed attacks and thus do not provoke attacks of opportunity

when used. Should a discipline effect that normally requires no

activation be dispelled, it must be activated using a full-round

action to resume functioning.

Wizards begin the game with the Arcanist discipline. They also

choose one other discipline at 1st level; at every even-numbered

level thereafter, instead of gaining a feat at that level, they may

choose a new discipline or an enhancement to an existing one.

(Note that all characters using this book gain a feat each level; see

Chapter Three.) Each discipline enhancement has a minimum level

requirement as described below.

Arcanist

You sense moderate or stronger magical auras on creatures and objects within

60 feet that you can see. This is not an action. You can feel dim (lingering) or

stronger magical auras on creatures and objects you touch using a standard

action. Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations

may distort or conceal weaker auras. Enchantments and illusions cannot be seen

or felt in this way. *Nyst’s magic aura* often hides magical traps.

Further, using a standard action, you can create a personal arcane mark, either

visible or invisible. If an invisible mark is made, a mage using this discipline can

still see it, though not necessarily understand it. *See invisibility, true seeing*, a *gem of*

*seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. The

mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *erase* spell.

If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the

effect to fade in about a month.

You may enhance Arcanist as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Detection: Using a standard action, you can detect magical auras

through barriers: up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal,

a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

2nd Reading: You can automatically read all scrolls or other common

magical writings.

4th Enhanced aura vision: You can sense faint or stronger magical auras.

6th Enchantment sight: You can sense enchantment auras.

12th Illusion sight: You can sense illusion auras.

**Aura Strength:** An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or

an item’s caster level as follows:

5th or lower Faint aura

6th–11th Moderate aura

12th–20th Strong aura

21st+ (artifact or deity level) Overwhelming aura

If an aura falls into more than one category, Arcanist indicates the stronger of

the two.

**Lingering Aura:** A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in

the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). A lingering aura

has an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura

lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Faint lingers 1d6 rounds

Moderate lingers 1d6 minutes

Strong lingers 1d6 × 10 minutes

Overwhelming lingers 1d6 days

Bolt of Bedevilment

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you blast a bolt of magical

energy that envelops one living target. The target’s total Hit Dice cannot be more

than 2 HD higher than your own. The creature is dazed for 1 round + 1 round per

three caster levels. No attack roll is necessary, but the target may attempt a Will

saving throw to negate the attack (DC 10 + half your level + your Intelligence

bonus). The bolt’s range is 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels.

You may enhance Bolt of Bedevilment as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Fascination: The target becomes fascinated rather than

dazed. The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate

+ 1 round.

2nd Medium range: The range of the bolt increases to 100 feet

+ 10 feet per caster level.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

6th Enhanced potency: The Will save DC is +2 higher than

normal.

8th Any target: There is no Hit Dice limit to your potential

targets.

8th Multiple targets: The bolt blasts up to one target per two

levels. No two targets may be more than 20 feet apart.

10th Stun: The target is stunned rather than dazed.

12th Enhanced duration: The target is dazed for 1 round per

two levels.

Debilitating Touch

Using a free action and at least one free hand, you arm yourself

with harmful magical energies. Your next touch inflicts 1d6 points

of negative energy damage + 1d6 points per three caster levels.

Further, targets who fail a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half

your level + your Intelligence bonus) become fatigued. The damage

heals undead creatures, although in a given day you can use it to

heal only a number of different undead individuals equal to 1 +

your Intelligence modifier + your level.

You may enhance Debilitating Touch as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Exhaustion: The target is exhausted rather than fatigued.

6th Enhanced potency: The Fortitude DC is +3 higher than

normal.

10th Greater damage\*: The target suffers an additional 1d6

points of damage (total damage dice cannot exceed 1d6

per two caster levels).

12th Stun: If the saving throw fails, the target is stunned for

1 round in addition to other effects.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Eldritch Bolt

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you blast a bolt

of magical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of force damage + 1d6

points of force damage per three caster levels. To use this discipline,

you must succeed at a ranged touch attack. The bolt’s range is 25

feet + 5 feet per two levels.

You may enhance Eldritch Bolt as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Attack bonus: You gain a +2 bonus on your ranged touch

attack for the bolt.

2nd Long range: The bolt’s range increases to 400 feet + 40

feet per caster level.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

8th Chosen energy: You can choose for the bolt to inflict energy

damage rather than force damage.

10th Greater damage\*: Target suffers an additional 1d6 points

of damage (total damage dice cannot exceed 1d6 per two

caster levels).

14th Eye bolts: The bolt no longer requires a free hand but

instead comes from your eyes. Further, you can fire a halfstrength

bolt (half damage, half range, –4 attack penalty)

as a free action every other round when you don’t fire a

normal bolt.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Familiar

A familiar is an extension of your own soul given a quasi-real substance

in the world. Often, your familiar is not visible to the other

characters—it is little more than a voice in your head, keeping you

company (after a fashion) and helping you remember things you

might otherwise forget. As such, taking an extra round to consult

your familiar grants you a +1 bonus to any Intelligence-based skill

check.

When you take a standard action to focus upon your familiar, you

can make it manifest as any Tiny animal you wish. It is important to

note that the familiar is not an animal, but a spiritual creation—it is

not a true “creature” in the most basic sense, so it is not subject to

spells and attacks that target creatures. The familiar cannot move

from a space that is not adjacent to you (i.e., the space you occupy).

A manifested familiar can speak to you aloud. It can watch your

back, granting you a +2 bonus to Spot and Listen checks. It can

also help remember important parts of spells for you, allowing you

to cast all spells with a +1 bonus to caster level.

If any other creature (ally or otherwise) touches a manifested

familiar, the familiar disappears for 1d10 rounds. During this period

you suffer a –1 penalty to caster level. Familiars use your Armor

Class and cannot be touched by accident—only by intentional

choice. (Doing so is considered the height of rudeness, but it can

be a useful tactic in a fight.) Ranged attacks targeting a familiar

always miss. Area of effect attacks do not harm them—other than

being dispelled by the touch of someone other than you, a familiar

cannot be harmed or affected in any way. Likewise, the manifested

familiar cannot attack, nor can it manipulate objects, other than

very minor changes to your gear: It can crawl into your pocket, hide

up your sleeve, and so forth.

A familiar that you ignore even for a moment stops manifesting.

Mainly, this occurrence is up to the DM’s discretion. A player cannot

say, “I keep my familiar manifested all the time,” because no

one can maintain that kind of concentration and hope to accomplish

anything else. As a rule of thumb, assume that if you manifest

your familiar, it remains for 10 rounds or the duration of an

encounter, whichever is longer. The familiar of a sleeping, stunned,

or unconscious wizard always stops manifesting.

You may enhance Familiar as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Extended range: Your manifested familiar can move up to

5 feet per level away from you, allowing it to scout or spy for

you. It cannot communicate with you unless it is adjacent

to you, however, or unless you have the extended link

enhancement.

6th Extended link: A familiar that has moved away from you

can still communicate with you mentally.

6th Aligned form: Henceforth, your familiar takes on the

appearance of a Tiny humanoid creature that suits your

alignment: a little angelic being if you are good, and a tiny

devil if you are evil. A manifested familiar in this form

increases by +1 the save DC of spells cast against targets of

the opposing alignment (evil targets if you are good, good

targets if you are evil). If you are neither good nor evil, you

cannot use this enhancement.

8th Otherplanar spirit: The familiar is imbued with an otherdimensional

spirit of the same alignment as your own.

Henceforth, it can offer insights beyond your own knowledge,

adding an additional +2 bonus to Intelligence-based

checks. The DM can choose occasionally to play the familiar

as an NPC offering advice or instruction.

10th Elemental form: Henceforth, your familiar takes on the

appearance of a Tiny humanoid creature composed of one

of the four elements. Once per day, for 1 round per level, it

can take the form of a Medium version of the elemental in

question. The elemental acts as you decide (but cannot

move from you without the extended range enhancement).

In this fully functional material form, the familiar can affect

objects and even fight. Others can touch it without dispelling

it, but spells and ranged attacks can target it just

like any elemental. If it is slain, the familiar becomes dormant

for twenty-four hours, offering you no benefits.

10th Greater aligned form: If you have adopted the (evil) aligned

form enhancement, your familiar can take the form of an

imp (if you are lawful), a quasit (if you are chaotic) or either

(if you are neutral). You can activate this effect once per day;

it lasts 1 round per level. The fiend acts as you decide (but

cannot move from you without the extended range enhancement).

In this fully functional material form, the familiar

can affect objects and even fight. Others can touch it without

dispelling it, but spells and ranged attacks can target it

just like any outsider. If it is slain, the familiar becomes dormant

for twenty-four hours, offering you no benefits.

If you are good, the familiar takes the form of a small

winged angelic being of lawful good or chaotic good alignment.

This being has the same statistics as an imp (if you

are lawful), a quasit, (if you are chaotic), or either one (if

you are neutral). If you are neither good nor evil, you cannot

use this enhancement.

12th Large elemental form: If you have adopted the elemental

form enhancement, your elemental familiar can take the

form of a Large elemental instead of Medium once per day.

14th Greater range: Your manifested familiar can move up to 50

feet per level away from you, allowing it to scout or spy for

you. It cannot communicate with you unless it is adjacent,

however, or unless you have the extended link enhancement.

16th Greater elemental form: If you have adopted the elemental

form enhancement, your elemental familiar can take the

form of a greater elemental.

18th Elder elemental form: If you have adopted the elemental

form enhancement, your elemental familiar can take the

form of an elder elemental.

Gifts of Magic

Using a standard action, you can perform minor tricks. The effects

are minimal and have severe limitations. Below are examples of what

you can accomplish with this discipline:

• You can slowly lift 1 lb. of material.

• You can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round.

• You can chill, warm, or flavor 1 lb. of nonliving material.

• You can create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches,

or remains at a fixed place. You can produce as much noise as

one normal human per caster level. Thus, you can use this discipline

to create talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or

running sounds. The noise can be virtually any type of sound

within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking

is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.

A roaring lion is equal to the noise of sixteen humans, while

a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise of twenty humans.

• You can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.

The materials are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools,

weapons, or spell components.

You cannot use Gifts of Magic to deal damage or affect the concentration

of spellcasters. The discipline’s effects lack the power to

duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object

(beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only one hour.

Common tricks include producing ethereal music, brightening

faded flowers, creating glowing balls that float over your hand, generating

puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of

bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs.

You may enhance Gifts of Magic as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Mending: You can repair small breaks or tears in objects.

Using mending, you can weld a broken metallic object

such as a ring, chain link, medallion, or slender dagger,

providing only one break exists. Ceramic or wooden

objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be

as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is

completely healed over. You can repair a magic item, but

the mending does not restore the item’s magical abilities.

You cannot affect creatures (including constructs) or

mend warps, such as those caused by a *warp wood* spell.

Mending takes a half hour.

Shield of the Seraphim

An invisible field of magical force constantly protects you. You gain

an armor bonus to Armor Class of +2 plus 1 additional point per

four caster levels.

You may enhance Shield of the Seraphim as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Hardened shield\*: You enjoy an additional +1 bonus (but

may not total more than +1 per two levels).

6th Thickened shield: You gain damage reduction 2/magic.

8th Energy shield\*: You gain resistance 10 to one energy type

of your choosing (once you choose the energy type, it cannot

change).

8th Shared protection\*: You can extend the shield to any one

adjacent creature.

16th Insight: Rather than a shield of force, the armor bonus to

Armor Class changes to an insight bonus. This shift

reflects your growing supernatural awareness.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Telekinesis

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you may move

an object of up to 5 lbs. per level from a distance of 25 feet + 5 feet

per two levels. The object moves up to 20 feet per round. As long as

you concentrate, and the object remains within range, you can continue

moving it. You cannot use fine manipulation, however—you

can move a backpack, but you can’t undo the clasp and open it. You

cannot move an object with such force that it harms another creature

or object, or itself.

You may enhance Telekinesis as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Unseen servant: The telekinetic effect can act independently

of you, exactly as described in the *unseen servant* spell

in the Core Rules. You cannot use this effect while using

the base Telekinesis discipline effect.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

6th Fine manipulation: You can manipulate objects as if you

were using one hand. This allows you to untie knots, open

jars, and so forth. You can even write with a quill, albeit

crudely.

6th Medium range: The range of the telekinesis increases to

100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.

8th Creatures: You can affect creatures as well as objects.

10th Greater capacity: The effect’s weight limit increases by

100 lbs.

12th Violent thrust: You use telekinesis to hurl an object at

another object within 20 feet. To hit the target object, you

must succeed on an attack roll using your base attack

bonus + your Intelligence modifier.Weapons cause standard

damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows

or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in

this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from

1 point per 25 lbs. (for less dangerous objects such as barrels)

to 1d6 points per 25 lbs. (for hard, dense objects

such as boulders), up to a maximum of 10d6 points of

damage total.

10th Extra fine manipulation: You can manipulate objects as if

you were using two hands. This allows you to tie knots

and perform similarly intricate actions.

16th Maximum capacity: The effect’s weight limit increases by

500 lbs.

Telepathy

You can carry on a mental conversation with a single intelligent

target at a distance of 100 feet per level. Using this discipline

requires a standard action to establish the connection; thereafter

no action is required for one minute per wizard level; at that point,

it must be reestablished. Unwilling targets may attempt a Will saving

throw to resist (DC 10 + half your level + your Intelligence

bonus). This discipline is language dependent.

You may enhance Telepathy as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Telepathic network: You can communicate with one person

per level simultaneously.

8th Language independent: You can use telepathy regardless

of any language barrier.

10th Increased range: The range becomes 100 miles per level.

16th Unlimited range: The range has no limit; the telepathy

works even across planes.

Paladins and Rangers

As with the classes described earlier in this chapter, the flavor and

basic mechanics of paladins and rangers (Hit Dice, saving throws,

base attack bonuses, etc.) do not change from what you see in the

Core Rules. Everything that *does* change is described here.

Paladins and rangers do not cast spells. Instead, they use disciplines

as described below.

Unlike the previously described classes, paladins and rangers do

not give up all of their level-based class abilities. Paladins lose only

Lay on Hands and Turn Undead. Rangers lose only Animal

Companion and Woodland Stride. Of course, they can still choose

these abilities as disciplines or discipline enhancements, if they wish.

Paladin Disciplines

Disciplines are abilities that paladins can use as often as they wish.

Their effects are spell-like abilities, which means they can be dispelled

or suppressed. Some discipline effects must be activated as

described below, while others—such as Godhammer—function all

the time.

Activating a discipline provokes attacks of opportunity. Should a

discipline effect that normally requires no activation be dispelled, it

must be activated using a full-round action to resume functioning.

A paladin chooses one discipline at 1st level; at every third level

thereafter (3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.), instead of gaining a feat, she may

choose a new discipline or an enhancement to an existing one.

(Note that all characters using this book gain a feat each level; see

Chapter Three.) Each discipline enhancement has a minimum level

requirement as described below.

Divine Inspiration

Using a standard action, you grant all allies within 30 feet a +1 luck

bonus to the following:

• attack and damage rolls; or

• saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or

• Armor Class

This bonus increases by +1 every five levels. The effect lasts for

1 round per level before it must be renewed.

You may enhance Divine Inspiration as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Continuous: Although the bonus is only half normal, putting

it into effect requires no action. Designating which

bonus to grant is a free action that can be performed once

each round.

8th Two choices: The luck bonus applies to two of the three

choices listed above.

14th All choices: The luck bonus applies to all three choices.

Divine Presence

When allies touch you, or even the hem of your clothing, they are

blessed with healing. This requires no action on your part but calls

for a standard action on their part. Affected allies gain 1d6 hit points

+ 1 point per paladin level. While there is no limit to the number of

times each day you can heal in this fashion, in a given day you can

use this discipline to heal only a number of different individuals

equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier + your level (see “Healing”

sidebar, page 8).

You may enhance Divine Presence as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Holy water: With a touch requiring a full-round action, you

transform one ounce of water into holy water.

4th Greater healing\*: You add 1d6 points of healing to each

touch (total healing dice cannot exceed 1d6 per two caster

levels).

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Godhammer

Once per round, a melee weapon sacred to your deity (if applicable)

inflicts +1 point of damage + 1 point per three levels in your hands.

This effect applies to your first attack with the weapon in the round.

You may enhance Godhammer as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

6th Ranged attacks: The damage bonus applies to ranged

attacks as well as melee attacks.

10th Weapon empowerment: The damage bonus applies to all

attacks made with the weapon in a round.

Healing Touch

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you heal another

living creature 1d8 points + 1 point per level. While there is no

limit to the number of times each day you can use this ability, in a

given day you can use it to heal only a number of different individuals

equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier + your level (see “Healing”

sidebar, page 8).

You may enhance Healing Touch as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Harm undead: You can use this ability to harm undead,

inflicting with a touch attack the amount of damage you

would normally heal.

4th Greater healing\*: You add 1d8 points of healing to each

touch (total healing dice cannot exceed 1d8 per two caster

levels).

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

8th Healing link: Rather than convey this effect by touch, you

heal at a range of up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Holy Aura

A faint halo of divine power surrounds you. You gain a deflection

bonus to Armor Class of +1 plus 1 additional point per five levels.

You may enhance Holy Aura as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Greater halo\*: You enjoy an additional +1 bonus (but may

not total more than +1 per four levels).

6th Mighty halo: You gain damage reduction 2/magic.

8th Energy protection\*: You gain resistance 10 to one energy

type of your choosing (once you choose the energy type,

it cannot change).

8th Shared protection\*: You can extend the Holy Aura to any

one adjacent creature.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Holy Weapon

Any weapon in your hands is considered good, with regard to the

type of damage it inflicts.

You may enhance Holy Weapon as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Confirmed criticals: All critical strikes against evil foes are

automatically confirmed.

8th Holy damage: If the weapon in your hands is not already

holy, it gains that weapon quality.

Turn Undead

Using a standard action and at least one free hand, you force one

undead target to flee. The undead creature’s total Hit Dice must be

equal to or less than your own. This creature is frightened and

forced to flee for 1 round + 1 round per three caster levels. No attack

roll is necessary, but the target may attempt a Will saving throw to

negate the attack (DC 10 + half your level + your Charisma bonus).

The range of the turning is 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels. For more

on turning, see the sidebar on page 8.

You may enhance Turn Undead as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Damage: Rather than fleeing, the target suffers 1d6 points

of damage plus 1d6 points per two caster levels.

4th Medium range: The range of the turning increases to 100

feet + 10 feet per caster level.

4th Immobility: The target is held motionless rather than

afraid; the effect lasts as long as you concentrate, plus

1 additional round.

4th Experienced use: Using this discipline does not provoke

an attack of opportunity.

6th Enhanced potency\*: The Will save DC is +2 higher than

normal.

8th Any target: You can affect any undead creature regardless

of Hit Dice.

10th Demons: You can affect evil outsiders as well as undead

with this discipline.

14th Evil casters: You can affect evil divine spellcasters with

this discipline.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Ranger Disciplines

Disciplines are abilities that rangers can use as often as they wish.

Their effects are spell-like abilities, which means they can be dispelled

or suppressed. Some discipline effects must be activated as

described below, while others—such as Animal Companion—are

always functioning.

Activating a discipline provokes attacks of opportunity. Should a

discipline effect that normally requires no activation be dispelled, it

must be activated using a full-round action to resume functioning.

A ranger chooses one discipline at 1st level; at every third level

thereafter (3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.), instead of gaining a feat, he may

choose a new discipline or an enhancement to an existing one.

(Note that all characters using this book gain a feat each level; see

Chapter Three.) Each discipline enhancement has a minimum level

requirement as described below.

Animal Companion

You may select an animal companion from the following list:\*

• Badger

• Camel

• Dire rat

• Dog or riding dog

• Eagle

• Hawk

• Horse (light or heavy)

• Owl

• Pony

• Snake (Small or Medium viper)

• Wolf

*\* If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM*

*may add the following creatures to the ranger’s options: crocodile, porpoise,*

*Medium shark, and squid.*

This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies you

on your adventures as appropriate for its kind. Your

companion is completely typical for its kind, gaining

one additional Hit Die and a +1 bonus to natural armor

for every ranger level above 1st. At every even-numbered

level, you can teach the animal companion an additional

trick, as described in the Handle Animal skill description

in Chapter Four of the *Player’s Handbook*.

You can handle your animal companion as a free

action or push it as a move action, even if you don’t have

any ranks in the Handle Animal skill.

If you release your companion from service, you may

gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring twentyfour

hours of uninterrupted meditation. This ceremony also

can replace an animal companion that has perished.

When you reach 8th level or higher, you may select a companion

from the alternate lists of animals below. Should you select

from one of these alternate lists, the animal gains additional Hit Dice

and natural armor bonuses as if your ranger level were lower than it

actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list’s header

from your ranger level. (If this adjustment would reduce your effective level

to 0 or lower, you can’t take that animal as a companion.)

and Dexterity increase by +2.

4th Evasion: The animal companion gains the Evasion ability

8th Damage reduction: The animal companion has DR 5/silver.

10th Second companion: You gain an additional companion

appropriate for your level. You cannot have more than

two.

12th Spell resistance: The animal companion has SR equal to

11 + your ranger level.

18th Third companion: If you chose the second companion

enhancement, you may have a third companion. You cannot

have more than three.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Nature’s Affinity

You have a particular affinity with nature, which grants you a +2

bonus to Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks and a +4 bonus

on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as

dryads, pixies, and sprites).

Further, you can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor

to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or monitor

lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to

improve the attitude of a person; roll 1d20 and add your ranger

level + your Charisma modifier. The typical domestic animal has a

starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually

unfriendly.

To use this ability, you and the animal must be able to study each

other, which means that you must be within 30 feet of one another

under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this

way takes one minute but, as with influencing people, it might take

more or less time.

You can also use this ability to improve the attitude of a magical

beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or girallon),

but you suffer a –4 penalty on the check.

You may enhance Nature’s Affinity as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Woodland stride: You may move through any sort of

undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown

areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without

taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have

been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect

you. You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot

be tracked. (You may choose to leave a trail if so desired.)

2nd Greater influence\*: You gain a +2 bonus to checks to

improve the attitude of animals and magical beasts.

4th Speak with animals: You can communicate with animals.

6th Speak with plants: You can communicate with plants,

including plant creatures.

8th Immunity to venom: You are immune to poison.

10th Elemental resistance: You gain cold resistance 10, electricity

resistance 10, and fire resistance 10.

*\* You may select this enhancement more than once; its effects stack.*

Nature’s Movement

You enjoy a +10 bonus to your speed and gain an additional +10

bonus to your speed every five levels (at 5th, 10th, etc.). Further,

you add half your ranger level (rounded up) as a bonus to your

Balance, Climb, and Jump skill checks.

You may enhance Nature’s Movement as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

8th Water walk: You can walk or run on water as if it were

solid.

Nature’s Protection

You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and enjoy

an additional +1 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class every

five levels (at 5th, 10th, etc.).

You may enhance Nature’s Protection as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

4th Woodland stealth: You gain a bonus to your Sneak\*

checks in natural surroundings. This bonus is equal to

half your ranger level (rounded up).

10th Elemental resistance: You gain cold resistance 10, electricity

resistance 10, and fire resistance 10.

*\* See Chapter Two: Skills.*

Nature’s Senses

You sense moderate or stronger magical auras on creatures and

objects you can see within 60 feet. This is not an action. You can feel

dim (lingering) or stronger magical auras on creatures and objects

you touch using a standard action. Magical areas, multiple types of

magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal

weaker auras. Enchantments and illusions cannot be seen or felt in

this way. *Nyst’s magic aura* often hides magical traps.

You may enhance Nature’s Senses as follows:

**Level Enhancement**

2nd Detection: Using a standard action, you can detect magical

auras through barriers: up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of

common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or

dirt.

4th Enhanced aura vision: You can sense faint or stronger

magical auras.

6th Enchantment sight: You can sense enchantment auras.

12th Illusion sight: You can sense illusion auras.

**Aura Strength:** An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning

spell level or an item’s caster level as follows:

5th or lower Faint aura

6th–11th Moderate aura

12th–20th Strong aura

21st+ (artifact or deity level) Overwhelming aura

If an aura falls into more than one category, Nature’s Senses indicates

the stronger of the two.

**Lingering Aura:** A magical aura lingers after its original source

dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a

magic item). A lingering aura has an aura strength of dim (even

weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level

depends on its original power:

Faint lingers 1d6 rounds

Moderate lingers 1d6 minutes

Strong lingers 1d6 × 10 minutes

Overwhelming lingers 1d6 days

Bards and Sorcerers

This book does not include alterations to either the bard or the

sorcerer class. You can play the bard as found in the Core Rules or

use the spellsong-based bard from *The Complete Book of Eldritch*

*Might.*

Sorcerers likely prove unnecessary to your game with the new

rules provided in this book—giving wizards disciplines makes

them more like sorcerers. If you still want to have sorcerers in your

campaign, however, offer them the wizard spell list presented in

Chapter Five: Magic.

Runeblade

*This class is inspired by the mage blade and runethane classes from* Monte

Cook’s Arcana Evolved*. It is designed to be used with standard d20 games.*

Runeblades wield arcane magic, but unlike wizards they do not

use spells. They create runes—visual symbols that possess magical

might—to enhance their weapon, their armor, and themselves to

make them better in the art of martial combat.

Runeblades often put nonmagical runes on their weapons, armor,

gear, and even on themselves (as tattoos), because the runes carry

meaning important to them and make them appear more powerful.

As they train to create physical manifestations of magic,

runeblades gain an affinity for physical devices of all sorts: traps,

locks, wheels, clocks, and so on. Still, their primary focus lies in martial

arts and practice with their runic weapons.

**Adventurers:** Runeblades seek adventure with gusto, brandishing

their usually very visual power to impress others. They are always

seeking new runes and ways to challenge themselves. They are not

afraid of risks, knowing their physical might coupled with their

magic can protect them and get them out of almost any jam. But

nevertheless, they are quick to create a protective or warding rune to

help keep themselves safe. Runeblades like to be prepared.

**Background:** A runeblade is far more likely to have been taught by

a learned mentor than by an academy or guild. The runeblade’s art is

very personalized, with each individual learning and mastering different

magical symbols. Runeblades typically are very physical, yet contemplative.

They are both physically skilled and extremely intelligent.

When recognized as such, a child might be brought in to work with a

tutor to learn runes and their application. The close bond between

the runeblade and his tutor often remains throughout their lives.

**Races:** Human runeblades normally come from isolated cultures

where runes are an important part of magical lore. Elf and half-orc

runeblades enjoy covering themselves with tattoos and body art and

often are artists themselves. Dwarf runeblades are quite common, far

more so than dwarf wizards. Halfling runeblades exist as well,

though they prove less showy than those of other races.

**Other Classes:** Runeblades prefer the company of wizards and can

hold their own in conversations regarding magical theory and lore. At

the same time, they are just as comfortable in the company of more

physical characters—fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians—and

appreciate worthy allies to spar with. Runeblades often spend little

time dwelling on religion or nature, so clerics and druids can strike

them as occasionally odd. Because their magic lies in the creation

and enhancement of physical objects, they seem wary around rogues.

Characters who distrust magic usually find the company of a

runeblade more tolerable than that of a wizard.

Game Rule Information

Runeblades have the following game statistics.

**Abilities:** While the runeblade’s runic abilities require a good

Intelligence score, their focus on fighting skills suggests that a good

Strength or Dexterity is also essential.

**Alignment:** Often lawful or at least nonchaotic

**Hit Die:** d8

Class Skills

The runeblade’s class skills (and the key ability for each) are

Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script

(Int), Disable Device (Int), Forgery (Int), Gather Information

(Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Open Lock

(Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis). See the *Player’s Handbook*,

Chapter Four, for skill descriptions.

**Skill Points at 1st Level:** (2 + Intelligence modifier) ×4

**Skill Points at Levels Above 1st:** 4 + Intelligence modifier

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the runeblade.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Runeblades are proficient with

all simple and martial weapons and light armor and shields.

**Runes (Sp):** Runes resemble arcane symbols. They are usually

meaningless to anyone without the Knowledge (arcana) skill. Runeblades

apply runes by magically drawing a symbol on an object, a

surface, or a creature. No rune can be used more than once per hour.

There are three kinds of runes: touch-trigger runes, applied

runes, and enchanted object runes.

• A *touch-trigger rune* is placed upon an object, a surface, or even

a creature. Basically, a rune can cover a surface as small as 1

inch square and as large as 10 feet square; multiple runes can

cover a much larger area. The first creature that touches the

object, surface, or creature bearing the rune triggers the effect

immediately. Touch-trigger runes last until triggered, dispelled,

or erased by the runeblade. If circumstances result in a

creature triggering more than one touch-trigger rune at once,

only the most powerful one takes effect. The others are triggered

but have no effect. A runeblade can choose to create a

touch-trigger rune as a visible rune or as invisible.

• *Applied runes* require the runeblade to apply the rune to

immediately activate its effects—usually related to the object,

surface, or creature the rune is placed upon. Applied runes

last only as long as their effects.

• *Enchanted object runes* require the runeblade to apply the rune

to an object no larger than himself. These imbue the item

bearing the rune with a magical ability. Enchanted object

runes last for one day per runeblade level.

Triggering identical runes at the exact same time negates both

runes. For example, while two different doors can bear a *rune of*

*conjuring*, if one door has two *runes of conjuring* on it, neither rune

functions unless they are placed so that there is no way someone

could trigger both of them at once. Likewise, a runic weapon cannot

have two *lesser elemental runes* on it.

Each rune is worth 1 point or more; a runeblade may have only a

certain number of points worth of runes in effect at any given time.

That number is called his *total rune value*. A character’s total rune

value is equal to his level + Intelligence modifier (minimum 2).

Runes come in varying power levels, each with its own associated

value: Lesser runes each have a value of 1, which counts against this

total. Advanced runes each have a value of 2, greater runes a value

of 3, and runes of power a value of 4.

Anyone looking upon a visible rune can determine what it does

by making a Knowledge (arcana) check. The check’s Difficulty Class

is 15 for lesser runes, 18 for advanced runes, 21 for greater runes,

25 for runes of power, and 30 to identify the ultimate rune and

what it does.

**Lesser Runes:** Each time the runeblade gains this ability (at 1st

through 5th levels), he learns a new lesser rune from the list below.

At 1st level, the runeblade starts with two runes. Each lesser rune

he creates counts as 1 point toward his total rune value. Creating a

lesser rune is a full-round action.

*Rune of Affliction:* This touch-trigger rune blasts the target for 1d6

points of elemental damage + 1 point per runeblade level. A Reflex

saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence bonus)

reduces the damage by half. The runeblade chooses the element

when creating the rune.

*Rune of Armor:* Anyone affected by this applied rune gains a +4

armor bonus to Armor Class or a +1 enhancement bonus to the AC

provided by existing armor. This effect lasts for one hour per

runeblade level.

*Rune of Conjuring:* When touched, this touch-trigger rune summons

a monster from the *summon monster II* list, chosen by the

runeblade at the time of creation. The monster attacks the creature

that triggered the rune for 1 round per runeblade level (or until

destroyed). If the runeblade triggers the rune, he can command the

summoned creature and it automatically obeys, even if it does not

understand the character’s language. A runeblade using the invested

rune ability (see page 24) can choose the monster from the *summon*

*monster III* list instead of doubling the effect’s duration.

*Lesser Elemental Rune:* Applied to the runeblade’s runic weapon

(see next page), this enchanted object rune inflicts 1d6 points of

additional elemental damage on a successful strike. It is usable

once per level during the duration; the runeblade decides whether

to use it at the beginning of his turn (although the rune is not used

until he successfully strikes with the weapon). It functions only on

the runeblade’s runic weapon and no others. The runeblade chooses

the element when creating the rune.

*Rune of Locking:* This is an enchanted object rune. It seals a door,

lid, or other portal like an *arcane lock* spell (see Chapter Five: Magic).

*Rune of Protection:* Applied to the runeblade’s armor, this enchanted

object rune adds a +1 luck bonus to his Armor Class. It must be

applied to armor, and only to the runeblade’s armor. Like all

enchanted object runes, it lasts one day per class level.

*Rune of Rest:* Anyone affected by this applied rune heals at double

the rate she normally would. This effect lasts for twenty-four hours

while the subject rests.

*Rune of Sleep:* This touch-trigger rune requires one who touches it

to succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence

bonus) or fall asleep for 1d4 rounds. The target must have Hit Dice

equal to or fewer than the runeblade’s; otherwise she merely becomes

dazed for 1d4 rounds. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.

*Rune of Warding:* This touch-trigger rune has two different powers.

If placed upon an object, it is a trap that forces the victim to drop the

object and not touch it again for one day per class level, unless she

succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level +

Intelligence bonus). If the rune is placed upon a surface, the victim

instead refuses to cross over or come within 10 feet of the surface for

one day per class level, unless successful in the saving throw. This is

an enchantment (compulsion) effect as well as a fear effect.

**Erase Rune (Sp):** A runeblade can attempt to erase the runes he

encounters. He can always erase his own runes without fail. If the

rune was created by another runeblade, he can make a caster level

check (DC 10 + creator’s level) to erase it. An advanced rune adds +4

to this Difficulty Class, a greater rune adds +6, a rune of power adds

+8, and the ultimate rune adds +10. A runeblade must know a rune’s

location to erase it. Erasing a rune you created is a standard action;

otherwise, it takes a full minute.

**Runic Weapon (Su):** The runeblade selects a bladed weapon that

he is proficient with and inscribes it with personal runes to make it

his runic weapon. A runeblade can have only one such weapon, and

it must be a physical weapon (not the creation of a spell), although

it can be enhanced with magic already. The weapon enjoys a +1

enhancement bonus in the runeblade’s hands only. At 4th level, and

at every four runeblade levels afterward, this bonus increases by +1

(to a maximum of +5). The weapon does not have to be masterwork

to use it as a runic weapon, but if the runeblade ever wants to

enhance it with weapon special abilities, such as keen or dancing, it

must be masterwork. The runic weapon ability provides enough of

an enhancement bonus to give the blade special abilities without

first giving it at least a +1 enhancement bonus using the normal item

creation rules.

The runic weapon gains a small modicum of sentience via the

runes. It has a very basic empathic link with the runeblade, so the

character always knows where the weapon is (distance and direction).

A runeblade can create a new runic weapon, but this results in the

destruction of the previous one, if it still exists.

Starting at 6th level, the runic weapon—unless the runeblade

mentally commands it not to—strikes at anyone other than the

runeblade who picks it up or attempts to use it. The weapon strikes

once per round until dropped, using the runeblade’s attack bonuses.

Resolve the attack as if the runeblade were wielding the weapon.

Beginning at 9th level, the runeblade can summon his runic

weapon to his hand as a standard action. The weapon can be up to

10 miles away per class level, although if it is in someone else’s possession

or in a locked room, the runeblade must make a caster level

check (DC 25) to summon it. Starting at 14th level, this summons

becomes a free action, usable once per round.

**Sense Rune (Su):** A 3rd-level and higher runeblade can make a

check (d20 + runeblade’s level + Intelligence modifier) to sense

whether an invisible or otherwise hidden rune lies within 10 feet of

him. The Difficulty Class for the check is 11 + the creator’s level. It

takes a standard action to sense a rune. After a round of sensing,

the runeblade can sense the direction of the closest unknown rune.

A runeblade who spends another round sensing can determine the

rune’s strength (lesser, advanced, etc.) This ability also works with

runic spells, such as *glyph of warding* or *symbol* spell, in which case

the runeblade learns the spell level in place of rune strength.

**Shimmering Shield (Sp):** The 4th-level runeblade can call upon

a magical shield to surround him like a shimmering aura. This

shield provides a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class per four class

levels and does not require the runeblade to wield it as a shield (he

keeps both hands free). The shimmering shield can be called upon,

as a standard action, once per day for 1 round per level.

**Invested Rune (Su):** The 5th-level and higher runeblade can

create a rune that doubles the duration, damage, or healing of a

rune he already knows. Some runes, such as a *rune of communication*,

gain no benefit from being invested. An invested rune counts

double toward the runeblade’s total rune value.

**Advanced Runes:** Each time the runeblade gains this ability (at

6th through 10th level), he learns a new advanced rune from the list

below. Each advanced rune he creates counts as 2 points toward his

total rune value. It is a full-round action to create an advanced rune.

*Hand Rune:* With this enchanted object rune, the runeblade can

summon an object from any distance as a standard action. The object

teleports to the runeblade’s hands. The object must weigh no more

than the runeblade can lift over his head. This is a teleportation effect.

*Rune of Advanced Conjuring:* When touched, this touch-trigger

rune summons a monster from the *summon monster IV* list, chosen

by the runeblade at the time of creation. The monster attacks the

creature that triggered the rune for 1 round per runeblade level (or

until destroyed). If the runeblade triggers the rune, he can command

the summoned creature and it automatically obeys, even if it

does not understand the character’s language. A runeblade using

the invested rune ability can choose the monster from the *summon*

*monster V* list instead of doubling the effect’s duration.

*Rune of Augmentation:* This applied rune grants a creature a +2

enhancement bonus on an ability score of the runeblade’s choosing.

The bonus lasts for ten minutes per runeblade level.

*Rune of Blasting:* If touched, this touch-trigger rune explodes

with elemental fury, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per runeblade

level (10d6 maximum) to all within 10 feet. A successful Reflex saving

throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence bonus)

reduces the damage by half. The runeblade chooses the element

when creating the rune.

*Rune of Charming:* Anyone touching this touch-trigger rune must

attempt a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level +

Intelligence bonus). If unsuccessful, the target reacts to the runeblade

for one minute per class level as if the runeblade’s Charisma score

had a +10 bonus. If the runeblade is not within sight of the target

creature, there is no effect. This is an enchantment (charm) effect.

*Rune of Communication:* Two or more of these enchanted object

runes must exist for any of them to function. Anyone holding an

object bearing this rune can communicate telepathically with anyone

else with one of these runes within 1 mile. The runes must all be created

by the same runeblade in order for any of them to function.

*Rune of Enrichment:* This enchanted object rune grants a +1 luck

bonus to the runeblade’s runic weapon or his armor or shield. This

luck bonus works like an enhancement bonus, except that it stacks

with enhancement bonuses and it functions only on the runeblade’s

gear.

*Rune of Fear:* Anyone touching this touch-trigger rune must

succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level +

Intelligence bonus) or drop what she is holding and flee for 1

round per runeblade level. She then acts as though affected by a

*rune of warding* for one day per runeblade level. This is an enchantment

(compulsion) effect as well as a mind-affecting fear effect.

*Rune of Healing:* Anyone touching this touch-trigger rune is filled

with positive energy that heals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per

runeblade level. Undead that touch the rune suffer 1d6 points of

damage. A single creature cannot be healed more than once per day

by a *rune of healing*.

*Rune of Slicing:* This enchanted object rune grants a runeblade’s

runic weapon the keen special weapon quality. It functions only on

the runeblade’s runic weapon and no others.

**Password (Su):** The 10th-level runeblade and beyond develops a

special password for his runes. Now, he can touch a touch-trigger

rune without triggering it. This means, for example, that a runeblade

could create a *rune of affliction* on his runic weapon and then

pick it up safely, allowing him to strike a foe and also affect the foe

with the *rune of affliction*. The runeblade may choose to have a different

password for different runes or allow them all to use the

same one. He can give the passwords to others; however the only

weapon he can mark with password-protected runes is his own

runic weapon. Also, the password does not render the runeblade or

anyone else who knows the password immune to the effects of the

rune once triggered. If the runeblade stands within the area of a

*rune of blasting* triggered by someone else, he still suffers damage.

**Slice Through Wardings (Su):** Once per day per class level,

starting at 11th level, the runeblade can make a single attack with

his runic weapon that ignores all a foe’s magic-based protections

(Armor Class bonuses, *stoneskin,* and so on). The runeblade cannot

use this ability to ignore spells or effects that take affect when a foe

is attacked, like *fire shield*. The character must declare his use of this

ability before making the attack.

**Familiarity With Magic (Ex):** The 12th-level and higher

runeblade gains a +2 competence bonus to all saving throws

against spells and spell-like and supernatural abilities (including

disciplines and magic items). Further, he gains a +2 competence

bonus to Armor Class against spells with attack rolls.

**Greater Runes:** Each time the runeblade gains this ability (at 11th

through 15th level) he learns a new greater rune from the list below.

Each greater rune counts as 3 points toward his total rune value. It

takes one minute to create a greater rune.

*Elemental Rune:* This enchanted object rune can be placed on either

a runeblade’s runic weapon or his armor. If on a weapon, the weapon

inflicts an extra 1d6 points of elemental damage each time it strikes. If

on armor, the rune gives the armor and its wearer 10 points of elemental

resistance. In either case, the runeblade chooses the element when

he creates the rune. This rune functions only on the runeblade’s gear.

*Rune of Confusion:* This touch-trigger rune affects not only the person

touching it but all within 10 feet of that person. Everyone in

range must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s

level + Intelligence bonus) or stand dazed for 1d10 rounds, unable to

act except to defend themselves.

*Rune of Dominion:* This applied rune is placed upon a living

humanoid creature. After it is placed, the creature must succeed at a

Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence

bonus) or he is *dominated* (as the spell) for one hour per runeblade

level. This is an enchantment (compulsion) and mind-affecting

effect. This rune is used to best effect on an unconscious, incapacitated,

or duped target.

*Rune of Durability:* This enchanted object rune adds 10 to the

hardness of the object that bears it. The rune can be made invisible.

*Rune of Ghosts:* This enchanted object rune grants a runeblade’s

runic weapon the ghost touch special weapon quality. It functions

only on the runeblade’s runic weapon and no others.

*Rune of Greater Conjuring:* When touched, this touch-trigger rune

summons a monster from the *summon monster VI* list, chosen by the

runeblade at the time of creation. The monster attacks the creature

that triggered the rune for 1 round per runeblade level (or until

destroyed). If the runeblade triggers the rune, he can command the

summoned creature and it automatically obeys, even if it does not

understand the character’s language. A runeblade using the invested

rune ability can choose the monster from the *summon monster VII* list

instead of doubling the effect’s duration.

*Rune of Resistance:* The creature or object upon which this applied

rune is placed gains DR 20/magic for one minute per runeblade level.

*Rune of Understanding:* This enchanted object rune allows all those

hearing the words of the object’s wielder to understand them as if

the words were spoken in their native tongue.

**Inscribe Rune (Su):** A runeblade can make one of his own runes

permanent. Creating an inscribed rune requires one hundred times the

normal amount of time. In addition, it calls for 1,000 gp worth of valuable

inks or materials for a lesser rune, 4,000 gp for an advanced rune,

10,000 gp for a greater rune, 22,000 gp for a rune of power, and

50,000 gp for the ultimate rune. The rune can still be erased, but otherwise

it never fades. Thus, a touch-trigger rune triggers every time someone

touches it (no more than once per round), and an enchanted object

rune never loses its enchantment. Applied runes cannot be inscribed.

Inscribed runes still count toward the runeblade’s total rune value.

**Runes of Power:** Each time the runeblade gains this ability (at

16th through 19th level), he learns a new rune of power from the list

below. Each rune of power counts as 4 points toward his total rune

value. It takes one minute to create a rune of power.

*Rune of Cheating Death:* This applied rune, placed upon any living

creature, lasts until triggered. When that creature is affected by something

(a spell or attack) that normally would kill it, the rune has a

chance of storing the creature’s soul safely. This effect keeps the body in

a coma when it would have died, allowing it to “come back to life” (with no level loss) upon receiving magical healing. The chance of functioning

is equal to double the runeblade’s level on a roll of percentile dice.

*Rune of Dancing:* This enchanted object rune grants a runeblade’s

runic weapon the dancing special weapon quality. It functions only

on the runeblade’s runic weapon and no others.

*Rune of Devastation:* If touched, this touch-trigger rune explodes

with elemental fury, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per class level

(20d6 maximum) to all within 20 feet. A successful Reflex saving

throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence bonus) reduces

the damage by half. The runeblade chooses the element when creating

the rune.

*Rune of Energy:* This enchanted object rune grants a runeblade’s

runic weapon the brilliant energy special weapon quality. It functions

only on the runeblade’s runic weapon and no others.

*Rune of Transformation:* This applied rune can be placed only

upon a willing creature. The subject transforms into a creature

found on any *summon monster* list below VII and remains in that

form for 1 round per runeblade level.

*Rune of Transport:* When this applied rune is completed, the creature

or object that bears it vanishes, teleporting instantly and safely to a location

known to the runeblade (one that he has physically visited himself)

within 10 miles per class level. Unwilling creatures can attempt

a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half runeblade’s level + Intelligence

bonus) to resist the transport. This is a teleportation effect.

*Rune of True Conjuring:* When touched, this touch-trigger rune

summons a monster from the *summon monster VIII* list, chosen by

the runeblade at the time of creation. The monster attacks the creature

that triggered the rune for 1 round per runeblade level (or until

destroyed). If the runeblade triggers the rune, he can command the

summoned creature and it automatically obeys, even if it does not

understand the character’s language. A runeblade using the invested

rune ability can choose a monster from the *summon monster IX*

list instead of doubling the effect’s duration.

**Spell Parry (Su):** A 16th-level and higher runeblade gains the

ability to parry spells (and spell-like effects) with his runic weapon

in hand. Only spells targeting the runeblade alone can be parried—

not area spells or spells targeted elsewhere. To parry, the runeblade

makes an attack roll opposed by the spellcaster’s caster level check. If

the runeblade’s roll is higher, the spell fails to affect him at all. The

runeblade can parry only spells he is aware of; spells from invisible

casters or those using mental-action-only casting cannot be parried.

A runeblade can parry no more than one spell in a round.

**Slice Through Spells (Su):** Once per day beginning at 18th level,

the runeblade can strike a non-Instantaneous spell effect or creation

(a summoned monster, a *wall of fire*, an illusion, an area of

*obscuring mist*, and so on) with his runic weapon and dispel it as if

he had cast *dispel magic* using his class level as the caster level. A

runeblade cannot dispel effects on a creature (like *charm person* or

*alter self*), only “stand-alone” effects. Even spells not normally subject

to *dispel magic* can be affected.

**Ultimate Rune:** The ultimate rune does not count against a character’s

total rune value. It takes ten minutes to create the ultimate

rune. This touch-trigger rune, once trigged, can replicate the effects

of any spell of 15th level or below, with the same duration, area,

range, and so forth. It can also duplicate any spell with the word

“rune,” “glyph,” “mark,” or “symbol” in the title. The runeblade can

have only one ultimate rune in existence at a time. The ultimate rune

cannot be invested, but it can be inscribed and given a password.
