# C0 - Alternate Magic: Introduction
## Overview
**One More Time**

*I had thought I was done. I had righted the wrongs done to me, achieved the victories I strove for,*

*bested those foes that deserved it, and in the end spared a few that seemed worthy of such consideration.*

*Some thought I had grown soft by that time. But my adventures were complete. My traveling days were done. I had*

*accomplished more than any mortal dared dream. I had held the very stars in my hands and crushed empires beneath my*

*heel. I had forgotten more magical lore than most arcanists had ever contemplated. Although lesser, unenlightened folk*

*thought me arrogant, surely I had earned a respite from petty struggles and the conflicts of younger mages—had I not?*

*Yet I found that even I was not entirely master of the Fates—no, not even lord of my own. I discovered that*

*I must take up my* shadowstaff *and leave my otherworldly island home one last time.*

*The multiverse would experience the might of its most terrible son once more.*

*—Malhavoc*

I simply cannot stop tinkering. I suppose it’s in my

nature. Even when the rules work just fine, I like to

experiment with them and see what other options are

available. It’s fun. *The Book of Experimental Might* is the

result of that tinkering. To tell you the truth, I never

intended these rules to be published. They were created for

my own games. But I did discuss them in my online journal

at <www.montecook.com> and on the message boards

there, and a lot of readers told me they were interested in

learning more. In fact, the response overwhelmed me. So I

compiled this book by putting together the new stuff I had

created with some stuff from my previous products that is

very important in my current campaigns.

One of the main concepts explored throughout the

material in this book is the idea that the game’s magic system

embraces twenty levels of spells, not just nine. This is

an old idea, stemming from conversations during the 3rd

Edition design process about the many meanings of the

word “level” in the game. Really, it just makes sense to

offer magic-using characters twenty levels of spells—it’s

easier to remember that a 13th-level character can cast up

to 13th-level spells, not 7th. You’ll see that the material in

several chapters of this book speaks to this idea.

More than any of my previous roleplaying books, this

one is very conversational in tone and relaxed in nature. It

comes purely from my own games that I run for fun, not for

playtesting or any work-related endeavor. This is really just

one gamer talking to another here, nothing more.

Overview

This book is basically a collection of house rules that follows

the general structure of the 3rd Edition *Player’s Handbook*

and other variants like *Arcana Evolved* and other Books of

Might from Malhavoc Press. Here’s a chapter-by-chapter

rundown of the contents:

**Chapter One: Classes**—This chapter presents a new class,

the runeblade, and modified versions of the other core spellcasting

classes. The modifications in large part take advantage

of new aspects of the game presented in this book, such as

the twenty levels of spells described in Chapter Five.

**Chapter Two: Skills—**Here you will see a few skill-related

rules alterations, such as background skills and techniques

for identifying magic items. This chapter also introduces

variant versions of a few existing skills.

**Chapter Three: Feats**—This chapter offers a new, more

generous method for gaining feats, in addition to a number

of new feats and updated versions of core feats.

**Chapter Four: Playing the Game—**This section includes

new rules and alterations that affect the play of the game,

mainly related to health and combat.

**Chapter Five: Magic—**The largest chapter in the book

offers new rules for magic, in particular material to help flesh

out the concept of offering twenty levels of spells rather than

nine. Many spells presented here originally appeared in

*Monte Cook’s Arcana Evolved*, *The Complete Book of Eldritch*

*Might*, or *The Book of Hallowed Might.* Others are modified

forms of spells from the Core Rules.

Throughout *The Book of Experimental Might*, all references

to spells, feats, and other rules not in this book come from

the v. 3.5 revision of the three Core Rulebooks: the *Player’s*

*Handbook*, DMG, and MM. This sourcebook is protected

content except for items specifically called out as Open

Gaming Content on the title page. For full details, please

turn to the Appendix on page 84. Open content is not otherwise

marked in the text of this book.

Using This Book

Even though this book may seem like a hodge-podge of various

rules, I encourage you to use its contents as a cohesive

whole in your games, as much of it interrelates. For example, the disciplines in Chapter One rely on the idea that all characters

get a new feat each level, as described in Chapter Three. The new

metamagic feats in Chapter Three depend on the twenty-level

spell progression to function. And so on. So, if you decide to pick

and choose rules from this book to use, do so carefully.

Because this is a book of my own house rules, I’ve annotated it

heavily—much more than I usually do—to show you not only

what rules I have changed, but why. You’ll find numerous asides,

many of them set apart as sidebars, that explain why I use a particular

new rule or suggest some things to consider if you’re thinking

about using it.

In retrospect, maybe I should have done more of this in my previous

books. On some level, I suppose I always thought it was fun

for readers to look at a rule and figure out on their own why it was

(or maybe wasn’t) a good idea. Lots of author notes and commentary

can get heavy handed. In fact, as strange as it may sound, I

loathe reading most designer’s/author’s notes or behind-the-scenes

commentary. In many cases, these notes become a self-aggrandizing

opportunity to bash existing rules, and nobody wants that. Mostly,

though, I never wanted my designer’s blather to get in the way of

the actual rules. I write sourcebooks, rulebooks, and adventures to

be *used*, not just read, and when you’re trying to reference a rule or

an encounter, a lot of talk muddles things up.

Talking here about what this book *is* reminds me of what it is

*not*. It is not an indictment on the existing rules at all. There is no

presumption here that these changes are better than the Core

Rules. They merely exist as an alternative—a change of pace. An

experiment. Something for you to play around with, particularly if

your group has been using the existing rules for a long time and

you feel like mixing things up a bit.

In many ways, the rules here are very generous and make characters

more powerful across the board.Of course, what’s good for the

PCs is good for the NPCs, too. As I’ve pointed out to my players

numerous times, I love making NPCs with all the extra feats (see

Chapter Three). The goal, however, is simply to make things more

fun. These rules and changes address what the game has become

after so many years of play, and—just as importantly—what we’ve all

become: players and DMs who have lots of experience with the rules.
