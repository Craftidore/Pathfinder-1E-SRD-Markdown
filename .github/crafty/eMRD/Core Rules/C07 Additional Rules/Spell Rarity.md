# Spell Rarity
## Overview
Spells come in 7 different rarities.  

The rarities are: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, Unique, and Lost and/or Restricted.

Rarity is usually be determined by source.

**Common Spells:** The effects and details of common spells are generally known, even by wizards who may not have the spell in their spellbooks. All spells found in the Core Rulebook are common spells (unless ruled to be less common by the GM). Spells listed for the wizard class in world-specific material (such as the World of Greyhawk campaign) are common for wizards of that world, but might be less than common or even unknown in another campaign setting.

Spellcasters that receive new spells when leveling up (for example: wizards) learn these new spells through research. Spell rarity affects the new spells in the following way. Half of any spells received when leveling up must be common spells. Any limitation on spell selection--such as those for school or class--apply to all spells, even common ones. Note that GMs may have their own campaign guidelines. For example, the GM might require every PC wizard to have a mentor, restricting any 'free' spells (those not found or directly researched) to spells in the books of the mentor.

Common spells are identified by a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC (15 + spell level).

**Uncommon Spells:** Spells found in any other official Paizo publication (though there may be some exceptions that become more or less rare) fall into this category. These spells are less well known, but not restricted to a race or special group (for example, dragons or the Shadow Mages of Lost City). A specialization or archetype might allow an uncommon spell to be treated as a common one.

A PC wizard cannot start with an uncommon spell and may only learn it in the course of normal level advancement after half of any spells received (usually 2, so 1) have been taken from among common spells. Usually uncommon spells are encountered and then learned when found on a magical scroll or in a spellbook, developed as research, or purchased from an NPC spellcaster.

Uncommon spells may be restricted by the GM, though this is not likely.

Uncommon spells are identified by a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC (20 + spell level).

**Rare Spells:** Rare spells found in any Wizards of the Coast publication or are specialized or hidden magic, such as closely guarded magic developed by a secret cabal or wizard's guild. Besides spells that are just less well known, two special types of rare spells exist: 1) Spells known by a specific nonhuman races (such elves or halflings); and 2) Spells from a campaign-specific group that is not given in the Core Rulebook (such as the Silent Ones of Keoland or the Red Wizards of Thay). Rare spells are often restricted by the GM based on the style and type of campaign they are running.

Player character wizard encounter rare spells only as a result of campaign-specific conditions. Rare spells are frequently the target of spell research as gaining access to them otherwise is as the type says: 'rare'. Rare spells are more likely to be restricted by the GM than uncommon ones.

Rare spells are identified by a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC (25 + spell level) and the spell research DC for them is increased by +5 (15 + twice the spell's level).

**Very Rare Spells:** Spells found in other third party sources are classified as very rare. The GM typically controls access to such spells and they might be known by a very few (or even only one) NPC caster within a campaign universe. GMs often restrict very rare spells.

Very rare spells are identified by a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC (30 + spell level) and the spell research DC for them is increased by +10 (20 + three times the spell's level).

**Unique Spells:** Such a spell has been researched by a player (or even an NPC) and is frequently an experimental spell the GM wishes to playtest before allowing it be reclassified to a lesser degree of rarity. Typically unique spells may only be learned from their creators (or occasionally from the creator's writings). Gaining a unique spell should be an infrequent thing for wizards and tied to a significant campaign event.

Unique spells are identified by a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC (35 + spell level) and the spell research DC for them is increased by +15 (25 + four times the spell's level).

Spells from any source may be adjusted up or down in rarity as determined by the GM.

**Lost and Restricted Spells**

Two other definitions/classifications exist for spells: lost spells and restricted spells. Occasionally a GM may wish to mention or have their players encounter as spell which has no published details or existed in a form not updated for the Pathfinder Role Playing Game. He will give no details for such as spell other than the name and the fact it is 'lost knowledge.' Such a spell is a 'lost spell.'

Restricted spells are barred to wizards (PC and NPC) except those specifically allowed by the GM. This is often done so that an encounter with an NPC wizard is especially epic or to give a PC wizard a special one time reward for EXCEPTIONAL play.

**How Spell Rarity Affects Costs**

When selling a scroll or spellbook, the rarity of each spell found within affects its sale value. Normally scrolls and spells (in a spellbook) sell for half value; spell rarity adjusts this value as follows: common spells sell for half value (50%), uncommon spells have a 5% increase in value when sold (55%), rare spells have a 10% increase in value when sold (60%), very rare spells have a 25% increase in value when sold (75%), and unique spells have a 50%-150% increase in value when sold (sell for full value or more).

Within Realm Works, spell rarity is shown as a tag.

When generating spells for scrolls and spellbooks, use the following table to determine the rarity of spells found:


| **d100** | **Rarity of spell found** | **Rarity by Source** |
|---|---|---|
| 1-70 | Common | Core Rulebook |
| 71-90 | Uncommon | Any other official Paizo publication |
| 91-95 | Rare | Any Wizards of the Coast publication |
| 96-99 | Very rare | Any other third party source |
| 100 | Unique | Any researched by a PC (or even an NPC \[GM]) |
