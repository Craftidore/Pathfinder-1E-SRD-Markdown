# Weapons of Legacy
## Overview
**Introduction**

The raging red eye wept hellfire tears.

Aedwar, called He of the Steely Heart, gazed into the heart of the inferno. The fiery portal returned the look—undaunted, uncaring.

Chanting fiends surrounded and bolstered the portal’s appalling intrusion. Summoned by the Dire Cabal, the demons were immune to the threats of mortal steel and magic. With each syllable they repeated, the searing aperture yawned wider.

But Aedwar had something that the Dire Cabal had not reckoned on.

He of the Steely Heart flipped back his cloak, revealed in grip a dull black blade, scribed with runes of grim promise. Once a blade of storied guile and soul-swallowing repute, it was now a blade redeemed.

It was *Exordius*.

White light streamed from *Exordius’*s edges, and rays of brilliant clarity flooded from the jewel in its pommel. The demons flinched, and their chant faltered, but resumed a moment later. After all, what need had they to fear a mortal blade? While they maintained their rite, they were immune to the cuts and insults of all weapons, even those consecrated by the powers of good.

But the dull black blade had a legacy behind it, a convoluted story of loss and gain, transformation and redemption. *Exordius’*s powers were not confined to the merely mortal, or even the merely good. 

Aedwar waded in, and as the slaughter began, the dull black blade began to glow as it drank in the lives of the foulest spirits of the Abyss.

Such is the power of a weapon of legacy

## More Than Meets the Eye
Mythic history is replete with tales of singular weapons of legendary champions, magic staffs of remarkable heritage, and rings that grant powers undreamed by most mortals. Such wonders stand in ability as far above standard magic items as a magic item surpasses its mundane counterpart. A *[[Feather Falling|ring of feather falling]]* is a handy thing to have, but few would not give it up for *Bright Evening Star*, whose radiance illuminates the darkness and sears its enemies. And who wouldn’t trade a *+1 crossbow* for the chance to wield *Flamecaster’s Bolt*, that storied weapon prized for its lethal sway over fire? 

Finding these items of legacy, forged in the heat of momentous events and wielded by legendary heroes, is just the first step. Prospective wielders must also learn how to unlock their powers before using them to their fullest capacity.

**WHAT’S INSIDE**

*Weapons of Legacy* describes magic items that are more than what they seem, granting great power to those who can discover their nature.

The first chapters present the basic rules for items of legacy, as well as information for adding them to your campaign. They also detail a variety of options available to characters who wield legacy items, from feats to spells to a new prestige class.

The book then offers forty-nine fully detailed items of legacy, including swords, staffs, and wondrous items. Full histories of each item are included, along with rituals to unlock their mysterious powers and adventure seeds to introduce them to a campaign. Sections on tailoring the items to a FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON campaign are also provided in many cases.

DMs and players then learn how to create customized items of legacy as their characters and campaigns evolve, as well as explore a range of variants on the legacy item rules, such as mutable legacies, epic legacy items, and even monsters that embody legacy abilities.

**WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY**

*Weapons of Legacy* is intended for use in any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. You will need the three D&D core rulebooks—*Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide,* and *Monster Manual*. In addition, it includes references to material in the *Epic Level Handbook,* the *Expanded Psionics Handbook, Complete Adventurer, Complete Warrior,* and *Races of the Wild,* among other supplements. Although possession of any or all these supplements will enhance your enjoyment of this book, they are not strictly necessary.
