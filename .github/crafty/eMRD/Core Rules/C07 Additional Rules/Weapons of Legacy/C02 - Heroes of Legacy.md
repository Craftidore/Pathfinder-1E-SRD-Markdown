# C02 - Heroes of Legacy
## Overview
In a world of menace, where creatures of savage

hunger stalk the vulnerable, and where ancient,

evil gods encourage villainy and mayhem, the

abilities of the heroic few are sorely tested. For

aid, heroes can call upon potent spells, abilities honed

by diligent training and experience, and cunning

items of magical might.

But there is deeper and more ancient lore too.

This chapter provides additional resources for

wielders (and founders) of items of legacy, including

new feats, spells, psionic powers, and a legacy-themed

prestige class.

LEGACY FEATS

Unlocking the legacy abilities of an item requires

the related legacy feat (least, lesser, or greater). Other

legacy-related feats allow you to further enhance the

item’s abilities.

In addition to the listed prerequisites, you must

physically possess (carry, wear, or wield) your legacy

item to benefit from any legacy feat.

The feat descriptions below use the same format

presented in the *Player’s Handbook*.

**Table 2–1: Legacy Feats**

**Feats Prerequisites Benefit**

Least Legacy Character level 5th, perform Gain access to item’s least legacy abilities

associated least legacy ritual

Lesser Legacy Least Legacy, character level 11th, Gain access to item’s lesser legacy abilities

Greater Legacy Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, Gain access to item’s greater legacy abilities

character level 17th, perform

associated greater legacy ritual

Channel Legacy Least Legacy, legacy ability Expend legacy ability to gain bonus on attacks, saves,

checks with daily use limit

Master Legacy Channel Legacy, Least Legacy, +1 level for using legacy abilities

Quicken Legacy Least Legacy, spell-like or command- Trigger legacy ability as a swift action

activated legacy ability

Transfer Legacy Least Legacy, legacy ability Transfer ability from legacy item to another magic

item with daily use limit

CHANNEL LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You can call upon the hidden strength within

your legacy item to empower yourself for a single

spectacular effort.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with

a daily use limit.

Benefit: Choose one of your item’s available

legacy abilities with a daily use limit. As an

immediate action (see the sidebar on page

15), you can expend all the daily uses of that

ability to grant yourself a bonus on all attack

rolls, saves, and checks. This bonus lasts until

the start of your next turn and depends on the

power of the legacy ability, as shown in the

following table.

**Legacy Ability Expended Bonus**

Least +2

Lesser +4

Greater +6

All daily uses of the legacy ability are expended

without their normal effect. You choose the

ability when you use this feat.

Special: You cannot use this feat to expend any

legacy ability that does not have its full daily complement

of uses remaining. For example, if a legacy

ability is usable three times per day, all three daily

uses must be available to use this feat.

CURATIVE LEGACY \[LEGACY]

Your item’s legacy ability is so linked with your

aura that it restores your health each time it is

activated.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a

daily use limit, ability to cast *cure light wounds*.

Benefit: When you select this feat, choose one

of your item’s available legacy abilities with a daily

use limit. Each time you activate the chosen ability,

you regain hit points as though a *cure* spell were cast

on you. You cannot gain more hit points than your

full normal total. The amount of damage healed

depends on the power of the ability, as shown in the

following table.

**Legacy Ability Hit Points**

**Activated Restored**

Least 5

Lesser 10

Greater 25

Special: You can gain Curative Legacy multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

EMPOWER LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You can use one of your item’s legacy abilities to

greater effect.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, spell-like or commandactivated

legacy ability.

Benefit: When you select this feat, choose one

available spell-like legacy ability of a specific item,

or one whose effect is triggered by a command word.

Three times per day, you can choose to increase by

one-half all variable, numeric effects of that ability

(as the Empower Spell feat).

Special: You can gain Empower Legacy multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

GREATER LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You awaken the most powerful abilities of a specific

item of legacy.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy, character

level 17th, learn and perform the associated greater

legacy ritual of the chosen item.

Benefit: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item, if you are founding a legacy). If you meet the

other prerequisites for wielding that item, you can

use any of the item’s greater legacy abilities that are

available to a character of your level.

LEAST LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You awaken the basic abilities of a specific item

of legacy.

Prerequisites: Character level 5th, learn and

perform the associated least legacy ritual of the

chosen item.

Benefit: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item, if founding a legacy). If you meet the other

prerequisites for wielding that item, you can use any

of the item’s least legacy abilities that are available to

a character of your level.

LEGACY FOCUS \[LEGACY]

Your item’s legacy abilities are more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Least Legacy.

Benefit: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving

throws against your legacy item’s abilities.

LESSER LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You awaken more powerful abilities of a specific item

of legacy.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, character level 11th,

learn and perform the associated lesser legacy ritual

of the chosen item.

Benefit: Choose one item of legacy (or candidate

item, if founding a legacy). If you meet the other

prerequisites for wielding that item, you can use any

of the item’s lesser legacy abilities that are available

to a character of your level.

MASTER LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You temporarily gain access to legacy abilities beyond

your normal reach.

Prerequisites: Channel Legacy, Least Legacy, Use

Magic Device 4 ranks.

Benefit: Once per day as a free action, you can

treat your character level as if it were one higher for

determining which legacy abilities you can use. You

do not pay any new personal costs associated with

the increased level, but you cannot access any abilities

for which you have not met the prerequisites.

For example, a 10th-level character gains no benefit

from this feat, since she has not yet gained the Lesser

Legacy feat required to use legacy abilities of 11th

level or higher.

This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you activate

a legacy ability with a daily use limit, whichever

comes first.

QUICKEN LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You can activate one of your item’s legacy abilities

with a moment’s thought.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, spell-like or commandactivated

legacy ability.

Benefit: When you select this feat, choose one available

spell-like legacy ability of a specific item, or one

whose effect is triggered by a command word. Three

times per day, you can trigger that power as a swift

action, as the Quicken Spell feat (see the definition

of swift actions in the sidebar below).

Special: You can gain Quicken Legacy multiple

times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the

feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

TRANSFER LEGACY \[LEGACY]

You can temporarily transfer one of your legacy item’s

abilities to another magic item.

Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a

daily use limit.

Benefit: Choose one of your item’s available legacy

abilities with a daily use limit. Once per day, you

can transfer that ability from your legacy item to

another magic item. This transfer requires you to

touch the legacy item to the recipient magic item

(a standard action).

For the next 24 hours, you cannot activate the

transferred ability. However, the wielder of the

recipient magic item can activate the transferred

ability as the legacy item’s wielder, for as many uses

as remain in the day. The recipient wielder need not

meet any prerequisites for activating or using the

donor legacy item.

Special: You cannot transfer a legacy ability that

does not have at least one daily use remaining. You

choose the ability when you use this feat.

If you have the Lesser Legacy feat, you can use

this ability two times per day. If you have the

Greater Legacy feat, you can use this ability three

times per day. Each time you do so, you must choose

a different ability.

SPELLS OF LEGACY

Over the years, spellcasters have developed a few

incantations to manipulate the abilities of legacy

items. Some of these spells benefit an item’s

wielder, while others are preferred by the enemies

of those individuals.

SPELL LISTS

Some of these spells are usable by classes other

than those in the *Player’s Handbook*. The hexblade is

described in *Complete Warrior*. Spells granted to the

shugenja (*Complete Divine*) fall into the “All” category

for that class. The favored soul and spirit shaman (also

from *Complete Divine*) can cast any spell available to

clerics or to druids, respectively. Spells granted to

the wu jen (*Complete Arcane*) do not belong to any

elemental group.

SPELLS

The spells herein are presented in alphabetical order

(with the exception of those whose names begin with

“greater,” “least,” or “lesser”; see Order of Presentation,

page 181 of the *Player’s Handbook).*

Revitalize Legacy, Greater

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 9, druid 9, shugenja 9, sorcerer/wizard

9, wu jen 9

This spell functions like *least revitalize legacy*, except

that you regain one daily use of a chosen greater

legacy ability.

Revitalize Legacy, Least

Transmutation

Level: Bard 3, cleric 3, druid 3, paladin 3, ranger 3,

shugenja 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, wu jen 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Your legacy item; see text

Duration: 1 hour/level or until expended

Saving Throw: None

Power Resistance: No

Choose one of your legacy item’s least legacy abilities

with a daily use limit. You regain one daily use of the

chosen ability. This use must be expended within the

spell’s duration, or it is lost.

If all daily uses of all least legacy abilities of the

item are still available, this spell has no effect (that

is, it can’t increase the number of available daily

uses above the normal maximum). No legacy item

can be affected by this spell more than once in a

24-hour period.

*Focus:* Your legacy item, which you must be holding,

wearing, or wielding.

Revitalize Legacy, Lesser

Transmutation

Level: Bard 5, cleric 5, druid 5, shugenja 5, sorcerer/

wizard 5, wu jen 5

This spell functions like *least revitalize legacy*, except that

you regain one daily use of a chosen lesser ability.

Sever Legacy

Necromancy

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8, wu jen 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You permanently disrupt the bond between the target

creature and its legacy item (or items). The target is

treated as if it had not performed any of the legacy

rituals for its item or items. It loses all of the following

feats it has gained for all of its legacy items: Greater

Legacy, Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy.

If the target’s Hit Dice total exceeds your caster

level, the target adds the difference as a bonus on its

Will save to negate the effect. Any creature that successfully

saves against this spell cannot be affected

by it again for 24 hours.

The target does not regain any of the personal costs

paid to gain access to legacy abilities. It can regain

access to its item’s legacy abilities by performing the

requisite rituals again. In this case, it does not pay

again any personal costs that it has already paid.

Other than by again performing the legacy rituals to

regain lost feats, the effect of this spell can be negated

only by *miracle* or *wish*.

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You temporarily disrupt the bond between the target

creature and a single legacy item it possesses. The

target loses access to all legacy abilities granted by

that item. For the duration of the spell, it cannot

activate any of the item’s legacy abilities, nor do any

continuous effects of the legacy item grant any benefit

to the target.

If the target has more than one legacy item, determine

randomly which one is affected.

This effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated

by *break enchantment, remove curse,* or any other effect

that removes a curse.

LEGACY PSIONIC POWERS

Just as spellcasters are able to manipulate the essence

of a legacy item, so, too, are psionically aware creatures

able to influence items of legacy through the powers

of the mind.

For more about the presentation of psionic powers,

see Chapter 5 of the *Expanded Psionic Handbook.*

## Prestige Class: Legacy Champion
**PRESTIGE CLASS: LEGACY CHAMPION**

*“In my hand, talismans of ancient manufacture have no secrets. Their primeval power is mine.”*

*                                                                                                                              — Marrush Scarhand*

As a legacy champion, you are so devoted to the history

and chronicle of a particular item of legacy that you

enjoy enhanced access to your item’s legacy abilities.

You can learn the needed rituals more quickly and

use the item’s abilities more often, and you can even

customize the item’s abilities to your own purpose.

The story of a particular legacy item becomes central

to your own identity, so much so that you might

change part of your name, behavior, clothing, or other

attributes to more closely reflect historical or visual

aspects of your item.

BECOMING A

LEGACY CHAMPION

To become a legacy champion, you must already possess

an item of legacy, have unlocked its least abilities,

and be on the cusp of unlocking its lesser abilities.

No particular class is most associated with legacy

champions—obsession can be visited upon anyone.

Members of classes more inclined to study ancient

texts, such as wizards, have a slight predilection for

becoming legacy champions; however, reduced spellcasting

ability keeps wizards from predominating.

**Legacy Champion Entry Requirements**

**Skill:** Knowledge (history) 5 ranks.

**Feat:** Least Legacy\*.

**Special:** Must possess a legacy item, character

level 10th.

\*New feat; see page 14.

**Table 2–1: The Legacy Champion Hit Die: d8**

**Base Fort Ref Will**

**Class Skills (4 + Int modifier per level):** Concentration, Decipher Script, Gather Information, Knowledge (history),

Use Magic Device, plus existing class skills from all your classes.

CLASS FEATURES

As a legacy champion, you are focused on exploring

to the fullest the potential of your legacy item. Your

class features deal with getting needed information

more quickly and exploiting it effectively. Your existing

class abilities continue to advance at nearly their

full rate, interrupted only by opportunities to unlock

legacy abilities at greatly reduced cost.

Class Features: At each level except 1st and 7th,

you gain class features and an increase in effective

level as if you had also gained a level in a class to which

you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

The specific class features you gain include spells

per day (and spells known, if applicable), improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, bonus feats, monk special abilities,

sneak attack progressions, and so on, depending

on the class. You do not, however, gain the benefit of

your previous class’s Hit Dice, attack progression,

skill points, or saving throws. If you had more than

one class before becoming a legacy champion, you

must decide to which class to add each level for the

purpose of determining class abilities.

Reduced Ritual Cost: After you’ve made a successful

Knowledge (history) check to learn the lesser

legacy ritual for your legacy item, you can perform

that ritual and gain the Lesser Legacy feat as normal.

However, you do not pay the ritual’s associated gp cost.

You must still perform all other aspects of the ritual

and pay any personal costs required to unlock lesser

abilities. If you have more than one legacy item, you

must decide to which one this reduction applies.

On reaching 7th level, you can perform the greater

legacy ritual for your item without paying the associated

gp cost.

Bond of Lore (Ex): You add your class level as an

insight bonus to Knowledge (history) checks made

in relation to your legacy item.

Replace Legacy Ability (Ex): As your bond with

your legacy item strengthens, you become capable of

permanently changing the item’s abilities to suit your

needs. At 2nd level, you can replace any one least ability

granted by your item with your choice of any least ability

from Menu A in Chapter 4: Founding Legacies.

At 5th level, you can replace any one least or lesser

ability with your choice of any least ability from Menu

A or any lesser ability from Menu D, respectively.

At 10th level, you can replace any one least, lesser,

or greater ability with your choice of any least ability

from Menu A, any lesser ability from Menu D, or any

greater ability from Menu G, respectively.

Extra Legacy Ability Use (Su): As your bond

with your legacy item strengthens, you can draw

on its abilities more often than normal. At 3rd level,

choose one of your item’s least abilities with a daily

use limit. You can use that ability one extra time per

day. Once you have chosen an ability, you cannot

change it later.

At 6th level, you can also gain an extra daily use

of one of your item’s lesser abilities. At 9th level, you

can also gain an extra daily use of one of your item’s

greater abilities. You can instead choose to gain an

extra daily use of a lower ability (for example, choosing

a second least ability instead of a lesser ability at 6th

level), but you can’t gain more than one extra daily

use of a given ability.

If your item has no legacy abilities with a daily

use limit, you gain no benefit from this class feature.

If you later gain access to an eligible legacy ability,

you can immediately choose that ability for an extra

daily use.

Bonus Legacy Feat: At 4th and 8th level, you gain

a bonus feat related to your legacy item, which can be

selected from any of the legacy feats in this chapter

for which you meet the prerequisites.

### Playing a Legacy Champion
**PLAYING A LEGACY CHAMPION**

You hold a deep reverence for the historical significance of your legacy item. You know that many useful and valid lessons lie in the story of its founding and the events that surround its passage down the ages to your current stewardship. The pageant of its history contains myriad stories that, if properly interpreted, remain as relevant today as the day the item was founded.

The history of the legacy item is more than a litany of craving for power, of bloodlust, violence, destruction, and war—you are part of that history, even as it unfolds. In your hands, the item continues its great journey through the ages, becoming a part of events yet to take shape. In some distant future, it might be your name that is repeated in awe when some lucky person finds the legacy item and learns something of its past.

**Combat**

If your legacy item is primarily made for battle, then obviously it is your first and last recourse when conflict beckons. In fact, the more attention you draw to yourself and the wonder you wield, the more you might intimidate foes with its unparalleled potency. Use Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate before or during combat while reciting your item’s pedigree to shake your enemies’ confidence in their ability to defeat you.

**Advancement**

Your advancement as a legacy champion can vary widely, depending on your original class. Because you continue to have limited access to some of that class’s abilities, your best strategy is to customize your item’s legacy abilities to your original class. For instance, if you were originally a fighter, your legacy item is probably a weapon. A reasonable advancement plan is continuing to choose bonus fighter feats that enhance your prowess with that weapon; in addition, you can customize the weapon’s legacy abilities to work better with your existing talents.

**Resources**

Since this prestige class depends on possessing an item of legacy, your first resource is obvious. Beyond that, you need to continue your research into the specific details needed to unlock your item’s history. In this regard, your singular knowledge of obscure history can get you ready access to many libraries. Likewise, the reputation of your learning is sufficient to grant you audiences with sages who might be able to provide additional information in return for your own expertise.

### Legacy Champions in the World
**LEGACY CHAMPIONS IN THE WORLD**

Characters particularly proficient with legacy items are a rare breed, especially since legacy items are not nearly as common as standard magical items.

**Organization**

Legacy champions have no particular or overarching organizations. Each is unique, and other than an all-consuming desire to learn as much as possible about his legacy item, each legacy champion has little in common with any other.

**NPC Reactions**

Most people generally do not recognize a legacy champion as anything more than someone with a particularly powerful magic item. If he further advertises his item’s pedigree, NPCs might be impressed or afraid, but no more so than with any other character displaying an impressive weapon or staff.

Those NPCs who understand the concept of legacy items are likely to be impressed by the legacy champion’s possession, whether or not they understand that he has more fully tapped into its power than most could ever hope for. Their reaction might be mere admiration, but often this is mixed with envy and greed. As with any wielder of potent magic, a legacy champion must be vigilant against those who want only to take the legacy item for themselves (for all the good it would do them).

### Legacy Champion Lore
**LEGACY CHAMPION LORE**

Characters with Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), or Gather Information can research legacy champions to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the information from lower DCs.

**DC 10:** Some magic items possess hidden powers that are diffi cult, if impossible, to wake.

**DC 15:** Some magic items of epic pedigree, called items of legacy, can be wakened to greater power if enough of their history is researched and understood.

**DC 20:** Among the wielders of legacy items are those who more fully tap into their items’ powers. These are called “legacy champions.”

**DC 30:** Legacy champions do not have to pay the enormous costs associated with awakening a legacy item to its full potency. Moreover, they gain access to their items’ abilities more quickly and can use them more often.

Establishing contact with a legacy champion is difficult. Characters trying to do so should make a DC 25 Gather Information check to fi nd a library or sage, through which a meeting can be arranged, or a DC 30 Gather Information check to track the legacy champion down directly. If a PC possesses a legacy item or has information about a legacy item, the check has a +2 circumstance bonus.

### Legacy Champions in the Game
**LEGACY CHAMPIONS IN THE GAME**

Legacy champions can show up anywhere—they have no particular creed or affiliation and thus are not constrained to particular situations or styles of game play.

**Encounters**

Although legacy champions could show up in any situation, they are uncommon, and NPC legacy champions should be rarely encountered. When such a meeting happens, it is memorable.

EL 15: Marrush Scarhand wields the mighty spear *Guurgal* (see page 103). He believes that by discovering the weapon, he is destined to be leader of the Great Horde, an army of orcs that will wash over the civilized peoples of the world.

Marrush is typically accompanied by a 10th-level half-orc barbarian and 1d4 5th-level half-orc barbarians (use the statistics on page 112 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).
