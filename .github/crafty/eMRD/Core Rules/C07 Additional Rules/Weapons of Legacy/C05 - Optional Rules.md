# C05 - Optional Rules
## Overview
This chapter presents a variety of twists that

you, as the DM, can add to expand the rules

for items of legacy. From items with dual,

even opposing legacies to monsters that

seethe with mythic power, from heroes

sharing legacies with comrades to wielders unlocking

epic legacy abilities, this chapter lets you further

customize a legacy-themed campaign.

ALTERNATIVES

TO KNOWLEDGE

(HISTORY) CHECKS

Making a Knowledge (history) check is the usual means

of learning the background and rituals associated with

a legacy item. At your discretion, other methods are

possible. The following optional rules make using

legacy items easier for less scholarly adventurers.

OTHER KNOWLEDGE SKILLS

Weapons tied heavily to a specific church or deity,

such as the *Bow of the Black Archer* or *Durindana,* might

be featured prominently in the myths and dogma

of that religion. In such cases, you might allow the

PCs to substitute Knowledge (religion) checks for

Knowledge (history) checks. Likewise, the history

of an item strongly tied to the arcane, such as *Bright*

*Evening Star,* might warrant Knowledge (arcana)

checks, while one that figures prominently in

local affairs and tales might be uncovered with a

Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check.

If the player makes a valid case for substituting

another Knowledge check, go ahead and allow it.

However, you should increase the check DCs by

5, since these sorts of tales seldom include the

specific details necessary to properly perform

legacy rituals.

BARDIC KNOWLEDGE

AND LORE

Bards, with their vast repertoire of tales,

histories, and gossip, might very well know

something of legacy items and their history.

You can allow a bardic knowledge check as

a substitute for Knowledge (history), but you

should increase the check DC by 5 to reflect

the fact that bardic knowledge is sketchy and

incomplete in most cases.

206

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

Loremasters focus exclusively on ancient secrets,

unlike bards. Their repertoire of knowledge is vast, so

a loremaster’s lore check should entail no DC increase

if used in place of a Knowledge (history) check.

MAGICAL DIVINATION

Using divination magic is the easiest, most efficient

way to learn the history of a legacy item. The

*identify* and *legend lore* spells are commonly used

for this purpose.

Identify: This spell reveals all the standard magical

abilities of a legacy item but none of its legacy abilities.

It does, however, grant a +2 bonus on Knowledge

(history) checks (or alternative checks) to research the

item’s background.

Legend Lore: This spell uncovers enough knowledge

to learn and perform all legacy rituals for

an item.

MUTABLE LEGACY ITEMS

Mutable items are a special subcategory of legacy

items whose properties change with the addition

of different components. *Skull Lash,* for example

(see page 147), confers on its wielder special abilities

characteristic of the creature whose skulls forms one

of the flail’s heads. Other examples of mutable legacy

items include a sword with energy-related abilities

that depend on the type of gem set in its pommel,

or a crossbow with the bane special ability against

creatures defined by the material of its bolts. Each

variable component might be very specific (such as

a unique gemstone said to possess a link to the lands

of the dead) or broader (such as a polished marble orb

or the talons of a red dragon).

DESIGNING A MUTABLE ITEM

In general, a mutable item is designed just like any

other legacy item, as described in Chapter 4: Founding

Legacies. Add the following entries to the legacy

ability menus in that chapter.

*Legacy Ability Menu B—*Mutable Legacy: Select

any three abilities from Menu A.

*Legacy Ability Menu C—*Mutable Legacy: Select

any two abilities from Menu B.

*Legacy Ability Menu E—*Mutable Legacy: Select

any three abilities from Menu D.

*Legacy Ability Menu F—*Mutable Legacy: Select

any two abilities from Menu E.

*Legacy Ability Menu H—*Mutable Legacy: Select

any three abilities from Menu G.

*Legacy Ability Menu I—*Mutable Legacy: Select any

two abilities from Menu H.

You can’t use a mutable legacy ability choice to select

other mutable legacy abilities. For example, you can’t

use a Menu C choice to select mutable legacy twice

from Menu B. Just like most menu choices, you can’t

select more than one mutable legacy option from any

menu. Thus, you can choose mutable legacy once from

Menu B and once from Menu C, but not twice from

either menu.

A mutable legacy choice can’t be an ability with a

limited number of daily uses.

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

Examples of Designing Mutable

Legacy Items

Example 1: You are designing a legacy longsword

with energy-related abilities that depend on the type of

gem set into its pommel. It also has two suites of divine

magical abilities, each linked to the specific deity

whose holy symbol is tied on a leather thong around

the crossguard. You select three menu A abilities as a

menu B mutable legacy choice—linking them to the

pommel gem—and two Menu E abilities as a Menu

F mutable legacy choice, linking them to the holy

symbol. Thus, depending on the components attached

to the sword, it displays any of six different combinations

of menu A and menu E legacy abilities.

Example 2: You are designing a legacy staff with

three different sets of related legacy powers, and each

set is affiliated with a particular component: the stone

set into the tip of the staff. You select mutable legacies

from Menus B, E, and H, then assign one ability

from each trio of lower-level abilities to each of three

different stones (say, obsidian, marble, and granite).

Depending on the affixed stone, the staff will have

one of three different sets of abilities, each progressing

all the way to 20th level.

Variable Components

Once you have chosen the item’s mutable legacy abilities,

decide what variable components will actually

unlock them, as well as which ability is linked to each

component. Depending on the item, variable components

can be nearly anything: a sword’s blade, the

gemstone set in a ring, a staff’s capstone, a decorative

feather hung from a club, or one of countless other

options. Let your creativity run wild—the only rule

is that components must be either general or specific.

General components are a broad category of items

or substances, any of which will suffice as the item’s

variable component. Specific components are just

that—specific or even unique items (such as a crystal

from the hoard of the ancient red dragon Durtaxsteingakila).

Mere limitations on appropriate components

are not sufficient to make them specific.

In the above example of the longsword, you have

already decided it will have two variable components:

the pommel gem and the holy symbol tied to the

guard. You’ve also decided to link the set of three

Menu A legacy abilities to the pommel gem and the

set of two Menu E legacy abilities to the holy symbol.

The unique variability of the sword is the focus, and

you don’t want the PCs to get derailed by side quests to

find some legendary component, such as the Diamond

of Enth-Kai, so you decide to make both components

general. However, you specify types of gems that relate

to a given Menu A ability and energy type: rubies for

fire, sapphires for cold, and diamonds for electricity.

You likewise limit the holy symbol options to two

particular deities: Heironeous, god of valor, and St.

Cuthbert, god of retribution.

Finishing Touches

Although the great advantage of mutable legacy items

is their flexibility, their ability suites should share a

theme or otherwise relate to one another. It’s more

interesting to wield a sword with three different

energy-related effects, or a variety of restorative abilities,

or powers relating to the same faith or pantheon,

than one that alternately heals, blasts with fire, or

summons a creature. Possible themes include energy

types, alignments, the planes, monster or animal

abilities, a deity or pantheon’s portfolio or domains,

ancestral wisdom, and schools of magic. Of course,

you are free to design mutable legacy items with no

unifying theme at all, but doing so makes them much

less special and weakens their symbolic value.

USING VARIABLE COMPONENTS

The rules for actually using variable components

in a mutable legacy item are simpler than those for

designing such an item. As a player character, you

simply need to discover and obtain the appropriate

component, affix it to the legacy item, and perform a

brief ritual to activate the item’s new abilities.

Discovering Variable Components

Some mutable items have very obvious variable components,

with few or no restrictions (*Skull Lash,* for

example, accepts any skull of the appropriate creature

types). Other mutable items, however, have variable

components that are more esoteric, or for which fewer

items will serve. Returning to the above example, the

mutable legacy longsword accepts only three types of

pommel gems and two types of holy symbols. If you

were to attach another kind of gem, such as amethyst,

to the sword’s pommel, the weapon would gain no

new legacy abilities.

Discovering each of a mutable item’s eligible

components requires a DC 15 Knowledge (history)

check if general, a DC 20 check if specific, and a DC

25 check if unique. For every 5 points by which you

beat the check DC, you discover one extra variable

component. For example, if you are seeking suitable

components for the pommel gem of the example

208

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

longsword above and get a result of 27 on your

Knowledge (history) check, you would learn two

of the three types of gems that unlock the sword’s

various energy-related abilities.

Affixing a Component

Depending upon the nature of the variable component

and the legacy item, affixing a component might be as

simple as tying it to the item with a leather thong or

as complex as cutting a gem to fit a socket and setting

it with jeweler’s tools. Unless the DM decides otherwise,

affixing or switching out a legacy item’s variable

component, including the brief ritual involved, is a fullround

action that draws attacks of opportunities.

DUAL LEGACY ITEMS

Dual legacy items have divergent or even opposing

sets of abilities, each unlocked by a different series of

legacy rituals. Unlike mutable items, the abilities are

fixed for a given wielder and cannot be changed once

the ritual is complete. An example of a dual legacy item

is the greatsword *Merikel* (see page 117), the weapon

of a fallen angel, which retains some of its original

holiness but can also be warped toward evil. It could

become a powerful tool for good in the hands of a good

wielder, but wielded by an evil creature, it manifests

dread, unholy powers. A dual legacy item can pose a

tremendous threat in the hands of an enemy, but it can

make a great reward for a PC who finally claims it.

DESIGNING A

DUAL LEGACY ITEM

In general, a dual legacy item is designed just like

any other legacy item, as described in Chapter 4:

Founding Legacies. However, the process of assigning

abilities and designing legacy rituals differs as

described below.

Selecting Legacy Abilities

Whenever you select a legacy ability from a menu, you

can choose another from the same menu. Do this for

as many abilities as you wish. Each time, designate one

as the primary ability and the other as the secondary

ability. *Merikel,* for example, has good-aligned, positive,

helpful primary abilities and evil-aligned, negative,

spiteful secondary abilities. Not every legacy ability

needs an alternative; some might be shared by opposing

themes, such as *Merikel*’s divine countenance ability

(which grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma

regardless of which path its wielder chooses).

Depending on the theme of the item, sets of abilities

might be diametric opposites or only tangentially

connected. For example, a mace possessed by an

evangelical spirit might have one set of weapon special

abilities with no religious affiliation, such as flaming

burst or defending, and an alternative set of divine

magic-inspired powers such as the holy weapon ability

or the ability to use *cure light wounds.*

Dual Legacy Rituals

Dual legacy items, such as *Merikel*, require two legacy

ritual paths, one for each set of abilities. Once you have

started down either path by performing its least legacy

ritual, you are “locked in” to that path. That ritual path

dictates the legacy abilities you unlock. For instance, if

you wield *Merikel* and perform the Pious Redemption

ritual, you can use the least abilities associated with

that path (*touch of grace* and *bless*).

If you later choose to follow the item’s alternative

path, you must perform the next ritual to complete

that path’s task instead. All of the item’s legacy abilities,

even those previously unlocked, change to reflect the

new path. For example, if you are wielding *Merikel*,

and have already unlocked its least abilities with the

Pious Redemption ritual, you must perform the Path

of Despair ritual and unlock its lesser abilities to follow

the path of evil. Once the ritual is complete, the touch

of grace and *bless* abilities would be replaced by their

“evil” counterparts, touch of fury and *bane.*

When designing a dual legacy item, you must also

design two sets of rituals to represent the differing

paths. Each of a corresponding pair of rituals requires

the same Knowledge (history) check DC. Each should

have the same costs, both personal and gp, but could

require different tasks. You can even encourage a

potential wielder to prefer one path to the other by

making its tasks easier to complete. For example, a

wielder of *Merikel* following the path of good need

only travel to the high church of Heironeous to bathe

the sword in blessed water, while the evil path requires

dipping it into the water of the deadly River Styx.

SHARING A LEGACY

A common element in fantasy films and literature

is that of the trusted companion who takes up the

weapon of the valiant hero who falls in combat. One

famous example is when Sam wields *Sting* after Frodo

is taken by Shelob in *The Two Towers.* You can replicate

such an event with items of legacy. Under the standard

rules presented in this book, if Sir Aerin the Mighty

209

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

passes the powerful blade *Durindana* (see page 75) to

his companion Enian the bard, that fabled weapon

becomes nothing more than a *+1 longsword* in Enian’s

hands—not terribly impressive or heroic. This variant

rule provides a method for a willing character to

temporarily bestow upon an ally the ability to wield a

legacy weapon for which that ally has not qualifi ed.

Sharing a legacy item requires the voluntary and

informed consent of both wielder and recipient. This

consent need not be vocalized or even deliberate; it

can be granted tacitly even when the wielder is unconscious

or otherwise incapacitated. However, it cannot

be coerced in any way, magically or otherwise. Only

the intended recipient can benefi t (you can’t disguise

yourself as the wielder’s ally to trick her into lending

you the item).

If you are the intended recipient of a legacy item,

you are treated as having the same level as the owner

and as having completed the same legacy rituals,

regardless of your own level. For example, if you are

a 5th-level character who takes up the legacy blade of

an 18th-level wielder who had completed the greater

legacy ritual, you can use all the item’s legacy abilities

available up to and including 18th level (if any).

This benefi t comes with a heavy cost, though: You

immediately gain one negative level for each legacy

ritual completed by the original wielder. Thus, if the

original wielder has completed only the least legacy

ritual (unlocking the least abilities of the item), you

gain one negative level, but if the owner has completed

all three rituals and unlocked the greater abilities, you

gain three negative levels. These negative levels remain

as long as you continue to wield, wear, or carry the item,

but never result in actual level loss. However, the negative

levels can never be removed in any way (including

*restoration* spells) while you possess the item. If you

cannot gain negative levels (for example, because you

are a construct or undead creature), you cannot be the

recipient of another character’s legacy item.

If the total negative levels equal or exceed your Hit

Dice, you are not killed but instead gain the maximum

number of negative levels you can without dying.

For each negative level so gained, you have access to

the abilities granted by completing one of the legacy

*The path taken by its wielder determines the nature of a dual legacy item*

210

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

rituals, beginning with the lowest. For example, if

you are 3rd level and receive a legacy item from an

owner who has completed the greater legacy ritual,

you would gain only two negative levels (instead of

three) and would be able to use only the item’s least

and lesser abilities (but not the greater abilities).

You might wield the legacy item for as long as the

original owner allows. If the owner dies after consenting

to transfer the item, you can continue to use

all its available legacy abilities for a limited period of

time after death. The length of time depends on the

highest legacy ritual completed: 1 hour for the greater

legacy ritual, 10 minutes for the lesser, and 1 minute

for the least.

Sharing a legacy item, even with a trusted

ally, taints the bond between the item and its

true owner. To use the item’s legacy abilities

again, the original wielder must

complete a minor ceremony

requiring 1 hour of uninterrupted

meditation

in the presence of the

item. After this is completed,

the item returns to

its full normal functionality

for that wielder.

MONSTERS

OF LEGACY

Just as some items take on legacy

abilities when tempered in the

fire of extreme experience, certain

creatures sometimes undergo experiences

so extreme that their very

bodies can become imbued with

legacy abilities.

IRONHEART,

Ironheart was a fairly typical

azer cleric, worshiping Thermekhûl

(the dwarven patron of fire

and battle; see *Races of Stone,* page

19) and guiding his kin through their

duties in life. When his community was

threatened by invading yugoloths from

the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, he

fought at the forefront.

A horrid mezzoloth ambushed

Ironheart, pouncing from invisibility,

then catching up the cleric

in its claws to tear him up and ultimately drop him from

a great height. The azer didn’t give up easily, though;

although he had dropped his warhammer, he was able

to unsheathe a light pick, with which he tore at the

fiend’s claws and wings. Striking a mortal blow, Ironheart

fell to the flaming ground in the clutches of the

yugoloth. He perished in the fall, and the high priest

of his order raised him from the dead in recognition

of his valor. When Ironheart awoke, he found that the

entwined bodies of himself and his foe had partially

fused in the elemental flames. He was different,

infused with both fiendish qualities—and something

else. He continues to serve his people, but he struggles

constantly against the urges of his evil side.

Ironheart has an olfactory omen (sulfurous fumes)

and one Menu A choice (lesser metamagic).

Combat

Ironheart uses his natural heat, his clerical magic, and

his newfound abilities to punish foes in combat.

Heat (Ex): Ironheart generates so much heat that

his mere touch deals an extra 1 point of fire damage.

His metallic weapons also conduct this heat.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, Ironheart can

make a normal melee attack to deal 5 extra points of

damage against a good foe.

Spells: Ironheart casts spells as a 3rd-level cleric.

D: Domain spell: Domains: Fire (turn water creatures

or rebuke fire creatures 3/day), War (proficiency

and weapon focus with favored weapon).

Enlarge Spell (Su): Ironheart can cast up to three

spells per day of up to 3rd level that are empowered

as though using the Empower Spell metamagic feat.

Using this ability does not change the spell slot of

the altered spell.

Cure Moderate Wounds (Sp): Three times per

day, Ironheart can use cure moderate wounds as

the spell by touching the item to the creature to be

healed (including himself) and speaking a command

word. This ability can instead deal damage to undead

creatures. The save DC is 13, or 12 + your Charisma

modifier, whichever is higher.

Omen: A reek of brimstone swirls around Ironheart.

This counts as a strong smell for the purpose of scent.

Possessions: Masterwork scale mail, masterwork

\*New class and feat detailed in *Complete Arcane.*

When Livonia Fire-Eyes first encountered the furious

hound archon, she didn’t understand that she was the

object of its wrath. She’d done nothing to offend the

powers of Celestia—but that didn’t matter to the fanatical

creature, who was sworn to destroy all “evil-tainted”

beings. With a touch of fiendish heritage, Livonia qualified

as legitimate prey. The archon howled a challenge

and came at her with its greatsword. Livonia defended

herself as best she could, but she was no match for her

muscular opponent. Finally, in a last desperate move,

she threw up a *wind wall* between herself and her

attacker, which tore the sword from its grasp and

left it off guard for a precious few seconds. She

thrust with her rapier and scored a mortal blow.

Something awoke in her then, a sense both of

triumph at her victory and of rage at the injustice

of the archon’s attack. Fiend-tainted, was she? Well,

then she would embrace that heritage. She had

proven herself once—let the celestials come. Now

she is Dark tongue, enemy of heaven.

Livonia has an auditory omen (song of doom), one

Menu A choice (creature compass) and one Menu B

choice (Charisma enhancement +2).

Combat

Livonia combines aggressive spellcasting

with her innate abilities.

Darkness (Sp): Livonia can use

*darkness* as the spell once

per day (caster level 7th).

Doom of Heaven (Su):

Livonia can detect any

good outsider within 60 feet,

but she must concentrate (a standard

action) to do so. She ignores any damage reduction

of good outsiders when attacking them.

Warmage Edge (Su): Whenever Livonia casts a

spell that deals hit point damage, she deals an extra

3 points of damage. This bonus damage applies only

once per casting of a given spell.

Spells: Livonia casts spells as an 8th-level warmage.

by means of a fiendish trap.

Because the Band of Lavender had such a long and

illustrious history, and because Shuluth devised such a

cunning and lethal trap, the illithid became a monster

of legacy. Now, Shuluth thrills to the continued beat of

its own heart, realizing that its victory was a spectacular

event that might eventually become a legend.

Combat

Shuluth enhances the normal combat tactics of an

illithid with its improved defensive abilities.

Extract (Ex): If Shuluth begins its turn with all

four tentacles attached and makes a successful grapple

check, it automatically extracts the opponent’s brain,

instantly killing that creature.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Shuluth

must hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its

tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and attaches the tentacle to the opponent’s head.

Shuluth can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only

if it can somehow reach the foe’s head.

If Shuluth begins its turn with at least one tentacle

attached, it can try to attach its remaining tentacles

with a single grapple check. The opponent can escape

with a single successful grapple check or an Escape

Artist check, but Shuluth gets a +2 circumstance

bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the

beginning of the opponent’s turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): 60-ft. cone, stun 3d4 rounds,

Will DC 17 negates. This ability is the equivalent of

a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At will—*charm monster* (DC 17),

*detect thoughts* (DC 15), *levitate, plane shift, suggestion*

(DC 16). Caster level 8th.

Deflection: Shuluth enjoys an inherent +1 deflection

bonus to its AC.

Mirror Image (Sp): Once per day by uttering a vile

command word, Shuluth can use *mirror image* as the

spell. Caster level 5th.

Omen: All creatures within 15 feet of Shuluth

that have a language “hear” dire mental whispers

forecasting their sudden and painful demise. Shuluth

can suppress or emit this telepathic aura as a

free action.

See Invisibility (Sp): Once per day by uttering a

vile command word, Shuluth can use *see invisibility*

as the spell. Caster level 5th.

Telepathy (Su): Shuluth can communicate telepathically

with any other creature within 100 feet

that has a language.

Vhuuksssh was summoned by a *planar ally* spell

to perform a service for an elemental temple. But

when the water elemental had fulfilled its pact

and the time came to release it from service, the

cleric who had summoned Vhuuksssh refused to

uphold the terms of the bargain. By claiming the

elemental had not met the letter of the agreement,

he denied it return to its home plane. With the fury

of a storm-tossed sea, Vhuuksssh lashed out at its

enslaver. Battered by the cleric’s elemental magic,

it was nearly destroyed, but finally the elemental

caught up the traitor in its vortex and dashed his

head against the temple walls. Now truly free,

Vhuuksssh could have returned to the Elemental

Plane of Water—but it felt different, as though stirred

by a fresh current.

Vhuuksssh had escaped a magical pact by doing

what no other planar ally had dared: turning on its

summoner. It absorbed some of the elemental power

of its tormentor and now explores the new abilities

that have awakened within it.

Vhuuksssh has selected a visible omen (fl ickering

fl ames), one Menu A choice (+1 defl ection), one Menu

B choice (*lightning bolt*), one Menu C choice (*acid*

*arrow*), and one Menu E choice (*fi reball*).

Combat

Vhuuksssh combines the offensive capabilities of a

water elemental with other energy-based powers.

Drench (Ex): Vhuuksssh’s touch puts out torches,

campfi res, exposed lanterns, and other open fl ames

of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or

smaller. It can dispel magical fi re it touches as *dispel*

*magic* (CL 12th).

Spell-Like Abilities: At will—*Melf’s acid arrow*

(+10 ranged touch; CL 10th); 3/day—*fi reball* (DC 14;

CL 11th); 1/day—*lightning bolt* (DC 14; CL 11th).

Vortex (Su): Vhuuksssh can transform itself into a

whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater,

and remain in that form for up to 6 rounds. In

vortex form, it can move through the water or along

the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide

at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 40

*Vhuuksssh struck back against a faithless summoner*

*and has found new elemental power*

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

feet tall. Vhuuksssh controls the exact height, but it

must be at least 10 feet.

Vhuuksssh’s movement while in vortex form

does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it

enters the space another creature occupies. Another

creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches

or enters the vortex, or if Vhuuksssh moves into or

through the creature’s space. Medium and smaller

creatures might take damage when caught in the

vortex and might be swept up by it. An affected

creature must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save when

it comes into contact with the vortex or take 2d6

points of damage. It must also succeed on a second

DC 19 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held

suspended in the powerful currents, automatically

taking 2d6 points of damage each round. An affected

creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape

the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can

leave if the save is successful.

Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except

to go where Vhuuksssh carries them or to escape the

vortex. Creatures caught in the vortex can otherwise

act normally, but must make a Concentration check

(DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught

in the vortex take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2

penalty on attack rolls. Vhuuksssh can have only as

many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time

as will fit inside its volume. Vhuuksssh can eject any

carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them

wherever the vortex happens to be.

If the vortex’s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling

cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on Vhuuksssh

and has a diameter equal to half the vortex’s height.

The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision,

beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment,

while those farther away have total concealment. Those

caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check

(DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

While in vortex form, Vhuuksssh cannot make slam

attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Water Mastery (Ex): Vhuuksssh gains a +1 bonus

on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent

are touching water. If the opponent or Vhuuksssh is

touching the ground, Vhuuksssh takes a –4 penalty

on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not

included in the statistics block.)

Vhuuksssh can easily overturn craft up to 60 feet

long, stop larger vessels (up to 120 feet long), and slow

large ships (up to 240 feet long) to half speed.

Deflection: Vhuuksssh enjoys an inherent +1

deflection bonus to its AC.

Omen: Vhuuksssh flickers with fiery glints that

seem to run across its surface.

Speed Enhancement (Su): Vhuuksssh’s land speed

has increased by 5 feet.

Skills: Vhuuksssh has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard.

It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even

if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

CREATING A

MONSTER OF LEGACY

“Monster of legacy” is an acquired template that can

be added to any aberration, dragon, elemental, giant,

magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, outsider, or

undead (hereafter referred to as the base creature).

The base creature must also have the following:

• Intelligence 3 or more;

• 5 or more HD;

• At least one supernatural or spell-like ability.

In addition, the monster must experience the same

sort of dramatic event that paves the way for creating

an item of legacy.

Monsters of legacy do not perform legacy rituals or

pay for materials, nor do they incur any personal costs

for their legacy abilities. No legacy feat (such as Least

Legacy) is required to unlock their legacy abilities.

A monster of legacy uses all the base creature’s

statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Special Attacks/Special Qualities: A monster of

legacy retains all the special attacks and special qualities

of the base creature. It also gains legacy abilities

as described here.

To assign abilities, use the legacy ability menus in

Chapter 4: Founding Legacies. Treat the monster as both

an item of legacy and its wielder. It selects a number of

ability choices determined by its total Hit Dice, as well

as a choice from the omen menu. Use the following

table to determine which menus it can choose from.

**5–10 HD 11–16 HD 17+ HD**

Menu A Menu D Menu G

Menu B Menu E Menu H

Menu C Menu F Menu I

In one of the examples given above, Shuluth the

illithid is an 8 Hit Die creature. Thus, it could choose

three abilities from Menu A, or one from Menu A and

one from Menu B, or a single ability from Menu C. It

doesn’t have enough Hit Dice to make any choices from

higher menus. It selected a mental omen (the threatening

216

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

mental whispers) and three Menu A choices: *deflection,*

*mirror image,* and *see invisibility.*

Of course, you should make whatever substitutions

and modifications are necessary to indicate that an

ability derives from the monster itself and not from a

separate item. For example, instead of holding an item

over its head to use *fly* (a Menu C ability), the monster

might raise its arms, make flapping motions, or use

some other equivalent gesture to activate the ability.

Challenge Rating: Adjust the creature’s Challenge

Rating based on the number of legacy abilities to

which it has access. These increases are not cumulative

with each other.

**Legacy Abilities Awakened CR Increase**

Two or more least +1

Two or more lesser +2

Two or more greater +3

Level Adjustment: Legacy monsters are never appropriate

as player characters or cohorts. The base creature

loses any level adjustment it previously had.

STANDARD MAGIC ITEMS

AS ITEMS OF LEGACY

The *holy avenger*. The *staff of power*. These powerful

magic items and others have been iconic parts of the

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game for many years, and their

appearance in a campaign should be a major event.

Their sheer power, however, entails the risk of severely

unbalancing the campaign if they are introduced at

anything less than high levels.

As the DM, though, you might sometimes want to

include such potent items earlier, as a plot element or

a piece of a character’s background. Perhaps the party’s

paladin inherited her father’s sword when she set off on

her adventuring career, or your storyline revolves around

the party’s possession of a dangerous item whose powers

they neither fully comprehend nor have the ability to use.

Discovering the item’s true potential can be the basis

for exciting adventures. *The Lord of the Rings,* to use the

obvious example, would not have been nearly as interesting

a story if Frodo could call upon the full powers of

the *One Ring* from the moment he put it on.

One solution to this dilemma is to convert the item

into a legacy item, allowing its wielder to gain access

to its most powerful abilities over time.

CONVERTING STANDARD

MAGIC ITEMS TO LEGACY ITEMS

Using the standard item’s abilities as a guideline, it should

be fairly simple to map out a progression for legacy

abilities. The item’s base price determines what legacy

abilities the item has: If its price is 18,000 gp or less,

it has least abilities only; between 18,000 gp and 72,000

gp, it has least and lesser abilities; and between 72,000 gp

and 200,000 gp, it has least, lesser, and greater abilities.

If the standard item’s cost is more than 200,000 gp, use

the rules for epic legacy items starting on page 218.

Some items might not fit the progression exactly.

For example, an item worth 20,000 gp is too powerful

to tie all of its abilities to a least legacy, but its price is

just barely high enough to qualify it for a lesser legacy.

In such cases, you must decide whether to adhere

strictly to the item’s original abilities, or to “pad them

out” with one or more extra related abilities. Other

items, though, just aren’t suitable for such conversions;

examples are those with only one, albeit extremely

costly, ability (such as a *greater*

*Quicken metamagic rod*) or

single-use items.

Even if a legacy item starts

out as a standard magic item,

you should take the time to

come up with a unique history

and legacy rituals for it. Doing

this not only adds verisimilitude

to your campaign, but

also avoids conveying the

impression that somewhere

there is a “legacy item factory”

churning out copy after

copy of *legacy vorpal swords*

or *legacy rings of elemental*

*command*. Don’t just call

that sword a *legacy holy*

*avenger*—it sounds

much more impressive

to PCs who learn

of it as *Brightbiter,* the

holy blade of the pious knight

Sir Treven of Carcia.

CONVERSIONS

Two standard magic items—the *holy avenger*

sword and the *staff of power*—are given abbreviated

legacy item write-ups below, as

examples to get you started. These

abbreviated write-ups do not include

histories, legacy rituals, or adventure

seeds, and unless otherwise specifically

stated, assume that any ability listed on the item

described in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*.

LEGACY HOLY AVENGER

The *legacy holy avenger* is a dedicated to the powers of

goodness and order. It appears to be a typical *+1 cold*

*iron longsword,* but in the hands of a bonded wielder,

the blade acts as a channel for her faith and piety. As

she advances in level, the blade confers on her the

power to shatter wicked enchantments and scourge

her foes with holy energy.

Spell Resistance (Su):

At 15th level, you gain spell resistance

equal to 5 + your paladin level.

Break Enchantment (Sp): On

reaching 16th level, you can use *break*

*enchantment* as the spell once per day to

remove harmful enchantments, transmutations,

or curses from a single creature. You must

touch the sword to the target to create this effect (a

standard action). Caster level 10th.

Heal Self (Sp): At 18th level, once per day as a standard

action, you can use *heal* on yourself when holding,

wearing, or wielding the sword. Caster level 15th.

LEGACY STAFF OF POWER

The *legacy staff of power* begins as a standard magic

quarterstaff, but as its wielder increases his knowledge

of the arcane mysteries, tremendous vistas of magic

open up to him, unlocking the staff’s true power.

Unlike a typical magic staff, the *legacy staff of power*

EPIC LEGACIES

None of the legacy items described in Chapter 3

describe legacy abilities for a wielder beyond 20th

level, the normal maximum. If your campaign includes

epic-level characters—those who have attained 21st

level or higher, as described on page 206 of the *Dungeon*

*Master’s Guide*—you have two options should you wish

to allow items that manifest additional legacy abilities

at epic levels.

1. Design epic legacy rituals and assign epic

legacy abilities according to the following rules, as

appropriate for the item. The wielder must learn the

additional history of the legacy item and perform

the epic rituals to unlock its epic abilities.

CHAPTER 5

OPTIONAL

RULES

2. Allow the wielder’s player to design epic legacy

ritual(s) and choose epic legacy abilities for the item,

much like founding a new legacy (see Chapter 4:

Founding Legacies). In this case, the wielder is imbuing

the item with new abilities that were not within

its reach before.

Regardless of which option you choose, you can rule

that an epic founding event (see below) is also required.

In both methods, each new epic legacy ability

requires an epic-level wielder to perform a new epic

legacy ritual and select the Epic Legacy feat for that

item. This is an important difference from the nonepic

legacy rituals: The epic legacy ritual does *not* grant

Epic Legacy as a bonus feat.

EPIC LEGACY RITUALS

Unlocking the epic legacy abilities of an item works

much the same as unlocking nonepic legacy abilities.

You must make a Knowledge (history) check to learn

the particulars of the epic legacy ritual; the check DC

is equal to twice the character level needed to gain the

ability (DC 42 at 21st level, DC 48 at 24th level, and

so forth). See the sample epic legacy weapon on page

221 for an example of an epic legacy ritual.

You must pay a cost for the raw materials of the ritual:

150,000 gp for a Menu Y legacy ability or 500,000 gp

for a Menu Z legacy ability. (See the epic legacy ability

menus below.)

Once you have learned and completed the ritual,

you might select Epic Legacy at the next opportunity

to take an epic feat. (The ritual does not grant it as a

bonus feat.)

Unlike nonepic legacy rituals, each new epic legacy

ability requires you to perform a new legacy ritual. You

can do this no more often than once per three levels, as

shown in Table 5–3: Designing an Epic Legacy Item.

Epic Founding Events and Rituals

Even for items with an existing legacy, it might be

appropriate to require an additional founding event

that propels the item into the realm of epic power.

Founding events are described in detail in Chapter

4: Founding Legacies. An epic founding event follows

the same guidelines but must be even more

amazing. The DM has the ultimate say in whether a

founding event is sufficiently momentous to unlock

epic legacy abilities.

Like its nonepic equivalents, an epic founding

ritual is specific and appropriate to a particular item

of legacy, and encapsulates the founding event in a

ritualized manner.

ASSIGNING EPIC LEGACY

ABILITIES AND COSTS

Epic legacy items do not bestow new abilities at the same

rate they did at lower character levels. If they did, such

items would quickly exhaust the available epic legacy

options, making all of them appear very similar.

Instead, an epic legacy item’s wielder can unlock a

new epic legacy ability at 21st level, and every three

levels thereafter (performing the required ritual and

selecting the Epic Legacy feat each time). Even though

Table 5–3: Designing an Epic Legacy Item details this

progression for only levels 21 through 30, it continues

at the same rate infinitely.

This chapter presents two epic legacy ability menus,

which provide examples of the power level of such

abilities. These menus can’t begin to cover all the

fantastic possibilities available to an epic legacy item.

Feel free to create additional abilities as you see fit,

using the costs of the sample abilities in this chapter

as a guide: Menu Y abilities have an average value of

300,000 gp, while Menu Z abilities have an average

value of 1,000,000 gp.

Epic legacy items have standardized personal costs, as

shown on the following table. At every level that does

not allow a new legacy ability (and associated ritual),

the wielder permanently loses 3 hp. This applies only

if the wielder has unlocked that “tier” of legacy abilities

by undergoing the requisite ritual and selecting the

Epic Legacy feat. For example, if you attain 25th level

but have unlocked only one epic legacy ability, you do

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

EPIC LEGACY \[EPIC, LEGACY]

You unlock an epic ability of a specific item of legacy.

**Prerequisites:** Character level 21st, Least Legacy, Lesser

Legacy, Greater Legacy, design (or learn) and perform the

epic ritual associated with the chosen item.

**Benefit:** Choose one legacy item. You can make use of

its epic legacy ability available to your character level.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time

you take the feat, you must perform the associated epic

ritual. The ritual can be completed up to 30 days before

or after you choose the feat.

Unlike nonepic legacy feats, Epic Legacy is not granted

as a bonus feat on completion of an epic legacy ritual. It

must be selected like any other feat.

EPIC LEGACY ABILITY MENUS

The menus of epic legacy abilities presented below

provide examples of suitable abilities for epic legacy

items. Follow the instructions presented earlier in

this chapter to assign abilities.

Unless noted otherwise, you can select a specific

menu choice only once.

Epic Legacy Ability Menu Y

The raw materials cost for a Menu Y legacy ritual is

150,000 gp.

Menu Y abilities have a caster level of 25th.

Armor or Shield Enhancement, Epic (Su): The

enhancement bonus of a suit of armor or a shield

increases to +6. This ability can be placed only on a

suit of armor or a shield.

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, your armor or shield’s effective enhancement

bonus to AC increases by 1. You cannot increase

the armor or shield’s effective enhancement bonus

beyond +20 (but see Epic Armor or Shield Enhancement

in Menu Z).

Constant Companion, Epic (Su): This ability

works the same as greater constant companion (see

page 203), except that the creature you summon

comes from the 7th-level list of the summoning

spell you use.

Energy Immunity (Su): The item grants you immunity

to one type of energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire,

or sonic. Choose the specific type of energy when

assigning this ability to the item.

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, it applies to a different type of energy.

Resistance, Epic (Su): The item grants you a +6

you do so, another level of spells is doubled (6th-level

the second time, 7th-level the third time, and so on),

up to a maximum of 9th-level spells.

Epic Legacy Ability Menu Z

Unlike nonepic ability menus, a choice from this

500,000 gp.

Menu Z abilities have a caster level of 30th.

EXAMPLE EPIC LEGACY WEAPON:

BLOODCRIER’S HAMMER

*Bloodcrier’s Hammer* is an enormous warhammer

forged entirely from black iron. A grinning skull is

etched into the surface of the hammer’s head.

The nonepic legacy abilities of *Bloodcrier’s Hammer*,

and the rituals necessary to unlock those abilities,

are described starting on page 29. The following epic

history, ritual, and abilities continue the weapon’s

legend.

History

The dwarves of Rivencave were under attack by a

great black wyrm that threatened to exterminate

them all. In this time of greatest need, they called

back from the dead their ancient folk-hero, Bhazad

Khrar, to aid his descendants one more time. As the

legends promised, Bhazad appeared with his legendary

weapon, *Bloodcrier’s Hammer,* in hand. In a battle

lasting three full days that ranged over miles of Underdark

caves and tunnels, he finally proved victorious

over the black dragon, burying it forever in a tomb of

solid stone. Bhazad faded away, this time forever. His

warhammer disappeared as well, maybe for all time

(though some whisper it is entombed along with the

wyrm). (DC 42; Trial of the Wyrm)

Legacy Rituals

Four rituals are required to unlock all the epic legacy abilities

of *Bloodcrier’s Hammer*. The first is detailed here.

Trial of the Wyrm: You must defeat a great wyrm

black dragon in personal combat. *Cost:* 150,000 gp.

After completing this ritual, you must choose the

Epic Legacy (*Bloodcrier’s Hammer*) feat.

If you wish to unlock further epic legacy abilities

for *Bloodcrier’s Hammer,* you must design or discover

additional epic legacy rituals. In the epic progression

shown below, the next two epic legacy rituals cost

150,000 gp in raw materials, while the fourth costs

500,000 gp.

Weapon Features

All the following are epic legacy item features of

*Bloodcrier’s Hammer*.

Immunity to Acid (Su): Beginning at 21st level,

*Bloodcrier’s Hammer* grants you immunity to acid.

Obsidian Ally (Su): At 24th level, while you are

wielding *Bloodcrier’s Hammer*, you can use a swift

action to summon a greater earth elemental (*as summon*

*nature’s ally VII*) named Obsidian.

Obsidian attacks your foes and serves you to the

best of its ability. If you can communicate with the

elemental, you can direct it not to attack, to attack

particular enemies, or to perform other actions. It

remains with you unless dismissed (a standard action)

or killed. If Obsidian is slain, it can be summoned

again after 24 hours, fully healed.

Earthquake (Sp): Beginning at 27th level, three

times per day you can strike the earth with *Bloodcrier’s*

*Hammer* and speak a command word to create a widened

*earthquake* effect as the spell. Caster level 25th.
