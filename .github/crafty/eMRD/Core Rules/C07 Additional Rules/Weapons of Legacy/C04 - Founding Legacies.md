# C04 - Founding Legacies
## Overview
The slithering, obscene runes carved into the

metal of the pitted blade were not the icons

of good and light, Aedwar was sure.

But the tombstone golems roused as

age-old pacts were triggered, and guardian

demons swarmed around him, defending the final

resting place of their ancient master.

Desperate, Aedwar snatched up the blade. It seared

his hand with cold, shooting tendrils of weakness

through his limbs. It was a thing of evil—but it was

the only weapon at hand. It was this awful sword or

nothing. Steeling himself against the terrible pain,

he tightened his grip on the blade and turned to face

the fiendish horde.

Later, with the crumpled, exsanguinated forms of

demons scattered about his feet, Aedwar made to cast

away the sword, but he paused . . .

The pain was less. Oh, it was still there, but it wasn’t

the soul-wrenching agony of his first contact.

Aedwar wondered at the change, but even more

so at his near miraculous victory over the swarming

demons. The pain had lessened after the battle’s conclusion,

as if the blade had reached an accommodation

with its wielder—somehow empowered or changed

by the momentous conflict—who, all alone in a

forgotten tomb, beat back a demonic swell.

Aedwar girded the sword to his belt.

So was the weapon of legacy Exordius founded.

FOUNDING

LEGACY ITEMS

Tales of heroes are told far and wide because of

mighty exploits. Heroes accomplish great tasks,

set to right monumental wrongs, and defeat

insuperable odds, sometimes at great cost. The

item or weapon that a hero uses to accomplish

this goal makes the difference between success

and failure.

With the DM’s approval, a player might use

a momentous event as the necessary catalyst

to begin investing her character’s signature

item with legacy abilities. She controls the

process of imbuing the item with particular

abilities as she advances in experience, within

the larger context of the campaign’s plots and

adventures.

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

THE DECISION

As a player character, you must decide whether to

invest the necessary energy and resources in

founding an item of legacy. Sometimes the

decision is thrust upon you by events of

the campaign: You are the hero of a story,

which becomes the legend of a later age.

Implements of that hero become storied

relics—and possibly legacy items.

Only after a founding event (see

below) occurs must you make

the decision.

THE FOUNDING

EVENT

Every so often, a dramatic

event shakes a

campaign. Perhaps a party defeats

a mind-killing illithid against all

odds—only the rogue’s last, desperate

dagger thrust ensures survival.

On the other hand, the party

might be wiped out. If later

adventurers then recover

the dead characters’ gear

and learn the details of

the massacre, they can

realize one of the

items holds the seed

of legacy.

Up to three different

founding events

might occur during

the empowerment

of a legacy item,

but the first one establishes

the item’s

identity. Meticulously detail

all the circumstances

of this event, which are

uncovered by research when a new

wielder takes it up. Additional founding events allow

it to gain even more abilities. The candidate item

doesn’t even have to be magic

(see The Candidate Item,

below).

What makes a founding

event? Below are

some suggestions. In all

cases, the DM makes the final determination

of the event’s suitability.

Right Time and

Right Place

The item is responsible for

resolving a “clutch” situation,

one that means

the difference between

success and

disaster. A ring of feather

falling might save a character from a

tumble into boiling lava, or gauntlets of

ogre power provide the extra oomph to

break down a door just in time to save

a comrade from a terrible fate.

Destiny Calls

The item slays an important figure,

whether by design or by a terrible

twist of fate. For example, a fighter’s

axe cleaves the skull of an orc assassin

who has slaughtered half

the party, or a holy sword slips

from the grasp of the paladin

and accidentally kills a helpless

friend.

DM deems important enough

a legacy item. In this case, the DM

merely informs the player of each affected character,

who can then choose whether to design an appropriate

founding ritual.

PC Petition

An event occurs that a player feels is important

enough to begin the process of founding a legacy item.

In this case, the player asks the DM for approval to

design an appropriate founding ritual.

THE CANDIDATE ITEM

Founding a legacy item requires a suitable candidate.

Type

The following make suitable candidates for legacy

items: weapons, armor, rings, rods, and staffs. A

candidate item could also be a crown or circlet, a pair

of gloves, or any one of the different kinds of magic

items that can be worn at the same time, as described

on page 214 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Nothing prevents a belt, a set of bracers, a vest, or

a pair of eye lenses from becoming a legacy item;

however, these are far less likely to serve an active role

during a founding event.

Mundane, Masterwork, or Magic?

Mundane items typically do not possess the necessary

“spark” of potential to grow into legacy items. Such

an occurrence is extraordinarily rare. A masterwork

item can attain a legacy, but this is unusual.

In general, only items that are already magic in

some fashion have the required thaumaturgical framework

to found a legacy. For example, an otherwise

unremarkable +1 longsword could grow into a mighty

bane of evil over the course of many long years and

arduous adventures.

Conversely, magic items that carry more than

minor power do not make suitable candidates for

legacy items. Therefore, weapons and armor with a

+2 or higher effective enhancement bonus cannot

become legacy weapons, nor can other magic items

whose market price is above 4,000 gp. Weapons

and armor made of special materials that increase

their market price are still viable candidate items,

as long as their initial enhancement bonus is no

more than +1.

DESIGNING

FOUNDING RITUALS

Once a founding event occurs that involves a suitable

candidate item, you can found a legacy for that item.

This is a complex process with several steps.

The first crucial step in founding a legacy is to

chronicle in detail the history of an item—even if its

history is just beginning. This knowledge will define

the details of a ritual that encapsulates the founding

event in a formal manner, such as a reenactment or

a ceremony that is somehow related to the item’s history.

Each candidate item requires a different ritual,

which must commemorate the event that propelled

the item to potential legacy status. The ritual always

includes the candidate item. Example rituals of the

broadest type are provided in the General Legacy

Ritual Examples sidebar. When creating a founding

legacy, you can choose from those listed or come up

with a legacy of your own. The legacy descriptions in

Chapter 3 also offer good examples of suitable rituals.

Your ritual should have a name, preferably one that

reflects the item’s unique history.

An item’s founding rituals, once established, also

make up the rituals that a potential wielder (other

than the founder) must perform to unlock the item’s

legacy abilities.

Once you have designed, performed, and benefited

from the first ritual, which is called a least legacy

ritual (see below), you gain the Least Legacy feat for

your item as a bonus feat. You also begin to imbue

your item with magical abilities that you can unlock

as you advance in level. You must design and perform

lesser and greater legacy rituals if you want the item’s

abilities to continue progressing as you grow in power

and experience. As with the least legacy ritual, these

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: LEGACY ITEM

FOUNDING RESTRICTIONS

Designing the rules for items of legacy is a challenge: On

the one hand, the items must be exciting and unique,

while on the other, they can’t be so powerful that they destroy

game balance. Thus legacy abilities and costs are all

balanced against a character’s expected power and wealth

at a given level. (The relative values of abilities in the

legacy item menus presented in this chapter also follow

this principle.) Taking these factors into account, as well

as the customized ritual and personal costs of each item,

no more than a +1 enhancement bonus (or equivalent

ability) is appropriate for a starting item.

182

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

new rituals must also be tied to the item’s history,

however short it might be.

When you perform the founding least legacy ritual,

you must pay all the gp costs associated with that

ritual (see Setting Costs on page 184). In addition,

you must expend a set amount of experience points,

as described under Least Legacy Founding Ritual (see

below). Lesser and greater legacy founding rituals also

require an expenditure of XP; see the Lesser Legacy

Founding Ritual and Greater Legacy Founding Ritual

sections for details. Those who wield the legacy item

after you do not spend these experience points, and

must only pay the material (gp) costs associated with

each ritual.

Whenever you design a founding ritual, you must

undergo and pay all costs for the ritual yourself before

you or any other wielder can access the legacy abilities

associated with that ritual. The legacy founding

process is ruined if you pass the item to another

wielder without first paying all costs, and you must

start anew.

You gain the benefits of a given legacy ritual only

if you have reached the specified character level, as

set out below.

Legacy Minimum

Ritual Character Level

Least 5th

Lesser 11th

Greater 17th

Least Legacy Founding Ritual

The least legacy ritual, when performed for the first

time, turns the item into an item of legacy. This ritual

establishes the general nature and theme of the item,

influencing all its later legacy abilities, as well as

establishing the abilities available from 5th through

10th level. Designing an appropriate least legacy

ritual requires some forethought as well as personal

adaptation of the item’s specific abilities.

Cost: In addition to the gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page 184), designing and performing

a least legacy founding ritual requires the

expenditure of 500 XP. Upon completing the ritual,

you gain the Least Legacy feat specific to your item

as a bonus feat.

Lesser Legacy Founding Ritual

The lesser legacy ritual, when performed for the first

time, brings a legacy item to the next level of power.

GENERAL LEGACY RITUAL EXAMPLES

Many of these example rituals involve a trial, test, dedication,

or similar commitment. Within one day of completing

the listed activity (whether before or after), you must

expend raw materials as determined by the ritual type

(least, lesser, or greater).

Trial By Enemy: Choose one creature type (such as an elemental,

dragon, aberration, and so on), or a specific foe

(such as an evil half-dragon). You must defeat a chosen

foe with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than your

character level.

Requiem: Enact a memorial service in the location

where the founding event occurred or in a similar location.

The memorial rite recounts, reveals, or recreates the

founding event.

Ordeal: Undergo a challenge that is physically demanding

or involves physical or mental danger, and that somehow

recounts, reveals, or recreates the founding event.

Test: Prove your prowess in some skill, test, or feat.

Alternatively, you must run a gantlet of successive challenges

or labors.

Purification: The item must be purified in some way.

This might involve bathing it in special waters, anointing

it with blessed oils, or some other action and materials

relating to the founding event.

Meditation: Meditate on the item for one day per character

level. You must spend at least 8 continuous hours

in meditation each day; during this period, you cannot

engage in mentally or physically demanding activities,

such as combat or spellcasting. If your meditation is interrupted,

the ritual fails and must be restarted; however, you

do not need to pay its gp cost again.

Pledge: Dedicate yourself to some principle or philosophy

related to the founding event. Each time you fail to

act in accordance with this pledge, you are unable to use

the two highest-level available abilities of your legacy item

for one day. If you repeatedly fail to honor the pledge, you

lose access to those abilities for additional days.

Knowledge: Educate yourself in some area of knowledge

that relates to the founding event. In game terms, you

must purchase at least 1 rank in a suitable Knowledge

skill, either immediately (if skill points remain available)

or when you next attain a level.

Reverence: Enact a service that reveres a deity, spirit,

or other aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers,

songs, or rituals. You must enact the service in the location

where the founding event occurred or a similar location.

Quest: Pledge yourself to a specific activity related

to the founding event, such as slaying some great foe,

recovering a magnificent relic, surviving a mythically

dangerous passage, and so on. Unless you specify otherwise,

you are presumed to be following the quest; however,

each day after the initial pledge that you have not

completed the quest, you have a 10% chance of being

unable to use the two highest-level available abilities of

your legacy item.

LEGACIES

It allows you to establish further legacy abilities,

available from 11th through 16th level.

Cost: In addition to the gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page 184), designing and performing

a lesser legacy founding ritual requires the

expenditure of 1,100 XP. Upon

completing the ritual, you

gain the Lesser Legacy

feat specific to your item

as a bonus feat.

Greater Legacy

Founding Ritual

The greater legacy ritual,

when performed for the

first time, brings a legacy

item to the “highest

level” of power. It allows

you to establish ultimate

legacy abilities, available

from 17th through

20th level.

Cost: In addition to the

gp cost for raw materials

(see Setting Costs on page

184), designing and performing

a greater legacy founding

ritual requires the expenditure of

1,700 XP. Upon completing the ritual,

you gain the Greater Legacy feat specific

to your item as a bonus feat.

ASSIGNING

LEGACY ABILITIES

The process of assigning legacy abilities—the powers

that give a legacy item its identity—is complex. As a

player whose character is founding an item of legacy,

you should work with your Dungeon Master to create

a suite of interesting and flavorful abilities that harmonize

to form a unique creation.

You have two options when assigning legacy abilities.

On completing a given founding ritual, you

can choose all the abilities that are accessible to the

associated legacy feat, effectively creating a

“road map” to follow over the rest of your

career. Alternatively, if your DM allows,

you can choose each legacy ability

when you attain the next

character level that allows

access to a new ability. You

must still select abilities

available for the appropriate

legacy feat you have

(least abilities if you have

the Least Legacy feat). The

second option allows

much more flexibility

but needs the approval

of the DM to prevent

abuse—otherwise you

could simply choose the

best ability for whatever

challenge you happen to be

facing at the time.

To guide you in choosing appropriate

legacy abilities, this chapter

presents a series of menus. Each menu

includes a range of abilities of roughly

equivalent value, allowing a nearly limitless variety

of legacy items. These are not exhaustive—you can

also create new abilities of roughly the same cost,

even if they’re not found on the menus. (In fact,

many of the legacy items presented in Chapter 3

feature custom abilities that do not exactly match

menu choices.) If you do so, determine a reasonable

value for the ability (as a guide, try comparing it to

equivalent magic item properties) or just compare

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: XP COSTS

FOR FOUNDING RITUALS

Founding a new legacy item (that is, designing and creating

it from scratch) costs XP in addition to the raw materials

costs for unlocking an existing item’s abilities. The reasons

for this are twofold.

First, designing your own legacy item from the ground up

allows it to more closely fit your needs, as well as your campaign

history. This makes the legacy more meaningful to you,

but it also makes the item more powerful in your hands.

Second, if awakening a legacy item cost no more than

creating a new one, there would be little reason to discover

legacy items—characters would simply found their own,

allowing them to customize items for the same price.

Legacy items are intended to lend a distinctive cachet to

a campaign as well as to reinforce its unique history and

background, so there should be an incentive to introduce

preexisting ones rather than have every player design his

or her own.

A founding ritual requires both

dedication and imagination

Illus. by M. Phillippi

184

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

its effect to similar abilities already listed in the

menus or on preconstructed legacy items. Then

determine the appropriate menu and assign the

ability accordingly.

You can choose any given ability from a menu

just once, unless specifically noted otherwise. For

example, if you choose the armor or shield enhancement

ability from Menu A, you can’t choose it again

as a least ability for that item.

You also can’t “front-load” an item with powerful

abilities at low levels from higher menus (which

require additional slots from lower menus) and leave

higher levels empty. For example, when selecting an

ability from Menu B or C, you must “lose” Menu A

slots. The empty slots must precede the slots filled by

those menu abilities. If you choose two least abilities,

one from Menu A and one from Menu B, the Menu

A ability would appear at 5th level while the Menu

B ability—which costs two Menu A slots—would

appear at 7th level (leaving 6th level empty).

OMENS

In addition to legacy abilities, each item of legacy

has an omen: a minor power that makes the item

recognizable as something special. Of all the abilities

you assign to an item when founding a legacy,

only the omen can be used by a wielder without the

Least Legacy feat specific to that item. (Of course, the

original magical properties of the item also remain

available to any wielder, with or without an enabling

legacy feat.) Choose one of the ability categories from

the Omen menu on page 188, then design its specific

features. Alternatively, you can design a minor magical

ability based on examples from preconstructed items

in Chapter 3 (such as the +2 bonus on Concentration

checks granted by the Bones of Li-Peng or Bright Evening

Star’s light ability).

An omen manifests while the item is in use, when

first drawn, or on some other triggering factor you

specify.

LEGACY ABILITIES

Each legacy feat (least, lesser, and greater) is represented

by three menus listing legacy items appropriate

to that level of power. The first menu in a series lists

the least powerful abilities. The simplest way to

assign abilities for a given legacy feat is to choose

one from the first menu (for example, Menu A for

least legacy) for each level in the appropriate range.

Abilities from higher menus are more powerful and

take up additional ability slots: For example, each

Menu B choice replaces two Menu A choices, while

each Menu C choice replaces three Menu A choices.

You can always choose an ability from a lower menu

instead, if you prefer.

Each of the abilities listed in a menu has a generic

title that describes its effect. To make your item more

interesting, you can give the ability a colorful name

that reinforces the item’s theme. For example, if you

are founding a legacy item that is somehow associated

with mind flayers, and you choose the detect thoughts

ability from Menu A, you might instead name the

ability “infiltrate brain.” Many of the legacy items in

Chapter 3 have custom abilities that aren’t readily

summed up by a simple spell name, for example, and

have interesting names as a result.

Least abilities are the least potent (aside from the

omen), and represent the first tier of power resident

in an item of legacy. These abilities are described in

Menus A, B, and C.

Lesser abilities represent a moderate to high level

of power and are described in Menus D, E, and F.

Greater abilities represent the pinnacle of a legacy

item’s power. Greater abilities are described in Menus

G, H, and I.

Unless otherwise specified, a legacy ability takes

effect whenever you carry, wield, wear, or otherwise

use the item of legacy.

SETTING COSTS

After designing the legacy rituals and assigning abilities

to the item, you must decide on and set the ritual

costs (in gp) and personal costs (such as hit point loss

or attack penalties).

Ritual costs are fairly standard, but there is no

simple method for assigning personal costs. You can’t

just choose a personal cost from a menu—it must have

a consequence to both the founder and any subsequent

wielder. Work together with your DM to design costs

that are meaningful but not crippling.

A legacy item’s personal costs are offset by its

uniquely powerful abilities. Although it seems as

though the wielder is accepting an onerous burden,

the payoff is an item that is much more powerful

than might otherwise be expected at a given character

level.

SAMPLE COST PROGRESSIONS

This chapter provides ten sample progressions of

ritual and personal costs appropriate to a range of

characters. These are guidelines only—many items

185

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

presented in Chapter 3 do not follow them precisely.

Each progression lists the gp cost of the least, lesser,

and greater legacy rituals, as well as the personal costs

assessed against the wielder and the levels at which

those costs are assessed. The ritual costs for each

progression are similar but not identical.

A given progression is appropriate for a certain

class of legacy items. For example, a progression that

applies attack penalties has little effect on the average

wizard, whereas skill penalties don’t mean much to

combat-focused characters such as fighters.

Tables 4–1 and 4–2 impose significant hit point

losses, along with penalties on attack rolls and saving

throws. These are most appropriate for items intended

for fighters, paladins, barbarians, and other characters

who focus on martial talents. Table 4–2 applies

a penalty only to a single saving throw (Fortitude,

Reflex, or Will, at the founder’s option), but the

penalty is more severe than the general penalties

assessed in Table 4–1. Neither of these progressions

is suitable for characters who don’t rely on attack rolls

(such as wizards). Hit point losses are cumulative,

but penalties on attacks and saves represent the total

at a given level.

Tables 4–3 and 4–4 impose costs related to both

combat (hit points or attack penalty) and skill use

(skill points or skill check penalty). These progressions

work best with characters who rely on both, such as

rangers, barbarians, monks, and rogues. Table 4–3 is

meant for those with higher hit points (such as barbarians),

while Table 4–4 is more heavily weighted toward

those with lower hit points (such as rogues). Neither

of these progressions is suitable for martial characters

who don’t rely heavily on skills (such as fighters) or

who are neither combat specialists nor skill-users

(such as sorcerers). Hit point and skill point losses are

cumulative, but penalties on attacks and skill checks

represent the total at a given level.

Table 4–5 is similar to Table 4–4, except that it

replaces the attack penalty with a save penalty and

drastically reduces the hit point cost. It is best suited

to skill-using characters who don’t engage in much

combat, such as bards and rogues who are fast-talking

or deft rather than sneak attackers. It is not appropriate

for characters with fewer than 6 skill points per

level, since it can severely limit skill acquisition.

Hit point and skill point losses are cumulative, but

penalties on saves and skill checks represent the total

at a given level.

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

Tables 4–6 through 4–8 apply personal costs that

include lost spell slots. Thus they are appropriate only

for spellcasting characters. Table 4–6 offers the most

widely applicable progression, useful for any “pure”

spellcaster (cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard). Table

4–7 works well with spellcasters who have some melee

capability (such as clerics and druids), replacing skill

check and save penalties with penalties on attack rolls.

Table 4–8 is best suited to characters who combine

limited spellcasting with skill use (mostly bards,

though items for rangers who don’t advance past lesser

legacy could also use this table). Spell slot, hit point,

and skill point losses are cumulative, but penalties on

attacks, saves, caster level, and skill checks represent

the total at a given level.

Tables 4–9 and 4–10 offer psionic equivalents for

spellcaster cost progression. Most of the cost here is

assessed as power point losses—the psionic equivalent

EXAMPLE LEGACY ITEM DESIGN

Dave is playing a 5th-level character who founds a legacy

shield: Praetorian Bulwark. Before the founding ritual, the

shield has a +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class but no

other magical properties. Dave decides to assign all of the

shield’s legacy abilities at the time of the founding ritual.

He chooses one option from Menu A for the item’s

5th-level legacy ability: an increased enhancement

bonus to the shield’s AC. As soon as Dave’s character

completes the least legacy ritual and pays the appropriate

costs, his shield’s enhancement bonus immediately

improves to +2.

For the next legacy ability, Dave decides to increase

the shield’s enhancement bonus again. To do so requires

choosing the enhanced armor or shield option from

Menu B, because the Menu A choice can’t be taken again.

A Menu B choice uses up two least ability slots: one ability

that would otherwise be available from Menu A at 6th

level and one at 7th level. Therefore, Dave’s character

unlocks no new legacy ability at 6th level, instead waiting

until 7th level before Praetorian Bulwark’s enhancement

bonus improves to +3.

Dave could choose another Menu A ability for 8th

level, but instead he opts for the fly ability from Menu

C. This takes up three least ability slots, meaning that

his character can’t unlock that ability until he reaches

10th level.

Having now assigned all his item’s least ability slots,

Dave has founded a legacy shield. Once his character

reaches 11th level, Dave will need to decide whether

he wants to design a lesser legacy ritual and continue

adding powers to Praetorian Bulwark.

Finally, Dave must assign ritual and personal costs

for his item’s least abilities. Because a shield is most

suited to a combat-oriented character, Dave decides to

use Table 1. His character expends raw materials worth

2,500 gp to perform the least legacy ritual. On attaining

6th level he will lose 4 hit points, and another 2 at 9th.

He takes a –1 penalty on all saving throws at 8th level,

and a –1 penalty on all attack rolls at 9th level. If he decides

to unlock the Praetorian Bulwark’s lesser abilities,

he must pay the appropriate ritual and personal costs

from the same table.

of spell slots. (Soulknives should use a progression

appropriate to combat-focused characters, since their

psionic abilities don’t rely on power points.) Table 4–9

is intended for classes such as the psion or wilder who

focus entirely on psionic powers. Table 4–10 is better

suited to the psychic warrior and similar psionic

classes, imposing a lower power point cost progression

at the cost of hit point losses and attack penalties.

Hit point and power point losses are cumulative, but

penalties on attacks and manifester level represent

the total at a given level.

Some characters don’t fi t neatly into these categories.

That’s okay—just use your best judgment. You don’t

have to fi nd a perfect match in these tables, as long

as the personal costs are appropriate for the wielder’s

character archetype and represent meaningful, but

reasonable, expenditures.

LEGACY ABILITY MENUS

The menus of omens and legacy abilities presented

below provide an à la carte approach to creating new

legacy items. Follow the instructions presented earlier

in this chapter to assign omens and abilities.

Unless noted otherwise, you can select a specifi c

menu choice only once.

OMEN MENU

When you found a legacy item, before assigning legacy

abilities, choose one omen type from this menu to

assign to your legacy item. Once you choose an omen

type, customize the ability to your specifi c item. For

instance, if you choose an audible omen, decide what

sound or sounds your item makes and under what

circumstances. Once customized, the omen does

not change.

Auditory: The item sings, weeps, whispers, or makes

some other sound. If the item produces words, they

cannot be more than preprogrammed phrases.

Material: The item displays some minor material

effect. This might manifest as illusory substances,

such as seeping blood, running shadows, or slime,

or as programmed visual illusions, such as a blinking

eye or a snarling mouth. No blood, slime, or other

material is actually produced.

Mental: A threatening voice echoes telepathically

in the mind of specifi ed creatures, promising

eventual death by the legacy item, or some similar

preprogrammed phrase. Examples of such targets are

creatures whose alignments differ from your own,

members of a particular race or class, and so on.

Olfactory: The item produces a signature odor, such

as the scorched smell of burning steel, the coppery

tang of blood, the ozone stench of lightning, and

the like.

Visible: The item shines, fl ickers, glows, strobes,

or produces some other light effect.

ABILITY MENU A (LEAST)

When you found a legacy item and perform a least

legacy ritual, assign least abilities to the item from

the following menu. You choose one ability at 5th

level, and one for each additional character level

up to 10th level.

Alternatively, you can “lose” Menu A choices to

select abilities from Menus B and C, as described

under those menus.

Menu A abilities have a

caster level of 5th.

Armor or Shield

Enhancement (Su):

The effective enhancement

bonus of a suit

of armor or a shield

increases by 1, to a maximum

of +2. You can

instead choose any special

ability whose market

price is equivalent to a +1

bonus, such as light fortifi

cation. This ability can

be placed only on a suit

of armor or a shield.

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

Cause Fear (Sp): Five times per day on command,

you can use cause fear as the spell. The save DC is 11, or

11 + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

Comprehend Languages (Su): You continually

understand all spoken and written languages,

as if continually affected by the comprehend languages

spell.

Creature Compass (Su): While holding, wearing,

or wielding the item, you can detect any one type

or subtype of creature within 60 feet, but you must

concentrate (a standard action) to do so. You ignore

any damage reduction of the specified creature when

attacking it (whether with the item, if a weapon, or

with some other weapon, unarmed attack, or natural

weapon, provided you are wearing or otherwise using

the item). Choose the creature type or subtype when

you assign this ability to the item. This can be any of

the general types described in the Monster Manual or a

subtype, if the creature type is humanoid or outsider,

just like the ranger’s favored enemy class ability (see

page 47 of the Player’s Handbook).

Cure Light Wounds (Sp): Three times per day,

you can use cure light wounds as the spell by touching

the item to the creature to be healed (including

yourself) and speaking a command word. This ability

can instead deal damage to undead creatures. The save

DC is 11, or 11 + your Charisma modifier, whichever

is higher.

Cure Light Wounds, Self (Sp): Once per day as

a swift action, you can use cure light wounds as the

spell on yourself when holding, wearing, or wielding

the item.

Darkness, Self (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can cause the item to shed darkness as the spell.

Darkvision (Sp): Once per day on command, you

can use darkvision as the spell.

Deflection (Su): The item grants you a +1 deflection

bonus to Armor Class. This ability can never be

placed on a suit of armor or a shield.

Detect Thoughts (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use detect thoughts as the spell. The save DC

is 13, or 12 + your Charisma modifier, whichever

is higher.

Enlarge Person (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use enlarge person (self only) as the spell.

False Life (Sp): Once per day on command, you

can use false life as the spell.

Feather Falling (Su): The item immediately confers

the effect of a feather fall spell upon you if you fall

for more than 5 feet.

Intelligent Legacy, Minor (Su): The item gains

sentience (see Intelligent Items on page 268 of the

Dungeon Master’s Guide). It can communicate with

you empathically, and can hear and see out to 60

feet. It gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

scores: Two of these are 13, typically Intelligence

and Charisma, and the third is 10. The legacy item’s

Ego score is calculated as normal for an intelligent

item (include the item’s enhancement bonus, telepathy,

if any, and ability bonuses, but not its legacy

abilities). Its Ego also increases as more legacies are

unlocked. An item with one or more least abilities

has 2 additional Ego points; one with one or more

lesser abilities has 4; and one with one or more

greater abilities has 8 (these additional Ego points

are not cumulative).

Invisibility (Su): Once per day, when you issue the

command word and gesture with the item, you become

invisible. This works like the invisibility spell.

Knock (Su): Once per day on command, you can

open locked or magically sealed doors, as with the

knock spell. Doing this requires touching the item to

or striking it against the object to be opened.

Lightbringer (Su): You can use dancing lights, flare,

or light at will as the spells, using a different command

word for each effect. The save DC is 10, or 10 + your

Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

Lock (Su): Once per day on command, you can

magically lock a door, chest, or portal, as with the

arcane lock spell. Doing this requires you to touch the

item to or strike it against the object to be locked.

A legacy item can let you know what you’re up against

CHAPTER 4

FOUNDING

LEGACIES

Magic Missile (Sp): Three times per day, when

you issue the command word and gesture with the

item, you cause it to launch three missiles of force,

as the magic missile spell.

Magical Cipher (Su): You can use detect magic,

read magic, or arcane mark at will as the spells, using

a different command word for each effect.

Metamagic, Lesser (Su): You can apply the

effect of one metamagic feat to up to three spells

per day that you cast of up to 3rd level. This can be

any metamagic feat that normally adjusts a spell’s

slot by one level (such as Enlarge Spell, Extend

Spell, or Silent Spell); choose the specific feat

when assigning this ability to the item. Using this

legacy ability does not change the spell slot of the

altered spell. A spontaneous spellcaster (such as a

sorcerer) must still take a full-round action when

using this ability, just as if using a metamagic feat

he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

cast spells.

Metapsionic, Lesser (Su): You can apply the

effect of one metapsionic feat to up to three psionic

powers per day that you manifest of up to 3rd level.

This can be any one of Delay Power, Enlarge Power,

Extend Power, or Split Psionic Ray (see Chapter 3:

Skills and Feats in the Expanded Psionics Handbook).

Choose the specific feat when assigning this ability

to the item. Using this legacy ability does not change

the power point cost of the altered power.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Mirror Image (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use mirror image as the spell.

Mount (Su): When you throw the item to the

ground while speaking the command word, it transforms

into a normal, living light horse or pony (your

choice) to serve you as a mount for as long as you

choose. The mount is equipped with a bit, bridle, and

riding saddle. When you dismount and take hold of

the reins, you can speak the command word again to

cause the mount to revert to its original form. While

your legacy item is serving as a mount, you cannot

use any of its other abilities. If the mount is slain, the

item reverts to its original form and cannot be used

as a mount again for 24 hours.

Protection from Arrows (Sp): Once per day

on command, you can use protection from arrows

as the spell.

Resist Energy (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use resist energy as the spell.

Resistance (Su): The item grants you a +1 resistance

bonus on all saving throws. You can select

this option multiple times, each time increasing the

resistance bonus by +1, to a maximum resistance

bonus of +2.

See Invisibility (Sp): Once per day on command,

you can use see invisibility as the spell.

Skill Enhancement +5 (Su): The item grants you a

+5 competence bonus on one skill check. Choose the

specific skill when assigning this ability to the item.

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, it applies to a different skill.

Speed Enhancement +5 (Su): The item increases

the speed of one of your modes of movement by 5

feet. Choose the specific movement mode when

assigning this ability to the item. You can’t add this

bonus to a form of movement you don’t already have

(for example, if you don’t have a fly speed, this ability

can’t give you one). Treat this adjustment as an

enhancement bonus.

Summon Monster II (Sp): Once per day when

you issue the command word and gesture with the

item, you can use summon monster II as the spell.

Telekinetic (Su): You can use mage hand, mending,

and open/close at will as the spells, using a different

command word for each effect.

Unceasing Servant (Su): You enjoy the continual

benefit of an unseen servant, as the spell. If dissipated

by 6 or more points of damage from an area attack, or

if it ceases to exist by moving more than 35 feet away

from you, the servant re-forms 1 round later in any

square adjacent to you.

Weapon Enhancement: Your weapon gains an

enhancement bonus of +1. This ability can be placed

only on a weapon.

ABILITY MENU B (LEAST)

When you found a legacy item and perform a least

legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu B ability at the

cost of two Menu A slots. You cannot “trade in” existing

Menu A abilities for an ability from this menu. A

skipped slot means that no legacy ability is available

at that character level. For example, if you assigned a

Menu A ability at 5th level, you could assign a Menu

B ability at 7th level, gaining no new legacy ability at

6th level. You still pay personal costs for a given level,

even if you gain no new legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from Menu A in place

of one from Menu B.

Menu B abilities have a caster level of 7th.

is 13, or 12 + your Charisma modifier,

whichever is higher.

Cure Moderate Wounds, Self (Sp): Once per day

as a swift action, you can use cure moderate wounds as

the spell on yourself when holding, wearing, or wielding

the item.

you against damage from one type of energy—acid,

cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each time you would

the damage dealt. Choose the specific type of energy

when assigning this ability to the item. You can select

this option multiple times. Each time you do so, it

applies to a different type of energy.

can communicate with you

telepathically and speaks

Common, plus one additional

language per point of

using darkvision. It gains

Intelligence, Wisdom, and

Charisma scores: Two of these

are 16, typically Intelligence

and Charisma, and the third is 10.

The legacy item’s Ego score is calculated

as described under Intelligent

Legacy, Minor, in Menu A.

Lightning Bolt (Sp): Once per

day on command, you can use lightning

bolt as the spell. The save DC is 14, or 13

+ your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

Locate Object (Sp): Three times per day on command,

you can use locate object as the spell.

Speed Enhancement +10 (Su): The item increases

the speed of one of your modes of movement by 10

feet. Choose the specific movement mode when

assigning this ability to the item. You can’t add this

bonus to a form of movement you don’t already have

(for example, if you don’t have a fly speed, this ability

can’t give you one). Treat this adjustment as an

enhancement bonus.

Summon Monster III (Sp): Once per day when

you issue the command word and gesture with the

item, you can use summon monster III as the spell.

Weapon Enhancement (Su): The effective

your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

Whispering Wind (Sp): Three times per day on

command, you can use whispering wind as the spell.

ABILITY MENU C (LEAST)

When you found a legacy item and perform a least

legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu C ability at

the cost of three Menu A slots. You cannot “trade

in” existing Menu A or B abilities for an ability from

this menu. A skipped slot means that no legacy ability

is available at that character level. For example, if

you assigned a Menu A ability at 5th level, you could

assign a Menu C ability at 8th level, gaining no new

legacy abilities at 6th or 7th level. You still pay personal

costs for a given level, even if you gain no new

legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu C.

Menu C abilities have a caster level of 10th.

Acid Arrow (Sp): At will, when you issue the command

word and gesture with the item, you cause it to

fire an acidic arrow, as the Melf’s acid arrow spell.

Armor or Shield Enhancement (Su): The effective

enhancement bonus of a suit of armor or a shield

increases, as shown in the table below. This ability can

be placed only on a suit of armor or a shield.

Instead of increasing the enhancement bonus, you

can choose any combination of enhancement bonuses

and special abilities whose total market price is equivalent

to the effective bonus increase. For example, if

the effective enhancement bonus increases by 2, you

could increase the armor’s enhancement bonus by 1

and give it the light fortification ability, or leave its

enhancement bonus unchanged and give it a special

ability whose market price is equivalent to a +2 bonus,

such as spell resistance 13.

288 of the Monster Manual. Only that creature can be

summoned using this ability.

The allied creature attacks your foes and serves you

to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with

the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack

particular enemies, or to perform other actions. It

remains with you unless dismissed (a standard action)

or killed. If the creature is slain, it can be summoned

again after 24 hours, fully healed. You can never have

more than one least companion at any one time.

manifest psionic powers.

Empower Spell, Lesser

(Su): You can cast up to

three spells per day of up to

3rd level that are empowered

Haste (Su): Your legacy item speeds up your perception

of time. While you are holding, wearing, or

wielding the item, you can activate haste for 1 round

as a swift action, as though wearing boots of speed. You

can use this ability up to fi ve times per day.

Intelligent Legacy, Major (Su): The item gains

you telepathically and speaks Common, plus one

additional language per point of Intelligence bonus.

The item can hear and see out to 120 feet using

darkvision, and it has blindsense with a range of 120

feet. It gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

Obscurity (Su): The item cannot be detected

remotely through scrying, remote viewing, or other

means of divination, as if continually affected by the

obscure object spell.

Protection from Arrows (Su): While you are

holding, wearing, or wielding the item, you gain

damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons,

as if affected by the protection from arrows spell. There

is no limit to the amount of damage prevented.

Shocking Legacy (Su): Five times per day as a

standard action, you can imbue the item with electrical

energy. (This does not harm you.) The item

deals an extra 5d6 points of electricity damage on a

successful hit. If the item is a projectile weapon, it

bestows this effect on its ammunition. Alternatively,

you can deal 5d6 points of electricity damage with a

successful melee touch attack; if the item is a melee

weapon, use it to make this attack. In either case,

the energy is expended until you recharge the item

(using another standard action).

Slippery Barrier (Su): While you are holding,

wearing, or wielding the item and are standing on

solid, open ground, you can use a swift action to

cover the open ground with a layer of slippery grease.

This effect resembles the grease spell but covers each

eligible 5-foot square adjacent to your own (your

space is free of the grease effect). Another swift action

dismisses the effect; otherwise the grease dissipates

in 1 minute. If there is no open ground in one or

more adjacent squares, or if you leave the ground,

the effect immediately ends. The save DC is 11, or

11 + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

can fill an area with sticky strands, as the web spell.

The save DC is 13, or 12 + your Charisma modifier,

whichever is higher.

If you continue to enhance a legacy item by performing

a lesser legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu E

ability at the cost of two Menu D slots. You cannot

“trade in” existing Menu D abilities for an ability

from this menu. A skipped slot means that no

legacy ability is available at that character level. For

example, if you assigned a Menu D ability at 11th

level, you could assign a Menu E ability at 13th level,

gaining no new legacy ability at 12th level. You still

pay personal costs for a given level, even if you gain

no new legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu E.

Menu E abilities have a caster level of 11th.

Ability Enhancement +4: The item grants a +4

enhancement bonus to one ability score. Choose

You can select this option multiple times. Each time

you do so, it applies to a different type of energy. This

ability does not stack with least energy resistance from

you can use fi reball as the spell. The save DC is 14, or

13 + your Charisma modifi er, whichever is higher.

legacy abilities at 12th and 13th level. You still pay

your normal number of 2nd-level arcane spells per

day, as though wearing a ring of wizardry II.

ABILITY MENU H (GREATER)

If you continue to enhance a legacy item by performing

a greater legacy ritual, you can choose a Menu H

ability at the cost of two Menu G slots. You cannot

“trade in” existing Menu G abilities for an ability

from this menu. A skipped slot means that no legacy

ability is available at that character level. For example,

if you assigned a Menu G ability at 17th level, you

could assign a Menu H ability at 19th level, gaining

no new legacy ability at 18th level. You still pay personal

costs for a given level, even if you gain no new

legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu H.

Menu H abilities have a caster level of 17th.

Armor or Shield Enhancement (Su): The effective

enhancement bonus of a suit of armor or a shield

increases, as shown in the table below. This ability

can be placed only on a suit of armor or a shield, and

can be selected multiple times. You cannot increase

the armor or shield’s actual enhancement bonus

beyond +5.

Instead of increasing the enhancement bonus,

you can choose any combination of enhancement

bonuses and special abilities whose total market price

is equivalent to the effective bonus increase.

Clenched Fist (Sp): Once per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

can create a Large magic hand that can attack foes, as

the Bigby’s clenched fist spell.

Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass (Sp): Three times

per day on command, you can use mass cure moderate

wounds as the spell. This instead deals damage to

undead creatures. The save DC is 19, or 16 + your

Charisma modifier, whichever is higher.

Disintegrate (Sp): Once per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

cause it to emit a thin green ray that destroys one

creature utterly, as the disintegrate spell. The save

or wielding the item, you can activate displacement

for 1 round as a swift action, as though wearing a major

cloak of displacement. You can use this ability up to ten

times per day.

Energy Resistance, Greater (Su): The item

protects you against damage from one type of

energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each

time you would normally take such damage, subtract

30 points from the damage dealt. Choose the

specific type of energy when assigning this

ability to the item.

You can select this option multiple

times. Each time you do so, it

applies to a different type of energy.

This ability does not stack with energy

resistance from previous menus.

Ethereal

Jaunt (Su):

Once per day,

when you issue

the command word and

gesture with the item, you can

become ethereal. This works like the

ethereal jaunt spell. You can remain

ethereal for as long as you wish, but

once you return to material form,

you cannot become ethereal again

that day.

Finger of Death (Sp): Once per

day, when you issue the command word

and gesture with the item, you can

kill one living creature, as the finger of death spell.

action, you can use heal on yourself when holding,

wearing, or wielding the item.

is 22, or 18 + your Charisma modifier, whichever

command word and gesture with the item, you gain

the benefit of the iron body spell.

Maximize Power (Su): You can manifest up to

three psionic powers per day of up to 6th level that

are maximized as though using the Maximize Power

metapsionic feat (see the Expanded Psionics Handbook

for details). Using this legacy ability does not change

the power point cost of the altered power.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Maximize Spell (Su): You can cast up to three

spells per day of up to 6th level that are maximized

as though using the Maximize Spell metamagic feat.

Using this legacy ability does not change the spell

slot of the altered spell. A spontaneous spellcaster

(such as a sorcerer) must still take a full-round action

when using this ability, just as if using a

metamagic feat he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you

cannot already cast spells.

Mind Blank (Su):

While you are holding,

wearing, or wielding the

item, your mind is protected

from mental and emotional tampering,

as if continually affected

by the mind blank spell.

Moment of Prescience (Su):

holding, wearing, or wielding

the item, you can gain a

+20 insight bonus on a single

roll, as the moment of prescience

spell. You must declare that you

are activating the effect before you

make the roll.

Prismatic Spray (Sp): Two times per

day, when you issue the command word

and gesture with the item, you cause it

to emit shimmering, multicolored beams of light

with a variety of effects, as the prismatic spray spell.

whichever is higher.

of spells in the item, as though it were a ring of spell

storing.

when you issue the command word and gesture

with the item, you can use summon monster VII as

the spell.

Weapon Enhancement (Su): The effective

enhancement bonus of a weapon increases, as shown

in the table below. This ability can be placed only on

a weapon, and can be selected multiple times. You

cannot increase the weapon’s actual enhancement

bonus beyond +5.

Instead of increasing the enhancement bonus,

you can choose any combination of enhancement

bonuses and special abilities whose total market

price is equivalent to the effective bonus increase.

A legacy item can make its

owner nearly invulnerable

Wishes, Two (Su): The item grants you two

wishes as the wish spell. You must state the desired

If you continue to enhance a legacy item by performing

a greater legacy ritual, you can choose a

Menu I ability at the cost of three Menu G slots.

You cannot “trade in” existing Menu G abilities for

an ability from this menu. A skipped slot means that

no legacy ability is available at that character level.

For example, if you assigned a Menu G ability at 17th

level, you could assign a Menu I ability at 20th level,

gaining no new legacy abilities at 18th and 19th level.

You still pay personal costs for a given level, even if

you gain no new legacy abilities.

You can choose one ability from any lower menu

in place of one from Menu I.

Menu I abilities have a caster level of 20th.

Constant Companion, Greater (Su): While you

are holding, wearing, or wielding the item, you can

use a swift action to summon an allied creature.

When assigning this ability to the item, choose

one of the creatures from the 5th-level list of the

Summon Monster or Summon Nature’s Ally table

on pages 287 and 288 of the Monster Manual. Only

that creature can be summoned using this ability.

The allied creature attacks your foes and serves you

to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with

the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack

particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

It remains with you unless dismissed (a standard

action) or killed. If the creature is slain, it can be

summoned again after 24 hours, fully healed. You

can never have more than one greater companion at

up to three psionic powers per day of up to

9th level that are empowered as though using the

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

manifest psionic powers.

Empower Spell, Greater (Su): You can cast up

to three spells per day of up to 9th level that are

empowered as though using the Empower Spell

metamagic feat. Using this legacy ability does not

change the spell slot of the altered spell. A spontaneous

spellcaster (such as a sorcerer) must still take a

full-round action when using this ability, just as if

using a metamagic feat he possessed.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

cast spells.

Energy Drain (Sp): Once per day, when you issue

the command word and gesture with the item, you

cause it to emit a black beam of negative energy that

bestows 2d4 negative levels on a subject, as the energy

drain spell. The save DC is 23, or 19 + your Charisma

modifier, whichever is higher.

Heal, Mass (Sp): Three times per day on command,

you can use mass heal as the spell. This ability

can instead deal damage to undead creatures. The

save DC is 23, or 19 + your Charisma modifier,

whichever is higher.

Imprisonment (Su): Once per day, when you

make a successful melee touch attack against a foe,

you can imprison that foe beneath the earth, as the

the touch attack.

per day of up to 6th level that are quickened as though

using the Quicken Spell metamagic feat. Using this

sorcerer) does not take a full-round action when using

this ability.

You cannot use this ability if you cannot already

cast spells.
