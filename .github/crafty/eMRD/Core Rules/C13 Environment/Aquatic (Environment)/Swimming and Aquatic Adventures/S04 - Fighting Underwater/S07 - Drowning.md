# S07 - Drowning
## Overview
**Drowning**

Drowning is one of the most obvious dangers of underwater adventuring. As creature can typically hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. Whenever a creature takes a standard or full-round action, it expends 1 additional round of breath, so practically speaking, if a creature wants to fight or double move each round, it can do so only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. Intentionally exhaling breath expends 1 to 3 rounds for each exhaling action—generally 1 round for a small exhalation, and 3 rounds for an extended exhalation like singing a song or casting a spell. Certain magic, like the *[[Suffocation (Spell)|suffocation]]* spell from the *Advanced Player’s Guide*, can expel all of a creature’s held breath.

Once a creature has used up these rounds of safety, it lives on a knife’s edge between life and death. Each round, the creature must succeed at a Constitution check, with a DC starting at 10 and increasing by 1 each round after the first. Once it fails this check, the creature begins to drown, falling [[Unconscious|unconscious]] (and dropping to 0 hit points if it currently had more), dropping to –1 hit points on the next round, and [[Dying|dying]] on the round after that. At any point, if the creature becomes able to breathe (perhaps because someone dragged it out of the water or cast a spell to assist it), it ceases drowning but doesn’t regain any lost hit points. Note that if a creature holds its breath in a situation where it could normally breathe, it won’t fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]] if it fails its Constitution check.

Because of the prohibitive limitations of holding one’s breath, underwater explorers from the surface use a variety of techniques to extend their ability to breathe underwater. The most common is *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]*, which is extremely long-lasting and can protect an entire group with one casting. A simpler, short-term solution is *[[Air Bubble (Spell)|air bubble]]* from *Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat*, which can protect a single creature for a few minutes—but not usually enough for an underwater adventure. The most powerful option is *life bubble* from the *Advanced Player’s Guide*; while its duration is half that of *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]*, it also protects against many other underwater hazards such as extreme temperature and pressure. Those who prefer a mundane alternative to ephemeral (and dispellable) magic tend to use air tanks (see page 56) to store additional air, but characters hoping to stay underwater find that carrying around more than a few extra breaths of air sets their [[S02 - Buoyancy|buoyancy]] to swiftly rising, almost like wearing a giant life preserver, so this solution is effective only for a strong swimmer or someone with access to magic to alter [[S02 - Buoyancy|buoyancy]].
