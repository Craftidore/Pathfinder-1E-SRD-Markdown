# S03 - Freedom of Movement
## Overview
**Freedom of Movement**

In addition to preventing a character from being [[Grappled|grappled]] and several other nasty conditions, *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|freedom of movement]]* enables the target to move and attack normally while underwater. Thus, a creature benefitting from *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|freedom of movement]]* can swing weapons without penalties (though objects that leave its possession, like thrown weapons or ammo from ranged weapons, lose this benefit), lift objects without drag, and walk along the bottom at full speed. The creature automatically succeeds at all [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks as the water offers no significant resistance to its movement. If the creature has the ability to do so, it can fly or use spells like *[[Air Walk (Spell)|air walk]]* to freely move around as if it were in air. Creatures who need just the movement benefits from *[[Freedom of Movement (Spell)|freedom of movement]]* without the benefits against [[Grapple|grapple]], [[S3.1N-Q - Universal Monster Rules N-Q (Bestiary 6 Apx)|paralysis]], and magic effects that hinder movement should consider the lower-level spell *free swim* on page 59.
