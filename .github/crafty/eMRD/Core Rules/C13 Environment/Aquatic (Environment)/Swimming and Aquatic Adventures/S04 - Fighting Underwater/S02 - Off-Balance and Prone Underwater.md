# S02 - Off-Balance and Prone Underwater
## Overview
**Off-Balance and Prone Underwater**

“Off-balance” is a special state (though not technically a condition) that is listed in the Combat Adjustments Underwater table on page 433 of the Core Rulebook. A creature off-balance in the water loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it, and attacks it makes with piercing weapons are made at a –2 penalty and deal half damage. A creature typically becomes off-balance by failing a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check, which makes it off-balance for a round, even if it has a neutral buoyancy and doesn’t sink or rise.

**Tripping Underwater:** While flying creatures specifically can’t be tripped, the Core Rulebook doesn’t specify whether the same is true of swimming creatures. Being prone doesn’t mean much for a swimming creature, so instead, a successful [[Trip|trip]] against a swimming creature forces that creature to attempt a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check at a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check to [[Trip|trip]]; failing the [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check causes the creature to become off-balance. Many aquatic creatures can’t be tripped or have a high [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] bonus and thus can always take 10, so this tactic isn’t always effective, but when it is, it can make dexterous foes much easier to hit. However, being off-balance doesn’t affect most of the target’s attack rolls, and the target can regain its balance simply by succeeding at a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to move on its next turn as normal.
