# S01 - The Basics
## Overview
**The Basics**

The basics of the [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill are the same in an aquatic campaign. According to page 108 of the Core Rulebook, when a creature uses a move or full-round action to swim, it attempts a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check against the appropriate DC based on how calm the water is and other local factors.

On a success, it can move up to one quarter of its land speed with a single move, or half its land speed with a double move. On a failure, it doesn’t make any progress, and on a failure by 5 or more it goes underwater. This last part, however, doesn’t make any sense if the PC is already underwater. Instead, if a PC fails her check by 5 or more while underwater (or doesn’t spend any actions to swim, thus not even attempting the check), she sinks or rises based on her buoyancy (see the next section for more details). While swimming, a PC can’t normally use the run or charge actions or take a 5-foot step. Every hour of swimming requires a successful DC 20 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to avoid fatigue. Even on a success, an hour of swimming is still at least as strenuous as marching for an hour, and extensive swimming eventually requires a PC to attempt checks as per forced marches (see page 171 of the Core Rulebook). Similarly, continually taking a double move to swim at half land speed counts as hustling. A creature can also walk on the ocean floor, lake bed, or other solid ground underwater as long as its buoyancy is swiftly [[Sinking|sinking]] (see below). When it does so, it moves at half its land speed without needing to attempt a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check.

**Swim Speed:** Creatures with a swim speed have a variety of advantages underwater. First of all, they can swim through normal water at their full swim speed without needing to attempt a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check. They can use the run and charge actions and take 5-foot steps with their swim speed. When they do need to attempt [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks to deal with a hazardous situation or perform a special action, they benefit from a sizable +8 racial bonus on their [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. There might be an unusual circumstance where a creature has a swim speed that’s actually slower than one-quarter of its land speed (for instance, a [[Monk|monk]] using the spell *[[Monkey Fish (Spell)|monkey fish]]* from Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide to gain a swim speed of 10 feet). Such a creature can swim at one-quarter of its land speed instead, but it sacrifices the benefits of its swim speed on rounds when it isn’t using its swim speed.
