# Aquatic (Environment)
## Overview
The rules presented in the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* assume the default perspective of a game based on land, with only occasional hazards and encounters involving water—typically as ways to get terrestrial PCs out of their comfort zone. However, when you’re running a game with significant portions set underwater, you often wind up needing to make a number of tricky adjudications in order to make gameplay work. In the same vein as the Skills in Conflict and Spells of Intrigue sections from *Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue*, which offer advice for handling situations likely to arise in an intrigue-style game, this chapter includes advice and adjudications that make it an invaluable resource for those running and playing in aquatic adventures. 

The chapter is divided into two sections. The first section covers various topics related to adventuring underwater, beginning with movement and the [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill. It continues by describing differences between fighting and combat activities underwater instead of on land. Next, there’s advice to assist in underwater adventuring and more generally thinking in three dimensions, followed by an overview of various features and hazards of the deep. 

The second section includes all sorts of new rules elements for aquatic adventuring, including archetypes, equipment, feats, magic items, and spells. These new elements are great for terrestrial adventurers exploring the vast depths and for naturally aquatic creatures.
