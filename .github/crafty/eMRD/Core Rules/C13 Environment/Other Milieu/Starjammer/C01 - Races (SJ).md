# C01 - Races (SJ)
## Contents
**Races**

Choosing to play a standard fantasy race such as a human, dwarf, or elf, versus playing one of the astonishing races described in this chapter is up to your Gamemaster and is based upon the type of campaign that they wish to run. Abiarazi, manu, and other “stellar” races are as diverse as fantasy races, with inspiration being taken from the original fantasy races to create their interstellar counterparts.
