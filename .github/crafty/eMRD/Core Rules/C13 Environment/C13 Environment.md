# C13 Environment
## Overview
From the lifeless desert to the trap-filled dungeon, the environment helps to define the world. Bringing these settings to life can help create a vibrant and immersive experience.

This chapter contains rules to help the GM adjudicate the game world, including rules for dungeons and their features, traps, various types of terrain, and environmental hazards.
