# Simple Weather Rules
## Overview
**Appendix 1: Weather Rules**

Temperature in the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game* sometimes has very specific effects, but is handled in separate sections (“standard” temperatures are covered under weather, and are in poorly-defined and overlapping categories, while “extreme” temperatures are covered under environmental rules, and are somewhat better defined). The following section combines these rules into a single and easy to use scale, and makes a couple of minor adjustments to the thresholds of certain temperature categories in order to make these two groups of temperatures compatible.

**Damage from Extreme Temperatures:** Extreme heat and cold deal nonlethal damage to the victim. A character cannot recover from the damage dealt by a hot or cold environment until she is removed from that environment and returns to a normal temperature. Once a character has taken an amount of nonlethal damage equal to her total hit points, any further damage from a hot or cold environment is lethal damage.

**Temperature Categories**

Temperature can be divided into several categories, based on the amount of heat involved. These categories range from extreme cold to extreme heat. The following table summarizes the various temperature categories.

**Table A1-1: Temperature Categories**


| **Temperature Category** | **Temperature\*** |
|---|---|
| Extreme Cold | -21° or lower |
| Severe Cold | -20° to -1° |
| Cold | 0° to 40° |
| Moderate | 41° to 60° |
| Warm | 61° to 85° |
| Hot | 86° to 110° |
| Severe Heat | 111° to 140° |
| Extreme Heat | 141° or higher |

**Extreme Cold (-21° or below):** Extreme cold deals 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.

**Severe Cold (-1° to -20°):** In conditions of severe cold, an unprotected character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on each failed save. A character who has the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well. Characters wearing a cold weather outfit only need check once per hour for cold and exposure damage. In conditions of severe cold or colder, a character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as [[Fatigued|fatigued]]). These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.

**Cold (0° to 40°):** An unprotected character in cold weather must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who has the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description).

**Moderate (41° to 60°):** While uncomfortable for many humanoids, there are no adverse effects caused by exposure to this temperature. Snow and ice exposed to moderate or warmer temperatures begin to melt.

**Warm (61° to 85°):** There are no adverse effects caused by exposure to this temperature.

**Hot (86° to 110°):** A character in hot conditions must make a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty on their saves. A character with the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).

**Severe Heat (111° to 140°):** In severe heat, a character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a –4 penalty on their saves. A character with the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill in Using Skills). Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per each 10-minute period). In severe heat or hotter conditions, a character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure suffers from heatstroke and is [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. These penalties end when the character recovers from the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.

**Extreme Heat (141° or above):** Extreme heat deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures deals 1d6 points of fire damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal  damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a –4 penalty on their saves.
