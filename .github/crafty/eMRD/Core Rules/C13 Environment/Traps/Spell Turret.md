# Spell Turret
## Overview
A spell turret is a highly dangerous magic trap that blurs the line between trap and construct. Powerful wizards use spell turrets to guard important reaches of their guild or tower. Priests install them in the burial vaults of particularly favored devotees.

A spell turret is generally located at one end of a long hallway or room, and is mounted on a wall, floor, or ceiling. When inactive, the turret merges with the material of the surface on which it is mounted and cloaks itself with a *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]* spell to hide its magical aura. A spell turret has a visual trigger that utilizes *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* feat, but does not cost gold pieces or experience points.

If a spell turret detects an unrecognized target, it immediately activates. When it does, it emerges from the wall quickly and quietly with a flash of colorful light; each spell turret looks different, since their creators personalize them. One turret might resemble a crystal lance, another a leering gargoyle, and still another an out stretched arm.

All four of the stored spells in a spell turret must be of the same level, from the same spell list, and from different schools. Once activated, a spell turret immediately begins casting one of the four spells stored within it at the rate of one spell per round, pausing only on every fifth round to magically repair 4d8+20 points of damage to itself. A turret targets the closest unrecognized creature, and has a 360-degree arc of fire. A spell turret’s caster level is always equal to the caster level at which the stored spells are available; thus, a spell turret that fires 3rd-level cleric spells does so at caster level 5th, and one that fires 6th-level bard spells does so at caster level 11th. The order in which a turret casts its spells is set; it cycles through them in the same order each time. A spell turret’s CR equals the level of spells it fires +1.
