# Ice Effects (Environment Rules)
## Ice Effects
**Ice Effects**

Characters walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by ice, and the DC for [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks increases by +5. Characters in prolonged contact with ice might run the risk of taking damage from severe cold.
