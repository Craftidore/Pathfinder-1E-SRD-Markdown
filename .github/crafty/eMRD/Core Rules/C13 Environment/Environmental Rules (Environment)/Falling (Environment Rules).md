# Falling (Environment Rules)
## Falling
**Falling**

Creatures that fall take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6. Creatures that take lethal damage from a fall land in a prone position.

If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. A DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check allows the character to avoid any damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts any damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. Thus, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same character deliberately jumps, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 2d6 points of lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a successful [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check, he takes only 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 1d6 points of lethal damage from the plunge.

Falls onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert the first 1d6 of damage to nonlethal damage. This reduction is cumulative with reduced damage due to deliberate jumps and the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill.

A character cannot cast a spell while falling, unless the fall is greater than 500 feet or the spell is an immediate action, such as *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]*. Casting a spell while falling requires a concentration check with a DC equal to 20 + the spell’s level. Casting *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* or a similar spell while falling does not end your momentum, it just changes your location, meaning that you still take falling damage, even if you arrive atop a solid surface.

**Falling into Water**: Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, the first 20 feet of falling do no damage. The next 20 feet do nonlethal damage (1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, falling damage is lethal damage (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).

Characters who deliberately dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check or DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. The DC of the check, however, increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.

*House Rule:* The worst thing that can happen to a flying character is to fall. A falling character takes 1d6 hp damage for the first 10' he drops, then 2d6 hp damage for the second 10., 3d6 for the third 10., etc., to a maximum of 20d6 damage. 

An airborne creature may go out of control and drop, regaining control of its flight shortly afterwards. An object falls at 32./second², which means that the object falls an increasing amount with each passing second, but wind resistance slows the creature.s fall. For simplicity's sake, Table 3 shows how far an object falls over a short span of time.

In order to regain control and stop a fall, the flier must make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check (DC 15 +1 for each second that the flier falls). If the number rolled is less than the creature's maneuverability (ie., their [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check DC), the fall continues. Air elementals, of course, do as they please and take no time at all to recover.

A flier injured so badly that it must land (half hps remaining), but not so badly that it will crash (quarter hps or less remaining), takes no damage upon landing if it makes a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check (DC 20 \[half hit points remaining) or DC 25 \[quarter hit points remaining]). Failure to make the check results in half normal damage from the fall. A flier so badly injured that it plummets to the ground (having taken over 75% damage to its hit points) can save itself only with a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] check using (DC 25 as outlined above). Making the check results in half damage from the fall; failure results in full damage. In either of the latter events, the injured flier cannot fly again until it has been fully healed. Note than anyone riding such a falling beast takes the same amount of damage that the beast takes.

The DM may decide whether or not the PCs can invent the parachute. This device would not affect game balance greatly, and if the players can think of a logical reason why their characters would have had the idea, they could probably make one. To work, a parachute must be deployed at least 1,000. above the ground. The DM can assign chances for a parachute not opening correctly, depending on how well it is made. A parachute must be 24. wide for every 200 lbs. it is to carry. If it is solid, without a central hole, the parachute spins during the fall. This may cause the parachutist to become dizzy. A PC who uses such a parachute is incapacitated by vomiting for 1d10 rounds upon landing. Parachutists have a 50% chance of taking 1d6 hp damage per landing, modified downward 5% for each jump. There is always a 10% chance of injury.

This information is modified from “Physics and Falling Damage,” DRAGON® issue #88, page 12. The distances have been rounded off to fit a game scale based upon 30’ game scale (5' equals 1 inch). Terminal velocity is reached after 6 seconds of falling.

**Falling and Damage Reduction**

Damage Reduction does not reduce falling or other environmental damage. The source of falling damage is not an attack. The ground is not attacking you. Falling damage is untyped (not bludgeoning) damage.

Some other environmental effects which are not attacks and that do untyped damage: deep water (ie. pressure), avalanche, extreme heat, extreme cold, strong winds, fast-flowing water. (Segue: no, Tieflings may not ignore hot and cold climates)

Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable. \[source: CRB, Special Abilities]

The numerical part of a creature's damage reduction (or DR) is the amount of damage the creature ignores from normal attacks. \[source: CRB, Special Abilities]

A spell that conjures a flight of arrows that deals piercing damage should be reduced by DR/bludgeoning or slashing. If it doesn't, then that spell's damage type shouldn't be listed as piercing at all, but untyped damage. Spells and effects that do untyped damage are pretty rare in Pathfinder, since these spells are quite powerful since their damage can't be stopped by any form of immunity, resistance, or damage reduction. \[Source: James Jacobs]

**How far does a character fall in a single round? If my griffon-riding character falls off his mount 300 feet up, how long do other characters have to catch him?**

This ends up being both a rules and a physics question. The short answer is, “In a single round, you fall far enough to hit the ground in the vast majority circumstances that come up in the game.”

Here’s the long answer: A falling character accelerates at a rate of 32 feet per second per second. What that means is that every second, a character’s “falling speed” increases by 32 feet. The distance he falls in that second is equal to the average of his falling speeds at the beginning of that second and at the end of that second. Thus, during the first second he falls 16 feet (the average of 0 feet and 32 feet, which are his speeds at the start and end of that second). During the next second he falls 48 feet (the average of 32 feet and 64 feet). He falls 80 feet during the third second, 112 feet the fourth second, 144 feet the fifth second, and 176 feet the sixth second. That’s a grand total of 576 feet fallen in the first round alone, hence the short answer given above—the number of falls occurring in any campaign longer than this is probably pretty small. For ease of play, you could simply use 500 feet as a nice round number—it’s easier to remember.

Of course, the character falls even farther the next round, although acceleration soon ends due to the resistance of air on the falling body (this is what’s called terminal velocity). If the Sage remembers his high-school physics, terminal velocity for a human body is roughly 120 mph (equivalent to a speed of 1,200 feet per round, or 200 feet per second); thus, the character’s falling speed hits its maximum in the first second of the second round. It’s safe to say that after 2 rounds the character will have fallen nearly 2,000 feet, and will fall another 1,200 feet per round thereafter.

In the example you give, other characters would clearly have no more than a round to react, and it’s possible they’d have even less time. Remember that despite the sequential nature of D&D combat actions, things are happening very quickly—virtually simultaneously, in many cases. As a DM, I’d probably allow every character a chance to react to a long fall (such as the one you describe), as long as their action occurs before 1 full round has passed from the start of the fall. (As a side note, that’s why *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* allows its caster to cast it even when it isn’t her turn—otherwise, adjudicating its timing would be a nightmare.) The difference between “you watch the character fall all the way to the ground before you can react” and “the character starts to fall, what do you do?” is really just up to the DM’s sense of fun and fair play. Off the top of my head, I’d say that anything up to 50 or 60 feet is clearly too fast to react to (barring a readied action, of course), and anything that approaches 250 feet or more should probably allow characters some chance to react, but that’s purely a personal opinion.

Whatever decision you make, try to make the same decision every time, so that players know what to expect. If this situation comes up a lot in your game, it’s probably worth creating a house rule so you don’t have to try to remember what you did last time. (If your campaign routinely features 300-foot falls, your characters might want to invest in some *rings of feather falling*!)

Now, if you start altering certain assumptions—such as the force of gravity, or the density of air that’s resisting the falling character, or even the mass of the falling character—these calculations become less useful. Yet, unless your numbers are much different than the standard values, you can still use these as benchmarks.

**Simplified Falling Rule**

A more simple (but much more lethal) rule for falling is when a character falls, they take 1 hp of damage per foot fallen. When using this rule, magic items such as *boots of the cat* which reduce damage to the minimum possible for the dice used; reduce the damage fallen to 1 hp/10 feet fallen.
