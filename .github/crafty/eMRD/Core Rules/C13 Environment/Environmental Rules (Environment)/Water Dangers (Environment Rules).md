# Water Dangers (Environment Rules)
## Water Dangers
**Water Dangers**

Any character can wade in relatively calm water that isnâ€™t over his head, no check required. Similarly, swimming in calm water only requires [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill checks with a DC of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10. Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult (see the [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill description)*.* By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. Characters must make a successful DC 15 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check or a DC 15 Strength check to avoid going under. On a failed check, the character takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per round (1d6 points of lethal damage if flowing over rocks and cascades).

Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a navigational hazard, but worse, deals water pressure damage of 1d6 points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the surface. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute. Very cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hypothermia per minute of exposure.
