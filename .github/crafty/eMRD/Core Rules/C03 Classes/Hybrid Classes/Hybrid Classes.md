# Hybrid Classes
## Overview
Most heroes progress along a single path—choosing to become a fearsome fighter, pious cleric, or mighty wizard—but some are drawn to many roads. For them, it can be hard to find a balance between abilities offered by disparate classes. Hybrid classes solve this dilemma by blending features from two classes, adding rules to make them work seamlessly together.

**Parent Classes**: Each one of the following classes lists two classes that it draws upon to form the basis of its theme. While a character can multiclass with these parent classes, this usually results in redundant abilities. Such abilities don’t stack unless specified. If a class feature allows the character to make a one-time choice (such as a bloodline), that choice must match similar choices made by the parent classes and vice-versa (such as selecting the same bloodline).

**Classes**

The ten new classes presented in this book are all hybrids of two existing classes from the *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player’s Guide*, and *Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat*. The new classes are as follows.

**Arcanist**: Blending the power of the sorcerer with the versatility of the wizard, the arcanist draws upon a reservoir of power to bend magic to her will.

**Bloodrager**: Fusing the frenzy of the barbarian with the bloodline might of the sorcerer, the bloodrager calls upon innate power to give himself extraordinary abilities.

**Brawler**: Focusing on hand-to-hand combat, the brawler mixes the martial artistry of the monk with the specialist training of the fighter.

**Hunter**: Though both the druid and ranger can have animal companions, the hunter takes this bond to the next level, forming a deadly duo with her savage ally.

**Investigator**: With the rogue’s cunning complemented by the alchemist’s magical talent, the investigator is a peerless problem solver.

**Shaman**: Calling on the divine power of the oracle and the hexes of a witch, the shaman communes with her spirit animal to unleash doom upon her foes.

**Skald**: Sharing fury through song and deed, the skald takes the rage that lives in the heart of the barbarian and inspires it in others using the performances of the bard.

**Slayer**: Mixing the precise strikes of the rogue with the special training of the ranger, the slayer hunts down his foes with ruthless efficiency.

**Swashbuckler**: Combining the prowess of the fighter with the determination of the gunslinger, the swashbuckler is an acrobatic melee combatant.

**Warpriest**: Blending the cleric’s divine might and the fighter’s martial skills, the warpriest brings the fight to the enemies of his faith.
