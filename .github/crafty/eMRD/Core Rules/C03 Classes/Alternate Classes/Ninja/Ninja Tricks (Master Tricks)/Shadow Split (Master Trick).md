# Shadow Split (Master Trick)
## Overview
*Shadow Split (Su)*: This trick allows the ninja to create an illusory double of herself that moves away from her, allowing the ninja to create a distraction. When she uses this ability, an illusory double appears and moves away from the ninja, heading in one direction. The double climbs walls, jumps pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice the ninja’s speed in the direction indicated by the ninja when the ability is used. Its course cannot be changed. The double persists for 1 round per level of the ninja. Those who interact with the double receive a Will saving throw to recognize that it is fake. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s level + the ninja’s Charisma modifier. Each use of this ability uses up 1 *ki* point. The ninja must possess the [[Shadow Clone (Ninja Trick)|shadow clone]] ninja trick before selecting this trick.
