# Master Disguise (Master Trick)
## Overview
*Master Disguise (Su)*: A ninja with this trick can take on the appearance of other creatures and individuals. Whenever the ninja uses the [[Sudden Disguise (Ninja Trick)|sudden disguise]] ninja trick, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level. Alternatively, the ninja can use the [[Sudden Disguise (Ninja Trick)|sudden disguise]] ninja trick to take on the appearance of a specific individual that the ninja has seen before for 1 minute per level. Creatures that are familiar with the individual receive a Will saving throw to see through the illusion. The DC of this saving throw is 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s level + the ninja’s Charisma modifier. This illusion also changes the ninja’s speech, if she has heard the individual talk and can speak his language. The ninja must have the [[Sudden Disguise (Ninja Trick)|sudden disguise]] ninja trick before selecting this trick.
