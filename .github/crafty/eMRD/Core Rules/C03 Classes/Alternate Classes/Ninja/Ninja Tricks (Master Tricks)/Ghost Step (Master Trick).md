# Ghost Step (Master Trick)
## Overview
*Ghost Step (Su)*: As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can pass through walls as if she were a ghost. Until the end of her turn, she can pass through a wall or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per level as if she were [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]]. She must exit the solid material by the end of her turn. Each use of this ability uses up 1 *ki* point.
