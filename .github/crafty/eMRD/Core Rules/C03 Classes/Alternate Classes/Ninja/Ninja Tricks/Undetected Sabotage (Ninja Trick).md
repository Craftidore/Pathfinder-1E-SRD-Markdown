# Undetected Sabotage (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
*Undetected Sabotage (Ex):* Whenever a ninja with this trick uses [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to sabotage or disable a device, she can make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check with a bonus equal to her level. Anyone who inspects the device does not notice the sabotage and assumes the object works unless he beats the ninjaâ€™s check with an opposed [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check.
