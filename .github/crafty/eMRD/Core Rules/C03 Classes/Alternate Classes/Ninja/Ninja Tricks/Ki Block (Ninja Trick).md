# Ki Block (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
*Ki Block\* (Su):* A ninja with this trick can prevent a creature from using its ki pool. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja’s Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja’s level + the ninja’s Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target’s ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.

**Source:** Ultimate Combat, pg. 15

Tricks marked with an asterisk (\*) add effects to a ninja’s sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.
