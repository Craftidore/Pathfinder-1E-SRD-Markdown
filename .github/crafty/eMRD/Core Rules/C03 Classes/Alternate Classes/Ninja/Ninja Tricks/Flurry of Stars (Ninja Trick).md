# Flurry of Stars (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
*Flurry of Stars (Ex):* A ninja with this ability can expend 1 ki point from her ki pool as a swift action before she makes a full-attack attack with shuriken. During that attack, she can throw two additional shuriken at her highest attack bonus, but all of her shuriken attacks are made at a â€“2 penalty, including the two extra attacks.
