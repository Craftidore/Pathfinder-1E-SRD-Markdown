# Hidden Weapons (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
*Hidden Weapons (Ex):* A ninja with this ability can easily conceal weapons on her body. The ninja adds her level on opposed [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks made to conceal a weapon. In addition, she can draw hidden weapons as a move action, instead of as a standard action.
