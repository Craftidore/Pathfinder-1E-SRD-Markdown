# Blink Dash (Ninja Trick)
## Overview
**Blink Dash (Su):** The ninja has learned to dash between the blinks of her foeâ€™s eyes. Whenever the ninja focuses purely on movement, her form becomes hazy and indistinct. If the ninja takes a run or withdraw action, she is treated as being under the effect of a *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]* spell until the beginning of her next turn. The ninja must have at least 1 ki point to use this trick.
