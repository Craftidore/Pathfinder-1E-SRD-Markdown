# Talented Thief
## Overview
Rogues are the iconic masters of stealth and subterfuge, with access to both a number of powerful set class features (primarily relating to traps, evasion, and sneak attacks) and a flexible set of customizable talents. While this gives them a wide range of options, it can also lead to characters with specific sneak, criminal, or adventurer concepts having abilities they don’t need, such as a wilderness scout being a master of urban traps, or an entirely scholarly researcher and archeologist gaining a huge number of sneak attack dice. Rogues are supposed to be masters of picking up tricks of the trade, but half their class abilities are static bonuses with little customization.

At the same time many cool rogue tropes have been presented as archetypes, allowing rogue characters to pick up new stealth of skill-based abilities, almost always at the cost of some of their trap expertise. It seems odd that the most customizable class has so many nonmagical abilities that are offered only as archetypes, when it’s the class that is the original holder of the idea of talents as class features. Further, the rogue is one of the few classes with an alternate class (the ninja) that has no philosophical changes from the original base class. The only things that set ninjas and rogues apart are flavor and a few key class features, but the classes remain so close that they can take each other’s talents.

Unfortunately it’s not possible to present all potential rogue abilities as talents, since some rogue builds won’t feature things like trapsense or sneak attacks and it’s not reasonable for a rogue to be able to pick up every possible core class features. There’s no system to allow even the most basic rogue abilities be customizable, while keeping them separate from the talents the rogue gains at every other level.

**But what if there was?**

*The Genius Guide to the Talented Rogue* rewrites the classic rogue class to use a system of edges and talents, rather than static class abilities alternating with talents. Edges represent the “core” features of each rogue, areas of study so intense and specialized that no thief can master all of them, while the classic talent system has been expanded to include any rogue-like ability a character could reasonable pick up at any time with study. This allows the rogue, ninja, and all their archetypes to be covered by a single class that is far more flexible than the versions in the core rules, without allowing overpowered combinations.

To make this system as flexible as possible, and to keep players and GMs from constantly having to check multiple sources for talents, this product includes talents, advanced talents, archetypes, the assassin, and the ninja alternate class for its abilities (as well as including new talents to expand its breadth). Because some abilities (such as a ki pool) are not appropriate for every campaign, and some GMs dislike allowing abilities from multiple archetypes to be taken by a single character, when an ability is adapted from another class or an archetype, the name of that source is given as a descriptor.

**Alignment:** A talented thief may be of any alignment.

**Hit Die:** d8

**Class Features**

All of the following are class features of the talented thief.

**Proficiencies:** A thief is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

**Hey, Where’s My Sneak Attack?!**

Sneak attack, one of the iconic abilities of the thief, does not appear on the talented thief class chart. Instead it is now treated as a thief talent that can be taken more than once (but not for more than half the thief’s talents), allowing thief players to decide if they want the traditional offensive punch of sneak attack or would rather focus on some other aspect of being a sneak.

It’s worth noting that a thief without sneak attack has fewer options for dealing hit point damage to foes, and may have to get creative in order to remain as effective as a classic thief. This option is presented for players who are up to the challenge, or have a strong character concept that doesn’t include being a master of sliding a knife between a foe’s ribs. It also works well for NPCs who are supposed to be adventurous experts in sneaking, sabotage, or similar subjects, but not in melee combat. But sacrificing sneak attack for other talents may well result in a character that is less powerful overall, and players should consider the consequences carefully before doing so.

## Thief Edges
**Thief Edges**

Every thief has a unique outlook on life, which colors what threats she takes seriously, what esoteric skills she studies, and what kinds of tricks and knacks she picks up. These abilities, known as edges, help a thief act as an assassin, scout, expert treasure locator, or some combination or roles that appeal to her in particular. A thief gains an edge at 1st level, and additional edges at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th level, and a final edge at 20th level.

Edges are similar to thief talents, but are more fundamental to her background and worldview, and require constant and regular practice to keep effective. As a result there’s a limit to how many edges a thief can have, and most edges must be selected early in the thief’s career. While a thief gains multiple edges over her first few levels, those acquisitions represent the culmination of years (possibly a lifetime) of effort and study. A thief may not decide to take the evasion edge until 4th level, but she has been thinking about how to escape explosions and practicing her ideas for long years before her acumen rises to the level of that edge. A thief may not take an edge more than once unless it specifies otherwise. Some edges are taken from various thief archetypes. These edges include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, to allow GMs to limit characters to edges from a single archetype (if desired).

*Ambush (Ex):* \[Bandit] The thief is fully practiced in the art of ambushing. When she acts in the surprise round, she can take a move action, standard action, and swift action during the surprise round, not just a move or standard action. A thief must be 4th level to select this edge.

*Blade Sense (Ex):* \[Knife Master] The thief is so skilled in combat involving light blades that she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made against her with light blades. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Bravado’s Blade (Ex):* \[Rake] When the thief hits an opponent and deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo 1d6 points of that damage and make a free [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of sneak attack damage she forgoes, she receives a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this edge.

*Daring (Ex):* \[Swashbuckler] The thief gains a +1 morale bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks and saving throws against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Divine Purpose (Su):* \[Sanctified Thief] The favor of a deity or religious institution grants a special blessing on the thief, shoring up some of her weaknesses. She gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws.

*Effortless Sneak (Sp):* \[Chameleon] The thief chooses a single terrain from the ranger’s favored terrain class feature. While she is within that terrain, she can take 10 on any [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check she makes. When the thief reaches 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, she chooses a new type of terrain from the ranger’s favored terrain list. She gains this ability with the newly picked terrain. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Expert Acrobat (Ex):* \[Acrobat] The thief does not suffer any armor check penalties on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]], [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]], or [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill checks while wearing light armor. When she is not wearing armor, she gains a +2 competency bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] and [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill checks.

*Evasion (Ex):* The thief can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the thief is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless thief does not gain the benefit of evasion. A thief must be at least 2nd level to select this edge.

*Follow Up (Ex):* \[Investigator] The thief can roll twice on any [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check made to gather information, and receives the information for both results. This takes the same amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks reveals false information, the thief is aware of it. False information is not revealed in this way if the people she questioned do not know it to be false.

*Frightening (Ex):* \[Thug] Whenever the thief successfully uses [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] to demoralize a creature, the duration of the [[Shaken|shaken]] condition is increased by 1 round. In addition, if the target is [[Shaken|shaken]] for 4 or more rounds, the thief can instead decide to make the target [[Frightened|frightened]] for 1 round.

*Hardy (Ex):* \[Survivalist] The thief is prepared to endure extreme hardships and environmental conditions. She can go twice the normal number of days without water and triple the normal number of days without food before feeling the effects of either thirst or starvation.

*Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):* The thief can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another thief the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more thief levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see below) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum thief level required to flank the character.

A thief must have uncanny dodge and be at least 4th level to select this edge.

*Ki Pool (Su)*: \[Ninja] The thief gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the thief’s ki pool is equal to 1/2 her thief level + her Int or Cha modifier (selected when this edge is taken). As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).

By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a thief can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a thief can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A thief can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting some thief talents with the thief descriptor.

The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the thief possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, her thief levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The thief can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.

*Martial Training (Ex):* \[Swashbuckler] The thief may select one martial weapon to add to her list of weapon proficiencies.

*Measure the Mark (Ex):* \[Cutpurse] When the thief makes a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check to take something from a creature, the target makes its [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check before the thief makes her [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check, and the thief knows the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target’s [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check. If the thief elects not to make the check, she can make a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check, opposed by the target’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], to prevent the target from noticing the attempt.

*Misdirection (Ex):* \[Chameleon] The thief knows that the secret to disappearing lies in deceiving the senses of her observers. Every day she gains a pool of stealth points equal to her ranks in [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]]. These points refresh at the start of each day. Before making a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check, she can choose to put stealth points into the roll, gaining a bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks equal to the number of stealth points she puts into the roll. If she gains a bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks because of a feat (such as [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] \[[[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]]]), she adds a number of points to her stealth pool equal to the bonus the feat grants.

*Natural Born Liar (Ex):* \[Charlatan] When the thief successfully deceives a creature with a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], that creature takes a –2 penalty on the thief’s [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks for the next 24 hours. This ability does not stack with itself.

*No Trace*: \[Ninja] The thief learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a thief using the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill checks and on opposed [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. These bonuses rise to +2 when the thief reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

*Poison Use*: The thief is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.

*Rake’s Smile (Ex):* \[Rake] The thief gains a +1 morale bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Roof Running (Ex):* \[Roof Runner] The thief is entirely adept at moving across the tops of buildings, spires, and similar locations. Provided she is wearing light armor, the roof runner can move at full speed while traveling across the tops of buildings or similar structures, and takes no penalties on any Dexterity-based Skill checks or Reflex saves that might be incurred from moving about on a roof.

*Scout’s Charge (Ex):* \[Scout] Whenever the thief makes a charge, her attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target were [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. A thief must be 4th level and have the sneak attack talent to select this edge.

*Second Chance (Ex):* \[Acrobat] The thief can reroll any [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], or [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill check she has just made. This reroll is made at a –5 penalty. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability only once on any given skill check. She can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. A thief must be third level to select this edge.

*Skilled Liar (Ex):* \[Spy] Whenever a thief uses [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] to attempt to deceive someone, she gains a bonus on the opposed roll equal to 1/2 her thief level (minimum +1). This bonus does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to pass secret messages.

*Skirmisher (Ex):* \[Scout] Whenever the thief moves more than 10 feet in a round and makes an attack action, the attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target was [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. If the thief makes more than one attack this turn, this ability only applies to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. The thief must be 8th level and have the scout’s charge edge to select this edge.

*Stab and Grab (Ex):* \[Cutpurse] As a full-round action, the thief can make an attack and also make a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check to steal something from the target of the attack. If the attack deals sneak attack damage, the thief can use [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] to take an item from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability can only be used in a surprise round before the target has acted. If the attack is successful, the target takes a –5 penalty on the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to notice the theft. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Talent:* The thief may select any thief talent she meets the prerequisites for.

*Trap Sense (Ex):* The thief gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the thief reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

*Trapfinding (Ex):* The thief adds 1/2 her level to [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill checks made to locate traps and to [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill checks (minimum +1). Additionally, the thief can use [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to disarm magic traps.

*Unbending (Ex):* \[Pirate] The thief gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting  effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

*Uncanny Dodge (Ex):* The thief can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A thief with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Combat) against her. A thief must be 2nd level to select this edge.

*Unflinching (Ex):* \[Pirate] The thief gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. A thief must be 3rd level to select this edge.

## Thief Talents
**Thief Talents**

As a talented thief gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 1st, a talented thief gains one thief talent. She gains an additional thief talent for every level of thief attained after 1st. A thief cannot select an individual talent more than once unless the talent specifies otherwise.

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a thief’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made, and a thief must have selected the sneak attack talent at least once before selecting any talents that modify it.

Some talents are taken from various thief archetypes. These talents include the name of their originating archetype as a descriptor, for all GMs to limit characters to talents from a single archetype, if desired.

*Accuracy (Ex):* \[Sniper] The thief halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a weapon with which she has proficiency.

*Acrobatic Master (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action, a thief with this talent can focus her ki to grant her a +20 bonus on one [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check of her choice made before the start of her next turn. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.

A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Adaptable Flanker (Ex):* A number of times per day equal to her Dexterity bonus, the thief may treat a foe as flanked if that foe is threatened by at least three creatures, even if they do not normally qualify as flanking the target. Only the thief may treat the target as flanked. The flanked status remains until the thief moves, the target moves, or the beginning of the thief’s next turn.

*Addling Attack (Ex)* \[Hoodwink]: At 3rd level, whenever a rogue would deal sneak attack damage, he may forgo the sneak attack damage to render the target [[Confused|confused]] for a number of rounds equal to half the number of dice forfeited (minimum 1 round) unless the target succeeds on a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + half the hoodwink’s class level + his Strength modifier.

*Agile Climber (Ex):* A thief with this talent rolls twice while making [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks and when making Reflex saves to avoid falling and takes the better result.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 8

*Agonizing Attack\* (Ex):* When a thief with this talent deals sneak attack damage, all damage from the attack is considered continuous damage for the purposes of any concentration checks made by the damaged creature prior to the beginning of the thief’s next turn. This talent does not stack with itself, a creature damaged by multiple agonizing strikes in a round only needs to make a single concentration check against the continuous damage from the sneak attack that dealt the most damage. The thief must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Ambush Assailant (Ex):* If a thief attacks after successfully using [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] against a creature, that creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks the thief makes until the beginning of the target’s next turn. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus to [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] and be at least must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.

*Apprentice (Ex):* [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] are class skills for you. You must spend 1 hour each day studying under the tutelage of a willing ally who possesses at least as many Hit Die as you do, and who also possesses at least as many ranks in each of those skills as you have Hit Dice. If you do not spend the requisite time studying, you lose the benefits of this talent, including the +3 bonus for having one or more ranks in a trained class skill, and may not regain the use of this talent again until you do. A rogue must have the minor magic rogue talent before selecting this talent. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Arcane Appraiser (Su):* If you successfully use the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] skill to determine that an object has magical properties, you gain information about the item’s properties as though you were using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* and as if your [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] check were a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check instead. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Armor Expertise (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains Medium Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. In addition, she also reduces the armor check penalty of any light or medium armor she wears by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and offsets the speed reduction for wearing medium armor by 5 feet. At 10th level, the thief can move at her normal speed while wearing medium armor.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Artful Dodge (Ex):* A thief with this talent adds her Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus to her AC against attacks of opportunity. The thief must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Assault Leader (Ex):* When the thief misses with an attack on an opponent she flanks, she can designate a single ally who is also flanking the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action. A thief can use this ability once per opponent per day.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Bag of Tricks (Ex)* \[Hoodwink]: The rogue gains a bonus equal to half his class level on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill checks made to create a diversion or deliver a hidden message, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (traps) and [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill checks, and on the attack rolls of caltrops that the hoodwink scatters.

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Befuddling Strike\* (Ex)*: When the thief deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls against the thief for 1d4 rounds. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Befuddling Attack\* (Ex):* When the thief deals sneak attack damage, the target takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks (including concentration checks) for a number of rounds equal to the number of sneak attack damage dice dealt. This penalty does not stack with itself.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Betrayer (Ex)* \[Wormtongue]: At 2nd level, the wormtongue gains Betrayer as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites of that feat (see the *Ultimate Combat* sourcebook for a description of the Betrayer feat).

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Black Market Connections (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check, the thief can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the thief can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the thief does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the thief’s presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table below.


| **Community Size** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Thorp | 10 |
| Hamlet | 12 |
| Village | 15 |
| Small town | 18 |
| Large town | 20 |
| Small city | 25 |
| Large city | 30 |
| Metropolis | 35 |

*Bleeding Attack\* (Ex)*: A thief with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the thief’s sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Bleeding Attack\* (Ex):* A thief with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the thief’s sneak attack (e.g., 3d6 equals 3 points of bleed). At 8th level, the thief adds an amount equal to half her Strength or Dexterity bonus (whichever is greater, minimum +1) to this bleed damage and at 16th level she instead adds an amount equal to her Strength or Dexterity bonus (whichever is greater, minimum +1). Bleeding creatures take this amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself.

*Brooding (Ex):* You gain a +2 bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill checks, and you may oppose an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill check with an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check of your own when an opponent attempts to use that skill to demoralize you in combat. You may use the result of your check in place of the usual DC of (10 + Hit Dice + Wisdom modifier).

*Brutal Beating\* (Ex):* \[Thug] Whenever the thief deals sneak attack damage, she can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to make the target [[Sickened|sickened]] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her thief level. This ability does not stack with itself—only the most recent duration applies. A thief must have the sneak attack talent and be 3rd level to select this talent.

Magical healing relieves the injuries without the need for a skill check, as usual.

*Camouflage (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The thief needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the rest of the day or until the thief fails a saving throw against an area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever comes first. The thief gains a +4 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.

*Canny Observer (Ex)*: When a thief with this talent makes a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to hear the details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.

*Careful Disarm (Ex):* \[Burglar, Trapsmith] Whenever the thief attempts to disarm a trap using [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], she does not spring the trap unless she fails by 10 or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she adds double her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap. A thief must be 4th level and have the trap sense edge to take this talent.

*Charmer (Ex)*: Once per day, the thief can roll two dice while making a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check. A thief can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 thief levels she possesses.

*Charmer (Ex):* A thief with this talent can roll twice while making a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check. A thief can use this ability once per creature per day plus one additional time per creature per day for every five thief levels she possesses. A thief can use this ability when making a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check against a group of creatures. However, if the thief has already expended all her uses per day of this ability for specific creatures in the group, she rolls the two checks sequentially, using the first result for those specific creatures and using the better result for the rest of the group. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks and be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

*Choking Bomb (Ex):* \[Ninja] Whenever a thief throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the resulting cloud must make a Fortitude save or become [[Staggered|staggered]] by the choking black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when the talent it taken). The thief can decide to create an ordinary smoke bomb or add poison to this smoke bomb as normal. The thief must have the poison bomb talent before selecting this talent.

*Coax Information (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can use [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] in place of [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] to force an opponent to act friendly toward her.

*Convincing Lie (Ex):* When a thief with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so convincing that when others repeat it, they are likely to convince those they are talking to that the outlandish story is the truth. When a thief with this talent successfully uses the [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill to convince someone that what she is saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement or story, that person uses the thief’s [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill modifier to convince the questioner, rather than his own. (Obviously the individual already believes he is telling the truth, this allows him to convince *others* that what the thief originally said is true.)

If his [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill modifier is better than the thief’s, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken).

*Cunning Trapsmith (Ex):* A thief with this talent can use a swift action to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed or has studied and successfully bypassed. As a full-round action, the thief can also set a simple trap with a CR no greater than her thief level –2 (minimum 1). To do this, she must purchase the components, spend the required time constructing the trap in advance, and have its components at hand. The types of traps that can be constructed in this way are subject to GM discretion.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Cunning Trigger (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can use a swift action to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed.

*Darkvision (Su):* \[Ninja] This talent allows the thief to use her ki to enhance her sight, granting darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Using this talent is a standard action that costs 1 ki point. The enhanced senses last for 1 hour. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Deadly Cocktail (Ex):* A thief with this talent can apply two doses of poison to a weapon at once. These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisons’ frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time. The thief must be at least 8th level and must have the poison use class ability (or an equivalent ability that allows the thief to apply poison to a weapon without accidentally poisoning herself) or be immune to poison before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Deadly Range (Ex):* \[Ninja] A thief with this talent increases the range at which she can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A thief can take this talent more than once. Its effects stack.

*Deflect Arrows:* \[Ninja] A thief who selects this talent gains the [[Deflect Arrows (Feat)|Deflect Arrows]] feat as a bonus feat. The thief must have the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] combat feat before taking this talent.

*Deft Palm (Ex):* A thief with this talent can make a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check to conceal a weapon while holding it in plain sight, even while she is being observed. *Distracting Attack\* (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to become [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The thief cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Deft Swipe (Ex):* A thief with this talent can use her [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver. If she gains bonuses on steal combat maneuver checks from feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, these are added to the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] bonus when using the steal maneuver. Additionally, opponents do not gain a +5 bonus to their CMD when the thief tries to remove items fastened to them. A thief must have the Improved Steal feat before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Delay Sneak Attack\* (Ex):* Whenever you would deal sneak attack damage with a light slashing or piercing weapon, you may choose to delay the sneak attack damage for 1 round. After 1 round, the wound ruptures, and the target receives your sneak attack damage normally. If, after 1 round, the damage from your attack has since been healed, your opponent does not receive the delayed sneak attack damage. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Dexterous Extrication (Ex):* As an immediate action, a thief with this talent can attempt an [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check in place of a Reflex saving throw against any effect that would immobilize her or impose the [[Entangled|entangled]] condition on her. Additionally, when she is the target of a grapple combat maneuver, as an immediate action the thief can attempt an [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check using the result of the skill check in place of her CMD against that combat maneuver attempt. A thief of less than 10th level can only use this second ability once per opponent per day, but at 10th level this limitation no longer applies.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Distracting Attack\* (Ex):* When a thief with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The thief cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Distraction (Ex):* \[Burglar] Whenever the thief is detected while using [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]], she can immediately attempt a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill check opposed by the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill of the creature that spotted her. If this check succeeds, the target assumes that the noise was something innocent and disregards the detection. This only functions if the creature cannot see the thief. This ability can only be used once during a given [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] attempt. If the same creature detects the thief’s presence again, the ability has no effect. A thief must be 4th level to select this talent.

*Divine Epiphany (Su):* \[Sanctified Thief] Once per day, the thief can peer into the immediate future and predict the results of a specific action as if she had cast an *[[Augury (Spell)|augury]]* spell. The caster level of this spell is equal to her thief class level. A thief must be 8th level and have the divine purpose edge or major and minor petition talents before selecting this talent.

*Dramatic Entrance (Ex):* When you intentionally reveal yourself to opponents who were previously unaware of you, you can make yourself known in a dramatically theatrical way. You may attempt a DC 25 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] skill check. If your check is successful, opponents that witness your dramatic entrance take a -4 penalty on the first initiative check they make within the next minute. 

If you are flying or wearing a disguise when you reveal yourself, you may make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] or [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill check instead. If you execute your dramatic entrance by way of an especially theatrical deed, such as by crashing through a window or by employing smoke and pyrotechnics, you gain a +4 bonus on the skill check (subject to GM approval).

*Driver’s Fortitude (Ex):* \[Driver] The thief learns to keep driving and maintain control of her vehicle, even when mortally wounded. If the thief drops below 0 hit points but is not dead, she can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save each round to remain conscious and in control of her vehicle (able to make drive checks), though she may take no other actions. (See *Ultimate Combat* for more information on vehicles and driving checks.)

*Duelist’s Precision (Ex):* If a thief makes a melee attack and deals sneak attack damage with a single light or one-handed weapon wielded in one hand and makes no attacks with any other weapon during her action, then she can roll double her normal number of sneak attack dice, choose half those dice, and total the chosen dice as her sneak attack damage for this attack. If a thief uses this on her turn, she must choose to use duelist’s precision before making any attacks during her turn and if she does, she can only attack with a single light or one-handed weapon wielded in one hand until the end of her turn. A thief can also use duelist’s precision with attacks outside her turn, such as attacks of opportunity, provided the other requirements are met.

A thief using this ability who has the powerful sneak class feature deals an additional amount of sneak attack damage equal to half the number of sneak attack damage dice dealt. If the thief also has the deadly sneak class feature, this additional damage increases to the number of sneak attack damage dice dealt. If using duelist’s precision in combination with the focused strike class feature, the thief rolls triple her sneak attack damage dice and then chooses an amount of dice equal to twice her sneak attack dice as the sneak attack damage for the attack.

*Duelist Training:* The thief has received the training classically associated with a duelist. The thief gains [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nobility) as a class skill, and is proficient with one of the following dueling blades: dueling sword, estoc, foil, main gauche, rapier, or smallsword. Additionally, this weapon is always considered to be a light weapon for purposes of the Weapon Finesse feat.

*Ear To The Streets (Ex):* You’re connected to the streets, and to local information centers. You can use the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill to learn when any party uses that same skill to gather information, and what sorts of information that party sought. Attempting to learn such information requires 2d10 minutes of canvassing local hot spots and contacting your own informants. If the party you are attempting to research made a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill check to gather information in the same settlement within the past week, a DC 30 (for small towns or larger settlements) or 20 (for villages or smaller settlements) check produces a description of both the seeking party and the information they pursued. If that party made more than one attempt to gather information within the past week, the above DCs are reduced by half. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Eerie Disappearance (Ex):* As a full-round action, the thief can move up to her speed. If she successfully reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any creature observing her must attempt a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check opposed by the thief’s [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check. On a failed check, the observer loses track of the thief and fails to note where she moved to. The thief does not take a penalty on this [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check for moving up to her speed. At the end of her movement, the thief can attempt an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize all foes within 60 feet who were aware of her at any point during her movement and are unaware of her current location. She rolls the [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check only once and compares her result to the DC for each opponent. The thief must be at least 6th level to select this talent.

**Source:** Heroes of the Streets, pg. 26

*Endure Elements (Sp):* \[Survivalist] The thief gains *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]]* as a spell-like ability, as the spell of the same name. The thief’s caster level is the same as her thief level. She may use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every 4 full thief levels she possesses. A thief must have the hardy edge or survivalist talent before selecting this talent.

*Escape Route (Ex):* When you take the withdraw action, you may designate a single 5-foot square along your path for which you do not provoke an attack of opportunity for leaving. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Esoteric Scholar (Ex):* Once a day, a thief with this talent may attempt a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check, even when she is not trained in that [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill.

*Esoteric Scholar (Ex):* A thief with this talent adds three [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills of her choice to her list of class skills and she can make all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill checks untrained.

*Expert Leaper (Ex)*: When making jump checks, the thief is always considered to have a running start. Also, when the thief deliberately falls, a DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the first 10 feet.

*Expert Leaper (Ex):* When making [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks to jump, a thief with this talent is always considered to have a running start and adds her thief level to the check result. The thief can always make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check to soften a fall, even if the fall is not deliberate. When softening a fall, a DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check allows the thief to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the first 10 feet. For every 5 by which the thief exceeds the DC of this check, she can ignore an additional 10 feet of distance fallen. Even if a thief takes damage from a fall, she still lands on her feet if the result of the check to soften the fall equals or exceeds a DC of 15 + the falling damage dealt.

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*False Attacker (Ex):* Whenever the thief strikes a foe from hiding, she can attempt a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check as an immediate action (opposed by the target’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] or [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check, whichever has a higher bonus) before rolling damage to convince the foe that another creature was the attacker. This [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check applies the normal modifiers for convincing a creature of a falsehood, but can be accomplished with just physical trickery (a shared language is not required). If the [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] is successful, and the thief maintains concealment or cover, the thief’s stealth does not end.

**Source:** Heroes of the Streets, pg. 26

*Familiar (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains a familiar as the familiar option of the wizard’s arcane bond class feature. This ability functions exactly like that part of the class feature, and the thief’s effective wizard level is her thief level. The thief must have the major magic talent before selecting this talent.

*Fast Fingers (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this talent can roll two dice while making a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check. A thief can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 thief levels she possesses.

*Fast Getaway (Ex)*: After successfully making a sneak attack or [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check, a thief with this talent can spend a move action to take the withdraw action. She can move no more than her speed during this movement.

*Fast Picks (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can use the [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill to attempt to open a lock as a standard action instead of a full-round action.

*Fast Stealth (Ex)*: This ability allows a thief to move at full speed using the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill without penalty.

*Fast Stealth (Ex):* This ability allows a thief to move at full speed using the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill without penalty. At 10th level, a thief with this talent can use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill while charging or running with a –10 penalty.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 11

*Fast Tumble (Ex):* When a thief with this talent uses [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move at full speed through a threatened area or an enemy’s space without provoking an attack of opportunity, the DC of the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check only increases by 5, instead of 10. At 10th level, moving at full speed does not increase the DC for this type of [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 11

*Fearsome Strike\* (Ex):* \[Bandit] The thief can terrify an opponent with a single hit. A number of times per day equal to her Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken), when the thief confirms a critical hit and deals sneak attack damage to an opponent, she can choose to make the opponent [[Frightened|frightened]] for a number of rounds equal to her Int or Cha modifier (minimum 1). She cannot use this ability in conjunction with a critical feat. A thief must be 8th level to select this talent.

*Feather Fall (Su):* \[Ninja] As an immediate action, the thief can slow her descent as if using *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]*. This ability uses her thief level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Feign Death (Ex):* When you receive damage in combat, you may fall prone and feign your death as an immediate action. Make a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check opposed by the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks of any who witness your attempt. Creatures who do not succeed on the opposed check believe the attack to have killed you. Closer inspection is nearly impossible to fool; a DC 5 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check performed as a standard action reveals your act for what it is. If you take damage while feigning death, you must succeed on a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check with a DC equal to 15 + the damage dealt or give yourself away with an involuntary flinch or sound.

*Finesse Specialist (Ex):* A thief with this talent selects a type of weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse. When the thief makes a successful melee attack with this type of weapon, she can add her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an effect would affect how the thief’s Strength modifier would be added to the damage roll (such as attacking with an off-hand weapon while fighting with two weapons) then this also applies to the Dexterity modifier added to the damage roll. However, any effect that would increase the multiplier to the thief’s Strength bonus on damage rolls to more than 1 times her Strength bonus (such as wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands) does not affect her Dexterity bonus on damage rolls. A thief must have the Weapon Finesse feat before selecting this talent; she can select this talent multiple times.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 11

*Finesse Training (Ex):* When a thief with this talent makes a successful melee attack with a dueling blade, sap, short sword, sword cane, rapier, or any simple weapon, and this weapon can be used with Weapon Finesse then she can add her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an effect would affect how the thief’s Strength modifier would be added to the damage roll (such as attacking with an off-hand weapon while fighting with two weapons) then this also applies to the Dexterity modifier added to the damage roll. However, any effect that would increase the multiplier to the thief’s Strength bonus on damage rolls to more than 1 times her Strength bonus (such as wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon in two hands) does not affect her Dexterity bonus on damage rolls. A thief must have the Weapon Finesse feat before selecting this talent.

*Firearm Training (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] (firearms). (See *Ultimate Combat* for more information on firearms. Firearms, and firearm proficiency, may not be available in all campaigns. Talk to your GM before planning to take this talent.)

*Fleet Footed (Ex):* A thief with this talent receives a +10 feet bonus to her base movement speed. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the thief’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. If the thief gains the fast movement class feature from another class, the bonuses to her speed do not stack.

*Flowing Feint (Ex):* A thief with this talent who uses a standard action to move can combine that move with a feint. If she is able to feint as a move action (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can combine a move action to move with her feint. The thief also reduces one of the penalties by 4 when feinting against a non-humanoid creature or when feinting against a creature of animal intelligence. The thief only applies this penalty reduction once when feinting against a creature that is a non-humanoid with animal intelligence. At 10th level, the thief instead reduces both of these penalties by 4.

*Flurry of Stars (Ex):* \[Ninja] A thief with this ability can expend 1 ki point from her ki pool as a swift action before she makes a full-attack attack with shuriken.

A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Follow Clues (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can use [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] to follow tracks as per the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill.

*Forceful Opportunist (Ex):* You can make an additional attack of opportunity per round, and you gain a +1 bonus on all attacks of opportunity that you make with a light weapon, or with a ranged weapon if you also have the [[Snap Shot (Feat)|Snap Shot]] feat (see the Pathfinder® Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat ™ sourcebook for a description of that feat).

This talent has been renamed form *opportunist* to *forceful opportunist* to avoid duplication with the advanced rogue talent of the same name. (House Rule)

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 2

*Forgotten Talent (Ex):* \[Ninja] A thief with this ability can recall one talent she’s observed, or briefly studied, or had explained to her by her ancient masters. When she uses this ability, she selects one talent (not an advanced talent or grand talent) that she does not know and can use that talent for a number of rounds equal to her level. She must pay any ki costs associated with the talent as normal. Using this ability expends 2 ki point from her ki pool, plus the ki cost of the talent she chooses. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Getaway Artist (Ex):* A thief with this talent adds [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]], [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], and [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] to her list of class skills, and gains a +2 bonus on all driving checks. (See *Ultimate Combat* for more information on vehicles and driving checks.)

The thief may use [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] with any light or 1-handed melee weapon with the monk or performance quality, as well as the cutlass, flail, scimitar, and shortspear. A thief must have the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to select this talent

*Grit (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat and one grit feat of her choice. She must fulfill the prerequisites of the grit feat in order to choose it. A thief must have the firearm training talent before choosing this one.

*Ground Fighter (Ex):* A thief with this talent can stand up from prone as a move action or a swift action without provoking an attack of opportunity. She can stand up from prone as a free action but this provokes an attack of opportunity. However, the thief can avoid provoking this attack of opportunity by successfully using the Acrobatics skill as if she were moving through a threatened square at full speed.

*Gut Stab (Ex):* The thief adds +2 to damage dealt with light melee weapons. Additionally, the thief is treated as having taken the sneak attack feat for purposes of meeting the prerequisites of talents marked with an asterisk\*. As a standard action the thief may make a single melee attack made with a light melee weapon using the shank talent and add a single effect from a talent marked with an asterisk to it. The thief cannot use the same asterisk talent against a particular foe more than once in a 24-hour period. For any calculations the talent marked with an asterisk makes using the thief’s sneak attack dice, instead use the number of times the thief has taken the shank talent. A thief must have the shank talent before selecting this talent.

*Hampering Attack\* (Ex):* An opponent damaged by the thief’s sneak attack has its movement speeds halved (to a minimum of 5 feet) and it cannot take a 5-foot step.

These effects do not stack with themselves and last until the beginning of the thief’s next turn.

However, if the thief has already expended all her uses per day of this ability for specific creatures in the group, she rolls the two checks sequentially, using the first result for those specific creatures and using the better result for the rest of the group. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on Bluff checks and be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

Whenever the thief deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier. The number of points in the target’s ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Ki Charge (Su):* A thief with this talent can invest a portion of her ki into a single thrown weapon, such as a shuriken, and throw it as a standard action. The thrown weapon explodes on impact in a 5-foot burst, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage for every four levels of the thief above 2nd, to a maximum 4d6 at 18th level. Creatures caught in the blast receive a Reflex save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent it taken). If the thrown weapon hits a creature, that creature takes a –2 penalty on the saving throw. If the thrown weapon misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Ki Talent (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains a small ki pool. This ki pool is similar to that gained with the ki pool edge, but does not grant any extra attacks.

These ki points replenish at the start of each day. If she already has a ki pool, or gains a ki pool later, she gains half her Wisdom bonus (see above) (minimum 1) as bonus ki points to her ki pool. She can spend a ki point to gain a +10-foot bonus to movement until the end of her turn.

*Lasting Poison (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way that it is effective for two successful attacks instead of one.

*Lay Low (Ex):* Other creatures add +5 to the DC of [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) skill checks to gather information or learn of you, your activities, or your recent exploits or goals.

*Ledge Runner (Ex):* This ability allows a thief to move quickly on narrow, slippery, or uneven surfaces using the Acrobatics skill without the penalty for moving at full speed. In addition, the thief doesn’t lose her Dexterity bonus to AC when using Acrobatics to move on these surfaces or while climbing. A thief with this talent can use accelerated climbing to climb at half speed without penalty. She also can take a –10 penalty on a Climb check to move at full speed while climbing. When a thief with this talent attempts to catch herself while falling, she reduces the penalty to the Climb check by 10.

*Light Steps (Ex):* \[Ninja] The thief learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the thief ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger. A thief must be 4th level and have the no trace edge to select this talent.

*Master Poisoner (Ex):* \[Poisoner] The thief can use [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist’s lab and a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poison’s DC. If successful, the poison’s type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is ruined.

*Ninja Training:* \[Ninja] The thief has received the training classically associated with ninja. The thief gains [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nobility) as a class skill, and is proficient with the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi.

*Nose for Trouble (Ex)* \[Lookout]: At 8th level, the thief's sense of danger is so sharply-honed that he can sense trouble from around the corner, inside the next room, or across the hall. As a full-round action, the thief can make an active [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to search a 15-foot radius area centered on a single point in space to which the thief has a line of sight. The DC for this [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check is not modified by distance or closed doors, though the DC is affected normally by more enduring barriers (like walls). If the check succeeds against the DC of any danger (such as a trap or a hidden creature) and the thief has a line of sight to that danger, the thief may detect or identify the danger normally. If the thief has no line of sight to the threat, he simply becomes aware that some unspecified danger lurks within the area.

When a thief uses this ability but discerns no apparent danger (whether or not any such danger exists), his confidence in his uncanny nose for trouble is [[Shaken|shaken]], and the thief loses the ability to use this class feature for 1 hour.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 13

*Opportunist (Ex):* The thief can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 13

*Quick Disguise (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can use the items at hand and seemingly innocuous material hidden on her person to create startlingly effective disguises, reducing the amount of time it takes to create a disguise using the [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill.

The time needed for the thief to alter her appearance in this manner is based on the complexity of the disguise, as noted on the following table. The times are cumulative, so if a female thief wants to disguise herself as a male of a different race, that takes 2 minutes.

A thief with both quick disguise and sudden disguise takes half the listed time to don a disguise.


| **Disguise** | **Time** |
|---|---|
| Minor details only | 1 full-round action |
| Disguise as a different gender | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different race | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different age category | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different size category | 1 minute |

*Quick Trapsmith (Ex)*: As a full-round action, a thief with this talent can set a simple trap with a CR no greater than 1/2 her thief level.

The type of trap that can be constructed in this way is subject to GM discretion.

*Quicker than the Eye (Ex):* A thief with this talent can retrieve non-bulky easy-to-reach items, such as potions, scrolls, or alchemical items, as easily as she can draw a light or one-handed weapon. This allows her to combine drawing such an item with a charge or regular move. If a thief with this talent also has the Two Weapon Fighting feat, then when drawing weapons, she can instead draw one such item and a light or one-handed weapon, or draw two such items. If a thief with this talent also has the Quick Draw feat, she can draw a hidden item or hidden weapon as a swift action and she can draw alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands as a free action, allowing her to throw alchemical items at her full rate of attacks. When attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of a standard action, the thief reduces the penalty by 10. In all these cases, drawing these items or weapons doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 13

*Rapid Scrutiny (Ex):* The thief can search a creature, object, or area more quickly than normal. If her Perception check would normally require a full-round action or less, she may make it one step shorter along the following progression: full-round action, standard action, move action, swift action, immediate action. This decrease has no effect on Perception checks that are attempted as free actions or Perception checks that don’t require an action. The thief can always take 10 on Perception checks, even if even if this is not normally allowed.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 13

*Rapid Swipe:* A thief who selects this talent gains Quick Steal as a bonus feat. She doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites for this feat. A thief must have the Improved Steal feat and be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 13

*Resiliency (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this ability can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the thief’s level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can only be performed when she is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent her from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the thief’s hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, she falls [[Unconscious|unconscious]] and is [[Dying|dying]] as normal.

*River Rat (Ex):* You do not take an armor check penalty on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks while wearing light armor. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks made to hide in murky water. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Rogue Crawl (Ex)*: While prone, a thief with this ability can move at half speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A thief with this talent can take a 5-foot step while crawling.

*Rogue’s Agility (Ex):* Any Dodge bonus to your Armor class may be applied to your [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] skill checks.

You gain a +1 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill checks. Additionally, the penalties to skill checks imparted by the [[Shaken|shaken]] and [[Sickened|sickened]] conditions, and any similar penalties imparted by extraordinary (Ex) effects or conditions that apply a penalty to skill checks, do not apply to any [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill checks that you make. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Sea Legs (Ex):* \[Pirate] The thief gains the Sea Legs feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

*Seamless Facade (Ex):* When disguising herself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, a thief with this talent reduces each of the penalties by –2. For example, if a female thief disguises herself as a male two age categories older than herself, she would take a –2 to the check instead of a –6. She also reduces the amount of time it takes to create a disguise. The time needed for the thief to alter her appearance in this manner is based on the complexity of the disguise, as noted on the following table. The times are cumulative, so if the thief wants to disguise herself as a male of a different race, this takes 2 minutes.

**Table: Disguise Functions and Time**


| Disguise | Time |
|---|---|
| Minor details only | full-round action |
| Disguise as a different gender | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different race | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different age category | 1 minute |
| Disguise as a different size category | 1 minute |

*Shank (Ex):* The thief has learned the brutal, straightforward assault fighting common to prisons and gaol cells. When all the attack rolls the thief makes in a round are with light melee weapons, the thief treats her base attack bonus as if it was 1 higher. Thus a 7th level thief with the shank talent has a +6/+1 attack progressing if she only uses daggers to attack for one round. 

Because the attacks made with the shank talent are quick, forceful, and simple, it is not possible to add precision damage (such as sneak attack dice) to any attack made using this talent.

This talent may be taken multiple times, but the thief’s effective base attack bonus with light melee weapons may never exceed her thief level.

*Shadow Clone (Su):* \[Ninja] The thief can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her true location. This ability functions as *[[Mirror Image (Spell)|mirror image]]*, using the thief’s level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Shrewd Engineer (Ex):* You’re a breaking and entering expert. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) skill checks. Additionally, the penalties to skill checks imparted by the [[Shaken|shaken]] and [[Sickened|sickened]] conditions, and any similar penalties imparted by extraordinary (Ex) effects or conditions that apply a penalty to skill checks, do not apply to [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) skill checks that you make.

*Silencing Attack\* (Ex):* When a thief with this talent deals sneak attack damage, the target is rendered mute for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the thief’s level + the higher of the thief’s Strength or Dexterity modifier). A mute creature cannot speak, use language-dependent effects, use verbal spell components, or use command words. A thief must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 14

*Skirmisher (Ex):* Whenever a thief with this talent moves at least 10 feet in a round and makes an attack action, she deals sneak attack damage as if the target was denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. If the thief makes more than one attack this turn, this talent applies only to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. A thief must have the waylaying charge talent before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 14

*Slow Metabolism (Ex):* \[Ninja] The thief has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the thief is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison’s frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of “1/round for 6 rounds” would instead be “1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.”

*Slow Reactions\* (Ex)*: Opponents damaged by the thief’s sneak attack can’t make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Slow Reactions\* (Ex):* Opponents damaged by the thief’s sneak attack can’t make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.

*Smoke Bomb (Ex):* \[Ninja] This ability allows a thief to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from a smokestick. The thief can center this smoke on herself, or throw the bomb as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. Using this ability is a standard action. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Snap Shot (Ex)*: A thief with this talent may treat her intitiative roll as a 20 for a surprise round, regardless of her initiative, but she may only take an attack action with a ranged weapon. Her normal initiative roll is used in subsequent rounds. If two or more thiefs possess this talent, their initiative determines the order in which they act, but they all go before any other creature. If a thief is prevented from acting in the surprise round, this talent has no effect. 

*Snatch Arrows:* \[Ninja] A thief who selects this talent gains the [[Snatch Arrows (Feat)|Snatch Arrows]] feat as a bonus feat. The thief must have the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat and the [[Deflect Arrows (Feat)|Deflect Arrows]] feat before taking this talent.

*Sneak Attack (Ex):* If a thief with this talent catches an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The thief’s attack deals extra damage (called “precision damage”) anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the thief flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 this first time this talent is selected, and increases by 1d6 every additional time the talent is selected. Should the thief score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a thief can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.

The thief must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A thief cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.

This talent may be taken more than once, adding 1d6 to the thief’s sneak attack each time it is selected. However, a thief’s total sneak attack can never exceed half her thief level (rounding up).

*Sneak Attack Spree\* (Ex):* When you deal sneak attack damage to an opponent, you may choose to deal an additional amount of damage equal to the number of sneak attacks you have successfully hit that opponent with in the same round. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Sneak Stab (Ex):* \[Knife Master] A thief focuses her ability to deal sneak attack damage with daggers and similar weapons to such a degree that she can deal more sneak attack damage with those weapons at the expense of sneak attacks with other weapons. When she makes a sneak attack with a dagger, kerambit, kukri, punching daggers, starknife, or swordbreaker dagger, she uses d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s. For sneak attacks with all other weapons, she uses d4s instead of d6s. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Sniper’s Eye (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can apply her sneak attack damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that benefit from concealment. Foes with total concealment are still immune.

*Sniper’s Eye (Ex):* When a thief with this talent makes a ranged against an opponent that is threatened by at least two allies, the thief gains flanking bonuses for the ranged attack as if she were flanking the enemy in melee and deals sneak attack damage with the attack if her target is within her sneak attack range. Creatures with improved uncanny dodge are immune to this, unless the thief making the ranged attack has enough thief levels to be able to flank the target in melee. When making ranged sneak attacks, the thief gains a +1 circumstance bonus on each sneak attack damage die. This circumstance bonus stacks with the circumstance bonus from the deadly range talent. The thief must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 14

*Sow Dissent (Su)* \[Wormtongue]: At 8th level, the thief gains the ability to radiate a subtle, supernatural aura of strife and dissent. This 30-foot aura is centered on the thief and causes creatures within the aura to take a -4 penalty on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill checks as each affected creature within the area finds their arguments ineffectual and their meanings undermined by the wormtongue’s discreet magic. Activating this ability is a standard action but requires no sign or gesture and is impossible to detect without magical means. The thief can renew this effect as a free action each round, and can maintain the aura for a number of rounds per day equal to half his class level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Once per day, the thief may dismiss the aura as a standard action in order to use *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his class level. The DC to identify this spell-like ability with a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill check is 25.

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Spring Up (Ex):* A thief with this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity for standing up while threatened by a foe. A thief must be 4th level and have the stand up talent to select this talent.

*Stand Up (Ex)*: A thief with this ability can stand up from a prone position as a free action. This still provokes attacks of opportunity for standing up while threatened by a foe.

*Stealthy Sniper (Ex):* When a thief with this talent acts in the surprise round she may treat her initiative roll as a 20 for the surprise round, regardless of her actual initiative roll, but can only make an attack with a ranged weapon. Her normal initiative roll is used in subsequent rounds. When a thief with this talent uses the Stealth skill to snipe, she reduces the penalty on the Stealth check by 5. At 10th level, she reduces this penalty by 10.

*Strong Impression*: A thief who selects this talent gains [[Intimidating Prowess (Feat)|Intimidating Prowess]] as a bonus feat.

*Strong Stroke (Ex):* A thief with this talent rolls twice when making [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks and takes the better result. If she already rolls twice while making a [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the thief is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks.

*Strong Swimmer (Ex):* A thief with this talent rolls twice while making Swim checks and takes the better result. Even if the thief fails a Swim check, she is not considered off-balance in the water and doesn’t lose her Dexterity bonus to AC. She can also hold her breath for twice as long before she risks drowning.

*Sudden Disguise (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action, a thief can change her appearance for 1 minute per level. (Double this duration if the thief has both quick disguise and sudden disguise.) This ability functions as *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]*. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Superlative Stealth (Ex):* Upon gaining this ability, a thief with this talent selects two of the following senses: blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. The thief must select blindsense before selecting blindsight. A creature using the chosen senses can’t automatically detect the thief, and must succeed at Perception checks as normal to do so. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on Stealth checks and be at least 8th level before selecting this talent. A thief can take this talent up to two times, each time choosing two different senses.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 15

*Swinging Reposition (Ex):* \[Pirate] The thief can incorporate a ship’s masts, rigging, ropes, sails, and other such structures into her combat style. Provided she is wearing light armor, when fighting in an environment where such structures exist, the thief incorporates them into her [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks by grabbing hold of the structure and swinging toward her opponent, making either a charge or a bull rush maneuver. Once she completes her attack or maneuver, she can reposition herself. Immediately after making the charge or bull rush, she can move 5 feet as a free action, even if the charge ends her turn. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

*Takes One To Know One (Ex):* You can use the [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill in place of the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill when attempting to discern a lie (but not in place of any other application of the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill).

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Terrain Mastery (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains a favored terrain as the ranger ability of the same name, though the favored terrain ability does not increase with her level as the ranger’s ability does. A thief can take this ability multiple times, each time applying it to a new terrain, and granting all other favored terrains a +2 increase to the favored terrain bonus.

*Thieves’ Honor (Ex):* You adhere to a code of honor, similar to a cavalier’s edicts. You must never steal from a creature that is less wealthy than you are. You must seek to practice your skills with a minimum of slaughter – a true artist has no need of clumsy killing. You must accept any honest and sincere surrender. You must hold to your word when you give it, and you must never betray a friend. 

As long as you adhere to these edicts, you gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks. If you willingly violate any of your edicts, you lose the benefits of this talent for 1 week.

*Trap Master (Ex):* \[Trapsmith] Whenever the thief disarms a trap using [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires. A thief must be 8th level and have the trap sense edge and careful disarm talent to take this talent.

*Trap Spotter (Ex)*: Whenever a thief with this talent comes within 10 feet of a trap, she receives an immediate [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM.

*Tumbling Descent (Ex):* \[Roof Runner] The thief can use her [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill to attempt a rapid descent from a rooftop or another surface, ricocheting against another surface and then diving through an opening (such as a balcony or window) directly below. So long as she has at least two surfaces no farther than 10 feet apart to bounce against, she can ricochet her body back from one to the next, descending great distances with a single check.

A thief can only use the underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Int or Cha modifier (selected when the talent is taken, minimum 0 times/day).

*Undetected Sabotage (Ex):* \[Ninja] Whenever a thief with this talent uses [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to sabotage or disable a device, she can make a special [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check with a bonus equal to her level. Anyone who inspects the device does not notice the sabotage and assumes the object works unless he beats the thief’s check with an opposed [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check.

*Unseeing Acumen (Ex):* A thief who selects this talent gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. Additionally, if a thief with this talent is blind or in darkness, she reduces the penalties on Strengthand Dexterity-based skills by 2 and doesn’t take a penalty on opposed Perception checks.

*Urban Predator (Ex)* \[Urban Stalker]: An thief treats urban environments as a favored terrain (as the ranger ability of the same name, though this favored terrain ability does not increase with his level as the ranger’s ability does). Instead, treat this ability as one instance of the terrain mastery rogue talent for the purposes of determining how or when the bonuses granted by the thief’s urban favored terrain are increased (see the *Ultimate Combat* sourcebook for a description of the terrain mastery rogue talent).

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogue Archetypes (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Vanishing Trick (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action, the thief can disappear for 1 round per level. This ability functions as the *[[Invisibility (Ring)|invisibility]]* spell. Using this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the *ki pool* edge) before selecting this talent.

*Ventriloquism (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action, the thief can throw her voice as if using the spell *[[Ventriloquism (Spell)|ventriloquism]]*. She can use this ability for 1 minute per thief level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from the ki pool edge) before selecting this talent.

*Wall Climber (Su):* A thief with this ability gains a climb speed of 20 feet, but only on vertical surfaces. This ability cannot be used to scale perfectly smooth surfaces or to climb on the underside of horizontal surfaces.

*Wall Scramble (Ex):* A thief with this talent rolls twice when making [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks and takes the better of the two rolls. If she already rolls twice while making a [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the thief is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks.

*Waylaying Charge (Ex):* Whenever a thief with this talent makes a charge, her attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target was denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. If the thief makes more than one attack this turn, this talent applies only to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 15

*Weapon Snatcher (Ex):* A thief with this talent can use Sleight of Hand bonus instead of her CMB when attempting to disarm an opponent. If she gains bonuses on disarm combat maneuver checks from feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, these are added to her Sleight of Hand bonus when using the disarm maneuver. The thief also applies any penalties she has on her attack roll to this check. However, if the thief is unarmed when using this ability, she doesn’t take the –4 penalty for making a disarm maneuver while unarmed. When using this ability as part of a full attack, the thief takes a penalty on the check equal to the difference between base attack bonus of the attack being used for the disarm maneuver and her highest base attack bonus. For example, a thief with a BAB of +6/+1 who uses this talent to make a disarm maneuver with her secondary attack (the one with +1 BAB) takes a –5 penalty on the disarm maneuver. If the thief has a free hand after successfully disarming an opponent, she may gain the disarmed item or weapon. This attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The thief must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.

*Web of Lies (Ex)* \[Wormtongue]: The thief adds half his class level on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill checks made to tell a lie. If a magical effect is used against the thief that would detect his lies or force him to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 10 + the thief’s class level to succeed. Failure means that the effect does not detect his lies or force the thief to speak only the truth.

*Without A Trace (Ex):* When you travel stealthily, you can cover your tracks. Your [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill check, if higher than the usual DC, sets the DC of [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill checks made to follow your tracks. Additionally, if you have the no trace class feature, you may double the bonus on opposed [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill checks granted by that ability.

## Advanced Talents
**Advanced Talents**

At 10th level, and every thief level thereafter, a thief can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a thief talent. Advanced talents otherwise follow the rules for talents.

*Adaptive Assailant (Ex):* Once per round, a thief with this talent can declare her space and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both of these to determine whether she or allies are flanking an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this purpose. The thief must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 8

*Another Day (Ex)*: Once per day, when the thief would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. If the movement takes her out of the reach of the attack, she takes no damage from the attack. The thief is [[Staggered|staggered]] for 1 round on her next turn.

*Angel of Death (Su):* \[Assassin] The thief becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the thief makes a successful assassinate attack, she can cause the target’s body to crumble to dust. This prevents *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* and *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* (although *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* works as normal). The thief must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the assassinate, this ability is wasted with no effect. A thief must be 15th level and have the assassinate advanced talent to select this advanced talent.

*Artful Dodger (Ex):* You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. Dodge bonuses stack. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Assassinate\* (Ex):* \[Ninja] A thief with this talent can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the thief must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the thief makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the thief as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). If the save is successful, the target still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but it is immune to that thief’s assassinate ability for 1 day. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this advanced talent.

*Blinding Bomb (Ex):* \[Ninja] Whenever the thief throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the cloud must make a Fortitude save or be [[Blinded|blinded]] by the black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). This talent cannot be combined with a choking bomb, but the thief can combine a blinding bomb with a poison bomb. The thief must have the choking bomb talent before selecting this talent.

*Blindsense (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains blindsense to a range of 30 feet. A thief must have the [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]] feat and be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 9

*Blindsight (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains blindsight to a range of 60 feet. A thief must have blindsense to a range of at least 30 feet and be at least 12th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Caltrop Splash (Ex):* You can throw a bag of caltrops as though it was a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The bag of caltrops deals 1 point of piercing damage on a direct hit, and 1 point of piercing splash damage. If your attack is successful, choose one space occupied by the target of the direct hit. That space is covered with scattered caltrops. A rogue must have the caltrop master rogue talent before selecting this talent. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Confounding Blades\* (Ex):* When a thief with this advanced talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that deals sneak attack damage, her target cannot make attacks of opportunity until the beginning of the thief’s next turn. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this advanced talent.

*Consummate Avoidance (Ex):* When a thief with this talent is targeted by a melee or ranged attack, she can spend an immediate action to make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check. She can use the result as her AC or touch AC against that attack, but she must be aware of the attack and not denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] and be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Crippling Strike\* (Ex)*: A thief with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Crippling Strike\* (Ex):* A thief with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the thief. The thief must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 10

*Danger Sense (Sp):* You can gain the benefits of a *[[Foresight (Spell)|foresight]]* spell for one round per day. Using this ability requires no action, and you may use this talent even when it is not your turn. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your class level. This ability cannot be used to affect another creature. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Daring Acrobatics (Ex):* Whenever an opponent at least one size category larger than you misses you with a melee attack, you may make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill check to attempt a feat of combat acrobatics as an immediate action. The DC of the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check is equal to the opponent’s CMD. If successful, you may move to any space within that opponent’s reach, by swinging or vaulting from the haft of your opponent’s weapon, scrambling up your opponent’s arm and leaping from their shoulders, or by way of some similar acrobatic maneuver.

*Deadly Cocktail (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can apply two doses of poison to a weapon at once. These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisons’ frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time.

*Deadly Shuriken (Ex):* \[Ninja] As a full-round action, a thief with this advanced talent can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shuriken throw. When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the thief increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]*) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus –5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0).

*Deadly Sneak\* (Ex)*: Whenever a thief with this talent uses the powerful sneak thief talent, she treats all 1s and 2s on the sneak attack damage dice as 3s. A thief must have the powerful sneak and sneak attack thief talents before choosing this talent.

*Defensive Roll (Ex)*: With this advanced talent, the thief can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the thief can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the thief must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can’t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the thief’s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

*Dispelling Attack\* (Su)*: Opponents that are dealt sneak attack damage by a thief with this ability are affected by a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, targeting the lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level for this ability is equal to the thief’s level. A thief must have the major magic thief talent before choosing dispelling attack. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Dispelling Attack\* (Su):* Opponents that are dealt sneak attack damage by a thief with this ability are affected by a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. The thief can choose to target the highest level spell effect active on the target or the lowest. The thief can also name a specific spell effect affecting the opponent to be targeted if she desires (see *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*). If the thief uses this ability on a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by a *summon monster* spell), she also makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature. The caster level for dispelling attack is equal to the thief’s level. At 16th level, a thief can dispel two spells, similar to a targeted *[[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]*, either starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells or vice versa, decided by the thief. A thief must have the major magic thief talent and be at least 10th level before selecting dispelling attack.

*Entanglement of Blades\* (Ex)*: When a thief with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the target cannot take a 5-foot step until the beginning of the thief’s next turn. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

*Eviscerating Attack\* (Ex):* When a thief with this talent damages an opponent with one of her sneak attacks, the opponent takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage, decided by the thief. At 16th level, this ability bleed damage increases to 2 points. A thief must have the bleeding attack talent and be at least 12th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 11

*Familiar (Ex):* A thief with this advanced talent gains a familiar as the familiar option of the wizard’s arcane bond class feature. This ability functions exactly like that part of the class feature, but the thief’s effective wizard level is her thief level –4. The thief must have the *minor magic* and *major magic* talents before she can choose this advanced talent.

*Fast Tumble (Ex)*: When a thief with this advanced talent uses [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move at full speed through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity, the DC of the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check does not increase by 10.

*Feat:* \[Ninja] The thief may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place of an advanced talent.

*Feat:* A thief may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place of a thief talent. A thief can select this talent multiple times. The thief must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 11

*Improved Evasion (Ex)*: This works like evasion, except that while the thief still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless thief does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. A thief must have the evasion edge to select improved evasion.

*Frugal Trapsmith (Ex)*: When a thief with this talent constructs a mechanical trap, she only pays 75% of the normal cost.

*Getaway Master (Ex):* A thief with this talent gains a +10 bonus on all drive checks. The thief must have the getaway artist talent before choosing this advanced talent.

*Ghost Step (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action, a thief with this talent can pass through walls as if she were a ghost. Until the end of her turn, she can pass through a wall or other surface that is up to 5 feet thick per level as if she were incorporeal. She must exit the solid material by the end of her turn. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.

*Hard to Fool (Ex):* A thief with this advanced talent is hard to fool with mind-affecting effects. At the start of her turn, if she is still subject to any mind-affecting spells or effects, she can make a Will saving throw with a standard DC for the effect’s level, and if she succeeds at the check, she is no longer subject to the mind-affecting effect. She can make this saving throw even against mind-affecting effects that normally don’t allow a saving throw. In those cases, generate the saving throw as if the spell or effect did allow a saving throw.

*Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):* A thief with this advanced talent can select a single terrain from the ranger’s favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain, and while within that terrain, she can use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to hide, even while being observed. A thief may take this advanced talent more than once, each time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain list.

*Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):* A thief with this talent is a master of disappearance. She can use the Stealth skill to hide even while being observed. The thief must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on Stealth checks and be at least 12th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 12

*Hunter’s Surprise (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this talent can designate a single enemy she is adjacent to as her prey. Until the end of her next turn, she can add her sneak attack damage to all attacks made against her prey, even if she is not flanking it or it is not [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]. A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this advanced talent.

*Instant Poison (Ex)*: A thief with this talent can apply poison to a weapon as a swift action, instead of a standard action. A thief must have the swift poison talent and poison use edge to select this advanced talent.

*Invisible Blade (Su):* \[Ninja] Whenever a thief uses the vanishing trick talent, she is treated as if she were under the effects of the *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]* spell. The thief must have the vanishing trick talent before selecting this talent.

*Knock-Out Blow (Ex)*: Once per day, the thief can forgo her sneak attack damage to attempt to knock out an opponent. She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that triggers when the thief deals sneak attack damage), the target falls [[Unconscious|unconscious]] for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this effect to [[Staggered|staggered]] for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when the advanced talent is taken). A thief must have the sneak attack talent to select this advanced talent.

*Master of Disguise (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this talent gains a +10 bonus on a single [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check.

*Master of Poisons (Ex):* The save DC of any poison the thief uses is increased by +2. This has no effect on the DC of poisons the thief possesses if someone else uses them.

*Mystic Disguise (Su):* \[Ninja] A thief with this talent can take on the appearance of other creatures and individuals. Whenever the thief uses the sudden disguise talent, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level. Alternatively, the thief can use the sudden disguise talent to take on the appearance of a specific individual that the thief has seen before for 1 minute per level. Creatures that are familiar with the individual receive a Will saving throw to see through the illusion. The DC of this saving throw is 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when the advanced talent is taken). This illusion also changes the thief’s speech, if she has heard the individual talk and can speak his language. The thief must have the sudden disguise talent before selecting this talent.

*Opportunist (Ex)*: Once per round, the thief can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round. Even a thief with the [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]] feat can’t use the opportunist ability more than once per round.

*Redirect Attack (Ex)*: Once per day, when a thief with this talent is hit with a melee attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with a free action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the attack that hit the thief, and the creature that made the attack against the thief must make a new attack roll against the new target.

*Rumormonger (Ex):* A thief with this advanced talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumor’s subject to take hold.


| **Community Size** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Small town | 18 |
| Large town | 20 |
| Small city | 25 |
| Large city | 30 |
| Metropolis | 35 |

*See the Unseen (Su):* \[Ninja] As a swift action a thief with this talent learns how to see that which cannot be seen. This acts as the *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* spell, using her thief level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.

*Shadow Split (Su):* \[Ninja] This talent allows the thief to create an illusory double of herself that moves away from her, allowing the thief to create a distraction. When she uses this ability, an illusory double appears and moves away from the thief, heading in one direction. The double climbs walls, jumps pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice the thief’s speed in the direction indicated by the thief when the ability is used. Its course cannot be changed. The double persists for 1 round per level of the thief. Those who interact with the double receive a Will saving throw to recognize that it is fake. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the thief’s level + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. The thief must possess a ki pool (such as from taking the ki pool edge) and the shadow clone talent before selecting this talent.

*Skill Excellence:* A thief with this talent who has at least 10 ranks in a skill may take 10 when making a check using this skill even if this is not normally allowed. The thief must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

**Source:** Legendary Rogues (Legendary Games), pg. 14

*Skill Mastery*: The thief becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A thief may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.

*Slippery Mind (Ex)*: This ability represents the thief’s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a thief with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

*Slippery Mind (Ex):* A thief with this talent can wriggle free from that which would otherwise control or compel her. If the thief is affected by a mind-affecting spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again at the start of her next turn at the same DC. This ability only gives the thief one extra chance from to succeed on her saving throw against each mind-affecting effect. At 15th level, the restriction of only one extra chance no longer applies. Instead, at the start of the thief’s turn, if she is still subject to any mind-affecting spells or effects, she can make a Will saving throw with a standard DC for the effect’s level, and if she succeeds at the save, she is no longer subject to the mind-affecting effect. She can even make this saving throw against mind-affecting effects that normally don’t allow a saving throw. In those cases, generate the saving throw DC as if the spell or effect did allow a saving throw. The thief must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.

*Sly Blade\* (Ex):* When you use a light piercing or slashing weapon to deal damage with an attack of opportunity, you may add your sneak attack damage to the damage roll.

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Sneak Attack Assault (Ex):* Whenever you are hidden from one or more opponents at the start of your turn, you may apply your sneak attack damage to each attack that you make against those opponents on your turn, even if you reveal your presence to one or more of your opponents by attacking them. At the end of any turn in which you use this talent, you are revealed, and you may not use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to snipe in the same round that you use this talent. 

**Source:** Class Acts: Rogues (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

*Stealthy Sniper (Ex)*: When a thief with this talent uses the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to snipe, she only suffers a –10 penalty on the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check, instead of –20.

*Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex)*: Once per day, a thief with this talent can reroll a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]], [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], or [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check to try to gain new or better information from the roll. This reroll can be made any time during the same day as the original check.

*True Death (Su):* \[Assassin] Anyone slain by the thief’s assassinate ability becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the thief’s level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* is 10 + the thief’s level. A thief must have the assassinate advanced talent to take this advanced talent.

*Unarmed Combat Mastery:* \[Ninja] A thief who selects this advanced talent deals damage with her unarmed strikes as if she were a monk of her thief level –4. If the thief has levels in monk, this ability stacks with monk levels to determine how much damage she can do with her unarmed strikes. A thief must have the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat before taking this talent.

*Unbound Steps (Su):* \[Ninja] This talent allows a thief to use her ki to walk through the air. Whenever the thief uses the light steps talent, she can walk on air, rising or descending as she desires. She must end her move on a solid surface. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point. A thief must have a ki pool (such as from taking the ki pool edge) and have the light steps talent to select this advanced talent.

*Unwitting Ally (Ex):* A thief with this advanced talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of the thief’s next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and see the thief, and the thief must succeed at a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check opposed by the opponent’s [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]]. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check succeeds, the thief cannot use this advanced talent again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the thief fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours.

*Weapon Snatcher (Ex):* A thief with this talent can make a [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check in place of a combat maneuver check when attempting to disarm an opponent.

## Grand Talent
**Grand Talent**

At 20th level a thief may select one of the following grand talents. A thief may select a talent or advanced talent in place of a grand talent, if that is preferred. Grand talents otherwise follow the rules for talents. 

*Hidden Master (Su):* \[Ninja] The thief becomes a true master of the art of ninjitsu. She can, as a standard action, cast *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]* on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even *[[Invisibility Purge (Spell)|invisibility purge]]*, *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]*, and *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* can reveal her. She uses her thief level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the thief deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1. A thief must have selected the ki pool edge and sneak attack talent to select this grant talent.

*Master Expert (Ex):* The thief has become a master of applying her skills under any circumstances. The thief receives a +4 bonus to any skill check when she takes 10, and a +6 bonus to any skill checks when she takes 20. Additionally, she receives a number of bonus skill dice each day equal to half her thief level. These are d6s she may roll and add to a skill check’s total. If she chooses to do this before the success or failure of a skill check she may add as many of her remaining bonus skill dice as she wishes. After a skill check’s success or failure is revealed she may immediately choose to add a single bonus skill die, and if its additional value raised her check enough to count as a success, her skill check is successful. A thief must have the skill mastery advanced talent to select master expert.

*Master Strike (Ex):* The thief becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the thief deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects:

The target can be...

- put to sleep for 1d4 hours
- [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 2d6 rounds, or
- slain

Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + sneak attack dice + the thief’s Int or Cha modifier (selected when this talent is taken). Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that thief’s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability. A thief must have selected the sneak attack talent to select this talent.

## Character Themes
**Save Vs. Wall of Text**

Because it includes well more than 175 edges, talents, advanced talents, and grand talents, getting through the talented thief class write-up can be daunting. Once a character has been written up its easy to look any selected edges and talents if they are presented alphabetically, but when thinking about what talent to take next the abilities can form a nigh-impenetrable “wall of text.”

To help with this issue we’ve categorized all the edges and talents into the following themes and sub themes, based on common thief character concepts: Defensive (general and saving throws), Flexible Customization, Magic/Mysticism, Movement, Offensive (general and sneak attack), Traps, and Skills (with several sub-categories for specific skills). Each talent gives its name and notes if it is an edge, advanced talent, or grand talent. This allows a GM or player looking for a new option to see which edges and talents are most likely to match his desired character concept without reading through the entire list of options.
