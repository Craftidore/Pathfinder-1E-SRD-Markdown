# Without A Trace
## Overview
*Without A Trace (Ex):* When you travel stealthily, you can cover your tracks. Your [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill check, if higher than the usual DC, sets the DC of [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill checks made to follow your tracks. Additionally, if you have the no trace class feature, you may double the bonus on opposed [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill checks granted by that ability.
