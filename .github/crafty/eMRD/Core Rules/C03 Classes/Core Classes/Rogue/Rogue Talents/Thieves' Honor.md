# Thieves' Honor
## Overview
*Thieves’ Honor (Ex):* You adhere to a code of honor, similar to a cavalier’s edicts. You must never steal from a creature that is less wealthy than you are. You must seek to practice your skills with a minimum of slaughter – a true artist has no need of clumsy killing. You must accept any honest and sincere surrender. You must hold to your word when you give it, and you must never betray a friend. 

As long as you adhere to these edicts, you gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks. If you willingly violate any of your edicts, you lose the benefits of this talent for 1 week.
