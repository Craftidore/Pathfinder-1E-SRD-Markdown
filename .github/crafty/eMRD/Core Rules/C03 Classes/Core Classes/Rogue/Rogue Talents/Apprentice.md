# Apprentice
## Overview
*Apprentice (Ex):* [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] are class skills for you. You must spend 1 hour each day studying under the tutelage of a willing ally who possesses at least as many Hit Die as you do, and who also possesses at least as many ranks in each of those skills as you have Hit Dice. If you do not spend the requisite time studying, you lose the benefits of this talent, including the +3 bonus for having one or more ranks in a trained class skill, and may not regain the use of this talent again until you do. A rogue must have the [[Minor Magic|minor magic]] rogue talent before selecting this talent.
