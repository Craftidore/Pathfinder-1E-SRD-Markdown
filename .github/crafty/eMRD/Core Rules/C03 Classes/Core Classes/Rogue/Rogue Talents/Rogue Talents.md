# Rogue Talents
## Overview
**Rogue Talents**: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.

| **Talent** | **Prerequisite(s)** | **Benefit** | **Source** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expert Scrounger | — | Make a Gather Information (Diplomancy) check to find a buyer/seller for a high value item | Streets of Zobeck (Open Design) 25 |

Looking at rogue talents in the Core Rulebook, their power level is about half a feat on average. However, given that a few of these talents ([[Weapon Training|weapon training]] for example) are actually feats, choosing a talent which is worth less than a feat feels like a downgrade. Several other classes have selectable class features gained every second level, such as alchemist discoveries, barbarian rage powers, and the talents of investigators or slayers, that are roughly worth a feat so rogue talents need an upgrade. 

There are a variety of factors to consider when upgrading these talents. Firstly, there are normally only two categories of talent, a normal rogue talent and an advanced rogue talent. This means that normal talents have to measure in power against other abilities gained at 2nd level because this is the soonest a rogue can take one. The same with advanced talents and 10th level. Removing this two tier breakdown and replacing it with a minimum level requirement for each talent allows for more gradation in each talent. It also means a PC can’t just take two rogue levels and cherry pick talents with the Extra Rogue Talent feat. 

Sometimes the easiest solution is to take two existing related talents and combine them, for example, the [[Rogue Crawl|rogue crawl]] and [[Stand Up|stand up]] talents both relate to fighting while prone, combining these into the new talent named ground fighter is a simple improvement. 

There are some existing talents that allow the reroll of a skill check a number of times per day. The daily limit on these is a major limitation that is a little gamist. A rogue that is great at the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill doesn’t suddenly run out of acrobatic greatness after using the skill a certain number of times in a day. Rolling a check twice and taking the better result is a seemingly strong ability, but only increases the average die result by 3.3, which is actually a similar amount to the investigator inspiration ability to add a d6 to a d20 roll. 

Talents that provide a bonus or reduce a penalty with a particular skill are useful but some of the existing talents need a little something. Take the fast stealth talent, it removes the –5 penalty for using [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] while moving at full speed. This is the same as a +5 bonus which only applies under certain circumstances. The [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] feat gives a +3 bonus on all checks with a certain skill, but this increases to a +6 bonus at 10th level making fast stealth strictly worse than the feat at 10th level. So fast stealth is reasonable at 1st level through 9th but needs a boost at 10th level and above. 

There are several talents listed below that let a rogue gain a bonus feat, the main reason for these is to allow rogues to avoid the prerequisites for these feats. After all, if a ranger or monk can ignore the prerequisites for their bonus feats, rogues should be able to do the same for feats that are particularly rogue-like, especially those involving dirty tricks, feinting, and steal combat maneuvers. 

Lastly, if another class has a similar ability, rogues shouldn’t get a worse version of that ability, especially if it is something particularly ‘roguish’. For example, both rogues and alchemists have abilities relating to poisons. There is an existing rogue talent called lasting poison and there is an alchemist discovery called sticky poison, which both allow a poisoned weapon to remain effective for more than one hit. The rogue version is weaker, it gives a +2 bonus on saves against the poison, whereas the poison remains at full strength in alchemist version. Improving the rogue version stops rogue players feeling like they are getting second-rate abilities, especially in a situation where those abilities are their only abilities; they can’t make up for them by resorting to extracts, mutagens, and other magical tricks. 

There are plenty of new talents listed below. Hopefully this will make rogue players really look forward to their next rogue talent and seriously consider taking the Extra Rogue Talent feat to squeeze in another talent or two.
