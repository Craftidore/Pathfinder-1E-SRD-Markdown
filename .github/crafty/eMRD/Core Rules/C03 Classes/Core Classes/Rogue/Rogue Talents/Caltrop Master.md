# Caltrop Master
## Overview
*Caltrop Master (Ex):* You have learned to strew a bag of caltrops with strategic precision. Caltrops that you scatter gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, and the [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check DC to treat injuries from caltrops that you scatter is increased by +2. Magical healing relieves the injuries without the need for a skill check, as usual.
