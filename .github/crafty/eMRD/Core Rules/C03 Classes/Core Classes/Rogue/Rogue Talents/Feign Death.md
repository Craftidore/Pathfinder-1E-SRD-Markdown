# Feign Death
## Overview
*Feign Death (Ex):* When you receive damage in combat, you may fall prone and feign your death as an immediate action. Make a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check opposed by the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks of any who witness your attempt. Creatures who do not succeed on the opposed check believe the attack to have killed you. Closer inspection is nearly impossible to fool; a DC 5 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check performed as a standard action reveals your act for what it is. If you take damage while feigning death, you must succeed on a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check with a DC equal to 15 + the damage dealt or give yourself away with an involuntary flinch or sound.
