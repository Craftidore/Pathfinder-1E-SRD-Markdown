# Arcane Appraiser
## Overview
*Arcane Appraiser (Su):* If you successfully use the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] skill to determine that an object has magical properties, you gain information about the itemâ€™s properties as though you were using *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*, and as if your [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] check were a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check instead.
