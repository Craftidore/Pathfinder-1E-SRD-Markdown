# Dramatic Entrance
## Overview
*Dramatic Entrance (Ex):* When you intentionally reveal yourself to opponents who were previously unaware of you, you can make yourself known in a dramatically theatrical way. You may attempt a DC 25 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] skill check. If your check is successful, opponents that witness your dramatic entrance take a -4 penalty on the first initiative check they make within the next minute. 

If you are flying or wearing a disguise when you reveal yourself, you may make a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] or [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill check instead. If you execute your dramatic entrance by way of an especially theatrical deed, such as by crashing through a window or by employing smoke and pyrotechnics, you gain a +4 bonus on the skill check (subject to GM approval).
