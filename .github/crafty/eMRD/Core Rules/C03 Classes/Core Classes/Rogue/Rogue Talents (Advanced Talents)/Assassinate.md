# Assassinate
## Overview
*Assassinate\* (Ex):* A rogue with this talent can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the rogue must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the rogue makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the rogue as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the higher of the rogue’s Strength or Dexterity modifier. If the save is successful, the target still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but it is immune to that rogue’s assassinate ability for 1 day. The rogue must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.
