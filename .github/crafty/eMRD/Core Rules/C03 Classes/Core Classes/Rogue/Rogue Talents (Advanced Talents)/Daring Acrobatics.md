# Daring Acrobatics
## Overview
*Daring Acrobatics (Ex):* Whenever an opponent at least one size category larger than you misses you with a melee attack, you may make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill check to attempt a feat of combat acrobatics as an immediate action. The DC of the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check is equal to the opponent’s CMD. If successful, you may move to any space within that opponent’s reach, by swinging or vaulting from the haft of your opponent’s weapon, scrambling up your opponent’s arm and leaping from their shoulders, or by way of some similar acrobatic maneuver.
