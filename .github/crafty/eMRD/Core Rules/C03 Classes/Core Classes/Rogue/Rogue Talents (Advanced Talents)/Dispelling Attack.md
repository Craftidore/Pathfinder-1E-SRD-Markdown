# Dispelling Attack
## Overview
*Dispelling Attack\* (Su):* Opponents that are dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability are affected by a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**,* targeting the lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue’s level. A rogue must have the [[Major Magic|major magic]] rogue talent before choosing dispelling attack.

*Dispelling Attack\* (Su):* Opponents that are dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability are affected by a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. The rogue can choose to target the highest level spell effect active on the target or the lowest. The rogue can also name a specific spell effect affecting the opponent to be targeted if she desires (see *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*). If the rogue uses this ability on a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by a summon monster spell), she also makes a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature. The caster level for dispelling attack is equal to the rogue’s level. At 16th level, a rogue can dispel two spells, similar to a targeted *[[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]*, either starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells or vice versa, decided by the rogue. A rogue must have the [[Major Magic|major magic]] rogue talent and be at least 10th level before selecting dispelling attack.
