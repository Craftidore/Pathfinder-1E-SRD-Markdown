# Consummate Avoidance
## Overview
*Consummate Avoidance (Ex):* When a rogue with this talent is targeted by a melee or ranged attack, she can spend an immediate action to make an [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check. She can use the result as her AC or touch AC against that attack, but she must be aware of the attack and not denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. The rogue must have a feat or skill specialty that grants a bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] and be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.
