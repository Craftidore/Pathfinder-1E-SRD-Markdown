# Adaptive Assailant
## Overview
*Adaptive Assailant (Ex):* Once per round, a rogue with this talent can declare her space and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing her to use one or both of these to determine whether she or allies are flanking an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this purpose. The rogue must be at least 10th level before selecting this talent.
