# Caltrop Splash
## Overview
*Caltrop Splash (Ex):* You can throw a bag of caltrops as though it was a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The bag of caltrops deals 1 point of piercing damage on a direct hit, and 1 point of piercing splash damage. If your attack is successful, choose one space occupied by the target of the direct hit. That space is covered with scattered caltrops. A rogue must have the [[Caltrop Master|caltrop master]] rogue talent before selecting this talent.
