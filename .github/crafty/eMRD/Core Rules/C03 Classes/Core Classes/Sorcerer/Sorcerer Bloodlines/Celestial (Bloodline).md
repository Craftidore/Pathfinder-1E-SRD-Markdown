# Celestial (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Celestial**

Your bloodline is blessed by a celestial power, either from a celestial ancestor or through divine intervention. Although this power drives you along the path of good, your fate (and alignment) is your own to determine.

**Class Skill**: [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]].

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Bless (Spell)|bless]]* (3rd), *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]* (5th), *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]* (7th), *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* (9th), *[[Flame Strike (Spell)|flame strike]]* (11th), *[[Dispel Magic, Greater (Spell)|greater dispel magic]]* (13th), *[[Banishment (Spell)|banishment]]* (15th), *[[Sunburst (Spell)|sunburst]]* (17th), *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]], [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Mounted Combat (Feat)|Mounted Combat]], [[Ride-By Attack (Feat)|Ride-By Attack]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[religion]), [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the summoning subschool, the creatures summoned gain DR/evil equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any DR the creature might have.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your celestial heritage grants you a great many powers, but they come at a price. The lords of the higher planes are watching you and your actions closely.

*Heavenly Fire (Sp)*: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. Against evil creatures, this ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. This damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. This ray heals good creatures of 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. A good creature cannot benefit from your heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are neither harmed nor healed by this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Celestial Resistances (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and resist cold 5. At 9th level, your resistances increase to 10. 

*Wings of Heaven (Su)*: At 9th level, you can sprout feathery wings and f ly for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level, with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.

*Conviction (Su)*: At 15th level, you can reroll any one ability check, attack roll, skill check, or saving throw you just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. You can use this ability once per day.

*Ascension (Su)*: At 20th level, you become infused with the power of the heavens. You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. You also gain resist electricity 10, resist fire 10, and a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison. Finally, you gain unlimited use of the wings of heaven ability. Finally, you gain the ability to speak with any creature that has a language (as per the *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]* spell).
