# Elemental (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Elemental**

The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can hardly control its fury. This influence comes from an elemental outsider in your family history or a time when you or your relatives were exposed to a powerful elemental force.

**Class Skill**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes).

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]*\* (3rd), *[[Scorching Ray (Spell)|scorching ray]]*\* (5th), *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]* (7th), *[[Elemental Body I (Spell)|elemental body I]]* (9th), *[[Elemental Body II (Spell)|elemental body II]]* (11th), *[[Elemental Body III (Spell)|elemental body III]]* (13th), *[[Elemental Body IV (Spell)|elemental body IV]]* (15th), *[[Summon Monster VIII (Spell)|summon monster VIII]]* (elementals only) (17th), *[[Elemental Swarm (Spell)|elemental swarm]]* (19th).

\*These spells always deal a type of damage determined by your element. In addition, the subtype of these spells changes to match the energy type of your element.

**Bonus Feats**: [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]], [[Great Fortitude (Feat)|Great Fortitude]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]], [[Lightning Reflexes (Feat)|Lightning Reflexes]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[planes]), [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to match the type of your bloodline. This also changes the spellâ€™s type to match the type of your bloodline.

**Bloodline Powers**: One of the four elements infuses your being, and you can draw upon its power in times of need. At first level, you must select one of the four elements: air, earth, fire, or water. This choice cannot be changed. A number of your abilities grant resistances and deal damage based on your element, as noted below.


| **Element** | **Energy Type** | **Elemental Movement** |
|---|---|---|
| Air | Electricity | Fly 60 feet (average) |
| Earth | Acid | Burrow 30 feet |
| Fire | Fire | +30 feet base speed |
| Water | Cold | Swim 60 feet |

*Elemental Ray (Sp)*: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of damage of your energy type + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Elemental Resistance (Ex)*: At 3rd level, you gain energy resistance 10 against your energy type. At 9th level, your energy resistance increases to 20.

*Elemental Blast (Sp)*: At 9th level, you can unleash a blast of elemental power once per day. This 20-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of damage of your energy type per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Reflex save for half damage. Creatures that fail their saves gain vulnerability to your energy type until the end of your next turn. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This power has a range of 60 feet.

*Elemental Movement (Su)*: At 15th level, you gain a special movement type or bonus. This ability is based on your chosen element, as indicated on the above chart.

*Elemental Body (Su)*: At 20th level, elemental power surges through your body. You gain immunity to sneak attacks, critical hits, and damage from your energy type.
