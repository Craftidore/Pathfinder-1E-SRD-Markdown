# Aberrant (Bloodline)
## Overview
**Aberrant**

There is a taint in your blood, one that is alien and bizarre. You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle that most would not expect. Over time, this taint manifests itself in your physical form.

**Class Skill**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering).

**Bonus Spells**: *[[Enlarge Person (Spell)|enlarge person]]* (3rd), *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* (5th), *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]* (7th), *[[Black Tentacles (Spell)|black tentacles]]* (9th), *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]* (11th), *[[Veil (Spell)|veil]]* (13th), *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* (15th), *[[Mind Blank (Spell)|mind blank]]* (17th), *[[Shapechange (Spell)|shapechange]]* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [[Combat Casting (Feat)|Combat Casting]], [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]], [[Improved Grapple (Feat)|Improved Grapple]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]], [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]], [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[dungeoneering]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool, increase the duration of the spell by 50% (minimum 1 round). This bonus does not stack with the increase granted by the [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]] feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Aberrant sorcerers show increasing signs of their tainted heritage as they increase in level, although they are only visible when used.

*Acidic Ray (Sp)*: Starting at 1st level, you can fire an acidic ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

*Long Limbs (Ex)*: At 3rd level, your reach increases by 5 feet whenever you are making a melee touch attack. This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 15 feet.

*Unusual Anatomy (Ex)*: At 9th level, your anatomy changes, giving you a 25% chance to ignore any critical hit or sneak attack scored against you. This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.

*Alien Resistance (Su)*: At 15th level, you gain spell resistance equal to your sorcerer level + 10.

*Aberrant Form (Ex)*: At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and damage reduction 5/â€”.
