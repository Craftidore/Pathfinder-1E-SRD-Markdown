**Granted Powers**: In strange and eldritch runes you find potent magic. You gain [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] as a bonus feat.

- *Blast Rune (Sp)*: As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any creature entering this square takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, decided when you create the rune. The rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to your cleric level or until discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered with a DC 26 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill check and disarmed with a DC 26 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Spell Rune (Sp)*: At 8th level, you can attach another spell that you cast to one of your blast runes, causing that spell to affect the creature that triggers the rune, in addition to the damage. This spell must be of at least one level lower than the highest-level cleric spell you can cast and it must target one or more creatures. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it only affects the creature that triggers the rune.
