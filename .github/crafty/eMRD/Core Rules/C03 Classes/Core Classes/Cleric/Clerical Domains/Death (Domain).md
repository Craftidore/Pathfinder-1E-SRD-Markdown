**Granted Powers**: You can cause the living to bleed at a touch, and find comfort in the presence of the dead.

- *Bleeding Touch (Sp)*: As a melee touch attack, you can cause a living creature to take 1d6 points of damage per round. This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum 1) or until stopped with a DC 15 [[Heal (Spell)|Heal]] check or any spell or effect that heals damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Deathâ€™s Embrace (Ex)*: At 8th level, you heal damage instead of taking damage from channeled negative energy. If the channeled negative energy targets undead, you heal hit points just like undead in the area.
