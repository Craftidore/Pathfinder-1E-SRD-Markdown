**Granted Powers:** You can repair damage to objects, animate objects with life, and create objects from nothing.

- *Artificerâ€™s Touch (Sp):* You can cast *[[Mending (Spell)|mending]]* at will, using your cleric level as the caster level to repair damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to objects and construct creatures by striking them with a melee touch attack. Objects and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two cleric levels you possess. This attack bypasses an amount of damage reduction and hardness equal to your cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
