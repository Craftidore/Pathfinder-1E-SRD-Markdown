# Glory (Domain)
## Overview
| **Deities:** | *Asgardian:* |  |
|---|---|---|
| | *Eberron:* |  |
| | *Golarion:* | [[Gorum]], Iomedae, Sarenrae |
| | *Greyhawk:* | [[Ayailla]], [[Heironeous]], [[Pelor]] |
| | *Kalamar:* |  |
| | *Krynn:* |  |
| | *Olympian:* |  |
| | *Other:* |  |
| | *Pharaonic:* | Re-Horakhty |
| | *Toril:* |  |

**Granted Powers**: You are infused with the glory of the divine, and are a true foe of the undead. In addition, when you channel positive energy to harm undead creatures, the save DC to halve the damage is increased by 2.

- *Touch of Glory (Sp)*: You can cause your hand to shimmer with divine radiance, allowing you to touch a creature as a standard action and give it a bonus equal to your cleric level on a single Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check. This ability lasts for 1 hour or until the creature touched elects to apply the bonus to a roll. You can use this ability to grant the bonus a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Divine Presence (Su)*: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within this aura are treated as if under the effects of a *[[Sanctuary (Spell)|sanctuary]]* spell with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier.

These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a standard action. If an ally leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect ends for that ally. If you make an attack, the effect ends for you and your allies.
