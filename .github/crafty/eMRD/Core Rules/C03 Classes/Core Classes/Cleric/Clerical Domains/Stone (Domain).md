**Granted Powers:** You can generate a *stone ward*, a spell-like ability to grant yourself or someone you touch damage reduction 5/— against attacks from stone weapons, creatures (such as earth elementals, gargoyles, clay golems, and stone golems), or spell effects, or against damage from falling onto earth or stone.
