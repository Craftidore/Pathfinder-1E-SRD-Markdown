**Granted Powers:** You are a true student of all things mystical, and see divinity in the purity of magic.

- *Hand of the Acolyte (Su)*: You can cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe before instantly returning. As a standard action, you can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (damage still relies on Strength). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Dispelling Touch (Sp)*: At 8th level, you can use a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* effect as a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four cleric levels beyond 8th.
