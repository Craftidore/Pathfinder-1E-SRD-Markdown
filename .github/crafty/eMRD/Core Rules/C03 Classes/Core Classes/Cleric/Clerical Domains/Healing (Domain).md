## Overview

|---|---|---|
| | *Eberron:* | Olladra |
| | *Golarion:* | Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae |
| | *Greyhawk:* | [[Pelor]] |

**Granted Powers**: Your touch staves off pain and death, and your healing magic is particularly vital and potent.

- *Rebuke Death (Sp)*: You can touch a living creature as a standard action, healing it for 1d4 points of damage plus 1 for every two cleric levels you possess. You can only use this ability on a creature that is below 0 hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Healer’s Blessing (Su)*: At 6th level, all of your cure spells are treated as if they were empowered, increasing the amount of damage healed by half (+50%). This does not apply to damage dealt to undead with a cure spell. This does not stack with the [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]] metamagic feat.
