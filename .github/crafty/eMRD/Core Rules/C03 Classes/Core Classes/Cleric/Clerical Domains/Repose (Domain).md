# Repose (Domain)
## Overview
| **Deities:** | *Asgardian:* |  |
|---|---|---|
| | *Eberron:* |  |
| | *Golarion:* | Pharasma |
| | *Greyhawk:* | Aluvan, Dracanish |
| | *Kalamar:* |  |
| | *Krynn:* |  |
| | *Olympian:* |  |
| | *Other:* |  |
| | *Pharaonic:* | [[Anubis (Deity)\|Anubis]], Osiris |
| | *Toril:* |  |

**Granted Powers**: You see death not as something to be feared, but as a final rest and reward for a life well spent. The taint of undeath is a mockery of what you hold dear.

- *Gentle Rest (Sp)*: Your touch can fill a creature with lethargy, causing a living creature to become [[Staggered|staggered]] for 1 round as a melee touch attack. If you touch a [[Staggered|staggered]] living creature, that creature falls asleep for 1 round instead. Undead creatures touched are [[Staggered|staggered]] for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Ward Against Death (Su)*: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that wards against death for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Living creatures in this area are immune to all death effects, energy drain, and effects that cause negative levels. This ward does not remove negative levels that a creature has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while the creature is inside the warded area. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
