# Spellbooks
## Overview
Each spellbook or formula book is a unique reflection of the personality and capabilities of its creator. Many of these tomes contain more than just spells, such as notes on the caster’s other research, personal diaries, naturalist sketches, or even political treatises. Some contain preparation rituals, each of which grants a boon—or sometimes a hindrance—to spellcasters who use the book to prepare their spells.

The sample spellbooks and formula books below each list a description of the book, information on the caster’s specialty school and oppositional schools (if any), the book’s spells, and its preparation ritual (if any). Some books also contain precautions against prying eyes.

Descriptions, protections, preparation rituals, and spell content can be mixed and matched as desired from different books. Higher-level books can easily serve for lower-level casters—just drop the spell levels that aren’t applicable and remove lower-level spells as desired. Similarly, if you desire longer books, combine two together or add spells or formulae of your choice to the desired levels. These books also work as spellbooks and formula books for new characters. Just copy the list, hand it to the player, and go.

A standard spellbook includes all cantrips from the *Core Rulebook* except those in the wizard’s oppositional schools. Books containing cantrips from additional sources are noted in the content description. 

Each book features a value, which represents what a character must pay for the book on the open market, though finding a seller may be difficult. The character may sell the book for half that value. Any book with a preparation ritual has two sets of costs, one for the book without the preparation ritual, and one for the book with the ritual.

**Arcane Magical Writings**

To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses the system in his own way. Another person’s magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until he takes time to study and decipher it.

To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in another’s spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 20 + the spell’s level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell automatically deciphers magical writing without a skill check. If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also automatic.

Once a character deciphers a particular piece of magical writing, he does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing is a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, he can attempt to use the scroll.

**Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks**

A wizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell he already knows and has recorded in his own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, the wizard must decipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster’s book is deciphered, the reader must make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 15 + spell’s level) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, the wizard can prepare the spell. He must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times he has prepared it before.

If the check fails, he cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until the next day. However, as explained above, he does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.

**Adding Spells to a Wizard’s Spellbook**

Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. A wizard can only learn new spells that belong to the wizard spell lists.

**Spells Gained at a New Level**: Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast. If he has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, one of the two free spells must be from his specialty school.

**Spells Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll**: A wizard can also add a spell to his book whenever he encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings). Next, he must spend 1 hour studying the spell. At the end of the hour, he must make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 15 + spell’s level). A wizard who has specialized in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus on the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check if the new spell is from his specialty school. If the check succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy it into his spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook). The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.

If the check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the spell. He cannot attempt to learn or copy that spell again until he gains another rank in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]. If the spell was from a scroll, a failed [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check does not cause the spell to vanish.

In most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to half the cost to write the spell into a spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook). Rare and unique spells might cost significantly more.

**ADDING SPELLS TO YOUR SPELLBOOK DURING DOWNTIME**

If you’re a magus or wizard, you can spend 1 day of downtime to copy up to eight spells from other sources into your spellbook (see Spells Copied from Another’s Spellbook or a Scroll on page 219 of the *Core Rulebook*). If you’re an alchemist, you can use this option to add new formulae to your formula book. If you’re a witch, you can use this option to add spells to your familiar. You may spend Magic toward the cost of copying spells.

**Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook**

Once a wizard understands a new spell, he can record it into his spellbook.

**Time**: The process takes 1 hour per spell level. Cantrips (0 levels spells) take 30 minutes to record.

**Space in the Spellbook**: A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level. Even a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has 100 pages.

**Materials and Costs**: The cost for writing a new spell into a spellbook depends on the level of the spell, as noted on the following table. Note that a wizard does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for spells he gains for free at each new level.


| **Spell** | **Writing** | **Spell** | **Writing** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level** | **Cost** | **Level** | **Cost** |
| 0 | 5 gp | 5 | 250 gp |
| 1 | 10 gp | 6 | 360 gp |
| 2 | 40 gp | 7 | 490 gp |
| 3 | 90 gp | 8 | 640 gp |
| 4 | 160 gp | 9 | 810 gp |

**Replacing and Copying Spellbooks**

A wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If he already has a particular spell prepared, he can write it directly into a new book at the same cost required to write a spell into a spellbook. The process wipes the prepared spell from his mind, just as casting it would. If he does not have the spell prepared, he can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.

Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The time requirement and cost per page are halved.

**Selling a Spellbook**

Captured spellbooks can be sold for an amount equal to half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the spells within.

### Using Preparation Rituals
**Using Preparation Rituals**

When a spellcaster who prepares spells uses a spellbook or formula book with a preparation ritual, as long as he prepares at least three spells (not including cantrips) or formulae from the spellbooks, he gains a temporary boon granted by the ritual. The boon lasts until its effect is spent (as specified by the boon description) or the spellcaster prepares spells again (at which time it can be reapplied by preparing at least three spells from the book). A spellcaster can only take the effect of one preparation ritual when she prepares spells, no matter how many spellbooks with preparation rituals she uses to prepare spells. A superscript “<sup>S</sup>” (S) indicates a spell from the caster’s specialty school, whereas a superscript “<sup>OP</sup>” (OP) indicates a spell from the spellbook creator’s opposition school.

Although most folks think of them as thick, heavy tomes of parchment or vellum pages bound with ornate covers and heavy locks, a wizard’s spellbooks can take almost any form. A spellbook can be made from belts of linked metal plates that serve as pages, scribed on thin sheets of ivory, or disguised by magic to look like a shield, gaming board, lute, or almost any other mundane item of equivalent size.

Whatever their appearance, spellbooks are generally classified in two groups—arcanabula and grimoires. Arcanabula, or workbooks, are a wizard’s everyday working tomes. They tend to contain spells jumbled in any order, interspersed with annotations and notes of magical lore, and are often stained and battered from travel and use in the field.

Grimoires, sometimes called greatbooks, are formal, ordered collections of spells. Greatbooks tend to be locked, guarded, and hidden, either in a secure cache or in a wizard’s abode. Most are composed with gilded ornamentation or inks, and they might even have plates of polished ivory or platinum within them, engraved or stamped with arcane writings. They are usually large and often of unusual proportions (such as very tall for their width), and many have metal-bound corners (ornate protective caps) and chased or relief-carved covers.

### Using Spellbooks
**USING SPELLBOOKS**

Every wizard possesses a personal set of notations, formulas, scripts, and ciphers for recording the workings of a spell. While the underlying language and concepts are the same, no wizard can simply pick up another’s spellbook and instantly prepare spells from the foreign tome. Whenever an attempt is made to understand another wizard’s spellbook (including forgotten tomes discovered in ruined towers or traveling workbooks seized from the hoards of enemies), the reader must employ *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* or succeed on a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 20 + spell level) to identify a particular spell (and its general purpose, if the spell is one not known to the reader). Until a wizard deciphers a spell in a foreign book, its magic is useless.

Wizards can prepare spells from a foreign spellbook or copy spells from a foreign spellbook into their own as described in Arcane Magical Writings, page 178 of the *Player’s Handbook*. Two special circumstances, discussed below, are worth noting.

**Masters and Apprentices:** Wizards who take on apprentices usually teach them many of the same notations and codes they themselves have perfected. A wizard attempting to decipher, prepare, or copy a spell from the spellbook of a master (or apprentice) gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check.

**Mastering a Foreign Spellbook:** Instead of laboriously copying each spell of interest from a found spellbook into his own, a wizard might instead make a dedicated effort to master the spellbook’s particular ciphers and notations. This procedure is sometimes referred to as becoming attuned to the spellbook (although it’s a matter of time and study, not a mystical process). Mastering a spellbook requires a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 25 + the level of the highest-level spell in the book) and takes one week plus one day per spell contained within. If the wizard succeeds, he can use the foreign spellbook as his own, requiring no further [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks to prepare or copy spells from it. If he fails, he cannot attempt to master that spellbook again until he gains at least 1 more rank in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]].

### Spellbook Construction
**SPELLBOOK CONSTRUCTION**

Aside from ornamentation and spurious false writings, all spellbooks require one page per spell level (minimum one page) to record any particular spell. The pages of most spellbooks have been treated for durability and protection against fire, mold, water, parasites, staining, and other hazards. These procedures make even a blank spellbook relatively expensive.

The base cost of 15 gp buys a well-bound leather volume of 100 parchment pages, a style also typically used for other high-quality books such as the genealogies of noble families or the master copies of sages’ published writings. Exotic materials increase the cost and weight of a spellbook accordingly, and these materials are usually reserved for grimoires, not arcanabula.

**Table 5–1: Spellbooks**


| **Cover** | **Weight** | **Hardness** | **Hit Points** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Leather | 1 lb. | 2 | +0 | 5 gp |
| Wood, thin | 1 lb. | 3 | +1 | 20 gp |
| Metal, soft | 5 lb. | 5 | +4 | 100 gp |
| Metal, hard | 5 lb. | 7 | +5 | 200 gp |
| Dragonhide | 2 lb. | 4 | +2 | 200 gp |
| Slipcase | +1 lb. | +1 | +1 | +20 gp |
| |  |  |  |  |
| **Pages (100)** | **Weight** | **Hardness** | **Hit Points** | **Cost** |
| Parchment | 2 lb. | +0 | 1 | 10 gp |
| Paper, linen | 2 lb. | +0 | 2 | 20 gp |
| Vellum | 2 lb. | +0 | 3 | 50 gp |
| Bone or ivory | 4 lb. | +0 | 4 | 100 gp |
| Metal foil | 20 lb. | +1 | 8 | 500 gp |

The weight, hardness, hit points, and cost of a spellbook of unusual construction is the sum of its cover and page construction. For example, a book made with a steel plate cover (hard metal) and copper foil pages weighs 25 pounds, has hardness 8, 13 hit points, and costs 700 gold pieces.

All fine books can be purchased with a waterproof double slipcase of chased and tooled leather, strong enough to protect against driving rain or burial in snow but not against prolonged immersion. Special physical treatments (such as baths in secret herbal tinctures and alchemical solutions designed to retard fire and mold damage) are included in the above costs.

### Protecting Spellbooks
**PROTECTING SPELLBOOKS**

Any wizard with the means to do so will carefully safeguard her spellbooks against accident, battle damage, or theft. Most arcanabula feature cheap and inexpensive protections (often a simple *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]]* or *[[Fire Trap (Spell)|fire trap]]*), but for most wizards, the risk of losing a workbook isn’t enough to justify the expense of high-level protection.

Grimoires, on the other hand, are generally stored in the most secret hiding places (sometimes even on other planes) and equipped with mechanical traps, loyal guardians, and deadly spells of defense. The protections applied to a greatbook can take virtually any form, from magically sustained poisonous spiders or snakes, to bladders of paralyzing or sleep-inducing gases, to scything blades or poisoned needles concealed in the locks, lids, or frames of the coffers and cabinets the books are hidden in. These traps are never of a design or nature that might endanger the book, but otherwise are almost limitless in the kinds of damage they can inflict on the uninvited.

Magical protections can add thousands of gold pieces to the cost of even the simplest tome. Some of the most common spellbook defenses include the following.

**Resistant to Energy (Minor):** The book has resistance 5 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic attacks. 

Moderate abjuration; CL 6th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]]*; Price +1,000 gp.

**Resistant to Energy (Major):** The book has resistance 12 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic attacks.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]*; Price +3,000 gp.

**Glamered:** The book looks and feels like something else of similar size (no more than 25% larger or smaller in any dimension) and weight (between half as heavy and twice as heavy as the original). Upon command, the book switches between its normal and its glamered appearance, but anyone who touches the book in glamered form can make a DC 14 Will save to disbelieve the illusion.

Moderate illusion; CL 6th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Major Image (Spell)|major image]]*; Price +2,000 gp.

**Pungent:** The book is infused with an acrid essence that repels damaging pests. Any creature that touches the book without first speaking a command word must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or become [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1d4+1 rounds.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Stinking Cloud (Spell)|stinking cloud]]*; Price +2,000 gp.

**Levitating:** The book hovers in the air at whatever point it is placed, much like an *[[Immovable|immovable rod]]* (though the book can support only its own weight).

Moderate transmutation; CL 6th; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]*; Price +2,000 gp.

**Waterproof:** The book is impervious to damage caused by immersion in or exposure to water.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]]*; Price +1,000 gp.

**Spelltrapped:** A magic trap has been incorporated into the book (for example, a *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]* spell that strikes anyone handling the book except its owner). The trap can be set to operate when the book is touched, when it is opened, or when a particular page is read. Any spell appropriate for a trap may be used (see Sample Traps, page 70 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, for suggestions and pricing).

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pgs. 140-141

**Spells for Spellbooks**

*[[Awaken Tome (Spell)|awaken tome]]*

*[[Scrivener's Chant (Spell)|scrivener's chant]]*

*[[Secluded Grimoire (Spell)|secluded grimoire]]* 

*[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*

*[[Spellbook Protection (Spell)|spellbook protection]]*

*[[Spellbook Protection, Greater (Spell)|greater spellbook protection]]*

### Bonded Book
The primary power of the [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira Adherent]] wizard archetype is the bonded book.

**Bonded Book (Sp):** A [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]] forms a bond with a spellbook. This bonded book becomes intrinsically tied to a [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]]’s conscious and subconscious mind. The book always opens to the right page, and she can record any number of spells and other information in her bonded book—when she turns pages, more blank pages appear. Other wizards find it difficult to read the book, which displays information in a seemingly random order: the DC of all [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks to copy or prepare spells from the book increases by 10. 

Each time a [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]] attains a new wizard level, she gains four spells (rather than two) to add to the bonded book. The cost and time requirement for writing a new spell into the book are halved. The time to prepare spells is reduced to one third (20 minutes to prepare all spells, and 5 minutes to prepare up to one quarter of her spells). Once per day while holding the book in one hand, she can use it to cast any one spell she has written in the bonded book, even if the spell is not prepared. 

A [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]] can replace a lost or destroyed bonded book in the same manner as a bonded item (*Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* 78). The new bonded book retains a number of spells per spell level equal to the [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]]’s Intelligence modifier from the previous bonded book, as well as all the mundane information that was recorded in the previous bonded book. If a [[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira adherent]] replaces her bonded book or dies, the previous book reverts to an ordinary blank spellbook. 

This replaces arcane bond.
