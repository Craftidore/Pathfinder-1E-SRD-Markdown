# Alchemical Affinity
## Overview
**Alchemical Affinity** 

Having studied alongside alchemists, you’ve learned to use their methodologies to enhance your spellcraft.

**Prerequisite:** Wizard 5

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a spell that appears on both the wizard and alchemist spell lists, you treat your caster level as 1 higher than normal and the save DC of such spells increases by 1. Additionally, you may copy spells from an alchemist’s formula book into your spellbook just as you could with another wizard’s spellbook.
