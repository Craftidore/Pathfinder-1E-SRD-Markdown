# Undying
## Overview
**Undying**

**Prerequisite:** You must be at least a 20th-level wizard to select this discovery.

**Benefit:** You have performed rituals that blend the power of *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]], [[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]],* and *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]].* If you are killed, your body (or anything that remains of it) is teleported to a safe location of your choosing (treat this as a *greater teleport*), and you are brought back to life as if *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* had been cast on you. Each time this ability is used, you must renew it with a ritual that takes 1 hour and costs 25,000 gp.

Once a day when you prepare your spells, you may set a delay on this ability, so it only functions if you remain dead for a predesignated period of time (such as only if you remain dead for 1 minute, or only if you remain dead for 8 hours). You may also change the location you are teleported to once a day when you prepare your spells.
