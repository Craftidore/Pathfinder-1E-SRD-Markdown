# Creative Destruction
## Overview
**Creative Destruction (Su)**

You have learned how to use destructive energy to empower yourself. When you cast an evocation spell that deals damage, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total number of dice used to determine the damage caused by the spell. Temporary hit points gained from this discovery do not stack and disappear after 1 hour.
