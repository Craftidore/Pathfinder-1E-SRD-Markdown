# Faith Magic
## Overview
**Faith Magic**

Select one spell granted by a domain belonging to the god you worship. This spell must be at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wizard spell you can cast. When you first prepare your spells for the day, you can prepare this spell once, using a spell slot 1 level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level. This is cast as a divine spell.
