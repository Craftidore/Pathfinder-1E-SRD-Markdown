# Lingering Divination
## Overview
**Lingering Divination**

You can put the divination magic you create to multiple uses.

**Benefit:** When you cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, as a swift action you may also gain the benefits of *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* for 3 rounds. It takes no time to use this effect to study an area or subject, but the rounds of study gained with this ability do not stack with rounds of study through an actual casting of the *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell.
