# Bonded Mask
## Overview
**Bonded Mask**

Your devotion to the Forgotten Pharaoh enables you to select a mask—typically an Osirian funerary mask—as your bonded item. The mask must be worn to have effect, and occupies the head slot. In addition, the mask shields you from notice. While wearing your bonded mask, efforts to use the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill to gather information about you take a –1 penalty, and you gain a +1 competence bonus on all saving throws against scrying and mind-reading effects that allow saving throws.
