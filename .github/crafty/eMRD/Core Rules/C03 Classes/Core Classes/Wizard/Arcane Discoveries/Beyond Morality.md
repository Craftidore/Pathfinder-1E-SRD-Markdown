# Beyond Morality
## Overview
**Beyond Morality (Su)**

As long as you are neutral, you may choose to be treated as the most favorable alignment when affected by spells whose effects vary based on alignment (such as *[[Holy Word (Spell)|holy word]]*). If you are neutral in relation to evil and good, you may choose to be treated as good or evil. If you are neutral in relation to chaos and law, you may choose to be treated as lawful or chaotic. You may only choose to be treated as one alignment type along a single axis at a time (for instance, if you were within the area of both a *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]* spell and an *[[Unholy Blight (Spell)|unholy blight]]* spell, you would have to choose to be either evil, good, or neutral for the purpose of determining the spellsâ€™ effects). You must be at least an 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.
