# Spell Cunning
## Overview
**Spell Cunning**

You can use different spellcasting techniques when circumstances require it.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can change what components you fulfill to cast a spell. For example, when casting spell with only verbal components, you may choose to instead cast it using only somatic components. You may do this a number of times per day equal to half your caster level.

The total number of components a spell requires are not changed by using this ability, only which components you must meet in order to cast it. Thus you can ignore the verbal, somatic or material component of a spell by adding another such component. You cannot replace a material spell component that has a gp cost. You can replace a spell focus, but only with a material component that has a cost equal to 1/50th the gp cost of the focus.

For example, Eliana is a wizard with Spell Cunning and the *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* spell prepared, but she finds herself in the area of a *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell. Since she cannot complete the verbal component of *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]*, and it already has a somatic component, so as a swift action she uses Spell Cunning to change the spell so she needs to complete a material component instead of a verbal one. Since she has her spell component pouch, she can cast the spell with somatic and material components even though she is silenced.

In most campaigns a material component added as a requirement through Spell Cunning can be assumed to be something the wizard has in a material component pouch. However, in some campaigns a GM may wish to require a wizard with Spell Cunning to define a material component for each spell they have that normally does not require one, so the character can add material components while using this discovery. In this case such material components should never have a gp cost, and should be thematically related to the spell in question â€” for example, *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* might require an arrowhead as a material component.
