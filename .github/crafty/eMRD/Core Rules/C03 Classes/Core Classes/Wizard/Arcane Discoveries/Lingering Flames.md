# Lingering Flames
## Overview
**Lingering Flames**

You can imbue some of the fire you summon with spells with a brief semblance of life.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a \[fire] spell of 2nd level or higher, as a swift action you may also summon a fire elemental. This acts as a fire elemental summoned with a *summon monster* spell of the same level or lower as the \[fire] spell that triggered this ability, but the elemental remains for only one round.

**Special:** A GM may choose to allow similar arcane discoveries that work off acid or earth spells (earth elementals), cold spells (ice elementals), or lighting and air spells (air elementals).
