# Primal Magic
## Overview
**Primal Magic**

You have learned some of the raw, primitive magic of the shamans and tribal wise ones.

**Benefit:** Select a magic item body slot from the following list: body, chest, feet, hands, shoulders, wrists. When you prepare your spells for the day, you may select one spell of a level no higher than half the highest level spell you can cast, and mark your body with sigils for that spell in special oils and/or paints. As long as you do not have a magic item in that slot, you may cast the selected spell once per day without it counting against your total spells/day. You must meet all the spells requirements to cast it. If you wear a magic item in the slot at any time after preparing spells, you lose the ability to cast the spell until the next time you prepare spells.

**Special:** You may select this arcane discovery more than once. Each time it applies to a different magic item slot.
