# Time Stutter
## Overview
**Time Stutter (Sp)**

You can briefly step out of time, pausing the world around you. This ability acts as the *[[Time Stop (Spell)|time stop]]* spell, except that you gain only 1 round of apparent time. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time for every 5 wizard levels you possess beyond 10th. You must be at least a 10th-level wizard to select this discovery.
