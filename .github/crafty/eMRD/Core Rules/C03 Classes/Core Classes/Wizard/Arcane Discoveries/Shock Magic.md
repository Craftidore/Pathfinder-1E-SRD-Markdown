# Shock Magic
## Overview
**Shock Magic**

You can imbue your electricity magic with the power of jolting sparks.

**Benefit:** When you deal electricity damage to a foe with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, as a swift action you may also force that foe to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 level + Int modifier) or suffer a -2 penalty to all attack rolls and Dexterity-based ability checks and skill checks for 1 round. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
