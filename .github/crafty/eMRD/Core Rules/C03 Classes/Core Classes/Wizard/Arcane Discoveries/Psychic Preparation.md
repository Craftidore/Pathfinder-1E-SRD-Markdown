# Psychic Preparation
## Overview
**Psychic Preparation**

You have learned a limited way to access psychic magic (*Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures* 144). When you first prepare your spells for the day, you can prepare one spell as a psychic spell. This spell must be at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wizard spell you can cast, and takes a slot 1 level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level. When you cast this spell, it operates as a psychic spell, including using emotional and thought components in place of somatic and verbal components, and only having expensive material components.
