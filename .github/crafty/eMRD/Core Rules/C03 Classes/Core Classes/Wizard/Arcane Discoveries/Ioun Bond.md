# Ioun Bond
## Overview
**Ioun Bond**

You can form an arcane bond with an [[Ioun Stone, crimson sphere (cracked)|ioun stone]]. If you choose this arcane discovery at 1st level, you gain a dull gray ioun stone as a bonded object at no cost. A bonded ioun stone must be orbiting your head to have effect. At 12th level, you can turn a bonded dull gray ioun stone into another kind of ioun stone as if you possessed the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feat; if you die or replace a bonded ioun stone that has been transformed in this way, the stone reverts to a dull gray ioun stone. You must have chosen a bonded object as your arcane bond to select this discovery.
