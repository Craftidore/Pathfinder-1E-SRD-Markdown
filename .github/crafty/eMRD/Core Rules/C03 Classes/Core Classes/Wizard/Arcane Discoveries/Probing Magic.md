# Probing Magic
## Overview
**Probing Magic**

When you control a foe’s mind, you also gain a glimpse into it.

**Benefit:** When a foe fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell you cast, as a swift action you may probe into the target’s mind. This gives you information as if you had cast *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* on the target and concentrated for 1 round. If the same target fails multiple saving throws against your mind-affecting spells in the same 24-hour period, each subsequent failed save after the first gives you information as if you had concentrated on the target with *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* for a number of consecutive rounds equal to the number of times the target has failed its save.
