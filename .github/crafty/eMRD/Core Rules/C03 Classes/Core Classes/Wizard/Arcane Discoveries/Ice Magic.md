# Ice Magic
## Overview
**Ice Magic**

You can imbue your cold magic with the power of the bone-chilling north.

**Benefit:** When you deal cold damage to a foe with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, as a swift action you may also force that foe to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 level + Int modifier) or have all their movement rates halved for 1 round. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
