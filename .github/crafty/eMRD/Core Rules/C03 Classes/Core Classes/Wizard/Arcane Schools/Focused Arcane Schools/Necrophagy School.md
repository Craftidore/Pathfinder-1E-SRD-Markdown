# Necrophagy School
## Overview
**Necrophagy School** 

**Associated School**: Necromancy.

A necrophagus receives the Power over Undead supernatural ability, like a necromancer specialist. 

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace powers of the necromancy school as noted. 

*Undead Familiar (Su):* At 1st level, a necrophagus may choose a zombie version of an ordinary familiar. He calculates his wizard level as two lower for advancement purposes. If selected, this replaces the ordinary familiar ability and counts as the Improved Familiar feat, so it cannot be taken later. This ability alters the wizard’s arcane bond class feature. 

*Memory of Flesh (Su):* As a standard action, you may consume the flesh of a living or recently slain creature. You gain a +1 profane bonus on all Knowledge checks, as well as 1 temporary hp per HD and a +2 bonus to your channel resistance. The bonus on Knowledge checks increases by +1 for every 5 wizard levels you possess. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to half your wizard level (minimum 1 round). The bonuses and temporary hp are immediately dispelled if you enter the area of a *consecrate* spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, but you can only consume the flesh of a particular creature once. This replaces the grave touch school ability. 

*Fruit of the Mind (Su): A*t 8th level, you may consume the flesh of a living or recently slain creature and gain the effects of a *speak with dead* spell (CL equal to the necrophage’s wizard level), even if the creature is still alive or is undead. The targeted creature makes a Will save against this effect at a –3 penalty. If successful, the creature may not be affected by this power again for 24 hrs. The creature may be bitten a number of times equal to the below chart. A restoration spell replenishes the number of bites that may be taken from a living creature. Nothing can replenish the number of bites that may be taken from a corpse. This ability replaces the life sight school ability.
