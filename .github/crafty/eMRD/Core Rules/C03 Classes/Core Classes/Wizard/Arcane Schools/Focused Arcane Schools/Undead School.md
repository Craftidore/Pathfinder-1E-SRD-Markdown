# Undead School
## Overview
**Undead School**

**Associated School**: Necromancy.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the grave touch power of the necromancy school.

**Bolster (Sp)**: As a standard action, you can touch an undead creature and infuse it with negative energy. It gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls and saving throws, as well as 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die and a +2 bonus to its turn resistance. The bonus on attack rolls and saving throws increases by +1 for every 5 wizard levels you possess. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round). The bonuses and temporary hit points are immediately dispelled if the creature is within the area of a *consecrate* spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
