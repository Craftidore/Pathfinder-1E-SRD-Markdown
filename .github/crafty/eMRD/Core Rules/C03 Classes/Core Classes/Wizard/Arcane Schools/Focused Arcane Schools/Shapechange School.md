# Shapechange School
## Overview
**Shapechange School**

**Associated School**: Transmutation.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the telekinetic fist power of the transmutation school.

**Battleshaping (Su)**: As a swift action, you grow a single natural weapon. The natural weapon lasts for 1 round and has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for every four wizard levels you possess. You can grow a claw, a bite, or a gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a creature of your size (see page 302 of the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). At 11th level, you can shape two natural weapons. You may not grow additional limbs or a tail with this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
