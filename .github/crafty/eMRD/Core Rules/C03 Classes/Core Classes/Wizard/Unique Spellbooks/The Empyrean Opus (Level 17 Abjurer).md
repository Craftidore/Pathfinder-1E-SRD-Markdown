# The Empyrean Opus (Level 17 Abjurer)
## Overview
**The Empyrean Opus** 

*This book’s cover sports numerous colorful, feathered wings, overlapping in a roughly circular pattern. Peering from between the wings are several round, staring eyes made from colored crystal. The wings fold out—like the petals of a blooming flower—to reveal a stack of circular mithral plates, fastened together with loops of golden wire run through small holes in the top of each plate.* 

The pages of this tome are written in Celestial, etched with holy writs, hymns, and prayers of the heavens. There is much information on the angelic hierarchy and the *Opus* contains names and information that would be useful for conjurations such as the various *[[Planar Ally (Spell)|planar ally]]* spells. 

The *Empyrean Opus* is warded against the foes of good. A permanent *[[Antipathy (Spell)|antipathy]]* alignment protects the tome, and neutral creatures that handle the tome find themselves subjected to a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* effect (Will DC 28). The *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* urges them to take the tome to the nearest temple or agent of a good deity.
