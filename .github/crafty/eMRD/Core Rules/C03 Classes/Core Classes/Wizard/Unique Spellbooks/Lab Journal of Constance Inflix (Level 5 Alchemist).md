# Lab Journal of Constance Inflix (Level 5 Alchemist)
## Overview
*The steel cover of this slim journal has taken its fair share of abuse; acid scars and minor slag spots show where the journal was subjected to intense working conditions. Equations, balances, and chemical notations mark the margins of the pages—with some formulae, it is difficult to tell where the notes end and the formula begins.*

**Value** 280 gp (655 gp with preparation ritual)
