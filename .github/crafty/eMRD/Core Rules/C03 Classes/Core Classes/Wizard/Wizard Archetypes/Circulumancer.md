# Circulumancer
## Overview
**CIRCULUMANCER (ARCHETYPE)**

For a rare few wizards, the secrets of the ring and its perfect circular form give rise to untold versatility and arcane power. A circulumancer’s focus on unlocking the secrets of magic rings, allows them to drastically exceed the limits of most who would make use of these powerful magic items.

**Ring Bearer (Su)**

At 1st level, a circulumancer must select the bonded object option for their arcane bond. This object must be a ring, which the circulumancer begins with at no cost.

If a circulumancer attempts to cast a spell without his bonded ring worn, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + twice the spell’s level. The bonded ring occupies the first of his initial two ring slots.

A circulumancer may add additional magic abilities to his bonded ring as if he has the Ring Apprentice feat, replacing this with the [[Forge Ring (Feat)|Forge Ring]] feat at 5th level. The circulumancer’s bonded ring possesses the unique ability to be enchanted as multiple magic rings at once

The bonded ring otherwise acts as a normal bonded object, including the ability to be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared.

If a bonded ring is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the ring is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork ring. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. A ring replaced in this way does not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded ring. A wizard can designate an existing ring as his bonded ring. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed ring except that the new magic ring retains its original enchantment while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded ring.

This ability alters arcane bond.

**Arcane Crafter**

Instead of specializing in a particular school of magic, a circulumancer instead gains the universalist school, gaining the Arcane crafter sub-school and replacement power at 1st level.

This ability alters arcane school.

**Skilled Crafter**

At 1st level, a circulumancer gains [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]]: [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (jewelry) as a bonus feat.

This ability replaces the [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats**

At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a circulumancer gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat or a ring feat. The circulumancer must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains from advancing levels. The circulumancer is not limited to the categories of ring feats, or metamagic feats when choosing feats gained from regular level advancement.

This alters the bonus feats received at these levels.
