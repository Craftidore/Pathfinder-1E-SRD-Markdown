# Siege Mage
## Overview
**SIEGE MAGE (ARCHETYPE)**

The siege mage combines his arcane mastery with a supernatural link to siege engines.

*Siege Engineer:* At 1st level, the siege mage gains Siege Engineer (Ultimate Combat  118) as a bonus feat, even though he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.

*Siege Engine Bond (Su):* At 1st level, a siege mage can bond with a single siege engine within 30 feet and line of sight as a standard action. He can utilize the power of this link to aim and fire the siege engine remotely (as long as he’s within 30 feet), though it still requires a crew to reload the siege engine. At 10th level, he can reload, aim, and fire the siege engine purely by the power of this link, and no longer needs a crew to control the siege engine. It still takes the normal required amount of time and actions to control a siege engine in this manner. This ability replaces arcane bond. The siege mage can end this bond with a free action. A siege mage can bond with a siege engine in this manner a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but can only be bonded with one siege engine at a time.

*Empower Siege Engine (Su):* As a swift action, a siege mage can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next attack he makes before the end of his turn with a siege engine he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to 3 × the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the siege mage gains the *detect magic* and *read magic* cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.

*Siege School:* The strange rituals needed to empower all forms of siege engines takes a level of dedication and perseverance that limits a wizard’s time to unlock other arcane mysteries. At 1st level, the siege mage forsakes three schools of magic. Once chosen, these opposition schools cannot be changed. A siege mage who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the siege mage takes a –4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools. This ability replaces arcane school.
