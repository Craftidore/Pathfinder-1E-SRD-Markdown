# Clockwork Crafter (Archetype)
## Overview
**CLOCKWORK CRAFTER (WIZARD)**

Some gearforged wizards focus on perfecting their own forms over crafting items for others. Such wizards specialize in enchanting their own mechanical bodies and maximizing the potential of their new metallic forms.

**Arcane Crafter**

Instead of specializing in a particular school of magic, a clockwork caster instead gains the universalist school, gaining the Arcane crafter sub-school and replacement power at 1st level.

This ability alters arcane school.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the hand of the apprentice power of the universalist school.

**Metacharge (Ex)**: As an Arcane crafter, you gain a bonus feat at 3rd level, which must be an item creation feat or metamagic feat. You must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. When using metamagic feats to create magic items, your skill and understanding of the principles involved in the itemâ€™s creation give you a +2 bonus on the skill check made to create the item.

**Self-Made (Ex):** At 1st level, the clockwork crafter gains the [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] item creation feat. This feat may only be used on his own body (or for himself) until he reaches 5th level when he may craft items for others using this feat. When doing this, the clockwork crafter literally enchants a part of his own body as if he were making a specific wondrous item for that particular magical item slot. For example, rather than enchant a pair of magical *[[Boots of Speed|boots of speed]]**;* the clockwork crafter would enchant his own feet. When enchanting a part of his own form, the clockwork crafter reduces the gp cost by 10%. Unfortunately, when he is crafting an item for another (at higher levels), he increases the cost by 25%.

At 4th level (and every 3 levels thereafter) the clockwork crafter can add an additional separate wondrous item enchantment to a selected body slot. So he might enchant his feet slot with the equivalent of *[[Boots of Speed|boots of speed]]* and then later on might also create *[[Boots of Striding and Springing|boots of striding and springing]]**.* These are separate enchantments (like two separate wondrous items) which the clockwork crafter can switch between as a full round action.

At 8th level switching between wondrous enchantments in a given body slot becomes a standard action.

At 12th level switching between wondrous enchantments in a given body slot becomes a move action.

Finally, at 16th level, the clockwork crafter can switch between enchantments in a given body slot as a free action (though he may still only take 1 free action of a given type once per round).

**Bonus Feats**

At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a clockwork crafter gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose an item creation feat. The clockwork crafter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains from advancing levels. The clockwork crafter is not limited to item creation feats when choosing feats gained from regular level advancement.

This alters the bonus feats received at these levels.
