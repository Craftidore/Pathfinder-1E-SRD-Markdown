# Hive Totem Resilience (Su)
## Overview
*Hive Totem Resilience (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian takes no damage from attacks by swarms of vermin, preventing harmful secondary effects of such attacks like poison or bleed. She also gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD when grappling for every four barbarian levels she has (maximum +5). A barbarian must have the [[Hive Totem (Su)|hive totem]] rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
