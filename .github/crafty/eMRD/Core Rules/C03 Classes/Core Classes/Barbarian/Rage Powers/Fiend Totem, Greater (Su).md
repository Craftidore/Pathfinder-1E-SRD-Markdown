# Fiend Totem, Greater (Su)
## Overview
*Fiend Totem, Greater (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded by an aura of menace. Good creatures adjacent to the barbarian are [[Shaken|shaken]] and take 2d6 points of slashing damage at the beginning of the barbarianâ€™s turn as dozens of small cuts open across their flesh. Neutral creatures that are adjacent to the barbarian are [[Shaken|shaken]], but do not take any damage. Evil creatures are unaffected. A barbarian must have the [[Fiend Totem (Su)|fiend totem]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.
