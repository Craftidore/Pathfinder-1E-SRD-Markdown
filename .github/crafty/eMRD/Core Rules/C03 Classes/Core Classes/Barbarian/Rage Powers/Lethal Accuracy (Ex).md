# Lethal Accuracy (Ex)
## Overview
*Lethal Accuracy (Ex)*: When using her [[Surprise Accuracy (Ex)|surprise accuracy]] rage power, the barbarian’s critical multiplier for damage increases by 1 (a ×2 multiplier becomes ×3, a 19–20/×2 multiplier becomes 19–20/×3, a ×3 multiplier becomes ×4, and a ×4 multiplier becomes ×5). A barbarian must have the [[Surprise Accuracy (Ex)|surprise accuracy]] and [[Deadly Accuracy (Ex)|deadly accuracy]] rage powers and be 16th level before selecting this rage power.
