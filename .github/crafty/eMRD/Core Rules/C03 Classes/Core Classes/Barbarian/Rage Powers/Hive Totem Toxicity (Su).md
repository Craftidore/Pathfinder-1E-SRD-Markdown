# Hive Totem Toxicity (Su)
## Overview
*Hive Totem Toxicity (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian increases her bite damage die type with the animal fury rage power by one die type and decreases the penalty on attack rolls with that bite to –2. Once per rage, a bite that hits can deliver an injury toxin that has a frequency of once per round for 4 rounds, deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage, and has a cure of one save. The saving throw has a Fortitude save DC of 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Constitution modifier. A barbarian must have the [[Hive Totem (Su)|hive totem]] and [[Hive Totem Resilience (Su)|hive totem resilience]] rage powers and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
