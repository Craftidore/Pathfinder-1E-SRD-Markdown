# Hurling Charge (Ex)
## Overview
*Hurling Charge (Ex)*: While raging and making a charge attack, the barbarian may draw and throw a hurled weapon during her charge, gaining the normal +2 attack roll bonus on the thrown weapon attack as well as on the melee attack at the end of the charge. The barbarian must move at least 10 feet before using a thrown weapon and at least 10 additional feet before making a melee attack at the end of her charge. The barbarian must have a thrown weapon in hand or have one hand free at the beginning of her charge. A barbarian must have the [[Hurling, Lesser (Ex)|lesser hurling]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.
