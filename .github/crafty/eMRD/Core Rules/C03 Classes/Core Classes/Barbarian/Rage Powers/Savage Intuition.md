# Savage Intuition
## Overview
*Savage Intuition:* Your bestial senses allow you to sense danger and become enraged before you even have time to consciously react to danger. When combat begins, if you have rounds of rage remaining, you may automatically enter a rage without using an action at the start of the first round of combat (or at the start of the surprise round, if there is one), even if you are not otherwise aware that combat has begun.
