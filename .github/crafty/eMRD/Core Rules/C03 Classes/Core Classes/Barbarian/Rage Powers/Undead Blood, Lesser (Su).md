# Undead Blood, Lesser (Su)
## Overview
*Undead Blood, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, when the barbarian hits a creature with a charge attack, the creature she hit becomes [[Shaken|shaken]] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). This effect does not stack with other fear effects to cause a stronger condition.
