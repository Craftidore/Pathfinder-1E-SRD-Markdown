# Fey Blood, Lesser (Su)
## Overview
*Fey Blood, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, each time the barbarian confirms a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarianâ€™s level + her Constitution modifier) or be [[Confused|confused]] for one round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
