# Bloody Fist (Ex)
## Overview
*Bloody Fist (Ex):* While raging, the barbarian may attempt to punch through an opponent’s flesh and rip out one of its vital organs. In order to do so, the barbarian must confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a natural attack or unarmed strike. The barbarian deals damage as normal for a critical hit and the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s class level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital organs is ripped free from its body. This power can only be used once per rage. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.
