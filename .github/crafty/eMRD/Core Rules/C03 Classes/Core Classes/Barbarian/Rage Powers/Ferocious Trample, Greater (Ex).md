# Ferocious Trample, Greater (Ex)
## Overview
*Ferocious Trample, Greater (Ex)*: A barbarianâ€™s mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its ferocious trample. In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against its trample. A barbarian must have the [[Ferocious Trample (Ex)|ferocious trample]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.
