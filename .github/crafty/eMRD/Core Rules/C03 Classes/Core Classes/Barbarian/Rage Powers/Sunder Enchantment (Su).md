# Sunder Enchantment (Su)
## Overview
*Sunder Enchantment (Su)*: While raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver on a magical item, that item’s magical abilities are suppressed for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 points by which her combat maneuver check exceeded the target’s CMD. A barbarian must have the [[Spell Sunder (Su)|spell sunder]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
