# Deathless Frenzy
## Overview
*Deathless Frenzy:* While raging, you ignore the effects of being at 0 or fewer hit points until you have been at 0 or fewer hit points for 1 round, at which point the appropriate consequences for your current hit point total take effect. Even death can be postponed this way, potentially allowing you to survive if you receive sufficient healing before the round is up. You must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.
