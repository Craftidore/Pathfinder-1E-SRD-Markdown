# Fueled by Vengeance
## Overview
*Fueled by Vengeance:* While raging, whenever you deal weapon damage to a creature that dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn, add 1 round to your remaining number of rounds of rage for the current day. You can gain no more than 1 extra round of rage each round. You must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.
