# Boasting Taunt (Ex)
## Overview
*Boasting Taunt (Ex)*: While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also [[Shaken|shaken]] as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.
