# Linnorm Death Curse, Cairn (Su)
## Overview
*Linnorm Death Curse, Cairn (Su)*: The character channels the power of a cairn linnorm. The character’s melee attacks deal an additional 1 point of negative energy damage. If the character is knocked unconscious or killed by an attack or spell, the attacker suffers the curse of decay (Will negates). A character must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. *Curse of Decay*: *save* Will DC 10 + 1/2 character’s level + character’s Charisma bonus; *effect* target takes 1 point of Con damage per day and ages at a rate of 1 year per day (eventually incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the bonuses).
