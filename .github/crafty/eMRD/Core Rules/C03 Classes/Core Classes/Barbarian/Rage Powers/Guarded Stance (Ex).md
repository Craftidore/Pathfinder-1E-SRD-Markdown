# Guarded Stance (Ex)
## Overview
*Guarded Stance (Ex)*: The barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class against melee attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarianâ€™s current Constitution modifier (minimum 1). This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
