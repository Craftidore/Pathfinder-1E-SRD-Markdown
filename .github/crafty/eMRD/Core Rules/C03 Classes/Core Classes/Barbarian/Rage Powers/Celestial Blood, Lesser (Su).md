# Celestial Blood, Lesser (Su)
## Overview
*Celestial Blood, Lesser (Su)*: While raging, the barbarianâ€™s melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, the barbarian deals an additional 1d6 points of damage when she damages an evil outsider with a melee attack.
