# Regenerative Vigor (Ex)
## Overview
*Regenerative Vigor (Ex)*: After using her [[Renewed Vigor (Ex)|renewed vigor]] rage power until her current rage ends, the barbarian gains fast healing 1 for every 6 barbarian levels she has (maximum fast healing 3). She regains hit points from fast healing at the start of each of her turns. A barbarian must have the [[Renewed Vigor (Ex)|renewed vigor]] rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
