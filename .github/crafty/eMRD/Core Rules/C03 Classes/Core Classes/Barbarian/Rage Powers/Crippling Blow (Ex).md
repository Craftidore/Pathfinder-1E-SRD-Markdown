# Crippling Blow (Ex)
## Overview
*Crippling Blow (Ex)*: When using her [[Powerful Blow (Ex)|powerful blow]] rage power, the barbarian can forgo the normal bonus to damage (including any bleed damage granted by the [[Bleeding Blow (Ex)|bleeding blow]] rage power or similar boosts to the damage of the [[Powerful Blow (Ex)|powerful blow]] rage power) and instead deals 1 point of ability damage to the target’s Strength or Dexterity score for every four class levels the barbarian has attained. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) to halve this ability damage. A barbarian must have the [[Powerful Blow (Ex)|powerful blow]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
