# Spirit Steed (Su)
## Overview
*Spirit Steed (Su)*: While raging and mounted, the barbarian’s mount gains DR/magic equal to 1/2 the barbarian’s level. The mount’s natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A barbarian must have the [[Ferocious Mount (Ex)|ferocious mount]] rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.
