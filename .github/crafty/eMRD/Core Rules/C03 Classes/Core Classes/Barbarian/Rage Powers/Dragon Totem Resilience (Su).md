# Dragon Totem Resilience (Su)
## Overview
*Dragon Totem Resilience (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to the energy type that is associated with her dragon totem—acid (black, copper, green), cold (silver, white), electricity (blue, bronze), or fire (brass, gold, red). This resistance equals double her current DR/— from her barbarian damage reduction class feature; this DR increases by 2 for each dragon totem rage power she possesses, including this one. A barbarian must have the [[Dragon Totem (Su)|dragon totem]] rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.
