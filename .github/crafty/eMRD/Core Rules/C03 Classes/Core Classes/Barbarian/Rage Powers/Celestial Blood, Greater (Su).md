# Celestial Blood, Greater (Su)
## Overview
*Celestial Blood, Greater (Su)*: Once per rage, the barbarian can reroll one ability check, skill check, or saving throw she just made. She must take the second result, even if itâ€™s lower. She must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled but before results are revealed.
