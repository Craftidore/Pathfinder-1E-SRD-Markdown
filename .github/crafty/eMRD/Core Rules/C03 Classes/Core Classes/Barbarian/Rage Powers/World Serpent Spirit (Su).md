# World Serpent Spirit (Su)
## Overview
*World Serpent Spirit (Su)*: While raging, the barbarian considers her weapons to be chaotic-, evil-, good-, and lawful-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. She also gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that have an alignment descriptor or come from an outsider or aberration. This bonus increases by +1 for each world serpent rage power the barbarian possesses, excluding this one. A barbarian must have the [[World Serpent Totem (Su)|world serpent totem]] rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.
