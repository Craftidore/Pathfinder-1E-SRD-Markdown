# Breaker (Archetype)
## Overview
While most barbarians are skilled at breaking things, some find the need to destroy their surroundings an almost uncontrollable urge when in the middle of a rage. These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes, but also to the very environment around them. A breaker barbarian has the following class features.

**Destructive (Ex)**: Whenever the breaker barbarian makes a melee attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat maneuver, she adds half her barbarian level (minimum +1) on the damage roll. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Battle Scavenger (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the breaker archetype: ground breaker, smasher, and strength surge\*.
