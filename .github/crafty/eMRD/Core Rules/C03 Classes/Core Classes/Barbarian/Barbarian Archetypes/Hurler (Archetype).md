# Hurler (Archetype)
## Overview
A raging barbarian is frightening enough in melee, but some become skilled at throwing objects at their foes before closing in for the kill. A hurler has the following class feature.

**Skilled Thrower (Ex)**: The hurler is skilled at throwing objects in combat. Increase the range increment of any thrown weapon or object by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the hurler archetype: hurling, greater hurling, hurling charge, lesser hurling, strength surge\*, and surprise accuracy\*.
