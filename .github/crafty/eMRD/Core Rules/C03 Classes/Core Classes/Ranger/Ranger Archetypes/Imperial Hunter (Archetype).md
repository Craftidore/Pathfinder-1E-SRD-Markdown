# Imperial Hunter (Archetype)
## Overview
**IMPERIAL HUNTER (RANGER)** 

Servants of the Ghoul Empire, imperial hunters pursue escaped slaves and patrol the empire’s frontiers. 

**Class Skills**: Remove [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] and [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] from the imperial hunter’s list of class skills. Add [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] to the imperial hunter’s list of class skills. 

**Bolas Warrior:** An imperial hunter is an expert with the bolas. In addition to proficiency with the bolas, imperial hunters gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the bolas and ignore penalties from their first range increment. This replaces wild empathy. 

**Combat Style:** An imperial hunter choosing archery as his combat style adds Quickdraw to the list of feats he can take at 2nd level. If he chooses the natural attack combat style, he adds Ghoul Claws instead. Alternatively, the imperial hunter can choose the net combat style at 2nd level. 

***Net Combat:*** If the ranger selects net combat style, the following feats are available when selecting a combat style feat: [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] (net), Net Adept, Net Maneuvering, and [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (net) 

At 6th level, the ranger adds Net Trickery and [[Two-Weapon Fighting]]. At 10th level, the imperial hunter adds Net and Trident and [[Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Improved Two Weapon Fighting]] to the list. 

**Persistent Hunter (Ex):** At 3rd level, an imperial hunter gains Subdued Pangs as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the [[Endurance (Domain)|Endurance]] bonus feat. 

**Taste of Prey (Ex):** At 4th level, the imperial hunter tracks prey like a natural predator. He gains the [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] universal monster rule when tracking a creature he has dealt hp damage to in the last 24 hours. If the imperial hunter dealt a [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] condition or a confirmed critical hit to his quarry, he gains a bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] rolls to track that prey equal to the amount of [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] damage or the critical multiplier of the confirmed attack. These bonuses last for 24 hours or until the target receives any magical healing. This replaces hunter’s bond. 

**Spelunker (Ex):** At 7th level, an imperial hunter gains a +2 bonus to [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] and [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks in underground terrain. He may move through any sort of underground difficult terrain at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This includes moving through [[Caltrops|caltrops]], *[[Spike Stones (Spell)|spike stones]]*, or similar effects. This ability replaces woodland stride. 

**Anticipation (Ex):** At 12th level, an imperial hunter may use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill as an immediate action to hide from a favored enemy or the target of his quarry ability. If underground, he can make this check even if the local terrain offers no cover or concealment. So long as he remains motionless, he gains concealment in darkness even to observers with [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|darkvision]]. This replaces camouflage. At 17th level, he can make this check (or a regular [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check as part of movement) even while being observed. This replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.
