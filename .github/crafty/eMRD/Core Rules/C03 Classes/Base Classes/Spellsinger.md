# Spellsinger
## Overview
Spellsingers cast spells through their songs. These songs become popular verses in elven culrure, although only those with the talent for sorcery are able to use them to cause magical effects. According to ancient elven tradition, the spellsingers were the first arcane spellcasters. Accordingly, they take great pride in their skills. At least among elves, ample evidence exists for sorcery being hereditary, as many spellsingers point to their ancestors who also had the talent.

**Adventures:** Like sorcerers, spellsingers adventure to learn their craft and explore their unique talent. They journey in the hopes of finding others like themselves, so that they can share stories, learn from each other and then (usually) part and continue the process. Spellsingers pride themselves on their spellcasting creativity and imagination. Adventuring provides them with an opportunity to put that ability to the test.

**Characteristics:** Charisma is far and away the spellsinger's most important attribute. Besides affecting her spellcasting ability, it is key to her singing. Aside from Charisma, spellsingers often have high Wisdom scores to reflect their natural intuition and inventiveness. A high Constitution score is helpful in maintaining concentration, which spellsingers claim is very important.

**Alignment:** Spellsingers are independent, and therefore tend toward chaotic, but they are rarely evil.

**Religion:** Spellsingers worship Raconteur far more often than any other god. Lesser patrons include the Shimmering One, the Coddler, the Rift master and the Laugher.

**Background:** The first spellsingers were direct descendants of the gray elf Yealen Batania, who according to legend first created the precious metal mithral to fight the diabolic followers of Blacksoul. Yealen armed his Nine Saints with spears tipped with mithral heads and slew the devils faster than Blacksoul could summon them. The spellsinger sealed the gate Blacksoul had created to bring in the outsiders, and then sang a song of hope for his saints. Blacksoul devoured seven of the saints, then Caregiver, Raconteur or the Eternal Lantern (the tale varies by teller) intervened and protected Yealen. Some accounts even claim Yealen reversed the summoning gate and himself sent Blacksoul away, though most right-thinking folk find this version simply preposterous.

**Races:** The first spellsingers were all elves, but other races began to hunger for this strange type of magic after the elves spread its knowledge. Dwarves who have the capability for sorcery have a surprising talent for spellsinging, but they prefer to do their singing in groups. Haillings, despite their comparatively shrill voices, make good spcllsingers. Gnome spellsingers are less common, and hobgoblin, half-orc, and half-hobgoblin spellsingers extremely rare.

**Other classes:** Spellsingers treat other classes in much the same way as sorcerers do. They get along very well with bards, however, and conflict less frequently with wizards.

**Game Rule Information**

Spellsingers have the following game statistics.

**Abilities:** Spellsmgers may cast the same spells as sorcerers, though Chansma determines how powerful a spell a spellsinger can cast, how many spells the spellsinger can cast per day and how hard those spells are to resist. To cast a spell, a spellsinger must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level A spellsinger also receives bonus spells based on Charisma. The Difficulty Class of a saving throw against a spellsinger's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the spellsinger's Charisma modifier.

Spellsingers may sing spells whose casting normally does not require a verbal component.
