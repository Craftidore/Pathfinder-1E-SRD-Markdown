# Skullbound Shapechanger (Hex)
## Overview
*Skullbound Shapechanger (Su):* The witch receives Realistic Likeness as a bonus feat. If she possesses the skull or face of the individual whom she wishes to transform into using Realistic Likeness, she reduces the bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks that those who are familiar with the individual receive to oppose her [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] check by half. The witch must be a kitsune in order to select this hex.
