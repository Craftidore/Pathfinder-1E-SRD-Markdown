# Death Curse (Hex)
## Overview
*Death Curse (Su)*: This powerful hex seizes a creatureâ€™s heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes [[Fatigued|fatigued]] the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]]. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain [[Exhausted|exhausted]] and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
