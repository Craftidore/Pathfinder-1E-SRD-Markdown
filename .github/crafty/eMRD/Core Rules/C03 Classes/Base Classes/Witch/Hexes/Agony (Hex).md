# Agony (Hex)
## Overview
*Agony (Su)*: With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The target is [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for a number of rounds equal to the witchâ€™s level. A Fortitude save negates this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
