# Nightblade (Archetype)
## Overview
**NIGHTBLADE (MAGUS)** 

The nightblade funnels the powers of darkness and necromancy through his magic weapon. 

**Armor Proficiency:** Nightblades do not gain proficiency with medium or heavy armor. 

**Skills:** Remove [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] from the nightblade’s list of class skills. Replace them with [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]]. 

**Spells:** Remove the following spells from the nightblade’s spell list: 

0—*[[Flare (Spell)|flare]]*, 1—*[[Color Spray (Spell)|color spray]]*, 2—*[[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]]*, 3—*[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]*, 4—*[[Elemental Body I (Spell)|elemental body I]]*, 5—*[[Elemental Body II (Spell)|elemental body II]]*, 6—*[[Elemental Body III (Spell)|elemental body III]]*. 

Add the following spells in their place: 0—*[[Bleed (Spell)|bleed]]*, 1—*consume light*, 2—*protective penumbra*, 3—*[[Ch.4 - Deeper Darkness (HallMtKing)|deeper darkness]]*, 4—*[[Enervation (Spell)|enervation]]*, 5—*boneshatter*, 6—*[[Circle of Death (Spell)|circle of death]]*. 

**Natural Spellstrike (Su):** At 4th level, the nightblade can use his spellstrike ability to deliver a spell through a natural attack. This natural attack still suffers any penalties from the spell combat ability or from combining a natural attack with attacks with a manufactured weapon. At 11th level, the nightblade only suffers a −2 penalty for [[S3.1N-Q - Universal Monster Rules N-Q (Bestiary 6 Apx)|natural attacks]] made in conjunction with manufactured weapon attacks. This replaces spell recall and improved spell recall. 

**Ill Spirited:** At 5th level, remove [[Dancing (MagWpnSpcAb)|dancing]] and [[Vorpal (MagWpnSpcAb)|vorpal]] from the weapon properties available to the nightblade’s arcane pool ability. Replace them with cruel, [[Heartseeker (MagWpnSpcAb)|heartseeker]], and [[Vicious (MagWpnSpcAb)|vicious]]. This modifies the nightblade’s ability to add bonuses to his weapon with the arcane pool ability.

**Natural Armor instead of heavier armor:** At 7th level, the nightblade gains a +2 enhancement bonus to his natural armor. If the nightblade has no natural armor, his base natural armor bonus is treated as +0. At 13th level, this bonus increases to +4. This replaces the magus’s medium armor and heavy armor class features.
