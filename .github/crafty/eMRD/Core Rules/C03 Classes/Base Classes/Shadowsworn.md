# Shadowsworn
## Overview
While rogues hide in shadows and wizards cast spells to defeat opponents, amass treasure, or accomplish other goals, shadowsworn use shadows and magic with the goal of becoming one with the shadows. It is said that the first shadowsworn were elven agents of Sarastra, trained in the Courts of the Shadow Fey. These original shadow mages have long since traded their mortal lives for a darker and more powerful existence.

**Role**: With their mastery of darkness and shadow magics, shadowsworn can sneak about with ease, confound their enemies, strike using spells or steel, and then escape unseen through their beloved shadows. 

**Alignment**: Any non-good.

**Hit Die**: d8 

**Starting Wealth**: As per rogue.

**Class Skills** 

The shadowsworn’s class skills are [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (Dex), [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] (Cha), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] (Dex), [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (arcana) (Int), [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (the planes) (Int), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] (Int), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (Wis), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (Int) and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (Dex).

**Class Features** 

The following are class features of the shadowsworn. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Shadowsworn are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the [[Crossbow, Hand|hand crossbow]], [[Rapier|rapier]], sap, [[Shortbow|shortbow]], and short sword. They aren’t proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a shadowsworn’s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail. 

**Darkvision (Ex)**: Beginning at 1st level, a shadowsworn gains increasingly powerful darkvision. If he has no darkvision, he gains it out to 30 feet. If he already has darkvision, he gains an additional 30 feet to his existing range. This range increases by another 30 feet at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. At 18th level, he also gains the ability to see through *[[Deeper Darkness (Spell)|deeper darkness]]*. 

**Spells**: A shadowsworn casts arcane spells drawn from the shadowsworn spell list. Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a shadowsworn need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. 

To learn or cast a spell, the shadowsworn must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a shadowsworn’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the shadowsworn’s Intelligence modifier. 

A shadowsworn can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on **Table 3-2 Shadowsworn Spells per Day**. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score. 

A shadowsworn’s selection of spells is limited. A shadowsworn begins play knowing two 0-level spells and one 1st-level spell of his choice. At each new shadowsworn level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on **Table 3-3 Shadowsworn Spells Known**. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a shadowsworn knows is not affected by his Int score.) 

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third shadowsworn level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a shadowsworn can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A shadowsworn may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. 

**Sneak Attack**: If a shadowsworn can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The shadowsworn’s attack deals extra damage any time his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the shadowsworn flanks his target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every three shadowsworn levels thereafter. Should the shadowsworn score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. 

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a shadowsworn can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. 

The shadowsworn must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A shadowsworn cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment. 

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 2nd level and higher, a shadowsworn can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the shadowsworn is wearing light armor or no armor, and only if there are shadows large enough to cover his entire body that he can duck into. A helpless shadowsworn does not gain the benefit of evasion. 

**Shadow Talents**: As a shadowsworn gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 3rd level, a shadowsworn gains one shadow talent. He gains an additional shadow talent at 8th, 13th, and 17th levels. A shadowsworn cannot select an individual talent more than once. 

**Crippling Strike\* (Ex)**: A shadowsworn with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that his blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of his sneak attacks also takes 1 point of Strength damage. 

**Feather Step (Sp)**: A shadowsworn with this talent moving through an area of darkness or dim light can ignore the effects of difficult terrain as if he’d cast the *feather step* spell (see the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player’s Guide*). This ability can be used as often as desired, up to a total number of minutes equal to 10 times the shadowsworn’s class levels. 

**Improved Evasion (Ex)**: This works like evasion, except that while the shadowsworn still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless shadowsworn does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. 

**Off Balance\* (Ex)**: When a shadowsworn with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, for 1 round the shadowsworn gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled. 

**Powerful Sneak\* (Ex)**: Whenever a shadowsworn with this talent takes a full attack action, he can elect to take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of his next turn. If an attack during this time is a sneak attack, he treats all 1s on the sneak attack damage dice as 2s. 

**Shadow Speed (Ex)**: This ability allows a shadowsworn to move at full speed using the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill without penalty. He can also move along narrow surfaces at full speed using [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] without penalty, and is not [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] when using [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move along narrow surfaces. Shadow speed can only be used if at least part of the movement occurs in areas of darkness or dim light. 

**Shadow Stretch (Su):** The shadowsworn can alter the shadows in his vicinity in order to use the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill even while being observed and without cover or concealment, as long as he’s within 5 feet of a shadow other than his own. If the shadowsworn has a shadow familiar, the range is extended to 10 feet. 

**Sniper’s Eye\* (Ex):** A shadowsworn with this talent can apply his sneak attack damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that benefit from concealment. Foes with total concealment are still immune. 

**Stealthy Sniper (Ex):** When a shadowsworn with this talent uses the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to snipe from an area of darkness or dim light, he only suffers a –15 penalty on the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check, instead of –20. 

**Surprise Attack (Ex):** During the surprise round, opponents are always considered [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] to a shadowsworn with this ability, even if they have already acted. 

**Shadow Familiar (Su)**: If the shadowsworn has the [[Improved Familiar (Feat)|Improved Familiar]] feat, at 4th level, he can conduct an all-day ritual that permanently releases his own shadow to serve as a familiar for him. A shadowsworn cannot have a standard familiar (gained from another class) and a shadow familiar; he can only have one familiar. 

A shadow familiar has the statistics and abilities common to all wizards’ familiars, but it doesn’t grant its master a special ability bonus. It is not undead, so cannot be commanded by a cleric. It can be cured with normal curative spells. It’s incorporeal, and cannot interact with physical objects. The shadow familiar can move under doors and through other tiny openings, can stretch to 10 times the shadowsworn’s height, is invisible in partial or full darkness, and can hide completely by posing as its master’s normal shadow. The shadow familiar uses the shadowsworn’s [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill to remain hidden, and gains a +4 bonus to [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks in dim lighting but a –4 penalty in brightly lit areas. 

The shadowsworn can communicate with his unbound shadow normally as soon as he gains it. The alignment of the shadow familiar is the same as the shadowsworn’s. 

If his shadow familiar is killed, a shadowsworn no longer casts a normal shadow. He may only create another shadow familiar after one month or after spending 24 continuous hours in complete darkness, replenishing his shadow. 

The shadowsworn cannot cast the *[[Shadow Projection (Spell)|shadow projection]]* spell if he has a shadow familiar. 

Note: The shadowsworn can take [[Improved Familiar (Feat)|Improved Familiar]] at an early level when he’s not yet eligible to use the feat. 

**Command Shadow (Su):** As a standard action, the shadowsworn can channel negative energy through his body to enslave undead shadows within 30 feet. The shadows receive a Will save (10 + 1/2 shadowsworn’s class level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. Undead shadows that fail the save fall under his control, obeying his commands to the best of their ability, as if under the effects of *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]*. The shadows receive a new saving throw each day to resist the shadowsworn’s command. He can control any number of shadows, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed his shadowsworn level. If an undead shadow is under the control of another creature, the shadowsworn must make an opposed Charisma check whenever their orders conflict. 

**Summon Shadow (Sp)**: At 9th level, a shadowsworn can summon undead shadows through nearby naturally occurring shadows. He can do this as a standard action once per day plus his Charisma modifier. He can summon 1d3 shadows plus one for every three shadowsworn levels above 9th. Once summoned, the shadows obey the shadowsworn’s mental commands, although they can only actively communicate with him when they are within 10 feet per shadowsworn level. The shadows last 1 round per shadowsworn level or until destroyed or banished. The shadowsworn can dismiss them as a free action. 

After a shadowsworn reaches 15th level, he can substitute one greater shadow for every three shadows he would normally summon. 

**Shadow Transformation**: Upon reaching 20th level, the repeated use of Shadow energy overcomes the shadowsworn and he is completely given over to shadow. At this time he must choose whether to permanently transform into a greater shadow, a shae (*Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 3*), or a shadow fey (*Midgard Bestiary*). 

The shadowsworn gains all the abilities and features of that creature type while keeping all of his class abilities forever (this choice cannot be changed), and is treated as a native fey.
