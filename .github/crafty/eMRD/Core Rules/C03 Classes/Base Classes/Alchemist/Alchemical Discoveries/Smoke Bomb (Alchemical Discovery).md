# Smoke Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Smoke Bomb\*:* When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]*, filling an area equal to twice the bombâ€™s splash radius for 1 round per level.
