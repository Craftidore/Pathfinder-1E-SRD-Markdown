# Sticky Bomb (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Sticky Bomb:* The effects of the alchemistâ€™s bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.
