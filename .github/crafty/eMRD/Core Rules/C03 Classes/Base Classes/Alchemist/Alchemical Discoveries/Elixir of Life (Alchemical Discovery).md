# Elixir of Life (Alchemical Discovery)
## Overview
*Elixir of Life:* Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]*. Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemistâ€™s Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.
