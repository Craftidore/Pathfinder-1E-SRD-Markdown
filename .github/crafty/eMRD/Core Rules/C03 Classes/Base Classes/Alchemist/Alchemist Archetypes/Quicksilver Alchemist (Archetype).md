# Quicksilver Alchemist (Archetype)
## Overview
**QUICKSILVER ALCHEMIST (ALCHEMIST)**

Members of the Quicksilver Society often travel alongside the Imperial Legions, serving as surgeon and battlefield salvager.

**Class Skills:** Remove [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] from the quicksilver alchemist’s list of class skills. Replace it with [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion).

**Extracts Known:** At each extract level available to the quicksilver alchemist, replace the cure wounds extract on the list of alchemist’s extracts with the inflict wounds spell of the same level.

**Ghoulish Mutagen (Su):** A quicksilver alchemist may create a mutagen which works almost identically to a normal alchemist’s mutagen. If the quicksilver alchemist chooses to increase his Charisma score to improve his physical skills, he takes a −1 penalty to [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]], [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] checks so long as the mutagen remains active. A quicksilver alchemist using the cognatogen discovery to increase his social mien takes a −1 penalty to Fortitude saves and loses 1 hp per Hit Die from his maximum hp as long as the cognatogen remains active. This ability also impacts greater and grand cognatogens or mutagens that would affect a normal alchemist’s Charisma score. This modifies the normal alchemist’s mutagen ability.

**Bolster the Ranks (Ex):** At 10th level, the quicksilver alchemist adds *[[Create Undead (Spell)|create undead]]* to his formula book as a 4th-level extract. Rather than consuming the extract, he injects it into a corpse he intends to animate, which rises as an uncontrolled undead creature 1 hour later. The extract can only create corporeal undead, and it cannot create darakhul. This ability replaces the alchemist discovery normally gained at 10th level.

**Alchemist Discoveries:** The following alchemist discoveries complement the quicksilver alchemist archetype: alchemical zombie, [[Combine Extracts (Alchemical Discovery)|combine extracts]], [[Enhance Potion (Alchemical Discovery)|enhance potion]], [[Feral Mutagen (Alchemical Discovery)|feral mutagen]], [[Infuse Mutagen (Alchemical Discovery)|infuse mutagen]], infusions, preserve organs, sunlight bomb.
