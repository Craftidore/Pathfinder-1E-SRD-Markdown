# Spellslayer
## Overview
The spellslayer (abbreviated SpS) is a magical killer whose strength comes from the element of surprise and his mastery of arcane magic.

This base class provides an alternative to the assassin prestige class given in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and the *PFG Gamemastery Guide*. Note that these two classes do not interact well, and a GM should not allow both in his campaign unless he is using regional assassins or something similar (such as differing guilds).

**Adventures**

Spellslayers usually seek adventure only when a great threat comes against those they serve, or when they are directed to do so. While they rarely pursue adventure for its own sake, some spellslayers are exceptions to this rule. The adventuring spellslayer uses the constant danger of the adventuring life as a way to hone and perfect his abilities, and keep his skills at their sharpest. The guise of adventurer is also excellent cover for the working spellslayer, since constant traveling and great fluctuations in wealth are part and parcel of adventuring life.

**Characteristics**

The spellslayer is a master of surprise and stealth, of cunning and magical skill. He does not have the strength of a barbarian or fighter, the versatility of a bard, or the breadth of skills of a rogue, but he combines a potent mastery of magic with a solid attack bonus and skill list, and special abilities that make him a feared, and seldom-seen, opponent.

**Alignment**

Spellslayers follow a path of exacting rules which comes from a code of conduct from which no deviation is allowed. They are never chaotic and good and evil are merely mental constructs for most spellslayers. Lawful spellslayers follow a strict code of who may be killed and when. They despise slaughter for its own sake, and only kill outside a contract when they or their master are threatened. Spellslayers who are neutral are among the most dangerous characters imaginable. Their absolute amorality and faithlessness makes them as unpredictable as mad dogs.

**Religion**

Those spellslayers who practice a faith commonly worship the gods of thieves, but many also revere deities of death, murder, and vengeance. Of course, many spellslayers do not trouble themselves to revere anything beyond their own ability to cause destruction.

**Background**

Almost all spellslayers are members of an organized guild that operates in major cities; though some are zealots who kill at the pleasure of their religious leaders. A very small minority, however, are self-trained in the craft and find honor only in the practice of killing.

Within the Arcane Age campaign setting for the World of Greyhawk, spellslayers are found almost exclusively in the Suel Imperium. There each Great House (as well as several of the Houses Minor) maintains a House Assasin (along with a small cadre of assassins in training). This House Assassin, along with the House Shield (a Suel arcanamach), are primarily responsible for the safety of the House members as well as their martial (and in many cases, arcane training).

In the Arcane Age, spellslayers and arcanamachs are perceived to be the dagger and buckler of each Great House. Their combined skills are nearly undefeatable.

**Races**

Humans are the most common spellslayers. Occasionally an exceptional thrall from another race will be trained as a spellslayer. Such are almost always considered disposable assets; though they are never given a hint of such an attitude and in fact are some of the dedicated spellslayers since they are indoctrinated from a young age and told that they are special, different from the rest of their kind.

Elves and half-elves are exceptional spellslayers, but it is rare to find an elf so grim that he would abandon his long life to the practice of dedicated killing. Most half-elves inherit a gaiety and love of freedom from their elven parent, and despise the sinister, single-minded determination of the class. Likewise, the dwarves' cultural tendency towards good make them ill suited to the essentially evil path.

Despite their reputation as opportunists, few halflings follow the path of the spellslayer. Most of their race is good at heart, and they instinctively shy away from the dedication and bloody-mindedness required in a trained killer. Gnome spellslayers are extremely rare, but their innate talent for illusion and keen intellect makes them extremely deadly.

**Other Classes**

Spellslayers who serve in a guild typically operate in teams alongside rogues, fighters, and arcane spellcasters; and zealots work well with clerics of their faith. Self-trained spellslayers often cultivate one or more long-term false identities as deep covers. Lone spellslayers get along with most evil characters.

Paladins and good-aligned rangers and clerics never knowingly work with spellslayers, and often seek to bring these characters to justice. Though, truth be told, many a rogue upon whom a paladin has relied upon for years (in some cases) has been a spellslayer in deep cover.

Within the Arcane Age campaign setting for the World of Greyhawk, spellslayers are routinely trained from a young age with Suel arcanamachs and perhaps work most effectively with them.

**Game Rule Information**

Spellslayers have the following game statistics.

**Abilities:** Dexterity is crucial for many of a spellslayer's skills, but Intelligence is equally important to the spellslayer for casting spells, as well as crafting poisons and occasionally forging documents. 

**Alignment:** Any nonchaotic.

**Hit Die:** d6.

**Starting Gold:** 5d4 X 10

**Class Features**

All of the following are class features of the spellslayer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A spellslayer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. However, when using any armor that has a chance for Arcane Spell Failure, that chance remains.

**Mind Over Body (Ex):** At 1st level, a spellslayer learns to use his Intelligence to determine bonus hit points. For all subsequent levels, he uses his Constitution modifier, as normal. In addition, a spellslayer gains +1 hit point every time he learns a metamagic feat and gets a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class.

**Focused Mind (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a spellslayer is taught to focus his mental faculties to a razor edge; the spellslayer uses his Intelligence modifier in place of that from Wisdom for all [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks.

**Killing Blow (Ex):** At 4th level, a spellslayer gains the ability to make a coup-de-grace attack as a standard action once per day. This ability may be used when the spellslayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the spellslayer flanks the target, just like a rogue's sneak attack ability. During a surprise round, a killing blow attack can be made as a partial action. The spellslayer may make an additional killing blow attack every four levels thereafter. A spellslayer also gets his extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a killing blow.

Unlike a coup-de-grace attack against a helpless opponent, the spellslayer may use a damaging spell in place of a melee weapon though he must roll to attack normally. If his attack hits, he scores a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he still must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die.

Delivering a killing blow provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening foes (but not a [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] target) because it requires intense concentration. You can't deliver a killing blow against a creature that is immune to critical hits, such as a golem.

At 14th level, the spellslayer masters the killing blow and all such attacks receive a +2 attack bonus and no longer provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Bonus Feat:** Spellslayers may choose any of the following feats (for which they meet the prerequisites) as bonus feats: any metamagic feat, any opportunistic feat, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Improved Initiative (Feat)|Improved Initiative]].

**Rogue Talents**: As a spellslayer gains experience, he can learn a limited number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level, a spellslayer gains one rogue talent. He gains an additional rogue talent for every 4 levels of spellslayer attained after 2nd level. A spellslayer cannot select an individual talent more than once.

At 10th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a spellslayer can choose one advanced talent in place of a rogue talent.

**Sneak Attack (Ex):** At 3rd level, a spellslayer gains a +1d4 sneak attack. Any time the spellslayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the spellslayer's attack deals +1d4 points of damage. The extra damage increases to +2d4 at 9th level and +3d4 at 15th level. Should the spellslayer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, his extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, the spellslayer can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

A spellslayer can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the spellslayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The spellslayer cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

If a spellslayer gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack. Note that sneak attacks add into the damage of coup-de-grace attack (such as killing blows).

**Spells**

Beginning at 1st level, a spellslayer gains the ability to cast arcane spells. To cast a spell, an spellslayer must have an Intelligence of 10 + the spell's level. The DC for saving throws against spellslayer spells is 10 + the spell's level + the spellslayer's Intelligence modifier. 

A spellslayer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the table above. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.

A spellslayer may know any number of spells. He must prepare the slots for the spells he will cast that day ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and then spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the spellslayer decides which spell slots to prepare. At this time he also determines if any metamagic feats will be applied and at what levels.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric a  spellslayer need not prepare her spells in advance; only the slots. He can cast any spell he has recorded in his personal spellbook at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.

A spellslayer begins play with a spellbook containing 8 0-level arcane spells plus two 1st-level spells of his choice. The spellslayer also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new spellslayer level, he gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new spellslayer level) for his spellbook. At any time, a spellslayer can also add spells found in the spellbooks of other arcane casts (such as other spellslayers or wizards) to his own spellbook.

There are feats that can increase the number of new spells a spellslayer is able to learn.

In addition to being able to learn and cast spells from those available to sorcerers and wizards, the spellslayer can also learn and cast spells from the more specialized list used by common assassins. 

**Ex-Spellslayers**

A spellslayer who becomes chaotic loses the ability to make a killing blow and cannot gain more levels as a spellslayer. He retains all the other benefits of the class, including spells, bonus feats, and bonus languages.

**GM Note**

This class was originally based off the Assassin base class from *The Assassin's Handbook* from Green Ronin Publishing. It has been heavily modified to enable more spellcasting flexibility while restricting the number of spells that can be cast per day. This was done by radically reducing the original class's special abilities (bonus feats were lessened and also restricted and precision damage was reduced) as well as the number of spells per day and the number of spells gained per level. These changes resulted from player testing over a 14 year period. 

In the Arcane Age campaign setting for the World of Greyhawk, this class is restricted to the Suel Imperium. Players must choose to either belong to a Great House or if they desire, they may play a 'rogue' assassin' (i.e. one that is self-trained). Doing the latter requires the player to create at least one deep cover identity and maintain it at all times since such rogue assassins are highly illegal within the Imperium and are hunted down ruthlessly. GMs are encouraged to frequently (at least one encounter per game month) develop encounters with hunter-killer teams sent to remove such rogues unless they diligently maintain their covers.

In the Arcane Age campaign setting for the World of Greyhawk, this class uses the alternative metamagic system developed by Jim Butler in the place of the core metamagic system. It is recommended that players wishing to play this class speak with their GM and request that they be able use this system in the place of the core system.
