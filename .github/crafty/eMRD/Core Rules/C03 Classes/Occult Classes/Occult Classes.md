# Occult Classes
## Overview
Beyond the worship of the divine and the studies of arcane scholars lies the mysterious terrain of the mind, accessed through psychic magic. Classes that draw upon psychic magic do so via innate mental abilities, whether they directly cast spells, create elemental effects, or focus psychic energy through objects. Members of these occult classes find themselves drawn to the strange and the hidden; they have connections to the timeless [[Astral Plane]], the haunted bleakness of the [[Ethereal Plane]], and the history of the Material Plane chronicled as psychic impressions in places and objects. 

Psychic magic is a third type of magic that functions differently from arcane and divine magic. The rules for casting psychic spells appear on page 144 of Chapter 4: Psychic Magic (of *Occult Adventures*). The occult classes’ spell lists include many new spells from Chapter 4, allowing them to fully express their mental powers. These spells, like other new rules elements from this book, are marked with an asterisk (\*). 

**CLASSES** 

The six new classes presented in *Occult Adventures* use psychic magic. In most cases, this means they cast psychic spells. The new classes are as follows. 

**[[Kineticist]]**: With a connection to the elements, a kineticist can bring forth energy in the form of kinetic blasts. Instead of casting psychic spells, the kineticist uses unique psychic spell-like abilities called wild talents to manipulate elemental energy and matter. 

**[[Medium]]**: By contacting spirits in places of power, the medium allows the personalities of legendary heroes to overcome his own, vastly changing his abilities and spells. He holds seances to benefit himself and his allies. 

**[[Mesmerist]]**: A mesmerist’s piercing stare lets him insinuate himself into other people’s minds. A master of enchantment and illusion, the mesmerist controls and inf luences the behavior of others. 

**[[Occultist]]**: To make use of his powers, an occultist channels psychic energy into a varied collection of antiques and mementos with storied pasts. Every type of implement allows him to use a different school of magic. 

**[[Psychic]]**: With her incredibly potent mind, the psychic can cast spells that are more powerful than those of members of any other occult class. She accesses these spells through a specific discipline, and can bend and amplify psychic spells as she casts them. 

**[[Spiritualist]]**: Attuned to the spirits of the dead, a spiritualist forms a bond with a phantom—a returned spirit that has unfinished business but did not become undead. This spectral ally can alternate between forms, emerging from the safety of the spiritualist’s mind to take on an incorporeal form or an ectoplasmic body.
