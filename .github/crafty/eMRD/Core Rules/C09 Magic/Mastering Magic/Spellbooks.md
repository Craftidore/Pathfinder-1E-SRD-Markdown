# Spellbooks
## Overview
Each spellbook or formula book is a unique reflection of the personality and capabilities of its creator. Many of these tomes contain more than just spells, such as notes on the caster’s other research, personal diaries, naturalist sketches, or even political treatises. Some contain preparation rituals, each of which grants a boon—or sometimes a hindrance—to spellcasters who use the book to prepare their spells.

The sample spellbooks and formula books below each list a description of the book, information on the caster’s specialty school and oppositional schools (if any), the book’s spells, and its preparation ritual (if any). Some books also contain precautions against prying eyes.

Descriptions, protections, preparation rituals, and spell content can be mixed and matched as desired from different books. Higher-level books can easily serve for lower-level casters—just drop the spell levels that aren’t applicable and remove lower-level spells as desired. Similarly, if you desire longer books, combine two together or add spells or formulae of your choice to the desired levels. These books also work as spellbooks and formula books for new characters. Just copy the list, hand it to the player, and go.

A standard spellbook includes all cantrips from the *Core Rulebook* except those in the wizard’s oppositional schools. Books containing cantrips from additional sources are noted in the content description.

Each book features a value, which represents what a character must pay for the book on the open market, though finding a seller may be difficult. The character may sell the book for half that value. Any book with a preparation ritual has two sets of costs, one for the book without the preparation ritual, and one for the book with the ritual.

**Using Preparation Rituals**

When a spellcaster who prepares spells uses a spellbook or formula book with a preparation ritual, as long as he prepares at least three spells (not including cantrips) or formulae from the spellbooks, he gains a temporary boon granted by the ritual. The boon lasts until its effect is spent (as specified by the boon description) or the spellcaster prepares spells again (at which time it can be reapplied by preparing at least three spells from the book). A spellcaster can only take the effect of one preparation ritual when she prepares spells, no matter how many spellbooks with preparation rituals she uses to prepare spells. Spells in this section that are marked with an asterisk (\*) are detailed in Chapter 5 of this book, and those marked with two asterisks (\*\*) are detailed in the *Advanced Player’s Guide*. A superscript “S” (S) indicates a spell from the caster’s specialty school, whereas a superscript “OP” (OP) indicates a spell from the spellbook creator’s opposition school.

**Spellbooks**

**Defensive Primer (Level 1 Abjurer)**

**Apprentice Chap boo k of Rul Thaven (Level 2 Diviner)**

*This slim book is carefully but amateurishly bound, with leather*

*stretched tight across thin boards. The writing inside is fussy*

*and crammed together, with words that are occasionally illegible.*

*Eight of its pages contain spells; the final 10 pages are blank. A*

*portrait of a plain woman, unsmiling, has been bound into the*

*inside front cover.*

**Spells**

1st—*alarm*, *feather fall*, *obscuring mist*, *mount*, *shield*, *shocking*

**Tra veler’s Tom e (Level 4 Tra nsmuter)**

**Book of Harm s (Level 5 Evoker)**

*The leather wrapping of this book is of an indeterminate type,*

*and gives off a faint and unpleasant scent, as of charred meat.*

*damaging magic. A glittering rune in the cover’s center is shaped*

*vaguely like a lightning bolt.*

**Value** 485 gp (860 gp with

The damage you take cannot be reduced in any way.

**Lab Jo urnal of Constance Inflix (Level 5 Alc hemist)**

*The steel cover of this slim journal has taken its fair share of*

*abuse; acid scars and minor slag spots show where the journal*

*formula begins.*

**Value** 280 gp (655 gp with preparation ritual)

**Formula**

**Boo k of the Gra ve (Level 6 Necroma ncer)**

nitharit poison (contact; *save* Fort DC 13; *frequency* 1/minute

for 6 minutes; *effect* 1d3 Con damage; *cure* 1

0—standard plus *penumbra*\*

boon’s effect to breathe a 15-foot cone of rotting stench.

spends the boon. After this boon has been spent, you take

a –4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks until you

prepare spells again.

**Gr imo ire of Gl ittering Eyes (Level 7 Illusionist)**

*the pages sparkle and gleam in even the faintest light, and the*

*handwriting looks preternaturally clean.*

DC 16; on failure, the suggestion is for the reader to “Close

the book and leave”).

**Opposition Schools** Evocation, necromancy

**Prepara tion Ritual**

**Shadow Knowledge (Su)** The knowledge in this book clings

to your consciousness like the Shadow Plane itself. Unlike

other boons, you do not spend this one. Until you prepare

spells again, you are considered trained in all Knowledge

skills as long as the check pertains to the geography and

denizens of the Shadow Plane. If you are already trained in

the appropriate Knowledge skill, you gain a +2 circumstance

bonus on these checks instead.

**Master Boo ks of Rul Thaven (Level 17 Diviner)**

*This trio of books is bound in leather as black as a starless night,*

*clasped together with gleaming silver. The pages are filled with*

*notes and errata. The handwriting becomes more hurried toward*

*page* hides the 9th- and 7th-level spells, and the first book is

warded with *explosive runes* (Reflex DC 17).

rounds of *see invisibility* are used up, or the next time you

prepare wizard spells.

points or higher, you do not fall unconscious.

**Librar y of the Da ncer of Skins (Level 19 Universal ist)**

*This quartet of books is held together by a shining silver strand*

*wound around the four tomes and tied in an intricate knot. Inside,*

*author’s notes indicate clear excitement about her discoveries,*

**The Form ula e of Master Gebr (Level 20 Alc hemist)**

*These four cloth-bound books are neatly printed—as with a*

*printing press or some other form of mechanical transcription—*

*with a title page, a table of contents, and a useful cross-referenced*

*index. They have been treated well and are clearly reference works,*

*rather than laboratory notes; the writer was obviously a most*

*disciplined and focused inventor.*

**Protection** The cover is treated with tears of death poison

(contact; *save* Fort DC 22; *onset* 1 minute; *frequency* 1/

minute for 6 minutes; *effect* 1d6 Con damage and

can apply a discovery that you qualify for (but do not already

know) to a bomb. This does not allow you to stack non-stacking

discoveries on a bomb.

**Mastery of Word and Thought (Level 20 Enchanter)**

**Preparation Ritual**

**Curse of Names (Su)** When you are finished preparing your spells with this book, write the proper name of a single creature among the list of names in this book. As a swift action, when you are within 30 feet of the named creature, you can call out its name to bestow the curse of names on it. This spends the boon’s effect. The target creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, and a –4 penalty on all attack rolls against you, for 1 minute. When you activate this curse, the name is crossed out in the back of the book. That creature cannot be the target of a curse of names originating from you ever again. The penalties of two instances of curse of names on the same creature do not stack.
