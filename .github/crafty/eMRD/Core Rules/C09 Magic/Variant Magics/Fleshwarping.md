# Fleshwarping
## Overview
Fleshwarping is the practice of completely altering a creature’s physical and mental form by submerging it in strange reagents that loosen the strictures of flesh and mind and opens them to the manipulations of magic. The secrets of fleshwarping have arisen independently in numerous regions of the Inner Sea, from the laboratories of the [[Drow|drow]] in Zirnakaynin to the constantly churning vats of Oenopion in Nex. Certain demon cults, particularly those of Haagenti and [[Lamashtu]], have developed significant fleshwarping traditions as well, and the aboleths have practiced similar methods for eons. These methods have created countless warped monstrosities over this time, of which driders are perhaps the most well known and widespread. 

The process for fleshwarping is partly magical and partly alchemical, and requires the creation of a large quantity of magical fluid that must be held within a fleshwarping vat large enough to fully immerse the target. This alchemical solution is expensive, difficult to create, and expended after a single use on a target. The actual ingredients of the alchemical solution include a number of rare components combining various types of fungi, several fully pulverized and destroyed oozes, poison from various immense vermin, and many similar ingredients. The exact details vary from culture to culture, further adjusted by the nature of the changes the fleshwarper seeks to effect upon his subject. Creating enough fleshwarping agent to affect a single Medium or smaller creature costs 10,000 gp, takes 10 days of work, and requires the assistance of an alchemist or at least one spellcaster who has both the [[Brew Potion (Feat)|Brew Potion]] and [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]] feats. 

Once the fleshwarping reagent is ready, the fleshwarper must prepare the target by performing a number of surgical and magical operations to ready the body and mind. Often, tubes connected to pots of additional substances are inserted into the target’s body. The entire process is excruciatingly painful, and subjects who are not volunteers must be physically restrained. Further complicating the process is the simple fact that the subject must be alive or undead—attempts to fleshwarp dead bodies have to date met with failure. This invasive and grisly period of preparation takes an additional 1d6 days— each day the preparation continues, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain that cannot be magically healed without ruining the preparation. Although a DC 15 Fortitude save reduces this Constitution drain to 1 point, many subjects still perish before the work is done. Fleshwarpers tend to seek particularly healthy subjects for the procedure as a result. 

When the subject has been prepared, it is fitted with a breathing tube and immersed fully in the fleshwarping agent. Additional reagents costing not less than 2,500 gp are added to the mixture, and over the course of the next hour or so, the subject’s body changes and transforms. After an hour has passed, the subject takes a further 1d6 points of Constitution drain (a DC 15 Fortitude save reduces this to 1 point of Constitution drain). The fleshwarper must then make a DC 20 [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) check—others who aided in the creation of the fleshwarping agent can use the aid another action to increase the primary fleshwarper’s chances of success. If this [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) check fails, the fleshwarping attempt fails as well and the subject emerges from its horrific bath unchanged save for any Constitution drain it has suffered. If the check is successful, the fleshwarping transforms the subject into something else entirely, and its Constitution drain is healed. 

The nature of the transformation itself is generally left to the GM’s imagination—in the case of drow fleshwarpers, their methods reliably produce consistent results that depend on the subject’s race. Drow universally become driders, troglodytes become hulking reptilian monsters called ghonhatines, humans become sluglike mutants called grothluts, and elves become twisted and tentacled abominations called irnakurses (see *Pathfinder Adventure Path* #18 for more details on these horrors). Dwarves have proven weirdly resistant to drow fleshwarping, but other methods seem to work as well on them as anything else. 

For non-drow fleshwarping, you can either build entirely new statistics for the creature, you can apply the fleshwarped template (below), or you can use the amalgam creature template from Green Ronin’s *Advanced Bestiary*— this method works particularly well if the fleshwarper places two creatures into the same vat. Some believe that methods such as these are what initially created monsters like the bulette, the owlbear, or even the chimera.
