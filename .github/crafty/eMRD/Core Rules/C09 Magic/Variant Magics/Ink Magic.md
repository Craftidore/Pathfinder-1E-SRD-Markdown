# Ink Magic
## Overview
**Ink Magic**

Ink magic is an esoteric but complex art that involves the scribing of arcane ciphers—on scrolls, books, or even rocks—to cast spells. Those who practice ink magic are often called scriveners, and the history of their tradition is long and complex. More information about this strange but powerful alternative practice can be found on page 288, in the Symbolic Magic chapter (of Deep Magic).

The following spells in this chapter were created by scriveners, and they are marked with the \[ink] descriptor. They are available only to sorcerers and wizards.

1st Level—*harrying cipher, ink cloud, skinbook*

2nd Level—*mind’s eye map*
