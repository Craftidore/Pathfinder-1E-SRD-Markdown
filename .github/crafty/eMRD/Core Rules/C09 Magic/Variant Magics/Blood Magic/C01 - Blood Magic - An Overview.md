# C01 - Blood Magic - An Overview
## Overview
*According to the oral traditions of the Bl’taxu tribe, as well as the forbidden tome known to scholars and blood magicians alike as the Crimson Book of Keddah, blood magic’s origins lie at the very dawn of time. Though the accounts differ in detail, there is sufficient similarity between the two, and between other manuals of blood magic, to give sufficient evidence to support the theory known as the Elder Blood Hypothesis.*

*The Bl’taxu posit a primal Creator God, Bl’taaax, who fashioned the universe from his own blood. It is said that the first man and woman, Phlaz and Sela, were formed from the clots in Bl’taaax’s blood, and given the instruction to breed so they could appease him by blood sacrifice. Gradually it is said that Bl’taaax and his magical son Ar’taaax taught the firstborn descendants of Phlaz and Sela to become the sorcerer-chiefs of the tribe, with all other tribal members being either warriors or slaves, depending on their ancestry – the beginnings of a caste system.*

*Slaves worked the land and were sacrificed if they committed any crimes, or in any case when they became too old to work. Warriors captured new victims from other tribes. It seems the sorcerer-chiefs’ blood magic was powerful indeed, for soon their tribe dominated the surrounding area. Great festivals of sacrifice were held, with thousands of slaves and captives slain at a time. The rest of the tribe, warriors and slaves alike, witnessed these sacrificial deaths and celebrated with day-long revels and orgies. It should be noted that though the sorcerer-chiefs’ magic was supposedly in honour of their god, this could not be called ‘divine magic’ in the modern sense of the phrase. The magic was not granted by Bl’taaax; he seems to have derived some sustenance from the sacrifice, though not directly. Rather, it seems likely that as a god of blood, he gained energy from any spilling of life’s vital stuff, and indeed the tribe’s warriors also revered him and prayed to him to ask to be made mighty shedders of blood before every battle in which they fought.*

*Soon after the ascendancy of the Bl’taxu, something went very wrong for them. Precisely what is uncertain, but it may be said with certainty that it too, like their rise to power, involved the practice of blood magic. It is said that at the grandest festival, involving almost all the sorcerer-chiefs of the tribe and more sacrifices than had ever before been seen, something erupted from the earth, a great, faceless, ravening beast, all claws and teeth, dark red-brown like dried blood, and devoured slave and sorcerer alike. Since that day the remnants of the Bl’taxu have hated and feared blood magicians of all kinds. Such sorcerers inevitably feature as the villains of their folk-tales, evil not so much for their tendency to sacrifice innocents but for the danger they always pose of unleashing terrifying creatures of savage power, hungry for blood.*

*The Bl’taxu never again achieved anything of great significance, and indeed were persecuted by surrounding tribes for many hundreds of years after their reign of terror was over. However, those tribes’ traditions also provide some supporting evidence of the Bl’taxu traditions; to this day they speak of the Bl’taxu as the ‘People of Blood,’ blaming all local incidences of vampirism and lycanthropy on Bl’taxu evil.*

                                                                                                                              From Arcane and Divine: A Comparative History of Magical Tradition

                                                                                                                              By Grand Loremaster Farvol Thukir

It is said that blood magic is one of the oldest forms of arcane magic, based on the most primitive, but extremely powerful, rituals of spilling blood. To the savage, lifeblood is something that is clearly full of magical energy, for if you deprive anyone of it they grow weak and die, losing all their own life energy. Any magician who can access this energy must be powerful indeed, for he can tap into the secrets of life and death themselves.

The first blood magicians were primitive sorcerers, perhaps because the secrets of written language, and the wizardry based on it, were unknown in those days. Today many wizards also learn some blood magic, though sorcerers are still the most commonly met blood magicians. Something about its immediate and barbaric nature seems to appeal strongly to them, and their flexibility also means they can use the energy gained from human sacrifices more easily than can wizards, though of course not all practitioners of blood magic also engage in human sacrifice.

A great many philosophical systems have recognised the power in blood, likening it to the very force that animates living creatures. Blood magic also ties in with these ideas, and certain blood magicians approach it not so much from the perspective of the savage power it can offer, but in an attempt to discover more about the magical underpinnings of the world. Even these scholars sometimes find their lofty ambitions fallen by the wayside, as they delve a little too deeply into the practices of blood magic, discovering their own inner lust for power and sacrifice rather than any new insight into philosophy and science.

Perhaps their most terrifying practice though is blood sacrifice, whereby a skilled blood magician can gain immediate magical energy by spilling another’s lifeblood. Many a blood magician has done so in a time of necessity, for the blood of others is simply such a convenient and concentrated form of power. The magical ‘rush’ gained from blood sacrifice is almost irresistible, with very few practitioners managing to stop at that first, genuinely necessary sacrifice. . .

Other blood magic includes the creation of temporary magical animals from the caster’s own blood, or making larger, more permanent blood creatures by binding the life energies of a number of sacrifices together. This can produce some truly horrific creatures, including the dreaded bloodless and powerful blood golems.

Certain blood magicians experiment with the transfusion of blood of power, such as demonic ichor or celestial blood, into the magician’s own body or that of another subject. This can have a variety of effects depending on the type of creature and the quantity of its blood transfused.

Many of these practices, indeed all other than certain blood bonds, are regarded with fear and disgust by ordinary folk, though again primitives will be awed by a sorcerer who can turn his own blood into a graceful hawk or who has become part-demon through the addition of another creature’s blood to his own. Human blood sacrifice is almost universally reviled other than by the most savage tribes, but the occasional supposedly civilised society also makes use of or even relies on it, whether to keep the populace in their place, punish criminals, or both. In such a place the blood magician’s expertise may be welcomed, particularly when the authorities realise he can not only dispose of their unwanted citizens but also produce useful spells and other effects by so doing.

Most blood magic comes not in the form of spells but of bloodrites, which might be regarded as the primal ancestors of arcane spells – rather than codified, scholarly spells that call upon the powers of the universe for their effect, bloodrites always involve something of self-sacrifice, be it of lifeblood or one’s very essence.

**The Blood Plane**

Some scholars of blood magic talk of a demiplane known as the blood plane. This is said to be much like an elemental plane but devoted to blood rather than one of the conventional elements, and is postulated as the source of blood magic and the home of the dreaded blood guardians.

However, more traditional practitioners of blood magic such as the tribal sorcerers tend to scoff at such an idea, having little patience for the codified systems of classifying the other planes. They prefer to consider anywhere which is not the material world to be the Otherworld, or the spirit plane, or some similar primitive concept. Even if one was to accept the scholars’ codification of the other planes, they would be wary of categorising blood magic within any one such place, because they strongly believe it to be the primal magic that underpins the workings of the world itself. . .

In this instance the tribal sorcerers may be no less wrong than their civilised counterparts, since few scholars have ever attempted to travel to the blood plane, and if any have succeeded they have not returned. There has then been no proof that the blood plane exists at all, let alone that it is the source of the blood magicians’ power.

**Pitfalls of Blood Magic**

Blood magic, then, offers tremendous scope for gaining – and abusing – magical power. However, there are inevitable consequences. There are several perils and pitfalls that almost every practitioner of blood magic must face and overcome, if he is to reach the pinnacle of his art.

The first is the tendency to get addicted to the enormous rush of magical power that comes from sacrifice. Even the most mild-mannered scholar can suffer from this, for the very first sacrifice he performs, be it an act of absolute necessity or a carefully considered scientific experiment using a state-provided condemned criminal as victim, could be the beginning of a dreadful, irresistible addiction. Many a blood magician has found the road to hell paved with the very best of intentions.

The second is that almost all blood magic risks attracting the attention of the strange class of creatures known to scholars as blood guardians. The sorcerer or wizard who uses blood magic too often, or too indiscriminately, or too ineptly, may attract the attention of these fabled guardians of blood magic, terrifying creatures who track down those who are not ready for the power of the bloody tradition and tear them to pieces. 

The third danger is that those who readily open a vein for their magic will do irreparable physical harm to themselves. The body is simply not meant to take such abuse as being sliced apart on a regular basis. With the attentions of a good healing expert or a cleric with plenty of curing spells, this can be avoided, but perhaps the best option is simply to use blood magic sparingly. 

Fourthly and finally, those who prefer to practise their blood magic by torturing and sacrificing others, whether their fallen enemies or innocent victims, will soon find that civilised societies frown on such behaviour at best, and at worst actively hunt down and destroy its practitioners.

**The Arcane and the Divine**

Blood magic is exclusively practised by arcane spellcasters, usually sorcerers but sometimes wizards or others. Certain shamans, druids and evil clerics learn a similar magic, again based around sacrifice and magical oaths, but though related it is beyond the scope of this volume.

The greatest difference between the two approaches is the difference found between arcane and divine spellcasters everywhere: the former are largely concerned with either personal power or the advancement of science through experiment and discovery, whereas the latter are more interested in venerating a god or other higher power. The blood magic of each is tailored accordingly, and so the bloodrites and spells found in this volume relate for the most part to the concerns of arcane spellcasters, though in many cases a hangover from the more primitive origins of blood magic can be found, with bloodrites concerned with the maintenance of savage tribal structures and so forth.
