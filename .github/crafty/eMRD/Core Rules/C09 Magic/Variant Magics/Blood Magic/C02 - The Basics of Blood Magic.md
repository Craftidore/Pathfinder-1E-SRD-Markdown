# C02 - The Basics of Blood Magic
## Overview
This chapter details the various different sorcerers, wizards, and occasional others who learn blood magic, as well as how a character might track a mentor down and persuade him to pass on vital knowledge. It also looks at the mechanics of learning and using blood magic.

**Folk of Blood**

Perhaps the most well-known practitioners of blood magic are sorcerers from the most primitive tribes, half-magician, half-witch doctor, barely worthy of the name ‘sorcerer’ at all. However these are not always the most likely blood magicians to teach others their art, and so it is possible the more savage sorcerers will eventually die out. Most are secretive in the extreme, passing on their knowledge only piecemeal to one or two chosen apprentices from their tribe, who must give up all thought of individuality and obey their master in every way.

Those more bookish wizards who first made a special study of blood magic often prove more willing and even eager to find students of their dark art, often because they are power-mad and feel the need to have minions to assist them in carrying out their apocalyptic plans of conquest. Though supposedly more civilised than their tribal sorcerer rivals, these brilliant but often crazed wizards are if anything far more malicious.

Some wizardly blood magicians refrain from the more dangerous, disreputable and powerful practices, such as human sacrifice, but they are scarce. Few can learn a great deal of blood magic without feeling the need to gain still more power from sacrifice, and those who give in to temptation in this regard rarely find themselves able to put the metaphorical genie back in the bottle – one sacrifice leads to another, until eventually whole regions become depopulated, all for the power and bloodthirstiness of one wizard.

The more basic bonds of blood, such as blood brotherhood, also have a parallel tradition among barbarians and other traditional fighting-men of all kinds. These folk, who rarely have any true arcane knowledge or any ability to cast spells, are either continuing half-remembered primitive rituals or re-inventing blood magic from first principles. In any case the continued existence of this tradition seems to support the theories of those who regard blood magic as one of the most primal and ancient of magical paths.

Practitioners of blood magic are for the most part human, though certain tribal monsters such as orcs and hobgoblins occasionally learn a little, as of course do vampires. All arcane spellcasters can use blood magic, so long as they can find someone to teach them; the simpler rituals of blood bonding can also be learned by soldiers, warriors and other fighting-men, as described later in this volume.

**Finding a Teacher**

Blood magicians, especially the more advanced blood magicians, are by necessity secretive. They will always be feared, even in primitive lands, and right-thinking civilised folk will not merely fear them but actively attempt to destroy them. The blood magician who is open will likely attract the attention of whole chapter houses of paladins, as well as great mobs of commoners with torches and pitchforks. Those blood magicians who are sufficiently powerful as to laugh off such threats are perhaps too frightening to attract a great many apprentices, though those who do wish to be taught by such a practitioner are often sufficiently depraved that they no longer care if they are signing their very souls away to an eternity of servitude.

There are, then, several main paths to learning blood magic. Once a character has done any of the following, he is considered to have undergone basic training, so he may begin to learn the skills, spells and feats of blood magic:

- A sorcerer born into a primitive tribe may persuade the tribe’s chief sorcerer to teach him the secrets of blood magic.
- A sorcerer or wizard of Good or Neutral alignment who can track down one of the few uncorrupted blood magic scholars may find said scholar willing to take on an apprentice.
- An Evil sorcerer or wizard, or one who is Neutral but cares little whether he later becomes Evil, may with similar difficulty find and persuade a less scrupulous blood magician to take him on as a minion. . .
- A fighter or other warrior who is part of an old-fashioned army, tribe or mercenary company may learn some of the basics of blood oaths by oral tradition from his fellows.
- As blood magic is such an intuitive and in some respects obvious path to power, it is possible for a character to teach himself through research, though this is a long, costly and potentially dangerous method.

**Tribal Sorcerers**

As with the practitioners of any primitive magical tradition, tribal sorcerers fulfil a social niche as important as their magical role. Often they are the only magic-worker, arcane or divine, the tribe has; in this case they will be expected to make pronouncements on spiritual and mystical matters whenever any such issue arises. In tribes which also have a shaman, druid or savage priest of some kind, the primitive sorcerer often operates far more on the fringes of society, perhaps occupying a small hut on the edge of the tribe’s village, to which the locals come for charms and simple potions.

Another sorcerer born into such a tribe will quite commonly be expected to be taken on as an apprentice by the head sorcerer, though almost as often the established sorcerer will see any others as rivals and potential threats, seeing to it that they are exiled from the tribe as soon as their talents are obvious. The Games Master should determine which case applied to the character by having him make a Charisma check (DC 14) to have been accepted at an early age. Success indicates that his former master will be reasonably open to the prospect of teaching him blood magic – usually in exchange for suitable services or gifts, of course, to a monetary value equal to 2d4 x 100 gp.

A character who was rejected by the tribal sorcerer for any reason will never be taught, even if he later returns to the tribe more powerful than ever before. However he may elect to challenge the resident sorcerer, whether to a formal magical duel of some kind or a more mundane battle. If he wins, he may be able to force the losing sorcerer to teach him blood magic or other secrets, and even if he had to slay the resident sorcerer he will at least inherit his magical paraphernalia, perhaps making it easier for him to research blood magic on his own (see pg 10).

Sorcerers whose powers do not manifest until relatively late in life, such as characters whose first class was not that of sorcerer but who later multi-classed, may also return to the tribe of their birth and attempt to convince the tribal sorcerer to take them on. They typically have a more difficult time of it than do those who were his apprentices – a tribal member who was not an apprentice wishing to persuade the tribal sorcerer to teach him blood magic must make a Charisma check (DC 18) to do so. Every 100 gp worth of gifts offered to the tribal sorcerer will give the character a circumstance modifier of +1 to the Charisma check.

A character from outside the tribe may also attempt to persuade a tribal sorcerer to teach him blood magic, making a Charisma check as above, but with a DC of 20 for a sorcerer or 22 for a wizard. Every 500 gp worth of gifts offered to the tribal sorcerer will give the character a circumstance modifier of +1 to the Charisma check – tribal sorcerers are far more wary of gifts from outsiders than from the members of their own tribe.

**Convincing Tribal Sorcerers to teach Blood Magic**


| Situation | DC | +1 Circumstance Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| Former apprentice to tribal sorcerer | 14 |  |
| Late-developing sorcerer from tribe | 18 | Per 100 gp of gifts |
| Sorcerer from outside tribe | 20 | Per 500 gp of gifts |
| Wizard from outside tribe | 22 | Per 500 gp of gifts |

 A character from outside the tribe may also attempt to persuade a tribal sorcerer to teach him blood magic, making a Charisma check as above, but with a DC of 20 for a sorcerer or 22 for a wizard. Every 500 gp worth of gifts offered to the tribal sorcerer will give the character a circumstance modifier of +1 to the Charisma check – tribal sorcerers are far more wary of gifts from outsiders than from the members of their own tribe.

**Scholars of Blood Magic**

The very best, strongest willed blood magicians are able to retain a certain sense of scholarly scientific detachment, rather than getting sucked into an addiction to human sacrifice – or a worse fate. They tend to learn only blood magical rituals and spells other than those related to blood sacrifices, preferring the less dangerous bonds of blood and the creation of blood creatures, though a few also dabble in blood transfusions.

For a similarly scrupulous would-be blood magician, such a practitioner would be the perfect teacher, though they can be difficult to track down – even well-meaning scholars who claim to ‘study’ blood magic rather than practise it are often targeted by paladins and witch-hunters, for blood magic has a very bad name with the followers of most civilised religions. Thus the first task is to find the right teacher, usually through either personal contacts or covert questions in the right areas.

A Diplomacy (v3.5 Gather Information) check at DC 25 will turn up rumours of a blood magician, if the questions are asked in the right place - for example a tavern frequented by sorcerers, or a wizardly college. The DC rises to 35 if not asked in the right place, or in a small town where there is no real ‘right place.’ Failure by twenty or more indicates that the character’s enquiries have come to the attention of a non-player character who strongly disapproves of blood magic – a cleric or similarly religious person, or an official authority such as a town watchman. This non-player character’s reaction could be anything from attacking or arresting the character to simply giving a two-hour moral diatribe against blood magic and similar arcane practices – this could almost be worse than outright attack, particularly if the non-player character continues to keep tabs on the character.

At the Games Master’s discretion the rumours could be cryptic or fairly straightforward. Actually tracking down the blood magic scholar could prove an adventure in itself, or alternatively the character might find out a street address and contact name from the first person he asks.

Once a scholar of blood magic has been found, again it is up to the Games Master how willing he will be to take on an apprentice. Most will be delighted to find a fellow student of magical lore who shares their interest, but may become wary if it seems the character’s lust is for power, not for knowledge. The character may adopt one of two tactics at this point: either impress the scholar with his Knowledge (arcana) by discourse (DC 20), or Bluff his way through the conversation (DC 25). Success using either method will mean the scholar is willing to teach him.

**Blood Magicians of Evil**

Those who see blood magic as a means to an end, usually that of great personal power, may best be served by seeking out a similarly vile sorcerer or wizard, a process fraught with danger. A sufficiently powerful and evil blood magician will often be well-known in his local area due to simple notoriety, so he will be far easier to locate than the more cautious scholar of blood magic. Anyone the character asks about the blood magician will warn him to have no contact with one so diabolical.

Once such a blood magician has been located, he will usually test the character. Typical tests could include anything from a simple Charisma check or Knowledge (arcana) check, much as for dealing with shamans or scholars of blood magic (see above) to more commonly a practical test intended to see whether the character has the hard-heartedness necessary to become a true dark master of blood magic, such as capturing a former comrade or family member for sacrifice.

Anyone who fails this test, or demonstrates more basic failings (which are likely to be defined largely at the whim of the blood magician), will be taken captive and sacrificed. Blood magicians are nothing if not practical, and one of the reasons they are happy enough to test out prospective apprentices is that it provides a slow but steady stream of new sacrifices.

Those who pass will be taught blood magic, often all their master knows, but always at a price. Mere gold is not enough – the new apprentice will be required to enter into a formal blood contract with his master. Just how restrictive this contract is will vary from master to master, and can range anywhere between a simple two-way loyalty bond to a contract of indefinite servitude.

**The Way of the Warrior**

A fighter or other warrior who is part of an old-fashioned army, tribe or mercenary company may learn some of the basics of blood oaths by oral tradition from his fellows. In most cases this will cover only blood brotherhood, and occasionally blood tribes or blood drinkers. However, if the character is apt enough, this may be enough to assist greatly with learning other aspects of blood magic, as it is quite possible to deduce much of the rest from first principles once one knows a little.

Generally this route to knowledge of blood magic is not one that a character can deliberately quest or search for. Rather, he will run into it by chance, after he has already been part of the group for a while and demonstrated his loyalty, honour and reliability in a fight. The oldest, most experienced warrior of the group will not so much teach blood magic as supervise the rituals, and the other warriors if they so choose can attempt to learn from said rituals. In effect this is much like learning alone (see Blood Magic for One, below) with the advantage of regular exposure to at least some aspects of blood magic.

**Blood Magic for One**

Due to the primal, savage, and intuitive nature of blood magic, it is one of the easiest traditions for a character to teach himself, though the risks and costs of such a course of action are manifold. A character who does not have access to at least some hints about the basics is likely to spend several months of research before he can even begin to learn the bloody art, and may also put his very life in peril by inadvertently drawing the attention of one of the bizarre creatures that safeguard blood magic from dabblers and interlopers.

Any character who can cast 1st level arcane spells may attempt to research the basics of blood magic. At the end of each month of research he makes an Intelligence check (DC 15). Each month of research and study costs 500 gp, and the wouldbe blood magician must inflict 1d6 damage on himself each month of research as he attempts to master and control the magic inherent in his own blood. This damage heals normally.

Success indicates the character has completed his basic training and can learn blood magic by spending experience points as usual (see Learning Blood Magic, below).

Failure usually has no particularly malign consequences. Unless the character fails severely, he suffers no ill effects other than the usual loss of hit points and gold, and may try again the following month if he so desires.

A failure by ten or more (i.e. a modified result of 5 or less) results in the character suffering 2d6 damage that month instead of 1d6. Furthermore he must make a Will save (DC 12 + damage sustained) or attract the attention of a random blood guardian (see pg 40).

**Researching Blood Magic**


| Situation | Int Check <br>Circumstance Modifier |
|---|---|
| Has observed at least one blood magic ritual | +2 |
| Has participated in at least one blood magic ritual | +5 |
| Has access to the paraphernalia of a blood magician | +3 |
| For each book on the subject of blood magic owned and read | +1 |

**Blood Magic: Spells and Bloodrites**

As well as the more standard arcane spells, blood magic incorporates rituals known as bloodrites into its practice. Bloodrites are older, less formal dweomers than are spells, drawing their power directly from the wills and bodies of the participants rather than invoking elemental or extraplanar forces. 

Bloodrites may be learned by any character who can find a teacher. The character does not need to learn the bloodrite in place of a spell, feat, or anything else; it is additional to all these things. There is an experience point cost to learn each bloodrite, however, and most also have an experience point cost to cast them. Usually a teacher will charge the character 1d4 x (XP cost to learn) in gold pieces to teach him the bloodrite. Bloodrites never take up ordinary spell slots when cast – rather, casting them always involves a more serious sacrifice, either in the form of hit points of damage or in the form of a loss of experience points.

Each bloodrite has the following entries:

**Components:** As with spells, all bloodrites have certain components, usually verbal and somatic though sometimes a material component or focus is also required.

**Casting Time:** This is the amount of time the bloodrite takes, and functions exactly like the casting time of a spell, except that all the characters involved in the bloodrite must also be involved in casting it, complete with Concentration checks if they become distracted. This includes the subject or subjects, if the bloodrite has any. If the casting time is interrupted for any reason, including a failed Concentration check, the bloodrite fails, but with no cost in either experience points or hit points.

**Range:** As for spell ranges (see *Core Rulebook I*).

**Subject, Target, or Area:** As for spells.

**Duration:** As for spells.

**Saving Throw:** As for spells. For purposes of determining saving throws and dispelling or counterspelling only, blood rites are treated as arcane spells of the highest level the caster is able to cast. For example, an 18 Intelligence, 7th level wizard casts all his bloodrites as though they were 4th level spells. His bloodrites have a saving throw of 18 (10, +4 Intelligence modifier, +4 spell level).

Knowledge (blood magic) Check: Most bloodrites require the ritualist to make a Knowledge (blood magic) check at the conclusion of the casting time. If the check fails, so does the bloodrite. A failed bloodrite has no effect and costs no experience points, though the usual hit points are lost.

**Prerequisites:** Rather like feats, most bloodrites have prerequisites, usually including a minimum level of Knowledge (blood magic) and often a certain degree of arcane spellcasting capability.

**XP Cost to Learn:** The experience point cost that must be paid by a character who wishes to learn the bloodrite.

**XP Cost to Perform:** The experience point cost that must be paid each time the ritualist wishes to perform the bloodrite. A bloodrite with an experience point cost to perform of 0 may be freely cast at any time, so long as the ritualist spills his blood to pay the hit point cost as usual.

**Hp Cost to Perform:** The amount of the ritualist’s blood, measured in hit points, which must be spilled to activate the bloodrite. The hit points are always lost at the end of the casting time, just before the ritualist makes the Knowledge (blood magic) check (if any).

Note that as bloodrites are not spells, they are never affected by any spell resistance a creature might have. However, they can be counterspelled or dispelled as though they were arcane magic spells – see the Saving Throws entry, above, for determining the effective level of the bloodrite.

**Learning Blood Magic**

Once basic training has been completed, the character can learn Knowledge (blood magic) as a class skill (see sidebar). Furthermore he now has access to the other blood magic rituals, spells and feats listed in this book, subject to his meeting any prerequisites they may have as usual.

A character who has learned only a little about blood oaths, usually through learning from fighting-men rather than arcane spellcasters (see The Way of the Warrior, pg 10), may learn Knowledge (blood magic) only as a cross-class skill. In addition he may only learn the following bloodrites, and then only if his warrior group practises them: *blood brotherhood*, *blood tribe*, *bloody chalice,* and *blood vow*. However, if he is able to cast arcane spells, he may attempt to learn more blood magic by research or one of the other methods, as detailed earlier in this chapter.

**Knowledge (blood magic)**

This new skill is used both as a prerequisite for learning many of the various bloodrites, and to determine whether a character successfully casts a bloodrite. Furthermore, ranks in Knowledge (blood magic) indicate a character’s general understanding of the theories behind blood magic and of the legends and origins of this powerful tradition.

**Sample Knowledge (blood magic) uses and difficulty classes**


| **Use** | **DC** |
|---|---|
| Recognise a bloodrite being cast | 15 |
| Determine whether a creature touched is under the influence of a blood bond | 20 |
| Determine the nature of the bond affecting the creature touched | 30 |
