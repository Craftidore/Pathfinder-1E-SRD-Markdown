# Dwarven Magic
## Overview
**Dwarven Magic**

Dwarven magic takes many forms, but it has always grown from roots of stone and earth. Indeed, in Midgard, some of the mages of Allain call dwarven magic “lithomancy,” as it involves various stone magic and gem magic, and the crafting of runes as well as other deep-earth traditions.

The following dwarven spells can be found in the pages of this book. Although typically only dwarves know these spells, other appropriate characters may have access to them, at the GM’s discretion.
