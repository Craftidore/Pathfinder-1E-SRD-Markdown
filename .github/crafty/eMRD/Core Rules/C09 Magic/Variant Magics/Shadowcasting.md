# Shadowcasting
## Overview
Protection from the dark times of Earthfall was but one of Zon-Kuthon’s “gifts” to the terrified people of Nidal. To ensure the grip of his Umbral Court would remain forever unbroken, the Midnight Lord bequeathed to his mortal servants the secrets of blending shadow and magic. Though most shadowcasters practice wizardry (and indeed, wizards can choose the shadowcaster archetype if they wish to fully embrace this style of magic—see page 39), Zon-Kuthon’s gifts can be used by any spellcasting tradition. Beyond the borders of Nidal, cabals practicing shadow magic haunt the fringes of Galt and Taldor, some in service of the Midnight Lord, and others serving only their own lust for power.
