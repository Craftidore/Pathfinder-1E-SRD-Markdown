# Illumination Magic
## Overview
**Illumination Magic**

The school of illumination includes the study of star and shadow magic. This strange magic is rare outside the knowledge of a few elven wizards, who regard it as more a curiosity than anything else.

Indeed, it is considered a quirk to call it a separate school at all. More properly called the school of illumination, it is closely related to illusion and tangentially related to creation, conjuration, and necromancy, but it stands apart from all of them. The shadow fey are said to be its inventors, though this may be an idle boast—certainly shadow is the dark spring from which this magic flows.

**The Nature of Illumination**

Star and shadow magic uses the power of the Shadow Realm to generate spell effects, in the same manner that elementalists use the various elemental planes to generate their magic. Its spells power force effects, light and shadow spells, and limited forms of divination and magical compulsion.

But all this misses the point. The school of illumination is a mystery much like summoning, divination, and abjuration. Its practitioners believe that its wellsprings of power come from an understanding of the stars, their alignments, and the power they give an arcanist over every living creature. Light and space are theirs to bend and shape.

**Day and Night Casting**

Star and shadow magic is popular among explorers because of its power in the dark. Illumination matters to the caster of star and shadow magic. Whenever a spell from this school is cast at night or in darkness, the DC for its saving throw is affected as shown below.

The illumination at the caster’s location, not that of his target, determines the effect. (See Pathfinder Roleplaying Core Rulebook for illumination sources.)

**Table 1-5: Day and Night Casting**


| **Illumination Spell** | **DC Change** |
|---|---|
| Total darkness | +2 |
| Dim, moonlight, or shadowy light | +1 |
| Normal light, daytime forest, torchlight | 0 |
| Bright light, *daylight* spell, sunlight | –1 |

**Special Cosmic Events**

Stars surround nearly every known world that floats in the dark expanse of the void, and star and shadow casters are particularly attuned to the universe’s cosmic events.

The chart on the following page can be used to determine random special cosmic events. Each month there is a 5% chance that a special cosmic event occurs. When it does, roll on the following chart. Special cosmic events marked with an asterisk are spontaneous, and they cannot be predicted without magical knowledge. Other cosmic events can be predicted with a DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check. Such checks can be aided by accurate star charts and texts on astrological occurrences. Such tools can grants between a +2 to a +4 equipment bonus on the checks, depending on their quality (as determined by the GM).

**Table 1-6: Special Cosmic Events**


| **%** | **Event** |
|---|---|
| 10-40 | Lunar Eclipse |
| 41-50 | Solar Eclipse |
| 51-60 | Planetary Conjunction |
| 61-65 | Comet |
| 56-80 | Meteor Shower |
| 81-90 | Meteor Strike\* |
| 91-99 | Alien Incursion\* |
| 00 | Nova\* |

The effect and the duration of those effects for casters with the Star and Shadow Casting feat are listed below.

**Alien Incursion:** When creatures from the dark recesses of space invade a world, the world itself fights back. Such aliens suffer a –2 penalty against spells you cast. This effect lasts as long as the aliens have a foothold on your world.

**Comet:** Comets are harbingers of instability. Each time you cast a spell, roll a d4. On a roll of 1 your spell is cast at –1 caster level. On a roll of a 4 you cast your spell at +1 caster level. On a roll of 2 or 3, the spell is unaffected. A comet’s effects last 2d4 days.

**Lunar Eclipse:** These eclipses weaken the power of lycanthropes and undead. These creatures suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws against spells you cast. A lunar eclipse’s effects last for 24 hrs.

**Meteor Shower:** Meteor showers interfere with called or summoned creatures. When casting such spells, you are considered one caster level lower when determining the duration. A meteor shower’s effects last for 1d4 days.

**Meteor Strike:** A meteor strike can cause great damage, but increases the potency of damaging evocation spells. Evocation spells cast within the 24-hr. period after a meteor strike deal damage as if you were one level higher.

**Nova:** A nova is of great importance to diviners. Divinations spells are cast as two caster levels higher, and augury and divination spells never grant false results. A nova’s effect last for 24 hrs.

**Planetary Conjunction:** Planetary conjunctions affect the minds and behaviors of creatures. When casting mind-affecting spells, you are considered two caster levels higher when determining those spells’ durations.

**Solar Eclipse:** These eclipses plunge the world into darkness for a short time. While a solar eclipse is in effect, you cast spells with the darkness or evil descriptor at 2 caster levels higher. When you cast spells with the light or good descriptor, they are cast at 2 caster levels lower. Eclipses last only an hour or two.

**The School of Illumination and its Spells**

The illuminator focuses on the study of combining star and shadow magic. An illuminator possesses the following abilities.

*Insight of the Stars (Su):* The stars provide you glimpses of fate, granting you a +1 insight bonus to initiative. This bonus increases by 1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

*Orb of Light (Sp):* As a standard action, you can unleash an orb of light targeting any foe within 30 ft. as a ranged touch attack. The orb of light deals 1d6 hp positive energy damage + half your wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Bend Light (Sp):* At 8th level, as a swift action, you can bend the light around your body, causing your opponents to suffer a 50% miss chance as if you had total concealment, for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions as a *displacement* spell.

This school of magic is a very old set of themes and mechanics that I can date back to prior editions of the world’s oldest RPG and to Kobold Quarterly #3. It is very much a product of the Midgard Campaign Setting, and it is most associated with the shadow fey of that setting as well as the wizards of the Free City of Zobeck. The Courts of the Shadow Fey is an adventure that leans heavily on the shadow side, but illumination is a school that I think arises from themes of the earliest days of RPGs.

My goal in designing this magic was to take the elements of star magic and illusions that I love most and make them more about light and dark than about illusion and trickery. I’ve always had a thing for light and shadow as tools for games and flavor elements. Illumination magic is the product of that obsession.
