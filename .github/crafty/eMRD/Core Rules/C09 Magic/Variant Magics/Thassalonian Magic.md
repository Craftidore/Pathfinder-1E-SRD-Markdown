# Thassalonian Magic
## Overview
While the concept of wizard specializations along the classically recognized schools of magic certainly dates back to the time of Azlant, and perhaps beyond into the dim recesses of time before humanity rose to prominence, it was the runelords of Thassilon who explored school specialization to its full extreme. 

Focusing their research on the discovery that each school of magic was opposed by two specific opposition schools, the runelords developed methods of further enhancing their mastery over their chosen arcane specialties. Essentially, they defined these seven schools as much by what they couldn’t do as by what they could. By excising “impurities” introduced by fixed oppositional schools, they traded arcane versatility for greater strength in their chosen fields. The seven schools of Thassilonian Magic are presented here. 

**Envy (Abjuration)**: The art of suppressing magic other than your own. *Prohibited Schools*: evocation, necromancy. 

**Gluttony (Necromancy)**: Magic that manipulates the physical body to provide for an unending hunger for life. *Prohibited Schools*: abjuration, enchantment. 

**Greed (Transmutation)**: Magically transforming things into objects of greater value or utility, and enhancing the physical self. *Prohibited Schools*: enchantment, illusion. 

**Lust (Enchantment)**: Magically controlling and dominating other creatures to satisfy your desires, and manipulating others’ minds, emotions, and wills. *Prohibited Schools*: necromancy, transmutation. 

**Pride (Illusion)**: Perfecting your own appearance and domain through trickery and illusions. *Prohibited Schools*: conjuration, transmutation. 

**Sloth (Conjuration)**: Calling agents and minions to perform your deeds for you, or creating what you need as you need it. *Prohibited Schools*: evocation, illusion.

**Wrath (Evocation)**: Mastery of the raw destructive power of magic, and channeling those destructive forces. *Prohibited Schools*: abjuration, conjuration.
