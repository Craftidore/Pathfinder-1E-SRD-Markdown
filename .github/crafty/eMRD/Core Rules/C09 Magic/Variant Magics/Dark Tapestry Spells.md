# Dark Tapestry Spells
## Overview
**Dark Tapestry Spells**

Far away, in the cold darkness between the stars, lies the place many consider the heart of madness. It is called the Dark Tapestry, and although the alien beings that inhabit its vast void are terrible beyond comprehension, some spellcasters still choose to risk their sanity by drawing from its essence. Magic fueled by the Dark Tapestry is strange and corrupting indeed—so much so that the prolonged study of it has driven more than a few spellcasters to the brink of insanity and beyond.

Nevertheless, there is power to be had for spellcasters who dare to wade into the study of these arts. The following Dark Tapestry spells can be found in this chapter.
