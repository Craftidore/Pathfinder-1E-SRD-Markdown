**Description:** Boccob (BOK-kob) is known throughout the Flanaess, oversees the maintenance of magic’s existence on Oerth, and is interested in the creation of new magic items and spells (he is said to have a copy of every magic item made by mortals). He sees that Oerth’s magic is declining and will eventually fade away; he combats this effect and suspects that Tharizdun is responsible. He is distant from all other gods save his servant Zagyg. 

Shown in purple robes with shimmering runes of gold, Boccob carries the first *staff of the magi*; an eye within a pentagram is his symbol.

"Seek balance above good, evil, law, or chaos. Fight to push back the encroachment of good just as you would the oppression of evil. Magic is the most important thing on Oerth, and it must be preserved so that the balance can be preserved." 

Churches are protected from outside interference, and those within devote most of the time to research, particularly prophecies, which they guard carefully lest they fall into the wrong hands. In lands where the forces of Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil grow too strong, churches of Boccob are built to balance those forces. 

Clerics of Boccob create and study magic and divine the future. They leave their churches to root out rumors of lost magic items or spells, or to defend a magical place or item from destruction. Most clerics of Boccob are neutral, as extremism in ethos is frowned upon; they must maintain the balance between all alignments. Boccob's clerics are alert for signs of magical aptitude among youngsters, and they offer education to any youth they deem worthy of the privilege, whether noble or commoner. Clerics of Boccob almost always learn their prayers and sacraments in a classroom at a major temple-college. Anything that involves powerful magic involves the followers of Boccob. Creating or destroying artifacts, uncovering new kinds of magic, and traveling the Outer Planes are all common quests. A follower of Boccob might rescue a sorcerer captured by bugbears, brave a ruin to retrieve an ancient spellbook, or break up a cult of ur-priests seeking to cut off magic power to all but themselves. 

Prayers to Boccob have remarkably florid language. One common one begins, "Hail and I greet you, Boccob, Master of Magic, All-Seeing, All-Potent Revealer of Mysteries Beyond Compare. Whose Perspicacity knows no boundaries, most puissant protector of the eldritch realms, both known and unknown..." 

Boccob favors tall, round towers for his temples. Almost all have colleges for the study of both divine and arcane magic, and visitors are as likely to meet wizards as clerics inside. Most Boccob temples provide magic item identification and a number of divinations to the public. Boccob's followers celebrate powerful magic in all its forms, performing ceremonies when a magic item is made or a new spell discovered. Many high-level followers make pilgrimages to other planes to see magic in action. 

Boccob's clerics favor purple garments with gold trim; many are cleric/wizards or cleric/sorcerers. Most remain aloof from worldly affairs and devote themselves to magical research and to formulating prophecies. They share their knowledge of the future only sparingly, lest someone get the upper hand and upset the balance. Boccob's clergy actively create magic items. Most of Boccob's clerics keep busy rooting out bits of magical lore, recovering lost magical items, and investigating mysteries. They adamantly oppose any attempt to destroy a magic item or any magical place. Boccob's temples are usually located in urban areas. They are always well fortified to withstand outside interference, and they house extensive libraries. Most are also well equipped with various scrying devices and defenses. Visitors to a temple of Boccob usually get a cool greeting at best and are never truly welcomed unless they have some unusual magic item to offer for examination or money to spend on spells, magic items, or information.
