**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Camazotz (or "Zotz") is the Olman god of bats and horrible things that fly at night. He is always shown as a huge bat surrounded by a cloud of normal bats. Like many Olman gods, he has a dual aspect - the ravenous monster that spreads plague and sickness as well as the benign fliers that eat crop-destroying insects. It is possible that Camazotz gained popularity (or notoriety) due to the ancient bat-people that used to live in Hepmonaland. The priests of Camazotz delight in terrifying and intimidating others, although they also help relieve the people from blights of insects. They are not above kidnapping and sacrificing political enemies under the cover of darkness. Ceremonial garb includes a black leather helm decorated with animal teeth. In parts of the Amedio Jungle, his worship includes an aspect of vampirism and the underworld; there he is known as Zotzilaha.
