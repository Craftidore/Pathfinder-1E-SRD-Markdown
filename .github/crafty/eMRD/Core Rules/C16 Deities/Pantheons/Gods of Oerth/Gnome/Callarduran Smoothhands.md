**Special Notes:**

**Description:** The patron deity of the svirfneblin, Callarduran Smoothhands teaches his followers the best way to be safe is to dig deep into the earth and tell no one what you've found. Because larger communities of drow, mind flayers, and goblinoids often threaten svirfneblin communities, such secrecy is an effective survival strategy. Callarduran Smoothhands is as important to the svirfneblin as Garl Glittergold is to the other subraces of gnomes. Accordingly, most adolescent svirfneblins with an interest in religious matters wind up in Callarduran's priesthood. Callarduran's quests almost always involve an element of subtefuge. He often sends adventurers in magical disguise to infiltrate societies inimical to the svirfneblin, such as drow cities or mind flayer temples. Callarduran has an extensive liturgy of prayers, but they all share one common element: they're whispered, not spoken aloud. Callarduran's temples often feature echo chambers and other acoustical tricks that magnify sound of whispered prayers to him. In the larger temples, the whispered chants of an entire congregation can be as deafening as a shout. Callarduran has a number of protective rites that promise protection against the svirfneblin's many enemies. In svirfneblin communities, his clerics also handle birth, marriage, and funeral rites.
