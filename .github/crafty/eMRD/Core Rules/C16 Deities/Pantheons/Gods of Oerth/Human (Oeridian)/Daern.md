**Description:** Daern (DAY-ern) is a minor goddess best known for the magical instant fortresses that bear her name. As a mortal, Daern was responsible for building several famous fortifications, such as Tarthax (now known as Goldbolt) near Rel Deven and Castle Blazebane in Almor. Certain tomes found thoughout the Great Kingdom suggest that she may have played a role in the construction of the Imperial Palace at Rauxes, though this would have involved a visit to the Prime long after she was thought to have perished - shortly after the Battle of a Fortnight’s Length. Daern appears as a plain-faced Oeridian woman with dark hair and strong blue eyes. She is often associated with griffons, and her holy symbol is a shield hanging from a parapet. 

While fools believe that a good offense is the best defense, few have the strength or skill to make that true. Knowing yourself and your allies is necessary to plan an adequate defense. Make the most of your surroundings, for in any battle you should know your environment better than your enemy. A single shield can stop a hundred swords, while a foot of stone can break a thousand. Those who fight from behind a wall guard themselves and the helpless, and they draw strength from the stones upon which they stand. 

Daern’s clerics advise military leaders on the placement and construction of castles, fortresses, and towers, and teach defensive strategies to commoners living in areas frequented by monsters or war. They adventure in order to study defensive structures of all sorts, and to acquire funds to build their own tower or castle. Her clerics are valued by rulers wishing to establish stronger borders, and many encourage retired adventurers of this faith to settle in their lands.
