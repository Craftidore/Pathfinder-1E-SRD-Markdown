**Special Notes:**

**Description:** Chronepsis is neutral - silent, unconcerned, and dispassionate. He is the draconic deity of fate, death, and judgment. His form is colorless and without luster, marking him as an outsider to the struggles between the chromatic and metallic dragons. Chronepsis is a passionless observer of the world. He passes judgment on all dragons when they die, deciding where in the afterlife their souls should go. Chronepsis is uninterested in justice; he merely observes what is and is not. He is also singularly uninvolved in the activites of the living, and strives to remain so. It is said that only a cataclysm of world-shaking proportions would rouse Chronepsis from disinterest. Chronepsis has very few active worshippers and even fewer clerics, since most dragons don't possess the balanced outlook to avoid interfering in the events they observe. The followers of Chronepsis count other faiths neither as allies nor enemies. Of the other deities, only Boccob the Uncaring shares a similar outlook, but neither deity cares enough to forge an alliance.
