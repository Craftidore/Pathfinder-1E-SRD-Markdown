**Description:** Bralm (BRAHLM) is depicted as a middle-aged woman with dark blonde hair, sometimes with insect wings. She is friendly with rest of the Suel pantheon but has no close allies there because she judges others on ability, not age or status. Trithereon has earned her enmity because of his individualism, and fiery deities like Pyremius and Joramy are avoided because of her dislike of that element. Her symbol is a giant wasp in front of an insect swarm. "Everyone has a place in a society, and you must master your role even if you don't understand how it is important. Those who know more or are in superior positions must be obeyed; you can learn much by observing those around you. Work hard and be satisfied with your work. Hive insects follow this path, with some members sacrificing themselves for the betterment of the entire hive." Some splinter churches elevate insects as creatures to be worshiped and keep giant insects as guards or pets. Bralm's clerics act as overseers for complex tasks involving large numbers of people: military captains, farm overseers, mine controllers, slave drivers, and so on. They intercede to prevent destruction of crops by insects and are not above getting their hands dirty to get something done. They enjoy leading groups for the sake of imposing order on a group of independent-minded people. Their prayer times are twilight and dawn. Temples to Bralm are large convoluted affairs spread over a wide area. They rarely have interior doors (instead of locked passageways, guards are posted) and clergy of all levels and status may enter any part of the temple except personal quarters, which are normally very sparse. Built of rough stone, wood, mud, and other common materials, Bralm's temples are easy to repair if damage. The walls and rooms are arranged in repeating patterns that tend to confuse visitors. Bralm's worshippers are called Bralmi. The hottest day of Goodmonth is the holiest day of the year; clerics anoint themselves with sacred perfumes, build strange structures out of mud and sticks, and release small swarms of captured bees and wasps that cling to the scented worshippers but do not sting. Ceremonial garb includes brown or yellow robes, speckled with insect designs and embroidered in gold, green, and black thread. Jewelry of gold, green, and black metal is very common. During all ceremonies, the high priest wears a heavy gold pectoral with delicate crystal wings sprouting from the back. Adventuring clerics wear simple clothing of neutral colors, with a long shirt or jerkin of brown or yellow decorated with insect symbols.
