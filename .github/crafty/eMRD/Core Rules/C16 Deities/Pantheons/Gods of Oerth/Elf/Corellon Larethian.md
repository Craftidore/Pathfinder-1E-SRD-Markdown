**Description:** CorelIon Larethian (core-eh-lon lah-reth-ee-yen) usually appears as an androgynous elf clad in a sky-blue cloak and armed with a longbow and longsword (named Sahandrian, made from a star). He also wears a large circular amulet that bears his crescent moon symbol. He has a lithe and swift look about him, and his movements are both swift and graceful. Gruumsh, the deity of orcs, is his nemesis, and it is because of Corellon's battle prowess that Gruumsh is called One-Eye. Because elves are so long-lived, CorelIon's clerics can afford to spend years observing potential recruits before initiating them into the mysteries of the faith. Once a new cleric-to-he gets an invitation to join the clergy, he spends much time in meditation, quiet academic study, and artistic endeavors. Corellon wants to protect the elven people from harm, naturally. Beyond that, he wants to return to the elves the lost artistic masterpieces of their heritage, and he tries to thwart the drow at every opportunity. Corellon's followers find themselves protecting villages from gnoll incursions, stealing into evil temples to recover ancient elven tomes of lore, and destroying underground fortresses full of vampiric drow clerics. Corellon's prayers are always in Elvish. They often begin. "Hei-Corollon shar-shelevu," which means "CorelIon, may your grace grant,.." In an elven city, the temple to Corellon Larethian is often an alabaster wonder of minarets and parapets. In smaller communities, the temple often takes the form of a massive treehouse hundreds of feet above the forest floor. Most temples are eager to aid traveling elves in any way they can-and other races as well if they're fighting the hated drove. Corellon's rites are integrated with elven society. celebrating births, honoring deceased believers, and blessing marriages. Before a battle, believers often recite a Litany of the Arrows. Correlon's clergy often wear blue cloaks. Prayer time for clerics is at night, preferably when the moon is highest in the sky. Most of his holy days are tied to astronomical events and only occur every few years. 

Correlon teaches that "the elves are sculptors and wardens of magic's endless mysteries. Bring forth the beauty that envelops and let the spirit gambol unfettered. Seek out new experiences and new ways. Ward against those that would destroy what they cannot create. Commune with the natural and mystical world. Be ever vigilant against the return of the banished darkness, and be strong in heart against the corruption of the Spider Queen."
