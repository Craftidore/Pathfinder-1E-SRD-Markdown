**Description:** Aerdrie Faenya (air-dree fain-yuh) is the elven goddess of air and weather. The goddess takes her delight in the freedom of the skies, the music of wind instruments, and (sometimes) fairly severe and violent thunderstorms. She rarely grants omens to her followers, but if they come they arrive as whispering winds. Aerdrie appears as a tall, slim elven female with sky-bluse skin, feathered hair and eyebrows, and large wings. Her feathers seem to constantly change colors (blue, green, yellow, and white). The lower half of her body from hips down vanishes into a swirling mist, so she seems never to touch the ground. Exploration and mantaining good relations with avian races are a prime duty for her clergy. Development of musical skills on wind instruments and acquiring magical aids to flight are also considered important goals. Her clerics pray for their spells at dawn, when the first hint of a breeze often drifts across the land. The vernal and autumnal equinoxes are holy days. Aerdrie teaches that "the ever-changing reaches of the sky are the greatest gift of the Winged Mother. Take flight into her windswept embrace, and gambol amid the clouds. Honor those who dwell in the sky and cherish the birds dancing on Aerdrie's tresses. Change is beautiful and chaos births new life. Ascend, soar, glide, dive, and ascend again and relish the freedom that the Winged Mother bequeaths."
