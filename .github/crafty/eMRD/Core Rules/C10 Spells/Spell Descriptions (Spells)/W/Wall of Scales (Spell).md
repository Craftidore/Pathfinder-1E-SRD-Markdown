*You blow a dragon scale from your palm, and before you sprouts a wall of glittering scales, pulsing like living flesh.*

You create a barrier of living dragonhide that is anchored to the ground or floor, or between two vertical surfaces. A *wall of scales* is 1 inch thick per two caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wallâ€™s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. 

You can create a *wall of scales* in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion. It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or dome-shaped enclosure about yourself or another creature.

The wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spells and so forth. It is immune to acid and fire. In addition, the *wall of scales* has damage reduction 5/magic. For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level. Each 5-foot square of wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points are reduced to 0 is breached. It is not possible to break a *wall of scales* with a Strength check.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a *wall of scales*, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.

*Material Component:* A pristine dragon scale.
