*Rubbing the fleece between your fingers, you hold up your hand and shout an arcane word. In an instant, a wall of dark shadow appears in the indicated location. Dark whispers, barely perceptible, constantly issue forth from the far side of the wall, causing a cold chill to run up your spine.*

You create a barrier of ominous shadow that obscures vision and blocks line of sight, including darkvision. The wall is insubstantial, so creatures can move through it without penalty.

*Wall of gloom* counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.

*Material Component:* A bit of fleece from a black sheep.
