*The spirit of the trees manifests within your foe, slowing and transforming its body.*

You transform the subject’s body into wood from the inside out. Each round, the subject must make a new saving throw or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. Success halves the Dexterity damage from that round and ends the spell.

A subject whose Dexterity is reduced to 0 or lower by this spell transforms, along with its gear, into a mindless, inert, wooden statue. A creature in this state is not actually dead, but it does not register as alive either when viewed with spells such as *[[Deathwatch (Spell)|deathwatch]]*.

If the target already has Dexterity damage or a penalty to Dexterity, *wooden blight* is even more debilitating. Each round in which the subject takes Dexterity damage from this spell, its base movement rate is reduced by 5 feet for every point of Dexterity damage it takes (minimum speed 5 feet).

Creatures of the plant type are immune to this spell.
