The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of festering, stinking organic ooze to bubble into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.

A *wall of ooze* is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 50 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 0. A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.

Any creature touching the wall takes 2d6 points of acid damage per round from the corrosive, burning nature of the ooze. Only the surrounding material that the wall initially is conjured to touch—such as the floor or an adjoining wall—is immune to this damage. Furthermore, a creature that touches the wall must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed by the ooze. The wall then consumes the creature in 1d6 rounds, digesting it and adding the creature’s full normal hit point total to its own.

*Arcane Material Component:* A bit of an ochre jelly or gray ooze.
