*By crushing a live termite between your teeth and reciting the necessary words of power, you finish casting the spell.*

When you cast this spell, an insidious rot immediately taints any wooden object or plant creature you touch. Any unattended nonmagical wooden item smaller than 6 feet in diameter, or a 3-foot-radius volume of a larger wooden object (such as a wooden door), is instantly destroyed by *wood rot.*

In combat, you can use the spell to attempt to sunder any wooden or wooden-hafted weapon; the weapon or its wooden portion is destroyed on a successful melee touch attack. Attempting to sunder a weapon generally provokes attacks of opportunity, and *wood rot* has no effect on wooden or wooden-hafted weapons that strike you, even if you hold the charge.

Against wooden shields or armor, you also make a melee touch attack. Such targets too large to be destroyed outright take a â€“1d6 penalty to their armor or shield bonus on a successful hit and are rendered unusable if the penalty exceeds the bonus. Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of *wood rot*. Against plant creatures, *wood rot* deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack.

Against plant creatures, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, *wood rot* cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items.
