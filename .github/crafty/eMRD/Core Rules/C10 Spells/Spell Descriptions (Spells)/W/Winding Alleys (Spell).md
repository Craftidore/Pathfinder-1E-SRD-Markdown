The subject suddenly feels as if the walls of the city are closing in around him. If the subject fails a Will save, he believes he is trapped in a maze of narrow city alleys that twist and turn in circles. The subject remains in his current location, but is effectively [[Stunned|stunned]] as long as the spell lasts. Each round at the end of his turn, the subject may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check to escape the maze and end the effect. If the subject takes any damage, the spell immediately ends.

The spell must be cast in a community no smaller than a small town, otherwise it has no effect.
