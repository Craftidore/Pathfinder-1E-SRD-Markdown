*Exuding the stench of festering carrion, waves upon waves of buzzing, clambering, clicking bugs roil up from beneath the earth.*

You cause a thick but porous wall, alive with hungry bugs, to buzz and scuttle into existence. It provides concealment in both directions, imposing a 20% miss chance on any attacks passing through it. You cannot conjure the wall so that it occupies the same space as a creature.

Any living creature passing through the wall is subjected to hundreds of tiny bites. It takes 2d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1 round. Any creature becoming [[Nauseated|nauseated]] while moving through the wall can complete its move action, but cannot take a standard action in that round.

The *wall of vermin* is immune to weapon damage, though it can be affected by area spells and effects (such as *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]* or *[[Cone of Cold (Spell)|cone of cold]]*). It has 20 hit points and automatically fails any save. *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|Disintegrate]]* has no effect on a *wall of vermin*, since it is not a single physical object, though any wind of 50 mph or greater breaks it up for 1 round. Despite its appearance, a *wall of vermin* is not made up of natural creatures, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect animals or vermin.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Vermin 3 to Level.
