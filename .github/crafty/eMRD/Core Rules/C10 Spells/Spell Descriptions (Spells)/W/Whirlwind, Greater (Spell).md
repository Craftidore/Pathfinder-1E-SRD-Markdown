*Wind whips into a frenzy and becomes a tornado that wreaks destruction as you direct, flinging your foes into the air and destroying nearby structures.*

This spell is a more potent version of *[[Whirlwind (Spell)|whirlwind]]*. A *greater whirlwind* affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.

*Near the Tornado:* Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a *greater whirlwind* must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4×10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.

Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.

Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6×10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6×5 feet toward the twister’s center.

Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds. Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later.

*Inside the Tornado:* Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can’t do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a *greater whirlwind.* When the *greater whirlwind* ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6×5 feet away from the twister’s center in a random direction, and 4d6×5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can’t fly).

*Terrain and Structures:* The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble wherever it goes. Structures within a *greater whirlwind* take 2d6×10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.

No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A *greater whirlwind* extinguishes all flames it touches. [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen) checks are impossible within a *greater whirlwind.*

A *greater whirlwind* remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round.
