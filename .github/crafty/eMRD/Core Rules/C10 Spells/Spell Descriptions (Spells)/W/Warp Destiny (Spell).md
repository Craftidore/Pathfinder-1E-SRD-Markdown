# Warp Destiny (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[Destiny (Domain)|Destiny 6]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 11th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 11]]

**Casting Time:** 1 immediate action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Races of Destiny (WotC), pg. 169

You reshape your personal fate to potentially avoid some tragic action, but the ripples caused in your destiny have unpleasant side effects for a brief period. After learning the result of a saving throw that you have rolled, you may cast this spell to reroll the save, but with an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +20). Alternatively, if you are struck in combat you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against the attack (even if [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]]); if your new AC exceeds the attack roll, the attack misses you.

Casting this spell has a side effect: until the start of your next turn, you take a â€“4 penalty on all saving throws and to your AC.
