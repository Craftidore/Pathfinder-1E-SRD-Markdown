You speak up to five words, which are magically amplified to be heard by all hearing creatures within half a mile. All within the area hear the words as loud as you spoke them. The spell does not harm people who hear it and cannot transmit magical effects (such as a harpyâ€™s song, sonic spells, or charm effects), although a creature already affected by a magical effect (such as a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]*) could respond to a nonmagical trigger word deployed by a *warning shout*.

Anyone sleeping naturally (as opposed to magically induced sleep, such as from a *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]* spell) within the area is woken by the *warning shout*.
