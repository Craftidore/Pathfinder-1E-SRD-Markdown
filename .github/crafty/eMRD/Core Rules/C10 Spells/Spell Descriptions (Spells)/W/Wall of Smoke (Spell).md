*You wave your hand in a circular motion, and black smoke swirls into existence as a dark wall.*

This spell creates a thin wall of black smoke. The wall is stationary once created. The wall blocks sight to a limited degree. Creatures on opposite sides of the wall that cannot see over it gain concealment from each other. A creature can pass through a *wall of smoke*, but it must make a Fortitude save to avoid being [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1 round.

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* spell, destroys the wall in 1 round.

This spell does not function underwater.
