**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 368

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls.

You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. *[[Make Whole (Spell)|Make whole]]*, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive *warp wood* spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
