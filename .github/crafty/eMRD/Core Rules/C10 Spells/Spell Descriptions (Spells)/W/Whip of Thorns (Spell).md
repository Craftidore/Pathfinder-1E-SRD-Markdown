When you cast this spell, a piece of vine grows into a thorn-studded whip capable of savagely ripping your opponent’s flesh. You can wield this whip as if you were proficient, and it follows all the rules for a whip except that it deals 1d8+1 points of lethal damage per strike. Any time you strike a Large or smaller opponent successfully with the whip, you can release it and entangle the creature. Doing this ends the spell, but the thorny vine continues to wrap around your enemy until the opponent breaks free with a successful [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check (DC equal to the save DC of the spell). On a failed check, the creature takes an additional 1d4 points of damage and remains [[Entangled|entangled]]. On a successful check that exceeds the DC by 10 or less, the creature takes the additional damage in the process of freeing itself. A creature can also attempt to burst the vine with a DC 20 Strength check, although it takes 1d4 points of damage whether or not the attempt succeeds.
