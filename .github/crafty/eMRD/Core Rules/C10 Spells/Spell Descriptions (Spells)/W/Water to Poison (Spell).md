This spell transforms a volume of water into an equal volume of colorless, tasteless, ingested poison with a save DC equal to the spellâ€™s DC. When ingested, the poison deals 1 point of Constitution damage followed by 1d8 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. A successful Will save can negate each instance of damage. A single swallow (1 ounce) of poison is enough to affect a single creature; drinking more does not increase the effect.

**GM Note**
