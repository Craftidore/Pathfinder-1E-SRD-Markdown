*A blinding flash accompanies the completion of this spell as a wall of pure light springs into being.*

This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into being at any point within range. The wall is opaque to all other creatures, though you can see through it without difficulty. A *wall of light* has no physical substance and does not otherwise hinder attacks, movement, or spells passing through it, although it blocks line of sight for other creatures. 

A creature that passes through a *wall of light* becomes [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for the duration of the spell. Spell resistance applies when passing through the wall. Sightless creatures and those already [[Dazzled|dazzled]] are not affected by passing through a *wall of light*.

A *wall of light* sheds light equivalent to a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell. *Wall of light* counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.
