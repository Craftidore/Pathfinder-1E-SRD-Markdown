The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of woven, spiked chains to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though the caster can shape its edges to fit the available space.

A *wall of greater deadly chains* is 1 inch thick per two caster levels. The caster can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 20 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. This opaque wall sports loose lengths of [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] (1 for every 2 caster levels) that strike anyone within 15 feet of the wall.

These chains lash out as the caster directs, attempting to grapple those within their reach. Treat each chain attacking a particular target as a Huge creature (size modifier +8) with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength modifier equal to Str 20 plus the caster’s primary attribute modifier (Int for wizards, Cha for sorcerers).

For example, a 14th‐level wizard with a 20 Intelligence would create a *wall of greater deadly chains* able to attack up to 7 creatures a round with a grappling attack equal to 14 (base attack bonus equals caster level) + 7 (Str modifier of 23 \[20 base + 5 for Int modifier]) + 8 (special size modifier of Huge) for a total grappling attack of 29. Any target successfully [[Grappled|grappled]] takes 2d8 (as a [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] of Huge size) points of damage each round.

Creatures that are size Small or smaller can only be struck by a maximum of two chains in a single round. Medium creatures can be struck by up to 4 chains in a single round. Creatures that are size Large or greater can be struck by 8 or more chains in a single round.

A section of wall brought to 0 hit points is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall, the DC for the Strength check is 20 +2 per inch of thickness. Creatures who use a Strength check to breach the wall take 1d6 points of damage from the spikes and barbs covering the chains.
