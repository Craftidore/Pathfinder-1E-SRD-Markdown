A swirling snow and a strong wind arise around you or a creature you designate, and follows you or the creature from that point on. Characters in whiteout conditions take a –2 penalty to AC, lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, move at half speed, and take a –4 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks, as well as [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], and any other checks that rely on vision. The character also gains total concealment (50% miss chance). These effects end when the character leaves the area of whiteout. Whiteout conditions stack with wind and snowfall. Visibility is 5 feet.

In addition, any creature trying to move within the effects of this spell must make a [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check (DC 10 + caster level) every move action or wander lost inside the *whiteout.* A creature that fails can’t leave the area, but can move around within it. Groups of creatures roped or otherwise physically held together can use the lead creature’s [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check and stay together. A new check can be made once per minute.
