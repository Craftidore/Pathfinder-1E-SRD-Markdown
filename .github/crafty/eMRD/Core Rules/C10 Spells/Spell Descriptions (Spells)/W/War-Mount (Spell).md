*At your touch, your mountâ€™s flanks ripple, and its eyes blaze with newfound energy.*

You render the natural attacks of your mount or fiendish companion magical with a touch. The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its natural weapons for the duration of the spell. They are treated as both magic and good-aligned (paladin) or evil-aligned (blackguard) weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

If you cast this spell in conjunction with *[[Master Cavalier (Spell)|master cavalier]]* and *[[Phantom Charge (Spell)|phantom charge]]*, the three spells have a synergistic effect. See the *[[Master Cavalier (Spell)|master cavalier]]* spell description for details.
