You cast this spell upon one or more gems, imbuing them with healing energy. The gems leap from your hand, fly to the target, and begin orbiting the target’s head like *ioun stones*.

Each *warding gem* is a receptacle that holds 10 hp. The target can, as a free action, access the healing energy inside a *warding gem*; the energy is released as a purple-white arc of divine power that unerringly strikes the target, healing 10 points of damage. The target cannot choose to absorb only a portion of a warding gem’s healing power. A *warding gem* depleted of its healing energy instantly turns to dust. At the end of the spell’s duration, any unspent *warding gems* lose their healing power and fall to the ground; these can be reused for a later spell.

A single creature can have no more than five *warding gems* encircling it at one time. A *warding gem* has AC 24, hardness 10, and 10 hp; if it’s destroyed, any healing power contained within is lost.

**GM Note**

*House Rules:***** *Warding gems* that are created using burnt out *ioun stones* store twice as much healing energy as those created using normal gem stones and have a duration of 1 day/level. 

At the end of the spell's duration, any unspent *warding gems* created using this alternate material component instantly turn to dust just as if their healing energy had been depleted.

*Spell Secret:* A [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (religion) or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) allows the target to access all the healling energy inside all the *warding gems* circling them as a single free action.
