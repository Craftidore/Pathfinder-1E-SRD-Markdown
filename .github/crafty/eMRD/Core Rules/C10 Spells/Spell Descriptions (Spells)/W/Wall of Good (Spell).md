*You invoke the abjuration, and a cascade of brilliant white energy springs up in a wall that becomes invisible almost instantly.*

You create an immobile barrier that inhibits evil creatures. An evil summoned creature cannot pass through the wall in either direction, and any other evil creature must succeed on a Will save each time it attempts to move through the wall. If the saving throw is failed, the creatureâ€™s movement is stopped, and it can take no other action that round.

A *wall of good* must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If it is cast so that an object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails.

*Arcane Material Component:* Powdered silver worth 25 gp.
