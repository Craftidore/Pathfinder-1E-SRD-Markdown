The next spell you cast can be cast as a purely mental action, provided that it is of 5th level or lower and that you can whisper. It requires no somatic or material components, unless the spell normally requires a focus or an expensive material component (any component worth more than 1 gp). If the spell does require a focus or an expensive component, you can still *whispercast* it as long as you have the focus or expensive component on your person—the magic of *whispercast* causes the focus to be used or the expensive component to be consumed normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it.

If you do not cast a second spell while *whispercast* is in effect, you gain no benefit from casting *whispercast*.

Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move action or standard action, but you can take only one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn.

Tsochari spellcasters use this spell to permit spellcasting while they inhabit other creatures. It is also useful for grappled spellcasters.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Spells that are *whispercast* can be more difficult to identify via [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]; spells with a V or S component add an additional +5 penalty to the difficulty to do so.
