*Immense, partially translucent wings unfurl from behind you for an instant just before you jump, helping you achieve incredible distance or height.*

You evoke immense, partially translucent wings that grant you a +20 circumstance bonus on a [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Jump) check you make in the same round when you cast the spell. In addition, if you are intentionally jumping down from a height and you succeed on the DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Jump) check to do so, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 30 fewer feet than you actually did.

*Special:* A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, gains an additional +1 bonus on the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Jump) check for every two caster levels (maximum +10).
