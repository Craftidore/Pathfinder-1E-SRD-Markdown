*You utter a blasphemous phrase, and an ally erupts in pale gray flames. When the fire sputters out, you feel the power of corruption coursing through your veins.*

You deal 1d10 points of damage to a single evil creature within range that is a willing target. As a result, you gain a profane bonus equal to half the number of points of damage dealt. As a free action, you can use the bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, or skill checks. You can use as much or as little of the bonus as you wish, but you must declare the use before the results of the die roll are known. At the end of the spell’s duration, any unused bonus points are lost. The effects of multiple *willing sacrifice* spells are not cumulative; you can benefit from only one spell at a time.
