**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect:** Area of wind 10 ft. wide by 10 ft. high by 100 ft. + 10 ft./level long

You create a localized area of strong wind (approximately 30 mph). This effect has limited utility in battle , but is often used to propel sailing craft. By concentrating as a full-round action, you can change the direction of the wind by 45 degrees.

This spell is effectively identical to the spell-like ability that can be gained by a character with the lesser Mark of Storm (*Eberron Campaign Setting* 66), except the range and the affected area are different, as given above.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4 to Level.
