As *[[Weapon Augmentation, Personal (Spell)|personal weapon augmentation]]**,* but any character can wield the weapon you augment.

Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles rather than thrown weapons for the purpose of this spell.)
