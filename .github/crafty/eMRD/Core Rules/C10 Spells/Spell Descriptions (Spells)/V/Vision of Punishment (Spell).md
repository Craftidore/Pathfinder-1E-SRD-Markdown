You give the target a vision of what awaits it in the afterlife. Since most evil creatures go to an evil plane where they take the form of a lowly and much-tortured petitioner (barring special arrangements with evil gods or fiends that grant them higher status in the afterlife), this is usually a gut-wrenching vision. The target is [[Nauseated|nauseated]]; if it makes its saving throw, it is instead [[Sickened|sickened]]

*Sacrifice Component:* 1d2 points of Strength damage.
