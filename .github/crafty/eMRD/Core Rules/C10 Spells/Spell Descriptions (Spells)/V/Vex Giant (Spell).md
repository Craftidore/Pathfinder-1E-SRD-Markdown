The giants and their kin have long plagued the peoples of Varisia, particularly the Shoanti of the Storval Plateau. Among the various tactics and methods the Shoanti have developed to fight against their enemies, this spell is one of the most widespread today.

When you cast *vex giant*, your senses and reflexes become particularly honed against a single target within 60 feet, provided the target is at least one size category larger than you. You may select your focused foe as a free action when you cast this spell—switching your focus to a different foe within 60 feet is a move action. If a foe moves beyond 60 feet from you, you lose your focus on that foe, although you may regain it by moving within 60 feet and spending a move action. Although the name of the spell is *vex giant*, it works equally well on any foe that’s at least one size category larger than you.

Against a foe you are focused on, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity by moving through their threatened area. Additionally, the first successful melee attack you make against the foe in a round deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Finally, you gain a +4 insight bonus on all combat maneuver checks made against your focused foe.
