You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire. This spell functions like *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]*, except that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|damage reduction]] of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.
