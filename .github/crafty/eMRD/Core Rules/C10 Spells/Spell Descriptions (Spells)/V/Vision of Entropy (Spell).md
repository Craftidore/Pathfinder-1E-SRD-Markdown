*With a whisper and wave of your hand, you invite the targeted creature to behold the seething chaos of the infinite void surrounding the Abyss.*

Each round, the subject must make a successful Will save or be overwhelmed with madness and awe at the sight of the images of the Abyss forming in its mind. The subject becomes [[Shaken|shaken]] on the first failure, [[Frightened|frightened]] on the second, [[Panicked|panicked]] on the third, and [[Unconscious|unconscious]] on the fourth. A creature that faints from the effect of this spell remains unconscious for 1 hour or until revived. Any successful saving throw merely spares the subject the effect of the next failure for that round; any already existing condition persists until the next failure changes it or until the spell ends.
