*You invoke the power of this spell and a purple mist swirls around your opponent, weakening its mystic protections.*

This spell lowers the subject’s damage reduction by 5 (to a minimum of 5). For instance, if you successfully cast *vulnerability* on a dragon with damage reduction 10/magic, its damage reduction becomes 5/magic.

For every four caster levels beyond 9th, the subject’s damage reduction lowers by an additional 5: a reduction of 10 at caster level 15th and a reduction of 15 at caster level 19th.
