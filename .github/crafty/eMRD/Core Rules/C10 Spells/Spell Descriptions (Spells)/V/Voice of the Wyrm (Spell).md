*As you speak the words of the spell and inscribe the motions in the air, your voice deepens, taking on a resonance that makes the listener think of authority, power, and great age.*

You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks. You also gain the ability to speak and understand (but not read) Draconic.

At any time before the spellâ€™s duration expires, you can use a standard action to target a creature with a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* effect, which functions identically to the spell of that name, including range, duration, and other effects. Doing this causes the *voice of the wyrm* spell to end, though the *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* itself lasts for the normal duration thereafter.

*Special:* Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *voice of the dragon* to *voice of the wyrm* to avoid duplication.
