The creature gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your level. If a caster cannot overcome the target’s spell resistance, that caster suffers 2d6 points plus your level in damage as magical feedback.

As always, in order to affect a creature with SR with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the creature’s spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + caster level. A creature with spell resistance may voluntarily lower it in order to accept a spell.
