You shroud the target vessel in a cloak of illusion that causes it to appear as a completely different vessel up to one size category larger or smaller than its actual size. The details of its appearance, including the color and condition of its hull, sails, oars, flags and similar insignia, and all such similar details are up to you. You also may create illusory cargo or weapons, or disguise existing weapons or cargo. Creatures aboard the ship are not changed in appearance.
