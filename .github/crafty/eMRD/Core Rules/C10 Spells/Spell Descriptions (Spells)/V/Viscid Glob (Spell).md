*You speak the words of this spell and toss the small ball of silk in the air. It turns into a 5-foot-wide glob of dripping, green-gray goo, and the sticky mass rockets toward your target*.

When you attack with a *viscid glob,* you make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you miss, the glob might strike a nearby square or creature (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon). Once you have established the direction of the miss, roll 1d4 to determine the number of squares away from the target square that the glob lands.

A Medium or smaller creature struck by the glob must make a successful Reflex save or be instantly stuck in place. A stuck creature can speak but is otherwise limited to purely mental actions (such as casting spells with no somatic or material components) and attempts to free itself by means of a Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check (against a DC equal to this spell’s DC) made as a full-round action. A Large or larger creature stuck in the goo can’t move from the spot where it is glued, but it can otherwise act normally.

The glob dissipates when the spell duration expires. Until then, it remains sticky, and any creature touching it (for example, a creature attempting to pull out an ally) must make a successful Reflex save or become stuck itself. A creature stuck by such secondary contact is not trapped as thoroughly as a creature targeted by the glob, however, so the DC of the Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check required to get free is reduced by 5.
