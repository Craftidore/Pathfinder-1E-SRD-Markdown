*After making a dramatic gesture and uttering a few words of power, you close your eyes and open them again, revealing all that is hidden.*

All creatures and objects within a *zone of revelation* are made visible. This includes invisible creatures, as well as those on coexistent planes such as the [[Ethereal Plane]] and the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]]. Natives of these planes do not lose any abilities but are simply made visible.

Z*one of revelation* suppresses but does not dispel *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]], [[Etherealness (Spell)|etherealness]],* or other spells. Once a formerly invisible object or creature leaves the area, it becomes invisible again. Ethereal creatures in the spell’s area become nonethereal until they move beyond the spell’s range. 

*Arcane Material Component*: A handful of dust from the grave clothes of an undead creature.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 5, Witch 5, Wizard 5 to Level.
