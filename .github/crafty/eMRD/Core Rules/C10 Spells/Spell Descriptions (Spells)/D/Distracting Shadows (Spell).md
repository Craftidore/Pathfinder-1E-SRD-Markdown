This spell causes an object to radiate distracting shadows in a 10-foot-radius spread. Casual scrutiny of an affected area doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary; however, cracks, crannies, corners, hidden traps, and secret entrances or exits within the area become harder to spot.

Creatures within the area or looking into it are subliminally confused by the *distracting shadows*, and take a –5 penalty on all [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. However, the shadows do not provide sufficient concealment for a creature to make a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check.

*Distracting shadows* counters or dispels any *light* or *darkness* spell of equal or lower level.

*Distracting shadows* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell (minimum caster level 10th; cost 1,000 XP).

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Shadow dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Phiarlan or Thuranni), can cast this spell to fill a 20-foot-radius spread.

*Material Component:* A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.
