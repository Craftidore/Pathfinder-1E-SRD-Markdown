*You exhale a cloud of poisonous gas mixed with starlight motes that gravitate toward the spellcasters and summoned monsters within the cloud.*

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as *dragon breath*. When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon acts as a targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*.

For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the highest level spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell’s caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks. A creature’s magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected.

If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by *monster summoning*), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came).

For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

Spells are dispelled prior to the effect of your breath weapon being resolved.

You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell in the area that you have cast.
