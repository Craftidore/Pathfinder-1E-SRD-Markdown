*With a slight blue shimmer of energy and an audible pop, a number of creatures around you disappear and reappear in new positions.*

You instantly transfer any subject creature from its current location to any other spot within 30 feet. You must have line of sight to its new location. An unwilling creature can make a Will saving throw to negate this effect. The creature must be placed on solid ground capable of supporting its weight. If you attempt to place a creature within a solid object or into a space where it cannot fit, the spell fails.
