*After an instant to lock the appropriate image in your mind, your touch brings it to life, spreading a new image across the canvas of reality.*

*Deceptive facade* allows you to alter the appearance of another being or object. When cast on another creature, it functions as *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]**,* except that it can affect a target other than yourself.

When cast on an inanimate object or a structure, the spell allows you to alter the object's visible characteristics. You might change its color, make it appear to be made of a different material or substance, increase or decrease its apparent size by up to 10 percent, or modify other cosmetic details. *Deceptive facade* does not alter any other sensory properties of the target.

A creature that interacts with the glamer can make a Will save to recognize the illusion, just as with *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]**.*

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level.
