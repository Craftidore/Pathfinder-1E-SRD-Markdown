The subject gains the ability to see in total darkness, with no limitation to the range of vision. Terrain, distance, and line of sight are the only limitations to the subjectâ€™s ability to see, and the normal [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) check penalties apply on attempts to descry distant or small objects or creatures.

Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight. *Superior darkvision* does not grant the target creature the ability to see in magical darkness.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 for game balance.

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 4, Witch 5 to Level.

*House Rule: Superior darkvision* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
