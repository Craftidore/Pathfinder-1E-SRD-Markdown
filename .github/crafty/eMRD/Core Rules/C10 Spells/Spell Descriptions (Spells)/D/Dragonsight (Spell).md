*You cast this spell and your eyes enlarge and turn yellow and catlike, like those of a dragon.*

You gain the visual acuity of a dragon, including low-light vision, darkvision, and blindsense.

You can see four times as well as a normal human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light. Your darkvision is effective out to 10 feet per caster level. You take half the normal penalties for distance on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) checks.

Your blindsense has a range of 5 feet per caster level.

None of these effects stack with any low-light vision, darkvision, or blindsense you might already have.

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Dragonsight* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell cast by a caster of 15th level or higher, at a cost of 17,500 gp.
