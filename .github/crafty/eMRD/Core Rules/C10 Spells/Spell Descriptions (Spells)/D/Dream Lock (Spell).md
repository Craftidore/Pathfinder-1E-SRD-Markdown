*Your foe stops short as a nimbus of glowing light surrounds it. Where it fought you a moment before, it stands transfixed now, caught up in a waking dream.*

When you cast this spell, you wrap the subject creature in the otherworldly energy of the dreamspace, altering its perceptions and behavior. The creature enters a state of waking dreaming, and is [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round. Thereafter, until the spell's duration expires, the target is trapped in a waking dream, unable to differentiate the random visions of the dream from reality. The creature is treated as [[Shaken|shaken]], and all its opponents gain concealment.

Creatures that do not dream are subject to the effect of this spell unless they are also immune to enchantments or mind-affecting spells, powers, and abilities.

**Special:** If you cast this spell while in a dreamtouched state, you can partially direct the random visions that plague the target creature. This allows you to influence the actions of the target as if using a *suggestion* spell. The suggested course of activity continues for the entire duration of the spell.
