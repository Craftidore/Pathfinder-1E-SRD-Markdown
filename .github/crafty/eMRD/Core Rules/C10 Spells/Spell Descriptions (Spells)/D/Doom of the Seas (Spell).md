It is said that in the deepest recesses of blackwater caverns dwell krakens of immense power, horrific creatures touched by malevolent extraplanar powers. Though this might certainly be true, it is likely that most experiences with such creatures comes as a result of this spell.

With this spell, you summon a fiendish kraken from the depths. (The statistics block for this creature appears below.) The doom of the seas obeys you for the duration of the spell.

**Tentacles:** Tentacles and arms can be severed by  treating them as though they were weapons and sundering them. Tentacles have 20 hp, and arms have 10 hp.

**Constrict (Ex):** The Doom of the Seas deals automatic arm or tentacle damage plus constrict damage with a successful grapple check.

**Improved Grab (Ex)** To use this ability, the Doom of the Seas must hit an opponent of any size with its arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

**Ink Cloud (Ex):** The Doom of the Seas can emit a cloud of jet-black ink in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the creature normally uses to escape a fight that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness.

**Jet (Ex):** The Doom of the Seas can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, moving in a straight line at a speed of 280 feet. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Half-Fiend Traits:** Unlike most half-fiends, the Doom of the Seas does not possess wings. It does, however, have webbing between its tentacles that augments its swim speed. All the Doom of the Seas’ attacks are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Skills:** The Doom of the Seas has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
