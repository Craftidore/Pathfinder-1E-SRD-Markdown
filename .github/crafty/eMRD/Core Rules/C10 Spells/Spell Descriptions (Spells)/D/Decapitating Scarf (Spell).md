When you cast this spell, you flick a silk scarf at one creature within range, magically propelling it toward the target. The scarf assumes an iron-like hardness on the way, and then wraps around the creature’s neck. You must have line of sight to the target and hit with a normal ranged attack. If you hit, the target must make a Fortitude saving throw; failure indicates that the scarf has decapitated the victim.

A target creature that makes its save takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) before freeing itself from the *decapitating scarf.* Constructs and most undead (except vampires) are not immediately killed by decapitation, and take only 6d4 points of damage whether they make their save or not. Oozes, aberrations, and other creatures without a head are immune to the spell’s effects.

*Focus:* The silk scarf.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7 to Level.
