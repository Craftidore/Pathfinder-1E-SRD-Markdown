*You hold a dead firefly in your hand and as you concentrate, it dissolves into nothingness. Nearby, in a place of your choosing, a mote of light which can only be seen by arcane means appears.*

This spell creates a mote of light whose radiance illuminates a 30 feet radius but which is only visible by arcane means such as *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]**,* *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]**,* *[[Arcane Sight, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane sight]]**,* or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*. To all others, there is no visible effect. You can move the mote at the beginning of your turn as you desire, forward or back, up  ordown, straight or around corners, up to 60 feet per round. This is a free action. You may also direct it to hover near you at a set distance and it will move as you do, within the limitations of its own speed.

The mote is both invisible and incorporeal and can pass through objects and nonmagical barriers. It partially illuminates hidden (10 + your caster level + either your Intelligence \[for wizards] or Charisma \[for sorcerers] modifier is added to your [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check against an opponent attempting to hide within the area illuminated by the *dead light*) objects and creatures. Ethereal and invisible beings and items become visible (by arcane means) as insubtantial outlines. Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but any incorporeal or invisible creature illuminated by the *dead light* does not benefit from concealment, and so attacks against them suffer no miss chance.

The mote cannot be attacked or damaged, though *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* and similar spells can dispel it. The mote winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

Magical darkness from sources such as any of the [[Darkness Spells|darkness spells]] has no effect on *dead light* and impedes it in no way

This spell may be cast in conjunction with *[[Glowing Orb (Spell)|glowing orb]]*. When this is done, all of its effects become a part of the magical light source produced by that spell. If the glass sphere of the *[[Glowing Orb (Spell)|glowing orb]]* is destroyed, the mote of *dead light* also ends. Casting this spell in conjunction with *[[Glowing Orb (Spell)|glowing orb]]* produces a magical controllable light that lasts for one day per level of the caster (instead of the permanent light source *[[Glowing Orb (Spell)|glowing orb]]* usually produces). 

The spell effect produced by casting *[[Glowing Orb (Spell)|glowing orb]]* and *dead light* together may be made permanent via the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
