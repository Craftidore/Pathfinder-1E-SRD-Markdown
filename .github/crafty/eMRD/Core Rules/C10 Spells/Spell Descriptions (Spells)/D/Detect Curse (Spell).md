You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been cursed or carries a curse. You can determine the general nature of the curse with a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 20). In scanning a cursed scroll, you could learn that the curse causes misfortune to the reader, but you could not tell the specific effects. 

If you succeed at the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check, you receive a +4 bonus to your effective level when casting *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* on the item or person analyzed with this spell. 

Note: The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Cleric 3, Sorcerer 3, Witch 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
