As *[[Transmute Rock to Mud (Spell)|transmute rock to mud]]*, except it transforms ice to cold water (about 40° F).

The water remains until a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell or spell with the cold descriptor restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. The water will freeze again naturally depending on local weather conditions and the depth of the water, normally over the course of several hours or days.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Jhanifer's deliquescence* to *deliquescence* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Jhanifer's deliquescence* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. In that setting, this spell was created by Syluné in her guise as Jhanifer
