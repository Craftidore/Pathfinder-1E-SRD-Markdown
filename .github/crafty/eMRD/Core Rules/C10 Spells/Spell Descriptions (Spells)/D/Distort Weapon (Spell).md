This spell makes a weapon strike true against good foes. Any threat of a critical hit against a good foe is automatically confirmed, without a roll. The weapon can also harm good creatures that have damage reduction, as if the weapon had a +1 enhancement bonus. Individual arrows or bolts can be altered, but altered projectile weapons (such as bows) donâ€™t confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.

This spell has no effect on any magic weapon that already has a special ability related to critical hits, such as a *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* or *[[Vorpal (MagWpnSpcAb)|vorpal]]* weapon.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 1 to Level.
