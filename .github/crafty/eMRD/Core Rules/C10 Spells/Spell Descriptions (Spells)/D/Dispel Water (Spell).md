You call on the power of the waste to counter and dismiss water creatures, spells, and effects. However, *dispel water* cannot counter an instantaneous spell or effect.

You choose to use *dispel water* in one of three ways: to dry up a body of water, to counter a water-based spell or effect, or to dismiss an extraplanar creature of the water subtype.

*Dry Up Water:* This effect instantly destroys 200 cubic feet of water per level. Remaining water rushes in to fill the void. Cast in a large body of water, such as an ocean, the destruction of 1,000 or more cubic feet of water produces a strong current that pulls boats and creatures down. Creatures caught in the current must make a DC 20 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check to avoid going under. A creature that fails the [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check is pulled down to a depth of 10 feet per caster level and must hold its breath or begin to drown. The current might capsize vessels: The chance is 95% for a craft shorter than 20 feet long, 50% for one from 20 to 60 feet long, and 20% for one over 60 feet long.

*Counterspell:* Used in this way, *dispel water* targets a spellcaster and is c ast as a counterspell. It only counters spells and spell-like abilities that have the water descriptor, or appear on the Water domain spell list, or clearly involve water (such as *[[Create Food and Water (Spell)|create food and water]]**,* *[[Sleet Storm (Spell)|sleet storm]]**,* and *[[Wall of Ice (Spell)|wall of ice]]*). To successfully counter the other spell, you must make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +20) against a DC equal to 11 + the spellâ€™s caster level.

*Dismiss Water Creature:* Cast in this way, *dispel water* targets a single extraplanar creature of the water subtype within range. The creature can negate the effect with a successful Will save (and its spell resistance, if any, applies). If it fails to save or resist the spell, the creature is forced back to its home plane.
