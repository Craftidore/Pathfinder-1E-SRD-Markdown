*Your call for service immediately compels a nearby creature to hurry to your aid.*

This spell allows you to send out a call to the nearest intelligent creature. That creature receives one saving throw each day. If it fails, it must come to your location using the most expedient means available. The creature will not brave unnecessary harm, but it will disregard minor hazards (a snowstorm or traveling through bandit territory) to reach its destination. If the creature makes a successful save, it is free to act normally that day, but it must continue to make a new save each day for the duration of the spell. Once the creature arrives in your location, its reaction is improved by one step, but it is in no other way bound to you.

*Special:* Only dragons can cast this spell.
