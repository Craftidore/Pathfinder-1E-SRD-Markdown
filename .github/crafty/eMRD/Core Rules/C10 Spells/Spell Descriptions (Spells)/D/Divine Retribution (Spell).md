*You feel your deity’s hand hovering over you, ready to smite anyone who harms you.*

For the duration of this spell, any creature that attacks you—whether with a physical attack, a spell, or by other means—is struck by a retributive effect immediately after you’re affected. The retribution deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level you possess (maximum 15d6) and 1d4 points of ability damage. The precise nature of the damage and ability damage are depend upon your deity, as given in the table below, but the damage is always one-half energy and one-half divine power. A successful Will save halves the hit point damage and negates the ability damage. Once the retributive effect takes place, the spell ends.

| [[Bahamut]] | Cold | Dexterity |
| [[Boccob]] | Electricity | Intelligence |
| [[Corellon Larethian]] | Acid | Wisdom |

If you do not worship a deity, choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own. You must make this choice when you cast this spell for the first time and cannot subsequently change it, unless your alignment changes in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable.

You can have only one *divine retribution* spell in effect at any time.
