All that occurs in the depths of the Underdark is witnessed by the stone. Over the ages, an infinite legion of events has come to pass, and in their passing they have left their mark upon the stones of the Underdark. The *[[Stone Tell (Spell)|stone tell]]* spell allows you to "tap into" this resonance of events to a limited extent, but this bonding is only a scratching of the surface of the strange phenomenon known to a few as the *deepsong*.

With this spell, you can attune your mind so you can experience the *deepsong*. The *deepsong* can be seen, felt, heard, and tasted, and it even makes itself known in more mystical ways to the subject of this spell. If you are above ground, the *deepsong* is muted and difficult to hear, and you quickly become oppressed and despondent, suffering a -4 morale penalty on all checks and attack rolls.

While underground, however, you are filled with a sense of belonging and welcome as the susurrus of the *deepsong* envelops you. This grants a +2 morale bonus on all skill checks and attack rolls. While underground, you can also speak with the stones, which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete descriptions if asked. You can also gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following subjects: the general layout of caverns and tunnels, plants and fungi, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of elemental creatures, and the presence of powerful abominations and undead. Note that a stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from providing the details you are looking for (as determined by the DM). You can speak with natural or worked stone.

*Focus*: A 5-pound lump of stone harvested from a depth of at least two miles below ground and that has never been exposed to the light of the sun, moon, or stars.
