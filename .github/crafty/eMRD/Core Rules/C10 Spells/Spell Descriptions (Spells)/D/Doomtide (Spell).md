*You fill an area with illusory black, creeping mist that vaguely resembles thousands of slender grasping tentacles.*

Creatures within the area must make Will saves or be [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round. Any creature moving into the mist, or a creature that begins its turn in the mist, must succeed on a Will save or also be [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round.

The mist filling the area obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment.

When you cast the spell, you decide if the effect remains stationary or if its point of origin moves straight away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round.

A moderate wind disperses the effect in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round.
