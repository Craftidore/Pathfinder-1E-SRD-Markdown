Your target's currently equipped weapon gains +1 weapon dice multiplier. A weapon that deals \[1d6] per hit will deal 2\*\[1d6] instead, while a weapon that deals \[2d4] damage per hit will deal 3\*\[3d4] damage instead. This affects base dice associated with a weapon any time they are rolled.

This spell's target is the creature holding the weapon, not the weapon itself. If the target changes its weapon, the *deadly weapons* effect is moved to the new weapon.
