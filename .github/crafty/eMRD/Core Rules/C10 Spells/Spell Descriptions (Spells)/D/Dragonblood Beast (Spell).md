*You toss a pinch of dragonshard dust into the air and call upon the power of the constellations. Motes of light, colored like your dragonmark, swirl around the target creature as it assumes a more dragonlike form.*

The subject gains the dragonblood subtype as well as one or more of the following physical traits chosen by you at the time of casting.

**Dragon’s Scales:** Dragonlike scales give the target a natural armor bonus equal to +1 per two caster levels (maximum +10). If the animal already has scales, its own scales become more resilient.

**Dragon’s Teeth:** Damage from the target’s bite attack increases by one step, as if the creature’s size had increased by one category. To determine the amount of the increase, fi nd the bite attack’s damage on one of the two progressions given below and improve it to the next higher die value.

*Progression 1:* 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6.

*Progression 2:* 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, 6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

If the target does not normally have a bite attack, it

does not gain one from this spell.

**Dragon’s Wings:** These wings give the target a fly speed of 90 feet (poor). If the target already has wings, they transform to look more like dragon’s wings, but its fly speed and maneuverability remain unchanged.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Handling casts this spell at an increased caster level. The increase in caster level depends on the strength of the caster’s dragonmark.


| **Dragonmark** | **Caster Level** |
|---|---|
| Least | +1 |
| Lesser | +2 |
| Greater or Siberys | +3 |

*Material Component:* A pinch of Siberys dragonshard dust (if the caster has a true dragonmark) or Khyber dragonshard dust (if the caster has an aberrant dragonmark).

*Dragonmark:* Any true or aberrant dragonmark.
