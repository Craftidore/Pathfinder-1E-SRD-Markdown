This spell enchants one or more daggers with sustained telekinetic energy that allows them to fly about and attack targets within range of the spell as the caster desires. The damage done by each dagger is normal, unless it is enchanted prior to casting this spell or while attacking by means of a *[[Magic Weapon (Spell)|magic weapon]]*, *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]*, or a similar magic.

The caster of the spell can direct each dagger in the swarm to attack a single target within range (as a free action) and can move the *greater dagger swarm* to another target as a move equivalent action during their turn. Unlike the *[[Dagger Swarm (Spell)|dagger swarm]]* spell, the *greater dagger swarm* can be used to flank or sneak attack, with each dagger in the swarm maintaining the critical threat range of the dagger used. If the daggers are directed to a target beyond the spell’s maximum range, they cease attacking and return to hover over the caster, awaiting a command to attack another target. 

The daggers attack using the caster’s base attack bonus plus his key ability modifier for spellcasting.
