You surround yourself with a palpable aura of draconic fear and dread. Living creatures within this aura that are normally immune to fear or mind-affecting abilities lose those immunities against your spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that create fear effects, as well as any [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks you attempt to demoralize foes.

If you have the antipaladin aura of cowardice class feature, this spell instead changes the penalty imposed by aura of cowardice to â€“6 for its duration.
