*You toss the powdered dried carrot into the air as you cast this spell, and it vanishes. You choose yourself as the spellâ€™s recipient and your eyes begin to glow with an alien purple luster.*

The subject gains the ability to see 90 feet in total darkness and ignores the 20% miss chance normally present in shadowy illumination (such as might be created by a *[[Darkness (Spell)|darkness]]* spell). *Deeper darkvision* is black and white only but otherwise similar to normal sight.
