*The vital spots on your foe seem to call out to you, guiding your weapon of their own accord.*

You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the actions and physiology of your foes. Your next attack (if it is made before the end of your next turn) is considered a death attack, without the need for the standard 3 rounds of observation. All other rules for a death attack, such as determining success and damage dealt, apply as normal.

If you don't have the ability to deliver a death attack, this spell has no effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Wizard 4 to Level.
