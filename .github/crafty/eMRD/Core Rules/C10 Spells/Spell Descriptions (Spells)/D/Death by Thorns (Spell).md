The caster causes thorns to sprout from the insides of the subject creatures, which writhe in agony for 1d4 rounds, incapacitated, before dying. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell cast on a subject during this time can eliminate the thorns and save that creature. Creatures that succeed at their Fortitude saving throws are still incapacitated for 1d4 rounds in horrible agony, taking 1d6 points of damage per round. At the end of the agony, however, the thorns disappear.

*Corruption Cost:* 1d3 points of Wisdom drain.
