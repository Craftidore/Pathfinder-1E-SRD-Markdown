*You understand your companions clearly enough, but judging by the expressions of those around you, nobody else knows what is actually being said.*

The subjects of the spell can speak about anything they like, but to everyone else, they sound like they are holding a mundane conversation about the weather, the taste of the food, local politics, and similarly banal topics. The illusion also modifies facial expressions and mouth movements to match the illusory words spoken. Anyone who spends at least 1 full round studying the conversation is allowed a Will save to disbelieve the illusion.

Subjects of the spell know the gist of what the illusory voices talked about during the duration—that *is,* they know the topics covered—but not the precise phrases or details.
