The caster lashes with her weapon (or punches with her fist), sending forth a bright, sparkling sphere of purple energy. It is not electricity, it is not negative energy; it is pure magical energy.

The caster must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit with this spell. The blast deals 1d10 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d10). This is raw magical damage, so all forms of energy resistance are ineffective against it.

Anything (with the exception that nothing living, undead, a magical construct or in the possession of another) may be used as the material component, which must be in one of the caster's hands at the time of casting).
