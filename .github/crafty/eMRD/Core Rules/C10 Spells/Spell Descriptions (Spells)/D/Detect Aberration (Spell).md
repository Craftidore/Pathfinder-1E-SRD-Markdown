You can detect the presence of all aberrations in the area. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of aberrant life.

*2nd Round*: Number of different aberrant auras and the strength of the strongest aura. If you detect overwhelming aberrant power with this spell, and the Hit Dice or level of the aura’s source is at least twice your character level, you are [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round and the spell ends.

*3rd Round*: The strength and location of each aura.

**Aura Power:** An aberrant aura’s power depends on the type of creature you’re detecting and its Hit Dice; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one power category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. A humanoid with the Aberration Blood feat detects as Faint even if it has more than 3 Hit Dice.


| **Hit Dice** | **Strength** |
|---|---|
| 1–3 or lower | Faint |
| 4–7 | Moderate |
| 8–13 | Strong |
| 14 or higher | Overwhelming |

**Length Aura Lingers:** How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:


| **Aura Strength** | **Duration** |
|---|---|
| Faint | 1d6 minutes |
| Moderate | 1d6 × 10 minutes |
| Strong | 1d6 hours |
| Overwhelming | 1d6 days |

Each round, the character can turn to detect aberrant auras in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Purity 1 to Level per Complete Guide to Beholders.
