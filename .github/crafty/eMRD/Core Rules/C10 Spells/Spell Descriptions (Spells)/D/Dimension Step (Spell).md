*All the creatures you target with this spell gain a dark, shimmering pattern of runes on their shoes and feet. The runes blaze with arcane light for a moment. Less than a second later, the targets have shifted position on the battlefield.*

This spell allows your allies to make a short teleport. All creatures targeted by this spell can teleport a distance equal to their base land speed. A target can teleport to any square within its line of sight. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can teleport up to a ledge, down to the base of a flight of stairs, and so forth as long as it observes the restrictions and limits given above.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* “Base land speed” is the character’s speed without any enhancements save those from race, class, and feats. Magical items and effects do not apply here.
