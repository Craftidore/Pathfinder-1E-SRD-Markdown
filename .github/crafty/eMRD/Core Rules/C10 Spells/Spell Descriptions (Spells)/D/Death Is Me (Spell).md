You must cast this spell on a dead creature of a similar type as you (i.e, humanoid). While doing so, you must be able to simultaneously place one hand over the target's face and one hand over your own face. The creature must have been dead for no more than 1 hour per caster level. Almost instantly you exchange features with the creature. You appear as the creature in every way (ie., gender, size, facial features, etc.) as when it was alive. If using this spell as a disguise you gain a +20 competency bonus to the skill check. When the spell expires, the illusion instantly fades from both of you.

**GM Note**

Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with it (such as by touching you or examining your face closely).

*Spell Secret:* This spell may be extended by the caster placing both hand over his own face while the previous casting of *death is me* is still in effect. Doing so requires a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 25) and extends the spell by one hour per level of the caster.

It is rumored that some wily assassins have used this spell to perpetrate a disguise for weeks, months or perhaps even longer.

This spell is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with *[[Masking Aura (Spell)|masking aura]]*.
