You briefly glance into the target's life strands and temporarily disrupt those that tie into critical events in his life that granted him the experiences and lessons that form the foundation of his training. The target suffers a ‐6 penalty to all attacks, checks, and saves. In addition, a spellcaster loses the ability to cast his highest level spells. For example, a 9th‐level wizard loses the ability to cast 5th‐level spells during this spell's duration.

Alternatively, you can seek out the event that granted your target a particular item. You may cause that item to disappear immediately and remain out of existence for the duration of the spell. You could, for example, temporarily sever the strands of a knight's armor, leaving him standing in battle without protection.

This spell represents a major violation of the past. When casting this spell, the caster must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or suffer 5d8 points of damage as time itself assaults him.
