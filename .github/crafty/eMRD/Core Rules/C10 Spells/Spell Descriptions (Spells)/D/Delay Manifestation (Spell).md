You prevent the subject creature from manifesting as a ghost for the duration of the spell. If the subject dies, it appears on the [[Ethereal Plane]] as normal, but cannot enter the Material Plane while the spell is in effect. This spell works only on an ethereal ghost or a living creature with a physical body; it cannot be cast upon the body of someone who is already dead, because this spell affects a creatureâ€™s soul and a dead body has no soul to affect.
