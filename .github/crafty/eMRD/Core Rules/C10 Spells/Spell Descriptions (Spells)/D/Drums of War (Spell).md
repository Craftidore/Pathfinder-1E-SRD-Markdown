When a bard casts *drums of war* and plays her instrument, the spell transforms that music into an ominous cadence of drumbeats that fills enemies with doubt. All enemies within range of the spell take a â€“2 penalty on their attack rolls and saving throws as long as the *drums of war* continue and for an additional 1 round per level afterward. Deaf enemies and enemies under the effect of a *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell are unaffected by this spell.

*Focus*: A masterwork musical instrument, which must be played.
