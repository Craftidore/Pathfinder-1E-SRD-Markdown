The caster makes one creature or object radiate special darkness called *[[Darklight (Spell)|darklight]]* in a 5-foot-radius/level sphere. This spell is most useful in a large, naturally dark area. Within the *[[Darklight (Spell)|darklight]]* sphere, the creature touched (or in possession of the object touched) can normally see in the light can see, even though there is no light. Only creatures and objects in the sphere can be seen, unless other observers can naturally see in the dark. Thus, while the creature affected by the *greater darklight* in the sphere can see each another within the sphere, a creature standing outside the sphere can neither see the creature in the sphere (assuming it doesn’t have darkvision), nor can it be seen by him. A creature with darkvision standing outside the sphere could see those within the sphere.

The *greater darklight* spell’s sphere is invisible in normal light and unlike the *[[Darklight (Spell)|darklight]]* spell does function in magical darkness.
