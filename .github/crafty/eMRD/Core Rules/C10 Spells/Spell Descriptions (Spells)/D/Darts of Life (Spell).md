*Small orbs of light circle your head. With a gesture, you cause one to spin off and strike your friend, healing him of damage.*

You create ten gently pulsing darts of pale blue light that orbit your head like *[[Ioun Stones|ioun stones]]**.* As a free action, you can launch one dart per round at an ally you designate within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three darts per round at one or more designated allies within range. As a full-round action, you can launch all remaining orbs at one or more allies within range.

Each dart heals 1d8 points of damage the target has taken, as though it were a *cure* spell. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell damages them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance to this effect, and you must make a successful ranged touch attack for each dart you attempt to launch against such a creature.
