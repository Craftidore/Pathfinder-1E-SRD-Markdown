*A translucent shield of turquoise energ y shaped like your dragonmark springs into existence to protect you.*

The *dragonmark shield* hovers in front of you and moves with you. It negates *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]* attacks directed at you. In addition, it provides a shield bonus to AC and a bonus on Reflex saves based on the strength of your dragonmark.


| **Dragonmark** | **Bonus** |
|---|---|
| Least | +2 |
| Lesser | +3 |
| Greater | +4 |
| Siberys | +5 |

The shield bonus to AC applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since the *dragonmark shield* is a force effect.

The *dragonmark shield* has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

If you use an immediate action to invoke the *dragonmark shield*, it disappears at the end of your next turn.

*Dragonmark:* Any true dragonmark.
