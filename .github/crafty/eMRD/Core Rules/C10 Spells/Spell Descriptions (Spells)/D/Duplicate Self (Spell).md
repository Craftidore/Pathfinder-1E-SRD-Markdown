You create a temporary duplicate of yourself and your gear. This is not a *[[Clone (Spell)|clone]]*—you control the duplicate as surely as you control yourself, for you and it are one person: one mind with two bodies. Both you and the duplicate can do anything that you can do, independently. For example, if you are an 18th-level wizard, so is the duplicate—you can both cast spells, communicate with your familiar, walk across the room, use items, and so on. In any given round of the duration, you can both take independent actions; thus the duplicate can cast a spell while you use a wand. You and the duplicate do not need to stay close to each other. If you create a duplicate, you can have it step through a magic *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* to explore what lies beyond, while the “real you” stays safe on this side. You share the same thoughts—your thoughts are the duplicate’s. The duplicate is an exact replica of you as you are at the moment you cast the spell. If you are down 11 hit points and 1 point of Constitution, so is the duplicate. If you are diseased, so is the duplicate. The duplicate does not carry lingering spell effects (neither beneficial ones, such as *[[Cat's Grace (Spell)|cat’s grace]]* or *[[Stoneskin (Spell)|stoneskin]]**,* nor harmful ones, such as *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* or *[[Doom (Spell)|doom]]*), even if you do when you cast the spell. After the duplicate is created, you can cast spell effects on it (or the duplicate can cast them), but even then, spell effects are not necessarily shared by both of you. The duplicate cannot be commanded to hurt you any more easily than you can be commanded to harm yourself.

Spells cast by either the duplicate or you come from your spell total. For example, if you have one *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* spell prepared, when the duplicate casts the spell, it is no longer available to you. Charged items (or items or abilities with a number of available uses per day) that you or the duplicate use count against the total number of daily charges or uses.

If the duplicate dies, the spell duration ends. If you die, the duplicate becomes the permanent version of you, its gear becomes the “real gear,” and your gear disappears. You suffer an immediate loss of 2d4 × 1,000 XP as you transition your soul into the new form. The duplicate is now you (and can cast *duplicate* again).

You cannot have more than one duplicate at a time (and a duplicate cannot have a duplicate). This spell cannot be made permanent, other than by your own death, as mentioned above.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *duplicate* to *duplicate self* forcampaign continuity.
