*The daggers in your hands glow with a soft golden light as you complete the spell. They feel as if they have become a part of your body.*

While this spell is in effect, if you make a full attack while holding a dagger in each hand, you gain a +3 insight bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Armor Class.

The magical energy that permeates your daggers while this spell is active allows you to deflect the magical energy of spells. When wielding two daggers, you gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level.

The spell focuses your concentration so that when you devote all of your attention to defense, you can turn the force of most blows away from your body with your daggers. When wielding two daggers and using the total defense action, you gain both the spell resistance benefit described above and damage reduction 10/magic.
