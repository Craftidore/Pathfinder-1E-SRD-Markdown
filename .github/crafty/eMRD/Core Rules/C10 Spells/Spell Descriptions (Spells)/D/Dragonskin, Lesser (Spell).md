*You say nothing, but make the motions in the prescribed pattern and hold the dragon’s scale aloft. Your flesh erupts with hard, colorful scales*.

Your skin toughens and becomes scaly like that of a chromatic dragon, of a color that you select. You gain an enhancement bonus to natural armor equal to +1 per two levels (to a maximum of +5 at 10th level), as well as energy resistance 10 against the type of energy appropriate to the color you select: acid (black or green), cold (white), electricity (blue), or fire (red). Your energy resistance increases to 20 at 10th level.

*Special:* Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *dragonskin* to *lesser dragonskin* to avoid duplication.
