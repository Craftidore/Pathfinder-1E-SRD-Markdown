You can sense the presence of dragonmarks. The amount of information you receive about a particular dragonmark depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 

*1st Round:* Presence or absence of dragonmarks.

*2nd Round:* Number of dragonmarks (on creatures or objects) in the area, and the type (aberrant, least, lesser, greater, or Siberys) of the most potent dragonmark.

*3rd Round:* The location and type of each dragonmark. If the objects or creatures bearing the dragonmarks are in line of sight, you can attempt [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks to determine the name of the spell-like ability granted by the mark (*Eberron Campaign Setting* 47 for the appropriate DC). If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you also learn whether the markâ€™s spell-like ability has any remaining uses for the day.

*Arcane Material Component:* A scale from a true dragon.
