*This spell arouses a zest and appreciation for life in the targets. The targets are distracted as they study the shapes of the clouds, the texture of tree bark, the patterns carved into a stone wall, the temperature and scent of a breeze—anything and everything gets their attention, if just for a moment.*

The targets of this spell must succeed on a Will save or lose themselves to the urge to experience nearly everything. Failure indicates the creatures take a –4 penalty on all Concentration and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5 Listen, Search, and Spot) checks, and can take only a single standard or move action each round, but not both. Creatures with more than 6 HD are unaffected.
