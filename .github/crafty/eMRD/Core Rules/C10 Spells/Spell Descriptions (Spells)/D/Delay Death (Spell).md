*You gesture toward your ally and call upon the power of your beliefs. A soft, golden glow appears on your companion’s chest, around his heart.*

The subject of this powerful spell is unable to die from hit point damage. While under the protection of this spell, the normal limit of –9 hit points before a character dies is extended without limit. A condition or spell that destroys enough of the subject’s body so as to not allow *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* to work, such as a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* effect, still kills the creature, as does death brought about by ability score damage, level drain, or a death effect.

The spell does not prevent the subject from entering the dying state by dropping to –1 hit points. It merely prevents death as a result of hit point loss.

If the subject has fewer than –9 hit points when the spell’s duration expires, it dies instantly.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Destiny 3 to Level per Cityscape.
