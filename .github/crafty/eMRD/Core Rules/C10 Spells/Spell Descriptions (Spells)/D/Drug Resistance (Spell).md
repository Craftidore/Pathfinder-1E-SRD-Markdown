The creature touched is immune to the possibility of addiction to drugs. He still experiences the negative and positive effects of drugs during the spellâ€™s duration. This spell does not free the target from the effects of an addiction already incurred. If the spell ends before the effects of a drug wear off, the normal chance for addiction applies.
