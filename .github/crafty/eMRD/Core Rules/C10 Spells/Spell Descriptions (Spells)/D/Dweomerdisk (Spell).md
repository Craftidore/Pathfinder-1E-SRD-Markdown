# Dweomerdisk (Spell)
## Overview
[[Conjuration Spells|Conjuration]] ([[Creation Spells|creation]])

**Level:** [[6th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 6]], [[6th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 6]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 11th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 11]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a golden egg worth 100 gp.)

**Range:** Touch

**Effect:** One disk

**Duration:** Permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw:** See text

**Source:** Lost Empires of Faerun (WotC), pg. 

This spell conjures a small disk, about 1 foot in diameter and 1 inch thick, made of a material that resembles rose-tinted eggshell. Once you summon a disk, a single spell of up to 5th level can be cast into it, either by you or by another spellcaster. If no spell is cast into the disk within 10 minutes of its creation, it vanishes into nothingness and the spell is wasted.

The disk stores an imbued spell indefinitely until it is shattered (a standard action requiring only 1 point of damage or a DC 5 Strength check). At that point, the spell immediatdy takes effect as if it had just been cast by the spellcaster who first placed it in the disk. Touch-range spells and spells that have specific targets (such as *[[Cure Critical Wounds (Spell)|cure critical wounds]]* or *[[Expeditious Retreat (Spell)|expeditious retreat]]*) are targeted upon the creature or object that shattered the disk, while area and effect spells are triggered as though the broken disk were the spell's point of origin. For example, a stored *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* would detonate in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the disk, whereas a *[[Flame Blade (Spell)|flame blade]]* would appear in the hand of the creature that shattered the disk. If the spell stored in the disk does not have a valid target (such as a disk imbued with *cause critical wounds* that is broken by a falling rock), the spell simply fails to manifest and is wasted.

**GM NOTE**

This spell is known as *Shalantha's delicate disk* in the Forgotten Realms.

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Shalantha's delicate disk* to *dweomerdisk* for campaign continuity.

A caster may only create a maximum of one disk per caster level. Any created after that maximum number are lost unless the caster also expends 100 XP as part of the casting process.

Throwing a disk (range increment 5 feet after the first 10 feet) in order to break it requires that it be thrown against a hard surface, in which case there is a 90% chance it will break.

Due to the utility of this spell (allows 0-5th level spells to be stored indefinitely and used by anyone without a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check), *dweomerdisks* sell (when they can be found) at 10 times the cost of a scroll bearing the same spell.

*Spell Secret:* Some spellcasters have learned to cast a variant of this spell that is much more economical with regards to size. Making a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) allows the caster to store the spell casting into a *dweomer egg* (a robin egg sized variant of the *dweomerdisk*). A single check is made each day and affects all castings of the spell for that day. This variant of the spell is especially useful when the *dweomer eggs* are stored in an extradimensional space where there is no risk of damage.
