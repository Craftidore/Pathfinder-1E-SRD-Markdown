*A longing for battle fills you as you complete this spell. Upon touching the intended weapon, the feeling fades even as a dull red aura encompasses the weapon.*

For the duration of the spell, the weapon’s threat range is doubled, and its critical threats automatically confirm, so every threat is a critical hit. The latter effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits.

Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as this spell and the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

**GM NOTE**

*House Rule:* Level changed from Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3, to Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 for game balance due to existing *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]* spell. 

*Spell Secret:* Casting *dolorous blow* (with a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check DC 35) on a weapon already under the effect of a *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]* spell removes the multiple effects restriction; allowing the *dolorous blow* affected weapon to stack effects (such as the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat) which improve threat range as well as magical effects related to critical hits.
