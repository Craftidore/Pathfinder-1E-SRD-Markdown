While this spell is in effect, all single-target damage up to 15 points per level (300 points maximum) dealt to the caster is duplicated against the attacker. Area effects, damage from environmental effects, or injuries from effects the caster controls cannot be duplicated in this manner. In other words, only effects where the spell or attack specifically targeted the caster and no other targets can be duplicated. If the attacker is protected from, immune to, resistant to, or weak against the source of damage (as per the original spell, not *death's favor*), apply those effects as well. The effects of this spell do not need attack rolls and automatically bypass spell resistance. Only damage is duplicated, not any other effect, even those effects which were part of the original spell or attack.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *balance in all things* to *death's favor* for campaign continuity.
