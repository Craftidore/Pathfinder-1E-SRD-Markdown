*As the killing blow falls, you smile with grim satisfaction even as the light of life fades, knowing that your enemy will soon be joining you in the afterlife.*

If you are killed, your body is instantaneously destroyed in an explosion that deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to everyone in a 30-foot-radius burst.

This explosion destroys your body, preventing any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]], [[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell can restore life.
