*You can sense the fibers of magic around you. Reaching out, you pull them tight about your subject, creating an invisible cocoon of mystical forces.*

This spell surrounds the subject with a mystical field that dampens the effects of magic. While it is in effect, the enhancement bonus of any magic weapon used against the subject is lowered by 1. For instance, a *+4 longsword* would have only a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when wielded against the subject. However, even if a weapon’s enhancement bonus is reduced below +1, its masterwork bonus still applies. Similarly, every spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that affects the subject—whether it is specifically targeted on the subject or merely includes the subject in its area—takes a –1 penalty to caster level and save DC.

The subject of the spell can choose, as a move action, to lower this field to receive the full effects of benefi cial spells, but doing so might leave him vulnerable until his next turn, since raising the effect again also requires a move action. Ongoing magical effects already in place on the subject when *dampen magic* is cast (such as *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bull’s strength]]* or the enhancement bonuses of its own equipment) are unaffected, but any item the subject picks up and any spell he receives after *dampen magic* is in effect are affected as normal.

For every six caster levels above 7th that you possess, the spell reduces incoming effects by one additional point. Thus, if your caster level is 13th–18th, the reduction to the enhancement bonus of weapons and the caster levels and save DCs of spells used against the subject is 2, and if your caster level is 19th or higher, the reduction is 3.

At any time when *dampen magic* has 5 or more rounds of duration left, the subject can render itself utterly immune to most magic for a brief period. The effect produced is an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, which surrounds the subject to a radius of 5 feet. Divide the remaining rounds of duration by 5 and round down; the result is the number of rounds the antimagic effect lasts. Once that time expires, the spell ends, and once the *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* has been invoked, the original spell effect cannot be reinstated.
