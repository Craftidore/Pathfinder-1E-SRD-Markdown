You cause one or more creatures to begin dancing a merry jig. This spell affects a number of HD of creatures equal to the caster level. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Those who are dancing receive a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks and Armor Class for the time that they dance. Though they can take actions normally (using the penalties given above), their movement is not their own.

Each round, a creature affected by this spell must take a move action to move half her speed in a random direction. If this movement would place the target in danger (such as dancing into a fire or off the deck), the dance causes the target to stop just short of the threat. Targets can still take their actions, either before or after their movement as they choose.
