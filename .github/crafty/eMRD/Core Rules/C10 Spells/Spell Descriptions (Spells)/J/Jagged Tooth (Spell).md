*You feel your own teeth sharpen momentarily as you complete this spell. As the magical energy surrounds your intended target, it flexes its muscles in appreciation of its weapon’s deadlier capabilities.*

This spell doubles the critical threat range of one natural weapon that deals either slashing or piercing damage. Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range don’t stack.
