Thieves and uninvited guests who try to pick or force the door of a Kariv wagon learn the hard way that you don’t invade the gypsies’ privacy that easily. Whenever a creature makes a [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check or attempts to break a door or container protected by a *crone’s grasp* spell, the ghostly form of an old woman emerges from the panel and tries to seize the culprit.

Once triggered the apparition lasts for 2 rounds per caster level and can go away from the protected object for as far as 50 feet per caster level. The crone appears to be deceptively weak but is in fact strong and fast (40 feet speed) and can try to [[Grapple|grapple]] the miscreant once per round. This attack doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity and the crone cannot be affected by weapons but can be dispelled. The CMB and CMD for the [[Grapple|grapple]] checks use the caster’s level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +5 bonus for the Strength of a hag.

A creature grabbed by the ghostly crone can attempt to escape with a combat maneuver check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. If the thief or vandal is ever [[Grappled|grappled]] a link is automatically created between the evocation and the spellcaster who created it. This allows Kariv witch to read the subject’s mind as per the *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* spell (Will negates). This lasts for as long as the crone holds the subject.
