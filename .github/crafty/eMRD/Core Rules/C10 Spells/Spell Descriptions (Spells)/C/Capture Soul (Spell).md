# Capture Soul (Spell)
## Overview
Necromancy

**Level:** Sorcerer 9, Wizard 9

**BoXM:** Wizard 18

**Casting Time:** One standard action

**Components:** V, S, F

**Range:** Medium (100 feet + 10 feet/level)

**Target:** One soul

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (see text)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 54

You trap a creature’s soul in an object. The creature can be alive or dead (dead souls have the same saving throw bonuses and spell resistance that they had in life). If the creature is alive, the soulless body falls to the ground, in a coma. If the soul belongs to a creature that died within 1 round per caster level, the saving throw Difficulty Class increases by +5.

This spell functions against incorporeal undead spirits. However, dead creatures whose souls are captured cannot be raised from the dead.

Captured souls can take no actions. You can offer the captured soul as a reward to an outsider or force the soul to answer one question truthfully each day (the only possible answers are “yes,” “no,” and “I don’t know”).

*Focus:* The object storing the soul may be no larger than you and must be worth at least 5,000 gp. You must have both it and the target in range while you cast the spell. Casting the spell does not consume the receptacle, but destroying the object sends the soul back to its rightful place—its body if it was a living soul, or the afterlife if it was dead.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* A soul that has been trapped using this spell after its body has died cannot be raised back to life by any means short of the intervention of a deity; not even *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* is powerful enough unless the object holding the trapped soul is onhand and is destroyed while casting either *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]**.*

*House Rule:* If the focus item for the captured soul is a gem, a soul gem is created as if using the *[[Create Soul Gem (Spell)|create soul gem]]* spell, however the DC to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped is increased to DC 25 + your caster level.
