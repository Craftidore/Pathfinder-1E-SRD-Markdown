A cracling globe of electricity flies in whichever direction you point, electrocuting those it strikes. It move 30 feet per round, though if it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d4 points of electrical damage for every two levels of the spellcaster (maximum 5d4). (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.)

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and crackles. The surface of the sphere is yielding, so does not cause damage except from the electricity. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
