You attempt to call forth a [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]]. If you know a [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]]’s name, you can attempt to call that [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] specifically. The [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] always appears when called during or immediately before a great battle.

A [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] may choose to assist its caller in battle if the caller is particularly honorable or if the caller is fighting against particularly tricky or evil enemies. The [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] may always refuse to help, at the GM’s discretion.

You can attempt to force a [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] to perform a task; if you do, you must use a magic circle and follow the process of the [[Planar Binding (Spell)|planar binding]] spell. Compelling a [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]] in this manner earns the caster the enmity of a good-aligned deity as well as the [[Valkyrie (Bestiary 3)|valkyrie]].
