You view your own actions or those of a single creature through the influences of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target creature fails its saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions.

This has the following effects:

- The creature is automatically [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] against you.
- For each square the creature moves, you can move one square (up to your normal movement) on the creature’s turn when it has completed its movement. This requires using your move action for that round out of sequence.
- You warn others of the affected creature’s offensive intentions as a free action, and any creature targeted by a spell or attack by the affected creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to a saving throw or AC.
- You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your AC and any saving throws against attacks or spells originating from the affected creature.
