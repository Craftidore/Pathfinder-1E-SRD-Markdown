You summon your special mount from the celestial planes where it resides. This works exactly as your normal, spell-like class ability to summon the creature, except that the duration is shorter and you are not limited in how many times you can call the mount in a day (except by how many times you can cast *call mount*). You can cast this spell even if you have already called your mount using your class ability on the same day.
