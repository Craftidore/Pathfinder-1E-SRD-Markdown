All recipients gain the ability to speak, write, and understand a unique language. This language sounds like random syllables and looks like written gibberish to anyone not under the spell, but the targets understand each other perfectly. Once the spell expires, any *codespeak* writing is unintelligible even to the targets. Each spellcaster creates a unique but constant secret language, and later castings of *codespeak* by the same caster allow new targets to understand messages left behind by others affected by the same spellcaster.

[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|Comprehend languages]] does not enable a caster to understand the language of another’s *codespeak* spell, but it does reveal that the targets are speaking a magical language. *[[Tongues (Spell)|Tongues]]* and similarly powerful spells translate *codespeak* normally. Add your caster level to the DCs of [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]] checks when attempting to decipher messages written in *codespeak*.
