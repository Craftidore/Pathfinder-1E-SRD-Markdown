# Create Faux Human (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Druid Spells|Druid 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Druid Spells List|Druid 10]]

**Casting Time:** 1 day

**Components:** V, S, F 

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Tiny or Small animal touched

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Will negates

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** The Standing Stone (WotC), pg. 32

You transform a Tiny or Small animal into a sentient humanoid resembling a halfling or human, respectively. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the target's HD). The newly created faux human has 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and becomes a 1st-level commoner, expert, or warrior (your choice). Faux humans can speak Common but do not have the ability to communicate with other animals.

Faux humans (or faux halflings) are of the humanoid type. Spells that affect animals do not affect animals transformed into faux humans. Faux humans appear identical to humans (or halflings), though they sometimes exhibit behavior reminiscent of their original form.

*Note*: This spell must be cast within a ring of standing stones consecrated to the Old Faith of the druids.
