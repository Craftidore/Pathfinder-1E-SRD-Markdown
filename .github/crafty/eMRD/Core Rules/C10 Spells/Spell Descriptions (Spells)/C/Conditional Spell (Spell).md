You cast this spell as well as another spell of 6th level (12th level BoXM) or lower to be “stored.” When a specific spell you name (of any level) is cast upon the subject, the stored spell releases in a preset manner. The stored spell takes effect immediately after the target spell in the same round.

For example, you store *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* within your friend the barbarian and designate *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* as the impetus spell. Now, when a *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* is next cast, placing the barbarian in its area, a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* is cast in the manner you chose when you cast *conditional spell*. You might have caused the spell to be cast “at the individual who cast *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]*,” or “100 feet straight ahead,” or “at the subject’s feet.” The barbarian still suffers damage from the *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* normally.

You could also designate a door as the subject, with an impetus spell of *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]**,* and store the *[[Web (Spell)|web]]* spell, to be cast in the area around the door.Or, you could identify an impetus spell of *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]* that, when cast upon a cohort (as the subject), releases the stored spell *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, cast on the cohort.

A target and his gear may have only one *conditional spell* active at a time, meaning you cannot cast this spell on both a barbarian and the barbarian’s axe. If the impetus spell does not affect the target because of a successful save or spell resistance, the *conditional spell* still triggers. If the stored spell cannot be cast as you designated (due to range, line of sight, etc.), the stored spell has no effect and the *conditional spell* is lost.
