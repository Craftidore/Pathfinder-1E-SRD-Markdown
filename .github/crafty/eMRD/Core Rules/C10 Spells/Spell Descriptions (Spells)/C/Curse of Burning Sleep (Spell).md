You place a curse upon the target that triggers 1 hour after the next time it falls asleep. When the curse is triggered, the creature bursts into flame, taking 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 8d6). Furthermore, it catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round at the end of its turn each round until the creature dies (*PF Core Rulebook* 444). If the target is still asleep, the fire damage from this spell wakes it.

Only one of these spells can be in place on a creature at any time. This has no effect on creatures that donâ€™t sleep.
