You cause your blood to spray and become caustic whenever it is exposed to the air. While you and items in your possession are immune to your caustic blood, others can be badly damaged by it.

When you take damage, as a free action you may make a single ranged touch attack at any target within 30 ft. (even if it is not your turn). On a successful hit, you deal acid damage equal to 1d6 hp plus your Constitution modifier (minimum +0). If you are suffering from a [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] effect, you add double your Constitution modifier (minimum +0), and you may make one such attack at the beginning of each of your turns. After the spell has been in effect for 10 min. or after you have made a number of attacks equal to your caster level (whichever comes first), the spell ends.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *caustic blood* to *lesser caustic blood* to avoid duplication.
