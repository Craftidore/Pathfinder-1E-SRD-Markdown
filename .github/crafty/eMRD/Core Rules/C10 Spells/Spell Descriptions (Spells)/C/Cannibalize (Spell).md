Up to 4 HD of undead creatures within this spell’s area of effect are destroyed, and you steal hp from them to heal your injuries. For each HD of undead creatures destroyed by the spell, you gain 2 hp. You cannot gain hp beyond your maximum, and you cannot regain hp lost due to Constitution damage.

Undead you have commanded with the [[Command Undead (Feat)|Command Undead]] feat receive no save to avoid this spell’s effects. If undead you do not command make a successful Fortitude save, they still suffer 2d6 hp damage. Undead killed by this damage heal you as if they had failed their save.

Gaining hp via this spell is dangerous because it involves infusing negative energy into your living body. If this spell grants you hp equal to two-thirds of your maximum, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 19). Failure results in immediate transformation into a free-willed undead creature—typically an intelligent [[Skeleton (Bestiary PF1)|skeleton]] or [[Zombie (Bestiary PF1)|zombie]]. Undead casters can use this spell without risk.
