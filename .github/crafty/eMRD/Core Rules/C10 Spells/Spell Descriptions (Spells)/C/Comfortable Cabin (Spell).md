This spell may only be cast on an existing structure or vehicle (magical or mundane). It causes the structure to become immune to exterior environmental conditions and invulnerable to natural environmental damage (for example, lightning and natural fire, to include lava, does not affect it while the flames from a dragon's breath would). The interior remains a comfortable 72 degrees (F) no matter how hot or cold the becomes. 

If cast on a moving vehicle, the spell causes the interior to remain level and stable no matter how violent the exterior motion becomes; even a crashing carriage that completely turned upside down as a result of the crash would not affect the passengers inside until such time as they exit the vehicle or the spell ends.
