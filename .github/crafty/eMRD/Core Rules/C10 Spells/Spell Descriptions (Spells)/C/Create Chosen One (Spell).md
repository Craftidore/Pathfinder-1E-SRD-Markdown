Only evil wizards can cast this spell (and the Red Wizards of Thay do not teach it to outsiders in the Forgotten Realms Setting). Casting the spell involves a series of magical rituals intended to turn a normal human (of up to 3rd level) into a maddened, murderous creature. The victim must be bound and helpless for the spell to work. After the casting time is completed, the victim must make a Will save or be transformed into a chosen one under the control of its creator.
