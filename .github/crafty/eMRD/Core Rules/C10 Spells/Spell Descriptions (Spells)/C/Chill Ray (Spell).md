A ray of burning cold erupts from your fingertips. Corporeal undead struck by the ray are covered in a layer of ice, rendering the subject immobile as if *held.* Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the ice. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *bone chill* to *chill ray* to avoid duplication.
