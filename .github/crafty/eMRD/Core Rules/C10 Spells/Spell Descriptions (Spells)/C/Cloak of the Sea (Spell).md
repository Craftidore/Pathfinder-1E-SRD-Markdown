*A blue-green glow surrounds your hand as you complete the spell. With a touch you release it into your intended target, which then turns the same shade of blue-green.*

While underwater, the subject functions as if affected by *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]*, *[[Freedom of Movement|freedom of movement]]*, and *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]],* and doesnâ€™t take nonlethal damage for the duration of the spell. When out of the water (or even partially out), the subject gains none of these advantages except *[[Water Breathing (Spell)|water breathing]]*. The subject can leave and reenter water without ending the spell.
