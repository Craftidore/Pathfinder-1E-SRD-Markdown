You conjure into existence a fine, seaworthy ship to carry you and your companions safely and comfortably.

A caravel is a fairly small, double-decked sailing ship. It holds a generous amount of cargo and offers cramped quarters for crew and passengers. The ship produced by this spell has even more room for cargo and passengers, contained within an extradimensional space.

The entry point to this space is a hatch on the aft upper deck. Lifting the hatch reveals a set of wooden stairs, which descend about 6 feet to a horizontal shimmering in the air about 4 feet wide. Only those you designate can enter this space, and the extradimensional portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. Those without authorization to enter instead continue descending the steps to an ordinary cargo hold. You can open the portal again from your own side at will.

Those who pass beyond the portal’s entrance find themselves in a magnificent foyer with many staterooms whose doors open from this space. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any deck plan you desire within the limit of the spell’s effect. The cabins are furnished, and the galley contains sufficient foodstuffs and preparation equipment to serve three full meals per day per person per caster level. A staff of near-transparent pursers (up to two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. They function as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere within the extradimensional space.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the passenger space, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Bad weather or other marine hazards can still threaten the vessel, but even if it sinks, the passenger space remains safe and isolated (though exiting it might prove difficult).

The ship is crewed by a minimum complement of spectral deckhands, which perform the basic tasks of maintenance. These, like the cabin servants, behave as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servants]]* but can travel anywhere on board ship and can enter the extradimensional space if you so direct. The spectral deckhands respond to the direction of the helmsman, reducing the number of crew necessary to control the caravel to 1. If you do not provide a real helmsman, the ship will steer itself on the last course a living helmsman provided but will not be able to avoid collisions or hazards or adjust to changing conditions.

**GM NOTE**

This spell is replaced by *[[Caster's Caravel (Spell)|caster's caravel]]* in Pathfinder.

In the World of Greyhawk setting, this spell is commonly known as *Mordenkainen's capable caravel.*

An important consideration is that 'outside conditions do not affect the passenger space.' This means that there is no risk of seasickness within the extradimensional space. Also, should the ship sink, the extradimensional space is unaffected by pressure effects. Someone leaving or entering the extradimensional space does not risk it being flooded as the spell is quite specific about only designated individuals being able to do so. Like the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell, environmental effects within the extradimensional space are renewed, ie., it always has fresh air.

Unlike the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell, whose entrance does not move with a ship (*Skull and Shackles Player's Guide 17*) the extradimensional space here does.

*House Rule:* Subsequent castings of this spell or *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* by the same caster within an existing extradimensional mansion extend either the duration by the amount of the subsequent casting or double the size of the extradimensional mansion.

### Caravel
![[Deck plan - Caravel.jpg|Caravel|300]]
[[Deck plan - Caravel.jpg|open outside]]

1.Sterncastle

The ship's wheel is located on this raised platform at the aft of the vessel; it is generally from here that the captain issues orders while sailing.

2. Forecastle

The ship's forward mounted ballista is here, usually kept covered by an oilcloth tarp.

3. Captain's Cabin

By far the most elaborate quarters on the vessel is this small room. It has a table, along with a bed, a wardrobe, a chest and a barrel of liquor. 

4. Ship's Mess

A large well lit room used for dining by the ship's officers (and any important passengers) as well as a meeting room when necessary.

5. Main Deck

The main deck is a broad, open space, although usually it is filled at least in part with ropes, the ship's anchor, a lifeboat and that sort of thing. Next to the mainmast is the hatch providing access to the cargo hold below.

6. Crew Quarters

Twelve hammocks are arrayed in this area, in two tiers on a solid wooden framework. The crew members sleep here, usually in shifts. In addition there can usually be found a number of sea chests, one per crewman, arranged beneath the hammocks.

7. Ship's Galley

Here the ship's cook and his helper both live and work; preparing meals for the crew (and any passengers).

8. Ship's Larder

This water-tight room is always locked with only the ship's cook and the captain holding keys to it. Here the ship's provisions are stored.

9. Cargo Hold

This space could contain just about anything, provided it can fit in through the cargo hatch. A cargo hatch set into the deck leads to the lower hold.

10. Private Cabin

For important passengers or, at least, those who can pay for it, this cabin boasts a bed and perhaps a table or a storage trunk. It can also be used for a first mate, if appropriate.

12. Secure Storage

The door to this room has a lock built into and the door itself is iron. Only the captain hold the key to this room which is used for securing valuables as well as a cell for prisoners as needed.

13. Lower Hold

This large open area is split into two separate areas: each is used for holding bulk goods as well as ship's stores (timber, rope, canvas, etc.

14. Crow's Nest (Not pictured)

A small platform high on the ship's foremast provides a place for the lookout to stand.
