*As you exhale the last syllables of the incantation, your breath forms an invisible spray of noxious air.*

This spell creates a small cloud of nauseating vapors. Any living creature in the area becomes [[Nauseated|nauseated]]. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.

The cloud obscures sight, including darkvision, providing concealment to creatures within the area or against attacks made through the cloud.
