You gain a limited form of telepathy, which allows you to communicate with any lesser dragon within 100 ft., regardless of the creatureâ€™s capability. Communicating with a companion dragon has an unlimited range with this spell as long as the creature is on the same plane. An unwilling dragon must succeed at a Will save to ignore your telepathic contact.

*Converse with drake* does not change the disposition of the creature contacted. Unpredictable or aggressive drakes may react strongly to intrusive thoughts, shifting their attitude down one step. A caster can attempt a [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] check to alter attitudes as normal.
