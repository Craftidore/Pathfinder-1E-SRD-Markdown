You cause the target creature to perform the action they last took over and over for the spell's duration. For example, if the target attacked and missed, it would continue to swing (even in the space where the target was if it moved or fell). If the target moved with its action, it continues to move and then take the action (which could lead to interesting scenes if a wall is in the way or a cliff is present). If the target attempts to duplicate an action that it could not complete, such as casting a prepared spell that it no longer has ready, it merely loses its actions for the duration of the spell.

This spell requires some minor modifications to the time streams, namely re‐looping strands to cause a creature to experience the same event repeatedly.When casting this spell, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or suffer 2d8 points of damage.
