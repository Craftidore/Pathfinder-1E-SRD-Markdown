*A crown of plain copper appears upon the recipient’s head. The crown has a front piece fashioned to resemble a bull’s head.*

This spell creates a crown of magical energy that grants the spell’s recipient a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. As an immediate action, the creature wearing a *crown of might* can discharge its magic to gain a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 round. The spell ends after the wearer uses the *crown* in this manner.

The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm. If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
