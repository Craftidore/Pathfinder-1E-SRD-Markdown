You infuse the area with powerful protections against earthquakes and upheaval. The area affected cannot be harmed by the effects of an earthquake or volcano (either natural or magical) and remains stable even during the height of such an event in the area. Collateral damage, such as structures tumbling into the area from beyond its limits, or clouds of hot ash or bombs of molten rock falling from above can still damage creatures in the area. The spell does divert lava flows that would normally enter the area along the ground during a volcanic eruption.

Creatures with the earth subtype become slow and languid in the area, and they suffer a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -4 penalty on Initiative checks and Reflex saving throws. In addition, all of an earth subtype creature's speeds are cut in half. If the creature moves out of the spell's area, these effects immediately cease until the creature re-enters the spell's area.
