The caster is always included in this spell, along with whoever else he chooses to include. Upon the completion of casting this more powerful form of *[[Chain of Shadows (Spell)|chain of shadows]]*, the caster and all those whom he targeted find that their shadows are now linked together by thin shadowy filaments.

This binding causes all of those linked to share their various defensive bonuses-everyone saves and resists with the highest score available to any of them. 

Additional, all creatures affected automatically succeed on aid another actions for any skills they have in common.

Should any of the targets move more than 60 feet away from the nearest creature under the effects of this binding, it immediately loses its own connection to the others; returning to within 60 feet does not restore its connection.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from* bind shadows* to *greater chain of shadows* for campaign continuity.
