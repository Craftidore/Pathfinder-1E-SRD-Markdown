Make a melee touch attack against a creature with a number of HD no more than 50% higher than your caster level. If the attack hits, you conjure chaotic pulsating waves of energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, you and the creatureâ€™s current hp total changes.

Roll on the following table, adding or subtracting your caster level from the roll if desired, and apply the result to both yourself and the target creature.

**Table 2-2: Hit Point Flux**

| 1-9 | Current hp changes to 0. |
