The target of this spell takes 2d10 points of Charisma drain (Will half). If he makes his saving throw, the spell has no further effect. If he fails, however, the chain continues. The next time he touches a friend, loved one, or ally, that individual takes the same damage: 2d10 points of Charisma drain, or half with a successful save. If this second victim fails the save, she then becomes the host for the spell, and the effect continues with the first friend or ally that she touches. This effect continues until the chain is broken by a successful save or until it has affected a number of people equal to the spellâ€™s caster level.

*Focus:* The umbilical cord of a stillborn child.

*Corruption Cost:* 2d4 points of Charisma damage.
