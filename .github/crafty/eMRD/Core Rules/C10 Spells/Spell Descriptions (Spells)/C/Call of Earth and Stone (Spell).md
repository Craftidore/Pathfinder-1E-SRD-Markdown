Upon completing this spell, you momentarily commune with the Elemental Plane. You may ask 1d4 questions, which are answered by any earth spirit (creatures with the [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|earth subtype]], Intelligence 3 or greater) closest to you at the time. You have no control over the creatures that answer, but those that do must answer honestly, in a language you understand, and cannot attack you or your allies while the spell lasts. Any offensive action by you or your allies immediately breaks the spell, allowing the creature to retaliate or retreat.

The GM should roll secretly to determine how many questions you may ask and whether the earth creature that answers the summons knows the answers you seek. The responding earth creature has a 60% chance of knowing the answer plus 1% for every point of the creatureâ€™s Intelligence score plus 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 99%.

[[Elemental, Earth (Bestiary PF1)|Earth elementals]], mephits, and [[Xorn (Bestiary PF1)|xorns]] commonly answer this call, with [[Xorn (Bestiary PF1)|xorns]] sometimes trading additional questions or details for precious gems and minerals.
