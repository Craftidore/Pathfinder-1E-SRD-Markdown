*With a few slurred words and fumbling motions, you complete the spell and prepare to perform.*

You cause any creatures in the area to feel increasingly more intoxicated the longer you perform a drinking song. In the round this spell is cast, all creatures that fail their saving throws take a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom.

If you use a standard action to continue performing in a second consecutive round, each affected creature must succeed on a second Will saving throw or become [[Nauseated|nauseated]]. Succeeding on this saving throw prevents the nausea, and the creature is immune to further effects of this spell.

If you use a standard action to continue performing in a third consecutive round, any affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or pass out, becoming [[Unconscious|unconscious]] and [[Helpless|helpless]].
