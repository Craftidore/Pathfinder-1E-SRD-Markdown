*2 HD or less*: The creature is [[Unconscious|unconscious]], [[Blinded|blinded]], and [[Stunned|stunned]] for 2d4 rounds, then [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds, and then [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked [[Unconscious|unconscious]].)

*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds, then [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.

*5 or more HD*: The creature is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.
