*As you complete the spell, the powers of Mechanus respond. The kolyarut does not manifest before you as much as assembles itself in your presence, a single whirling cog unfolding until the construct stands complete. “Who is to be punished?” it asks in the flat voice of a clock mechanism.*

By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a kolyarut inevitable. If you know an individual kolyarut’s name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).

You can ask the kolyarut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.

*XP Cost:* 250 XP.
