You summon a sword of holy fire to wield against your enemies. Attacks with the *cherubâ€™s burning blade* are resolved as touch attacks with an attack bonus equal your base attack bonus plus your caster level. The blade deals 4d6 hp fire damage + 1 hp per two caster levels. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or catch on fire if struck.

Half of the damage inflicted by the sword is fire damage, but the other half is positive energy, as it is the product of divine power and unaffected by fire resistance or immunity; this includes the damage from catching on fire.
