*You make the necessary conjurations and the powers of Mechanus respond. The Zelekhut fades into view, its centaur form accompanied by the sound of rattling silver chains. “Who seeks to escape justice?” it asks with the solemn tones of a judge’s gavel.*

By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a zelekhut inevitable. If you know an individual zelekhut’s name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway).

You can ask the zelekhut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task.

*XP Cost:* 100 XP.
