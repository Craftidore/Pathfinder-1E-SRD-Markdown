This spell instantly transports you from one community to a second designated community. Each community must be at least as large as a small city. The destination city may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnâ€™t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring along one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

You must have visited the destination city at some point in the past. You do not have precise control over your arrival point; you appear at a randomly determined safe location within the borders of the city (not within a building).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6 to Level.
