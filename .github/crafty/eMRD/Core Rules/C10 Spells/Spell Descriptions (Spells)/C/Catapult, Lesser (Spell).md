*Focusing on the object in your grasp, you abruptly jerk your head in the direction you desire, sending the item flying.*

You propel a single object out of your hand at fantastic speed. This object can be a weapon designed for throwing, a weapon not meant to be thrown, or another nonliving object.

Make a normal ranged attack roll with the affected object, but do not add any ability score modifier to the attack or damage roll. Instead, you gain a competence bonus on the damage roll equal to one-third of your caster level (maximum +5). The range increment for the hurled object is 30 feet, regardless of its normal range increment (if any).

If you use *lesser catapult* to fling an object not meant to be used as a thrown weapon, you take the normal –4 nonproficiency penalty on the attack roll. An item that isn’t a weapon deals 1d6 points of base damage if it weighs at least 1 pound.

The item *lesser catapult* is to affect must be in your hands when you cast the spell. If you cast the spell with nothing in your hands to fling, the magic automatically fails. You cannot propel living creatures with *lesser catapult,* regardless of their size.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *catapult* to *lesser catapult* to avoid duplication.
