*Though the creature struggles to contain itself, its breath weapon bursts forth explosively.*

The target of the spell is compelled to use its breath weapon as soon as it is capable. For instance, if a dragon must wait 1d4 rounds, and it rolls a 2, it must use its breath weapon after 2 rounds. The creature is capable of taking normal actions whenever its breath weapon is not available, though it cannot use any feats or spells that delay this result.

*Special:* Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 level.
