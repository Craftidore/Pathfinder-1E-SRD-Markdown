# Cannibal Compulsion (Spell)
## Overview
[[Enchantment Spells|Enchantment]] ([[Necrophagy Spells|necrophagy]], [[Compulsion Spells|compulsion]]) \[[[Evil Spells|evil]], [[Mind-Affecting Spells|mind-affecting]]]

With a successful touch attack, the target must do nothing but start to consume its own flesh in the most sickening manner. If it lacks exposed flesh (because the target is wearing armor), it must first strip itself of any impediments to its gruesome compulsion. It does this in the most violent fashion possible.

It takes one full-round action to strip out of light or medium armor and two-full round actions to strip out of heavy armor. Once any armor is discarded, the target gnaws and rips at its flesh, shoving pieces in its mouth. When eating its own flesh, the target gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength, and it must spend a full-round action each turn to start gnawing on exposed pieces of its own flesh. This deals hp damage equal to 2d6 + 2× its Strength modifier for each full-round action spent consuming flesh.

Each round, allies within 50 ft. that can see and hear this activity must succeed on a Will save or become [[Sickened|sickened]] for the duration of the spell. If an ally successfully saves, they are immune to the [[Sickened|sickened]] effect for the duration of the spell’s effect.

Each round, the spell’s target can attempt a Will saving throw to end this effect, with a penalty equal to the number of rounds it has already been affected by the spell.

**Mythic:** The target of the spell does not gain a Will saving throw each round to end the effect, and even if somehow the effect ends before the end of the spell’s duration, the target becomes [[Confused|confused]] (as the condition) for the remainder of the spell’s duration.
