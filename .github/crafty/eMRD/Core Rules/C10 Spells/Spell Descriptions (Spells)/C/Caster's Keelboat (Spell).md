You conjure a seaworthy [[Keelboat|keelboat]] with a cabin situated at the rear of the vessel. The [[Keelboat|keelboat]] can hold an amount of cargo and passengers as normal for a ship of its size, but the cabin has even more room available inside the extradimensional cabins.

When opened, the cabin door (4 feet wide and 8 feet tall) reveals a faint shimmering portal. Only those you designate may enter the cabins, and the extradimensional portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a lavish foyer with many cabins whose doors open from this space. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any deck plan you desire within the limit of the spell’s effect. The cabins are furnished and contain sufficient foodstuffs to serve a filling meal to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as one per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. They function as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the extradimensional space. Since the extradimensional space can only be entered through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the cabins, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

The ship is crewed by eight additional spectral sailors which behave as *unseen servants* but can only move about the ship, not the extradimensional space. These spectral sailors respond to the orders of the ship’s captain or helmsman (designated by you when you cast this spell; changing this designation is a standard action). If the helmsman does not give the spectral sailors an order to change course, they will continue to steer the [[Keelboat|keelboat]] in along the last course provided without regard for any hazards encountered or remaining duration of the ship’s existence.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *mage's lavish keelboat* to *caster's keelboat* for campaign continuity.
