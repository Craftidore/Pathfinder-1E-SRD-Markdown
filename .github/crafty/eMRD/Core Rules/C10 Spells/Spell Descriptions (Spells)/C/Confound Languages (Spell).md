Sometimes simply called babble, this enchantment temporarily replaces each affected creaturesâ€™ previously known languages with new languages. For the duration of this spell, the target cannot read or comprehend their previous languages. Randomly assign a new language (or multiple languages, if applicable) to each creature affected by this enchantment separately. Any effort the target makes to communicate (written or spoken) will instead be in this new language. The affected creature can only read this language if he/she was previously literate. This spell has no effect on telepathic communication, or the vocalizations of creatures that lack a spoken language.

Creatures under the effect of *confound languages* cannot benefit from the *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]* spell.
