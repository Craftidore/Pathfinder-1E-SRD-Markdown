The object touched sheds light brighter than bright sunlight, channeled directly from the celestial realms. The light extends to a 120-foot radius: bright light to 60 feet and dim light in another 60 feet.

Creatures with light sensitivity take twice the usual penalty when they are within 60 feet of the object. Undead creatures take 1d6 points of damage each round they are within the bright light. Evil outsiders, as well as undead creatures that are specifically harmed by sunlight, take 2d6 points of damage each round in the bright light.

*Celestial brilliance* brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

*Celestial brilliance* counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as *[[Deeper Darkness (Spell)|deeper darkness]]*.
