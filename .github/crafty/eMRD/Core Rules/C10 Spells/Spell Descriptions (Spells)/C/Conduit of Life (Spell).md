*A small kernel of positive energy grows within your heart, warming your whole body.*

The next time you use a class feature or racial ability to channel positive energy (such as turn undead or lay on hands), you also heal a number of points of damage to yourself equal to 2d10+1/caster level (maximum 10).

If you are already subject to an ongoing healing effect (such as *vigor*SC, or if you receive a *cure* spell while *conduit of life* is still in effect, this spell instead heals a number of points of damage equal to 3d8+1/caster level and it is discharged.
