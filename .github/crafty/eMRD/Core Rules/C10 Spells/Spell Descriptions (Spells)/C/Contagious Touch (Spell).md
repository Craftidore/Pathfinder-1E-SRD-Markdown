*Holding out your hand like it’s dead, you croak out magic words and imbue your limb with a terrible disease.*

Upon casting this spell, you choose one disease from this list: [[Blinding Sickness|blinding sickness]], [[Cackle Fever|cackle fever]], [[Filth Fever|filth fever]], [[Mindfire|mindfire]], [[Red Ache|red ache]], the [[Shakes|shakes]], or [[Slimy Doom|slimy doom]]. Any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack during the spell’s duration is affected as though by the *[[Contagion (Spell)|contagion]]* spell, immediately contracting the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. You cannot infect more than one creature per round.
