By using *cynosure* prior to casting spells like *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* or *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*, which require or have a chance of requiring you to roll to randomly determine the location targets are transported to, you decrease the distance targets appear from the intended location by 75% (rounded down to the nearest mile).

For example, a wizard who casts *cynosure* before casting a *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell that winds up off target by 18 miles actually only appears 4 miles away from his intended destination.

*Cynosure* affects the next conjuration (teleportation) spell or similar special ability (such as a spell weaver's *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* spell-like ability) of any creature touched. *Cynosure* has no effect on spells of the teleportation subschool that do not have a chance of deviating. If this spell is cast on a spell like *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* and the spell does not deviate, *cynosure* has no effect. This spell lasts for only 1 round and is wasted if a relevant transportation spell is not cast within that time.

*Lore:* As accuracy is frequently a concern when using long-range teleportation spells, spell weavers created this spell to increase the reliability of their innate planes walking ability.
