*A shimmering halo of energy surrounds the target’s head like a crown. It fl ashes a spectrum of colors before fading away.*

This spell creates a magic crown infused with illusion magic. The spell’s recipient gains a +2 competence bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Hide) checks. As an immediate action, the creature wearing the *crown of veils* can discharge its magic to gain a +8 competence bonus on a single [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] or [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Hide) check. The spell ends after the wearer uses the crown in this manner.

The crown occupies space on the body as a headband, hat, or helm. If the crown is removed, the spell immediately ends.
