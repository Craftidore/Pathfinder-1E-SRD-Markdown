A useful aid for craft􀄞ing mundane or enchanted weapons or items, this spell grants the caster the benefit of any single Cra􀄞ft skill with skill ranks equal to his level of experience + his Int modifier. It can also give an increase to the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill (for the purpose of magical crafting) equal to his level of experience + his Int modifier but if used in this way it cannot be used to gain a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill.

*Material Components:* A smith’s hammer and gold dust worth at least 100 gp.
