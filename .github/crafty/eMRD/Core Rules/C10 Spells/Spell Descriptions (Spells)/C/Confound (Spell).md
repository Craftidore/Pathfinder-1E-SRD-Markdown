*Your opponent’s eyes try to follow your gestures while you cast, and they fail to refocus when you finish.*

You render the target unable to follow your movements effectively. The subject takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls made against you, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made against it. If you worship a deity that provides access to the Trickery domain—even if you did not choose that domain—these modifiers rise to –3 and +3, respectively. Furthermore, the subject cannot make attacks of opportunity against you.

If you successfully cast this spell on the same subject in each of 2 consecutive rounds, these beneficial effects extend to your allies as well.
