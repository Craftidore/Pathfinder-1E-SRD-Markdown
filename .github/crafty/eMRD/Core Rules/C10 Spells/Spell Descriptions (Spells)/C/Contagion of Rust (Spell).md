A red, oxidizing cloud erupts at the point you designate, and any iron or iron alloy item within the cloud bursts into a cloud of rust. A new rust cloud spreads 10 ft. from the destroyed item and applies the same effects at the beginning of your next turn. If an affected object is attended and the creature succeeds at a Reflex save, the object takes 1d6 hp damage that bypasses its hardness. Objects whose wielders succeed at this Reflex save gain no immunity to this spell and must be removed from the spellâ€™s initial area (as well as any new clouds generated by destroyed items) to avoid any further risk.

Against a ferrous creature, this spell deals 6d6 hp damage +1 hp per caster level (maximum +30), but a Reflex save negates half this damage. A ferrous creature destroyed by this spell creates a cloud with a radius based on its size (Small or smaller: 10 ft.; Medium: 20 ft.; Large: 40 ft.; Huge or larger: 80 ft.).
