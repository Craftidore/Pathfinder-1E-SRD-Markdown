This spell was created by the paladins of the Mendevian Crusades, and co-opted by inquisitors and rangers dedicated to tracking and fighting demons, devils, and other evil extraplanar creatures.

When you cast this spell on a melee weapon you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting the weapon the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|evil subtype]], you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 roundsâ€”the outsider can reduce this [[Nauseated|nauseated]] condition to [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.
