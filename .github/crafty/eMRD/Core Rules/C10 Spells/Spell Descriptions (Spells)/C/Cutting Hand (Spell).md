*Your hand tingles as a smooth, metallic edge extrudes from the outside of your palm and curls up along your fingertips, forming a flexible, razor-sharp blade.*

You alter the structure of your hand so that it becomes as hard and sharp as a blade. Your hand deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large) and gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. You are considered armed with this hand. Your handâ€™s enhancement bonus does not apply to melee touch attacks.
