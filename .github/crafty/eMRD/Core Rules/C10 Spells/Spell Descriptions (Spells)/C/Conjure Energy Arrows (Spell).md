At the start of each round, *conjure energy arrows* equips your bow or crossbow with an energy arrow or bolt when its string is drawn. You select the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) at the time of casting. The weapon deals the same amount of damage as its standard ammunition, but the spell turns the damage into that of the chosen energy type. You may shoot as many energy arrows or bolts per round as you have attacks. Each arrow evaporates into a wisp of mist one round after being created, so they must be used quickly.
