*Drawing upon dark powers, you whisper a vehement curse and draw your finger down the weapon.*

A weapon affected by this spell deals wounds that can’t be healed in the usual fashion. Any damage dealt by the weapon (not including damage from special weapon properties such as *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]**,* *[[Holy (MagWpnSpcAb)|holy]]**,* *[[Wounding (MagWpnSpcAb)|wounding]]**,* and so on) cannot be cured by any means until the damaged individual has received a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell (or some other effect that neutralizes a curse).

If a creature is slain by a weapon that is under the effect of this spell, it can’t be raised from the dead unless a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell (or similar effect) is cast on the body or a *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell is used.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Hexblade 4 to Level per Complete Warrior.

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 5, Witch 5, Wizard 5 to Level.
