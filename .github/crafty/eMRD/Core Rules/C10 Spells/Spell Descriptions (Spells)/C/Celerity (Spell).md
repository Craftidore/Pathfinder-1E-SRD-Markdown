This spell works like *[[Celerity, Lesser (Spell)|lesser celerity]]*, except that you pull even more time into the present. When you cast this spell, you can immediately take a standard action, as if you had readied an action. You can even interrupt another creatureâ€™s turn when you cast this spell. However, after you take the standard action granted by this spell, you are [[Dazed|dazed]] until the end of your next turn.

**GM Note**

Note that is spell (as well as the other versions of it) becomes immensely powerful when cast in conjunction with one of the *mind stasis* spells.
