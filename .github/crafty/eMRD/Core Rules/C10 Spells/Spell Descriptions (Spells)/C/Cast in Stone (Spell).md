*Your eyes become like gray stone orbs traced with golden veins. The change catches the foes fighting you by surprise, and they turn to stone.*

Any creature within 30 feet that meets your gaze is permanently turned into a mindless, inert statue (as *[[Flesh to Stone (Spell)|flesh to stone]]*), unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. You can free the victim of your own *cast in stone* at any time by speaking a command word you establish during the casting.

Each creature within range of the gaze must attempt a saving throw against the gaze effect each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature.

In addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits.
