You create a light breeze (approximately 9 mph) that originates from a point you designate, affecting all creatures, gasses, clouds, and fogs in its path. Any airborne vapors, fumes, clouds, smoke, and gasses drift away from the point at a speed of 80 feet per round and dissipate in one-fourth the normal time.

In addition to the effects noted, the cooling breeze can do anything that a normal breeze would be expected to do. It can move wind chimes, scatter pieces of paper or parchment, cause candle or hearth flames to flicker, and so forth.

*Cooling breeze* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Darsson's cooling breeze* to* cooling breeze* for campaign continuity.
