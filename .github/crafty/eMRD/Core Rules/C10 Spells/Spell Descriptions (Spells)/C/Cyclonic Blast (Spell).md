*Cupping a child’s top, you forcefully thrust your hand forward, simultaneously speaking the final words of the spell’s proscribed formula. Immediately thereafter, a blast of whirling wind issues forth from your outstretched fingers, sweeping up within it all who stand in its way.*

You send a twisting torrent of wind, not unlike a tornado turned on its side, toward your enemies. A *cyclonic blast* deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all creatures and objects in the area. Objects bigger than Large take half damage. The *cyclonic blast* begins at your fingertips.

Creatures who fail their Reflex saving throws against a *cyclonic blast* are additionally in danger of being knocked back by the force of the wind. Treat this as a bull rush attack made with a +12 bonus on the Strength check. The *cyclonic blast* always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and (unlike a normal bull rush) you can exceed your normal movement limit with a sufficiently high check result. Airborne creatures are treated as if they were one size category smaller for the purpose of resisting the bull rush.

If the damage caused to an interposing barrier by the blast shatters or breaks through it, the *cyclonic blast* can continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

*Focus:* A child’s spinning top.
