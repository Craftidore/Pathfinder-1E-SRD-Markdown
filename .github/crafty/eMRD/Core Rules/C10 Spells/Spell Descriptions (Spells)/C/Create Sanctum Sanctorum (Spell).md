This spell creates an area where magical energies are finely focused, making spells you cast there more potent. All spells cast within the area of the sanctum are treated as though their caster's level were two levels higher than it actually is for the purposes of level-based effects (such as duration, damage dice, etc.). Additionally, any spell cast within the sanctum gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the DC to resist its effects.

Finally, when you cast *create sanctum sanctorum*, you may choose a one metamagic feat per three caster levels from the following list: [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]], [[Enlarge Spell (Feat)|Enlarge Spell]], [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]], [[Heighten Spell (Feat)|Heighten Spell]], [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]], [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]], [[Widen Spell (Feat)|Widen Spell]]). If you do, all spells cast within the area of the *sanctum sanctorum* are automatically affected as though by those metamagic feats. If a metamagic feat doesn't apply to a given spell, that spell is simply unaffected (though it continues to gain the other benefits of the *sanctum sanctorum*).

Unlike the *[[Create Sanctum (Spell)|create sanctum]]* spell, the benefits of a *sanctum sanctorum* apply only to the individual in possession of the focus that was used during the casting of the spell.

In order to cast the spell, you must expend 20,000 gp worth of magical herbs, oils, and incense.

Additionally, if you chose to include metamagic feats in the *sanctum sanctorum's* effects, you must inlay powerful, mystic runes made of precious metals (such as gold, platinum, and mithral) over the affected area, which costs an additional 3,000 gp for each additional spell level the metamagic feat costs (for example, a *sanctum sanctorum* which automatically Empowered all spells cast within would cost 26,000 gp: 20,000 gp for the herbs, oils, and incense and 6,000 gp for the runes necessary to Empower the spells). All metamagic feats (and their costs) must be cast (and on hand) at the time the *sanctum sanctorum* is created. Additional metamagic feats may not be added later. A spellcaster may only have a single *sanctum sanctorum* at a time.
