*A shroud of dark, writhing tentacles forms around your body as you speak the spellâ€™s final syllables.*

This spell creates a number of tentacles that surround you but do not interfere with your movement or spellcasting. They provide concealment and completely hide your features. You gain a +4 competence bonus on grapple checks, [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks, and [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks.

When you are attacked, the tentacles strike back at your attacker. They have an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + your Wis modifier, and a successful attack deals 1d12 points of damage.

**GM NOTE**

Per the Wizards of the Coast website, this spell creates one tentacle per caster level.
