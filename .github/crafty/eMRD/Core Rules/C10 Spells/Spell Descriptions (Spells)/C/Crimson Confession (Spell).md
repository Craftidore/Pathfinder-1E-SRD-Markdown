You ward an object or an area with your personal rune or mark. You can choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesnâ€™t harm the material upon which it is placed. A *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell causes an invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled.

*[[See Invisibility (Spell)|See invisibility]]*, *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*, a *[[Gem of Seeing|gem of seeing]]*, or a *[[Robe of Eyes|robe of eyes]]* likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark. A *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]* spell reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level.
