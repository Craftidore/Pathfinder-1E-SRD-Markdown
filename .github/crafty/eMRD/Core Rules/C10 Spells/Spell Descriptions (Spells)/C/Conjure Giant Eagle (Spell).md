This spell summons a Large-sized giant eagle to aid you. The eagle appears where you designate and acts on your turn. It will attack your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the eagle (it only understands Auran), you can give it specific commands. The eagle can be commanded to engage in particular tactics, to target specific enemies, or to perform other actions as you command, such as bearing you or an ally away from combat.
