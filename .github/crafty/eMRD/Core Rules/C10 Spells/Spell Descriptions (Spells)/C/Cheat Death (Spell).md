The caster draws on ancient lore to allow himself one chance to possibly avoid death, even when it would otherwise be inevitable. The next time the caster is dying (has between 0 and -10 hp), there is a 5% chance per caster level that his soul is safeguarded in a magical receptacle on the [[Astral Plane]]. The caster's body remains and to all means of physical and magical examination, he appears dead. The soul remains in the receptacle for 1d100 days, minus the caster's level in days (minimum 1 day). When that time ends, the caster appears on the plane where he was dying, at the very spot, at 0 hit points, regardless of what condition his body was in after his soul was safeguarded. For example, if a spellcaster falls in battle and triggers this spell, and his foes burn his body, the body is reconstituded when the soul returns.

*Material Component:* An opal worth at least 5,000 gp.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Witch 7 to Level.

*House Rule:* Added material component in place of the Dragon Magic feat. If the caster has the Dragon Magic feat no material component is required.
