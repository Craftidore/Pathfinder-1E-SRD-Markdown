This spell functions like *[[Create Undead (Spell)|create undead]]*, except that you can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows, wraiths, spectres, and devourers (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). The type or types of undead created is based on caster level, as shown below.


| **Caster Level** | **Undead Created** |
|---|---|
| 15th or lower | Shadow |
| 16th–17th | Wraith |
| 18th–19th | Spectre |
| 20th or higher | Devourer |

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.
