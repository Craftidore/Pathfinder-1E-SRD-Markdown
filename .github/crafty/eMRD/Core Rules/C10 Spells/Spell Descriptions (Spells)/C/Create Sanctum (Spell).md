This spell creates an area where magical energies flow more freely, making spells you cast there more potent. All spells cast within the area of the sanctum are treated as though their caster's level were two levels higher than it actually is for the purposes of level-based effects (such as duration, damage dice, etc.). Additionally, any spell cast within the sanctum gains a +2 enhancement bonus to the DC to resist its effects. Finally, when you cast *create sanctum,* you may choose a single metamagic feat from the following list: [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]], [[Enlarge Spell (Feat)|Enlarge Spell]], [[Extend Spell (Feat)|Extend Spell]], [[Heighten Spell (Feat)|Heighten Spell]], [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]], [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]]. [[Widen Spell (Feat)|Widen Spell]]). If you do, all spells cast within the area of the *sanctum* are automatically affected as though by that metamagic feat. If the metamagic feat doesn't apply to a given spell, that spell is simply unaffected (though it continues to gain the other benefits of the *sanctum).*

When you cast *create sanctum,* you choose whether the above benefits apply to all creatures, to creatures who share your alignment, to creatures affiliated with a specific organization you designate at the time of casting. or only to you. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

In order to cast the spell, you must expend 5,000 gp worth of magical herbs, oils, and incense. Additionally, if you chose to include a metamagic feat in the sanctum's effects, you must inlay powerful, mystic runes made of precious metals (such as gold, platinum, and mithral) over the affected area, which costs an additional1,500 gp for each additional spell level the metamagic feat costs (for example, a sanctum which automatically Empowered all spells cast within would cost 8,000 gp: 5,000 gp for the herbs, oils, and incense and 3,000 gp for the runes necessary to Empower the spells).

*Create sanctum* can also be cast in emergencies, though it is far more crude when done in this fashion. Cast in this way, *create sanctum* has a casting time of 1 full round, lasts for 1 round per caster level (to a maximum of 20 rounds at 20th level), does not require a focus, and uses a small portion of blood from a spellcaster as its only material component. Such "quick and dirty' versions of the spell automatically apply to all creatures within the area (rather than allowing you to choose who it affects), and are not capable of automatically applying metamagic feats to spells cast within the area.

An area can only receive the benefit of one *create sanctum* at a time. *Create sanctum* counters but does not dispel *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**.*
