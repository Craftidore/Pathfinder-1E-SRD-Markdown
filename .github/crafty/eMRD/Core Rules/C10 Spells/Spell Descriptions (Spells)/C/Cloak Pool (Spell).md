*A few words and motions, and the swirling color pool becomes as silver-gray as the rest of the Astral Plane.*

This spell causes a color pool on the Astral Plane—an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane—to seemingly cease to exist. In truth, the color pool is only hidden from view. The use of this spell does not hide the area around the pool; it masks only the fact that a pool is present. *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|See invisibility]]* or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* reveals the presence of the pool, as does *[[Analyze Portal (Spell)|analyze portal]]*.
