*Green-tinged smoke billows from the earth, obscuring sight and burning all it touches.*

You create a bank of smoke, similar in effect to *a* *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]**.* In addition to obscuring sight, the cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage per round to all creatures within. Furthermore, its acrid fumes burn the eyes, imposing a â€“5 penalty on all attack rolls and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks unless a creature succeeds on a Fortitude save (repeated each round the creature is within the cloud). These penalties last as long as the subject remains within the cloud, plus an additional 2 rounds thereafter.

If a creature within the cloud takes acid damage from any other effect, it must succeed on a Fortitude save (using this spell's save DC) or be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round.
