*Splaying your fingers, you call upon the energies that dwell within the shadowy places of the world. Your arm shakes with barely contained power, causing a translucent gray cone to burst forth from your outstretched hand.*

Creatures in the cone must succeed on a Will save or believe darkness has engulfed them, rendering them [[Blinded|blinded]]. A creature that makes its initial Will save suffers no ill effects. A creature that fails its initial save can attempt a new saving throw each round until it succeeds or the spell expires. Failing the subsequent saving throws results in continued blindness. Success on a later save means the creature feels its vision beginning to clear, although its vision remains dim and hazy for the remainder of the spell. This results in a 20% miss chance for any attack the creature makes.
