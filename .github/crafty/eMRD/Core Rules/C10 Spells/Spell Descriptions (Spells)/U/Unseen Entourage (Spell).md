This spell functions as *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]*, with the following differences:

- The spell conjures up one such servant per caster level.
- The servants have Strength scores equal to 10 plus your caster level (maximum Strength 20).
- The servants can make [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]], and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] (to provide bonuses on saves against severe weather) checks, in addition to all other skill checks allowed by *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]*. They may vocalise and assume visible shapes as needed for these checks but for no other purposes i.e. a servant may speak to communicate the result of its [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check, or may manifest as a ghostly dancer for a [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (dance) check, but cannot speak to warn a character of danger or assume a shape to distract an enemy.
- The servants have a bonus on all allowed skill checks equal to your caster level (maximum +10) plus your primary casting attribute modifier (e.g. Charisma modifier for bards and sorcerers, Intelligence modifier for wizards, Wisdom modifier for clerics). They canâ€™t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 20.
- The servants' land speed is 30 feet and they may fly at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.
