*You speak a word of emancipation.*

Upon casting this spell, you force the target creature to immediately attempt a grapple check. If it succeeds on that check, the creature immediately ends and escapes from any grapple or pin that it is currently subject to (even if it isn’t the creature’s turn). Typically, this spell is used to free an ally from the grasp of a creature that is larger and/or stronger than the ally.

This spell was developed by dragonborn sorcerers to better face the threat of their enormous dragon enemies (many of which have the ability to snatch up smaller foes).
