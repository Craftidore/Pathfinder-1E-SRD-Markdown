*The creature you touch grows thick tree roots that anchor it to the ground and provide it with life-sustaining healing.*

The creature you touch must be standing on or otherwise touching the ground for this spell to have an effect on it. For the duration of the spell, the touched creature can’t move from its current space, nor can it be moved from its space by bull rushes, overruns, magic such as *[[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]],* or any effect short of a massive earthquake. Such attempts simply fail. If an overrun attempt is made against a creature with *unyielding roots,* the rooted creature must block rather than avoid the overrun. The rooted creature automatically wins the Strength check to stop the overrun and can make a Strength check (opposed by the overrunning creature’s Strength or Dexterity check) to knock the overrunning creature prone.

The roots draw life energy from the ground that feed the touched creature, healing up to 30 points of damage per round, neutralizing poisons automatically, and wiping away negative levels (as the *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]* spell). The touched creature gets a +4 bonus on Fortitude and Will saves as long as the roots remain, but a –4 penalty on Reflex saves.

**GM Note**

*Note:* Sage Advice, Dragon Magazine #324, pg. 103:

**The *unyielding roots* spell anchors the recipient, making it impossible for him to move form his space. The flanking rules are based on the lack of facing in the game, but they presume that a creature is always turning to deal with adjacent attackers. Should the immobility imbued by this spell also make it easier for a creature to flank the recipient, as the recipient cannot move to face the attacker?**

A creature under the effect of *unyielding root*s is just a vulnerable to flanking as any other creature, but no more so. There are a whole category of immobilizing spells and effects, such as *[[Hold Person (Spell)|hold person]]*, that would appear to create similar situations, but these effects don’t alter the fundamentally abstract nature of D&D combat.

On the other hand, if you’re using the Combat Facing variant found in Unearthed Arcana, the *unyielding roots* spell could create some interesting tactical limitations for the recipients.
