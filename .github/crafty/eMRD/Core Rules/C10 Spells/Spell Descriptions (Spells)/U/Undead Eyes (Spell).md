This spell allows the caster to form a telepathic link with a mindless undead creature that the caster has first cast *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]* upon. The telepathic link provides two benefits. First, the caster can issue telepathic commands to the target (with the normal restrictions for *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]*). Second, the caster can form a sense-link to the target as a free action. This link allows the caster to see and hear through the sense, of the undead creature.

While using the sense-link the caster is considered [[Stunned|stunned]]; he cannot take any physical actions and is only dimly aware of events going on around him.

*Focus:* The user must possess a piece of the body of the undead creature he links with-a tuft of hair, a sliver of bone, a finger, or something similar. If the focus is removed from the caster, the link is broken.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The range of the telepathic link is limited to the same plane unless the caster has a magical means of extending it.
