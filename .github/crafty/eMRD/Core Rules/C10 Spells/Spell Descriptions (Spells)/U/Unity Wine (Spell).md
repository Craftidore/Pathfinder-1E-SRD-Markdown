With your holy symbol in one hand, you hold your other hand over a container of wine, invoking the spirit of community and blessing on all who drink from it. You infuse up to 1 pint of wine in a single container with energy. Up to four living creatures can partake of the wine. Drinking a glass takes at least a standard action, though diners usually imbibe the wine over the course of a meal. Creatures that drink unity wine feel uplifted and inspired, gaining a +1 morale bonus on skill checks for the spell's duration.
