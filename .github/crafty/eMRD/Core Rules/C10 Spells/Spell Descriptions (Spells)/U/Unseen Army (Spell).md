This spell functions as *[[Spiritual Weapon (Spell)|spiritual weapon]]*, with the following exceptions:

- It summons one weapon per caster level.
- The weapons each take the form of a weapon you are proficient with, and they benefit from any feats you possess for that weapon (e.g. [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], etc.).
- The weapons deal force damage equal to the base damage of real weapons of that type, +1 point per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level)
- The weapons are invisible, as *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]*, and gain the associated benefits as such.
- The weapons attack with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level (allowing them multiple attacks) and gain an additional bonus on attacks equal to your primary casting attribute modifier (e.g. Charisma modifier for sorcerers, Intelligence modifier for wizards, Wisdom modifier for clerics).
- The weapons get flanking bonuses and may help a combatant get such bonuses.
- The weapons fly at a speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability.
- You may redirect any number of the weapons as a move action.
- The weapons can be damaged by area attacks. Each weapon has hardness and hitpoints equal to your caster level.

*Focus:* A set of miniature replicas of each weapon to be conjured. The miniatures must be fashioned from the purest platinum and set with radiant diamonds, costing 1,000 gp per weapon to be conjured (you may cast the spell with fewer replicas than your caster level but you conjure correspondingly fewer weapons).
