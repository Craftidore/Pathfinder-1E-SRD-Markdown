You attempt to place a hyperdimensional object under the skin of a target creature without breaching its actual skin. While staring at the target, you feel for the edges of reality and grab a small object, and then you plunge your hand forward.

When you do so, your forearm disappears, leaving a ball of roiling flesh where your elbow passes into extradimensional space. To implant the item beneath the target’s skin, you must succeed on an [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]] ranged touch attack (although you do not become an [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]] creature while casting this spell). If you hit, your hand bypasses the target’s armor and skin and positions the implant. This attack ignores target cover bonuses, natural armor, shields, and most armor, but it does not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects, such as *[[Arcane Bulwark (Spell)|arcane bulwark]], [[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]],* and bracers of armor.

The object implanted must be four or more size categories smaller than the target, and it must be flat enough to fit just under the target’s skin. For example, you could implant a throwing star or a note with *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]]* into a Medium target. You could not implant a mace or a helmet, however.

The target suffers 1 hp nonlethal damage per round the implant remains. Removal requires a sharp blade and causes 1d6 hp damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *calling card* to *under the skin* to avoid duplication.
