*At your gesture, the terrain flattens itself, as though a great weight pressed down upon it.*

You cover an area of solid terrain with a faint layer of semisolid magic. This effect transforms difficult terrain into clear, flat terrain, allowing full movement, charge attacks, and any other skill use or movement normally impeded by difficult terrain.

This spell is not sufficient to actually cause the terrain to bear weight, however, so pitfalls, quicksand, and liquid surfaces still function normally in that respect.
