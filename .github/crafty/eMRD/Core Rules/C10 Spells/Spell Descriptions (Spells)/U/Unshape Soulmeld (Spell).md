You unshape (destroy) one soulmeld currently shaped on the target creature. You can choose a specifi c soulmeld if you wish; otherwise, the soulmeld affected is chosen randomly from all those currently shaped on the target. To succeed in unshaping the soulmeld, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the meldshaper level of the soulmeld (add +4 to the DC if the soulmeld is bound to a chakra). If the unshaped soulmeld was bound to one of the target’s chakras, the target takes damage equal to 3d6 points plus 1 additional point per caster level (maximum 3d6+15). Essentia invested in an unshaped soulmeld returns to the target’s essentia pool. If the target creature has no soulmelds shaped, this spell has no effect.
