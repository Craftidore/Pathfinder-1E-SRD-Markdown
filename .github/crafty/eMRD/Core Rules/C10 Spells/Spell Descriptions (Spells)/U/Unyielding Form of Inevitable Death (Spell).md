*Your flesh turns into solid onyx, and your muscled fists crackle with the unbridled power of thunder and lightning.*

You take the form of a marut, including the full plate armor normally worn by such a creature. You gain 50 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. You can use each of the marut's at-will spell-like abilities (such as *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**)* once per casting of the spell, but you don't gain access to any of the marut's 1/day or 1/week spell-like abilities (such as *[[Chain Lightning (Spell)|chain lightning]]* or *[[Earthquake (Spell)|earthquake]]**).*
