*A burst of white energy erupts from your body to destroy spells that contain, constrain, or seal.*

An *unbinding* spell negates *charm* and *hold* spells of all types; *arcane locks* and similar closures; and spells that create physical or magical barriers, such as *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]], [[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, *[[Guards and Wards (Spell)|guards and wards]], [[Temporal Stasis (Spell)|temporal stasis]],* and *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* spells, among others. The effect of a *[[Statue (Spell)|statue]]* spell is also ended, and a *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* is shattered—forever destroyed—and the life force within snuffed out. In addition, any spell that holds magical effects, including other spells (*[[Magic Mouth (Spell)|magic mouth]],* [[Imbue With Spell Ability (Spell)|Imbue With Spell Ability]]>ability, and so on), immediately releases them at a range of 0 feet.

Protective spells such as *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]], [[Shield (Spell)|shield]], [[Globe of Invulnerability (Spell)|globe of invulnerability]],* and similar spells are not affected by an *unbinding*. Petrified creatures are neither revealed nor restored. Individuals bound to service are not freed (including creatures such as familiars, invisible stalkers, genies, and elementals). An *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* is not affected, nor does the effect of *unbinding* penetrate one. A *[[Magic Circle Against Evil (Spell)|magic circle against evil]]* (or another alignment) that currently holds a creature imprisoned is dispelled.

Curses and *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas/quest]]* spells are negated only if you are of a level equal to or greater than that of the original caster.

All these effects occur without regard to the caster’s wishes. Spell effects on the person of the caster, or effects or items being carried or worn by the caster, remain undisturbed, but any others within the area are affected, including those of allies. The opening of locks or other closures triggers any alarms or traps attached to them. Any released creature might or might not be friendly to the caster.

*Material Components:* A lodestone and a pinch of saltpeter.
