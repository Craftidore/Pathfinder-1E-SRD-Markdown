This spell functions as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]**,* except that the *unseen crafter* can be assigned any one task that can be accomplished by the use of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill. Appropriate tools and materials must be provided for the *unseen crafter*; it makes [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] checks using your ranks in the skill plus your bonus for the relevant spellcasting ability (Intelligence for artificers, wizards, and magewrights, Charisma for bards and sorcerers, and Wisdom for clerics).

An *unseen crafter* can take 10 or attempt to work more quickly (as described in the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill description), but this must be part of the command it is given when the spell is cast. Once the *unseen crafter* has completed the assigned task, the spell ends as if dismissed. If the *unseen crafter* leaves work undone, any creature or another *unseen crafter* can continue it.

*Special:* When the *unseen crafter* is commanded to repair a [[Warforged (Domain)|warforged]], it receives a +10 bonus on its [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Witch 2 to Level.

*Spell Secret:* A [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] roll (DC 25) allows the *unseen crafter* to assist in the crafting of magical items. 

A [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] roll (DC 30) allows the *unseen crafter* to craft as if it had the [[Cooperative Crafting (Feat)|Cooperative Crafting]] feat.

A [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] roll (DC 35) allows the *unseen crafter* to share all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills and item creation feats the caster possesses.
