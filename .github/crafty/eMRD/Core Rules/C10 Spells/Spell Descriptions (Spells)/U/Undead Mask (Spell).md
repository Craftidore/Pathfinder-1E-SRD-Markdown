You imbue the subject with powerful transformative magic, granting it some of the characteristics of the undead type. The subject's flesh seems necrotic and rotting, much like that of a zombie. Nonintelligent undead ignore the subject unless the subject attacks the undead. Any spell or effect that affects undead also affects the subject. The subject can be turned, destroyed, rebuked, or commanded as an undead of its Hit Dice (and gets no saving throw to resist the result). Negative energy effects (such as *inflict* spells) heal the subject, while positive energy effects (such as *cure* spells) harm her.

An undead creature is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*, paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is immune to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. The subject loses its Constitution score while the spell is in effect, along with any bonus hit points from Constitution. The subject is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects. An undead spellcaster uses its Charisma modifier when making Concentration checks. The subject's other ability scores are unaffected. The subject retains its skills and feats.
