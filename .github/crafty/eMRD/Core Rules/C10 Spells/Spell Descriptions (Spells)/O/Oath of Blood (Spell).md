*Oath of blood* functions only when cast on a creature that has recently been subject to a *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas]]* or similar spell. It extends the reach of the *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas]]* beyond death. If the individual subject to the *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas]]* dies before completing the task, *oath of blood* animates him as an undead creature in order that he might continue his quest. The nature of the undead creature is determined by the caster level of this spell, as per *[[Create Undead (Spell)|create undead]]*. Once the task is complete or the original *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas]]* (or similar spell) expires, the magic animating the subject ends and he returns to death.

*Material Component:* Grave dirt mixed with powdered onyx worth at least 40 gp per HD of the target.
