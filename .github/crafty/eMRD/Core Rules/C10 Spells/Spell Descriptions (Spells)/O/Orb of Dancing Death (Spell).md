You call upon dark necromantic energy to drain the life force of your foes. You create a small orb of pulsing black energy (about 6 inches across) that flies toward a chosen creature, striking as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the creature gains 1 negative level.

Each round as a move action, you can direct the *orb of dancing death* to attack another creature within range (including the previous target, if desired). If not directed, the orb returns to your side.

If a creature has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level. Negative levels stack.

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim’s levels, but the negative levels from the *orb of dancing death* don’t last long enough to do so.

An undead creature struck by the orb gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
