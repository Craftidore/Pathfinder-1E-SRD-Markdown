*When you cast this spell, you fire your allies and companions with a divine madness or fury, greatly enhancing their combat ability.*

Allies gain one additional melee attack each round, at their highest attack bonus, when making a full attack. (This additional attack is not cumulative with other effects that grant extra attacks, such as a *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* spell.) They also gain a +3 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls. (This bonus on melee attack rolls does stack with the bonus provided by *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]].*)
