A scintillating aura of white radiance wreathes you and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The radiance also protects you from electricity attacks.

Any creature striking you with a natural or handheld weapons deals normal damage but also takes 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per caster level (the creatureâ€™s spell resistance applies).

You take only half damage from electricity-based attacks. If an electricity-based attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.

The radiance is as bright as a *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and shadowy illumination to 20 feet.

*Abstinence Component:* You must not have cast a darkness or Necromancy spell within the last 24 hours before casting this spell.
