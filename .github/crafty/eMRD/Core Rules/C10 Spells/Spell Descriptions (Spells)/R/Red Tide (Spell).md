*As you complete the spell, a surging, frothing wave of thick, red seawater washes over everything in the area*.

All creatures in the area of a *red tide* spell are immediately knocked prone and must make a Fortitude saving throw.

A creature that makes its Fortitude save against a *red tide* is [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw is [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1 minute, and it takes 2d6 points of Strength damage. After 1 minute, the nausea ends but the creature must make a second Fortitude saving throw or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to these effects of a *red tide.*

Creatures with the fire subtype take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half with a successful Reflex save.

The tainted water evoked by this spell vanishes almost immediately, and any objects or creatures in the area do not emerge wet.
