*You speak the words of this spell and your claws shine with lustrous yellow radiance, growing more slender and sharper as you watch.*

Choose one of your natural weapons that deals slashing or piercing damage (such as a bite or a single claw). That natural weapon’s threat range doubles (in most cases, becoming 19–20). The effect of this spell does not stack with any other effects that increase a weapon’s threat range.
