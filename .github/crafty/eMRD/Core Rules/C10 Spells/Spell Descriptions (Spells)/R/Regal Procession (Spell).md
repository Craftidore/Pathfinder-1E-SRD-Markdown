*You toss a bit of horsehair into the air, and as it drifts toward the ground, an array of finely adorned mounts appears.*

This spell functions like *[[Mount (Spell)|mount]]*, except you can summon several mounts. Each comes with a bit and bridle, riding saddle, saddle blanket, ribbons, adornments, and a banner. You select the colors of the horses and the livery, either or both of which can include a heraldic or personal symbol.
