*By laying hands on your ally and saying a brief prayer, you convince a higher power to grant him a second chance.*

The subject of a *resurgence* spell can make a second attempt to save against an ongoing spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, such as *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]*. If the subject of *resurgence* is affected by more than one ongoing magical effect, the subject chooses one of them to retry the save against. If the subject succeeds on the saving throw on the second attempt, the effect ends immediately. *Resurgence* never restores hit points or ability score damage, but it does eliminate any conditions such as [[Shaken|shaken]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], or [[Nauseated|nauseated]] that were caused by a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability.

If a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability doesn’t allow a save (such as *[[Power Word Stun (Spell)|power word stun]]*), then *resurgence* won’t help the subject recover.
