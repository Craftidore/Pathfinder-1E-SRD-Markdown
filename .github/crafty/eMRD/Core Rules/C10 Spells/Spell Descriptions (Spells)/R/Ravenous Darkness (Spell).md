*Tendrils of shadow leap from the object youâ€™ve touched, then swiftly form into an all-encompassing wave. The spreading night seems to blot out both light and life.*

The object touched sheds darkness as a *[[Deeper Darkness (Spell)|deeper darkness]]* spell. In addition, every living creature within the area of the resulting darkness (a 60-foot radius) takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage per round. Any creature under the influence of an ongoing negative energy effect (such as negative levels or necromantic-based ability damage) instead takes 2d6 points of damage per round. This effect ends for a given creature if it moves out of the area of darkness but resumes should it reenter. A successful Fortitude save negates the damage, but the affected creature must repeat the save every round, whether it succeeds or fails. If a creature has spell resistance, the spell must overcome it to deal damage.

Any undead creature within the darkness instead gains fast healing 1.

*Ravenous darkness* counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7 to Level.
