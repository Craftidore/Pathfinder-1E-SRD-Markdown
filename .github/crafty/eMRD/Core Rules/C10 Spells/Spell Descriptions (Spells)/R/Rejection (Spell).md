*With a stern word of disallowance, you cast the spell. A barely perceptible hum sounds in the direction you indicate.*

A creature in the area must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be pushed away from you to a distance of 5 feet per caster level. If the creature is pushed into a wall or similarly solid surface, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet it was moved.

Movement forced by this spell can take the creature beyond the spellâ€™s range.
