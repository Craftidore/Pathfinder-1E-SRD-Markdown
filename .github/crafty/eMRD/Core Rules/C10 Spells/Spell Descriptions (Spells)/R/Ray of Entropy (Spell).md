*You release a crackling black ray. The smell of decay fills the air.*

When you cast this spell, you unleash a ray of negative energy that consumes the life energy of the subject. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If your attack is successful against a living creature, the ray makes the subject weaker, slower, and less healthy. The subject takes a â€“4 penalty to Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity for the duration of the spell.
