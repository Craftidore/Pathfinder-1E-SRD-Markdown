A needle flicked from your fingers multiplies into a hail of needles, raining down on all the targets you select. You make a normal ranged attack against each target separately, and the needles deal 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) divided up among the targets. Thus, a 4th-level wu jen can target a single creature with 4d4 points of damage, or two creatures with 2d4 points of damage each, and so forth.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2 to Level.
