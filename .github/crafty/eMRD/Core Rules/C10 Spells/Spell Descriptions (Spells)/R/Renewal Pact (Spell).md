*Calling upon your deity to aid your ally, you bind a protective spell to your friend, leaving a tattoolike mark of your deityâ€™s holy symbol on his skin.*

This spell remains dormant until the subject is subjected to one or more of the following adverse conditions: [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|ability damage]], [[Blinded|blinded]], *[[Confused|confused]]*, [[Dazed|dazed]], [[Dazzled|dazzled]], [[Deafened|deafened]], diseased, [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], feebleminded, [[Insanity (Spell)|insanity]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], [[Sickened|sickened]], [[Stunned|stunned]], or poisoned. One round after the subject is affected by a condition that triggers the *renewal pact*, the subject receives a *[[Panacea (Spell)|panacea]]* spell at a caster level equal to that of the caster of the *renewal pact*.

A creature can be subject to only one *renewal pact* at a time. Casting *renewal pact* on a subject who already has an untriggered *renewal pact* voids the earlier pact.
