The subject becomes supernaturally loud, and his voice carries over long distances. A creature speaking or singing with the aid of *resounding voice* can be heard clearly up to 100 feet away per caster level. Creatures within an area of magical *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* cannot hear the subject, and a subject within a *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* effect cannot be heard at all.

*Resounding voice* counters and dispels *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* and is also countered and dispelled by *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]*.
