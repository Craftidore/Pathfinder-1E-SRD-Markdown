As *[[Solid Fog (Spell)|solid fog]]**,* but the cloud of fog shimmers with brilliant celestial radiance. Creatures within the cloud must make successful Fortitude saves or be [[Dazzled|dazzled]], taking a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls for as long as they remain in the cloud and for 1 minute afterward. Creatures with light sensitivity or otherwise susceptible to bright light are [[Blinded|blinded]] if they fail their saves. Sightless creatures are not affected by the radiance.

Spell resistance applies to the reduced movement, melee attack and damage penalties, and dazzling or blinding effects, but not to the concealment provided or the prevention of ranged weapon attacks.

*Abstinence Component:* You must not have cast a darkness or Necromancy spell within the past 24 hours before casting this spell.
