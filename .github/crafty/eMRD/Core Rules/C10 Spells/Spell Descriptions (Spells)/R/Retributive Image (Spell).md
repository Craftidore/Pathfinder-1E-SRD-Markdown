As *though drawn straight from your imagination, the image you envision springs into existence.*

You create an image or scene, which can incorporate not only sight but sound, smell, and thermal effects. This effect functions in all respects like *[[Major Image (Spell)|major image]]**,* except that the illusion is a pattern rather than a figment, and thus has a mind-affecting element to it. Anyone who successfully disbelieves the illusion endures a mental backlash that deals 1d6 points of damage +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +15) and is [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the [[Dazed|dazed]] effect.
