*Hot, burning passion fills your soul as you complete the spell. You release the passionate energy into the chosen area, causing fires there to flare with their own elemental desire to burn.*

This spell inflames existing fire, giving it a passion to burn. All normal fires within the affected area flare up, burning twice as hot and twice as bright. The illumination radii of all nonmagical fires double (so a torch casts bright illumination in a 40-foot radius), and all nonmagical fires deal double damage (so a creature that catches on fire takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round). Fire that leaves the area remains affected by the spell.

Fire affected by this spell burns out twice as quickly, so a torch that is the subject of a *raging flame* spell burns out in 30 minutes instead of the normal hour.

Magical fire in the area, such as from a *[[Produce Flame (Spell)|produce flame]]* or *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell, burns hotter, dealing +1 point of fire damage per die.

*Raging flame* counters or dispels the effect of *slow burn*.
