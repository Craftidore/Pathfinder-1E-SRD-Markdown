You cast this spell on summoned outsiders*.* If such an outsider is slain (and thus returns from whence it came), it instantly returns to the spot where it died. It is fully healed, as if freshly summoned, and it acts immediately. The outsider remains for as long as it would stay if the original summoning spell were just cast upon it. It immediately attacks the creature that slew it and continues until one of them is dead. If it was not slain directly by a creature (for example, if it died as the result of a trap), or if its slayer is not within its perception, it acts normally upon its return.

This spell does not work on called creatures or those that are physically presentâ€”only on summoned targets.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added, Sorcerer 5, Summoner 4, Witch 5, Wizard 5 to Level.
