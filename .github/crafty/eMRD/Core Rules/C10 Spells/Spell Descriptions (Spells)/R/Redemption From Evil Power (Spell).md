You undo the effects of a spell with the evil descriptor cast within 1 round. Thus, if someone casts a *[[Summon Monster V (Spell)|summon monster V]]* spell as an evil spell to summon a fiendish creature, you can make it so that the creature never appeared. Wounds inflicted by the summoned creature vanish. Likewise, you can undo the damage wrought by a *[[Blasphemy (Spell)|blasphemy]]* spell or the protection offered by an *[[Unholy Aura (Spell)|unholy aura]]*.

This spell does not actually turn back time. The evil caster has still lost the spell slot or the prepared spell. Everyone involved remembers the spell being cast and its effects.
