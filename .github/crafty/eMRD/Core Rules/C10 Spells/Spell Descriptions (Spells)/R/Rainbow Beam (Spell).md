*You fire a ray of swirling, multihued light drawn from radiant energies. The lightâ€™s hues wind together but remain independent.*

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If you hit, the subject is [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for 1 minute. The spell also deals 1d12 points of damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d12). A *rainbow beam* deals a random type of damage as determined by the following table. If two types of energy are indicated, *rainbow beam* deals half its damage from each type of energy indicated. Creatures apply energy resistance separately to each type of damage.

|---|---|---|
| 1 | red | fire |
| 2 | orange | acid |
| 3 | yellow | electricity |
| 4 | green | poison |
| 5 | blue | cold |
| 6 | indigo | sonic |
| 7 | violet | force |
| 8 | multihued | roll twice (ignore further results of 8) |
