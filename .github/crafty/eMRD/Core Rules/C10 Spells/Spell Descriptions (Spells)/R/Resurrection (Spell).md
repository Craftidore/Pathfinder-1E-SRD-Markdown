This spell functions like *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]**,* except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be resurrected).

You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be resurrected.

For most, death is an inevitable fact of life. Luckily for many adventurers on Golarion, so is resurrection. Once a party is experienced and wealthy enough (or has won the favor of the right patron), death becomes more a trauma to be overcome—a new chapter rather than the story’s end. 

When a character returns from the dead, she awakens as if from a long sleep. She retains her previous personality and remembers nothing of her time in the afterlife. However, this does not mean she is not marked by the experience. PCs returned to life via *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* often still bear the injuries that slew them, and nearly all forms of resurrection exact a cost (often represented by negative levels or Constitution drain)—a reminder of the stark toll the passage to death and back takes on both body and soul. 

The effects of a PC’s return shouldn’t be confined to the character sheet; there can and should be in-game consequences as well. The average citizen of the Inner Sea hears about resurrection in tall tales and mummers’ plays, but few ever witness it firsthand. If a character’s death was in public view or otherwise well known, onlookers might be surprised, delighted, or outright horrified to see him strolling through the market square a few days later. If a PC has debts, his death may have legally discharged them or caused them to become due prematurely. Hirelings and servants may feel themselves freed of their obligations to the character. Upon hearing of his return, old enemies might come looking to settle old scores—after all, if the PC was murdered once, surely he can be slain a second time. And he may have even earned new enemies by his return, including those who oppose resurrection on principle or who covet resurrected souls. 

Resurrection can also present out-of-game pitfalls, as noted on pages 67 and 92 of the *Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide*. It’s worth repeating that players are not obligated to bring characters back from the dead if they’d prefer to start fresh with new ones. Nor should resurrecting a deceased PC bankrupt or otherwise derail the rest of the party without the other players’ consent. Sometimes it’s just not possible to return a character from the dead, and that isn’t a bad thing; the risk of loss is part of what makes gaming exciting, raising the stakes for all involved. But if a character is particularly beloved, most dedicated gaming groups can work with creative GMs to find ways to cheat death, ideally with a quest that’s suitable for such an epic endeavor. 

Meanwhile, GMs should only rarely resurrect NPCs, and never more than once, as noted in the *GameMastery Guide*. While the deathless villain is a staple of fiction, it can feel like a cheat at the table. The return of a supposedly vanquished foe should be (at most) a once-in-a-campaign shock that spurs PCs to greater heroism; it should never feel like a hackneyed sequel or GM fiat. 

When handled well, death and resurrection can provide a springboard for new avenues of storytelling and richer roleplaying experiences. The following pages explore some of the common and uncommon means of resurrection; reveal the cults, monsters, and otherworldly forces who oppose or prey upon the newly risen; and serve up a number of resurrection-focused adventure seeds ready to be dropped into your campaign. 

**METHODS OF RESURRECTION** 

The most common method of resurrection available to adventurers is divine magic, particularly *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]*. While undeniably effective, *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* has many limitations: The conjuration requires a near-flawless diamond (worth 5,000 gp), which might equal the combined wealth of an entire low-level band of adventurers, and it must be cast within a relatively short time after a character’s death. The recipient returns to life badly weakened, often with wounds only partially closed, spells lost, and the touch of the grave lingering on in the form of negative levels or Constitution drain. *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|Raise dead]]* also requires a mostly intact corpse, and an arm lost to a bulette remains lost. Bodies that have suffered massive trauma, disintegration, and the like do not offer enough of a vessel for the soul to return to. 

As a healing spell that can also raise the dead, *[[Breath of Life (Spell)|breath of life]]* is an attractive solution, provided the spell's caster can reach her dead ally within 1 round of the fatal injury. While *[[Breath of Life (Spell)|breath of life]]* is an ideal triage option that avoids *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]*’s many costs, its strict timing requirements mean that the opportunity is often lost, and bringing back the character then requires more taxing solutions. 

For corpses greatly damaged or dead for any length of time, *resurrection* and *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* offer the most hope. While costly even for wealthy PCs, *resurrection* works upon even the dust left over from *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, and powerful casters can recall someone who has been deceased for up to 200 years. Meanwhile, *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* enables characters to evade even the tax in negative levels from *resurrection*.

Because resurrection magic is connected to the progress of souls, it is primarily the province of clerics. Other spellcasters’ attempts to dabble in this area usually amount to workarounds and shortcuts. Powerful witches have access to *[[Temporary Resurrection (Spell)|temporary resurrection]]* (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic* 243), for instance, but it lasts only a day. A druid’s *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]* spell returns the deceased to life… but in a completely new body, which may not even be the same species! 

Forward-thinking arcane spellcasters sometimes rely on *[[Clone (Spell)|clone]]*. Using a bit of her own flesh, such a caster can grow a duplicate of herself over 2 to 8 months. Once the inert clone is fully grown, the caster can rest secure, knowing that if she is slain, her soul will be automatically shunted to a waiting body identical to her own. However, this requires her to store the clone in a secure location for years or even decades to come. It also means abandoning her old body, her gear, and any companions to whatever fate befell her. 

As a last resort, desperate adventurers may turn to *miracle* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* to revive a fallen friend. As with all wishcraft, PCs must take care not to overreach the bounds of the spell, or they risk having their wish turn against them (*GameMastery Guide* 116). Provided PCs limit their wish to replicating *resurrection*, the attempt likely succeeds. But the more the caster pushes the wish’s boundaries (for instance, attempting to a restore a soul too long dead), the more likely it is the spell will fail or the result will be a distortion of the caster’s intent. 

*[[Miracle (Spell)|Miracle]]* avoids many of *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*’s drawbacks, and the spell can achieve even more spectacular results if the caster performs the proper obeisance. But it comes with one serious caveat: the caster is quite literally asking for divine intervention. This is not a request to be made lightly or frequently. Should the request go against the deity’s will, the spell fails. And even a successful *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* may obligate both caster and target to the deity’s service in the future. 

Obscure rituals or magical locations might also return a soul to life. This allows GMs to find in-game reasons to break the usual restrictions on access to spellcasting, offer resurrection to a party without a divine caster, motivate PCs to venture to distant locations, and otherwise encourage deeper player engagement with the game world. For instance, the ouroboros blood ritual (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6* 207) acts as *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]*, with no limit to how long the body has been dead provided its soul has not been judged. Not only might this allow PCs the opportunity to resurrect a soul otherwise beyond their reach, but obtaining the freshly harvested blood of a CR 21 ouroboros is an adventure in itself. PCs might likewise chase rumors of a magical altar, a life-giving pool, or a millennia-old golden willow tree, all in the hopes of finding a location or ritual component that will mean the difference between life and death. 

**LIMITATIONS OF RESURRECTION** 

Souls are fragile things, made of the quintessence of the multiverse and shaped by a lifetime of experiences and moral choices. They are also valuable on a spiritual level to outsiders—as currency, planar building blocks, spell components, and even food. As such, a soul separated from its body can be damaged, traded away, stolen, or simply obliterated. Certain extraplanar monsters such as cacodaemons and devourers store or digest the souls of those they consume. Some greater evil outsiders stain souls via curses, magical infections, or a corrupting touch. So long as a soul is marked for damnation or used up in such a way, it cannot be resurrected by ordinary means. 

A number of powerful spells and artifacts actively thwart attempts to raise the dead. Both *malediction* and *[[Hellfire (Spell)|hellfire]] ray* (*Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned* 184) corrupt the souls they affect, damning them to evil-aligned planes, while *[[Destruction (Spell)|destruction]]* incinerates characters killed by it, complicating resurrection. A priest harboring evil intentions might cast *false resurrection* (*Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue* 214) to call a shadow demon to possess a corpse, locking out its original soul. The spell *[[Create Soul Gem (Spell)|create soul gem]]* (*Book of the Damned* 184) temporarily traps a soul, and only a deity can restore a soul trapped by *[[Soul Bind (Spell)|soul bind]]* or lost to a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]*. 

One of the most common obstacles to normal resurrection is a prior claim upon the soul by a planar entity. The infernal contracts offered by devils (*Book of the Damned* 202) are infamous for this, offering power in life but consigning the soul to Hell after death. Likewise, the feysworn (*Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The First World, Realm of the Fey* 8), who serve the mysterious Eldest of the First World, are destined to reincarnate at their patron’s side. Even servants of the celestial powers are not guaranteed a return—lawful good outsiders in particular often begin their existence as mortal martyrs, and many a noble crusader has tried to raise a fallen friend only to find her deity has made other arrangements. No matter how well intentioned her original oath, a character who promises her soul to a planar power forever puts at risk any chance at a return from death. 

**THREATS TO THE RESURRECTED**

Numerous creatures and groups oppose—or even prey upon—the newly risen. Splinter cults and fundamentalist sects may see resurrection as an affront to their gods, and those who participate in the soul trade or who hunger for souls may deem a resurrected soul to be a precious asset. As a result, a recently resurrected PC may find herself facing a whole new slate of enemies she never knew existed, some of which are detailed below. 

**Akhanas:** Life must give way to death, and death to life. Such is the credo of these misty, four-armed aeons. If an akhana deems that a resurrection has caused some universal imbalance, it seeks to right the scales by slaying the risen mortal a second time, potentially even trapping the errant soul within itself. What motivates these inscrutable aeons to target one victim and leave another untouched is a mystery. 

**Daemonkind:** Powerful daemons often conduct blasphemous experiments on souls, harvesting them in gem form with their cacodaemon pets and then using them to power arcane trials. While for most purposes a previously resurrected soul is no different from any other, some especially exacting rituals call for nothing less, prompting daemons attempting them to hunt far and wide for appropriate mortal subjects. (For more on daemonic uses for souls and their value, see page 191 of the *Book of the Damned*.) 

**Ghoul Gourmands:** Just as an early frost yields delicious ice wine, an untimely demise and resurrection adds an earthy bouquet to humanoid flesh—at least if the diner is a ghoul. In Nemret Noktoria, the Darklands capital of ghoulkind, undead epicures prowl the fleshmarkets, hunting for such delicacies. Powerful undead known as reviviphages dine exclusively on the flesh of the risen. Their selective meals quicken the ichor in their veins, allowing them to momentarily experience the sensations of life again. 

**Gray Gardeners:** Galt’s masked executioners are well known for their *final blades*: magical guillotines that trap the souls of those they behead. Of course, many victims of Galtan justice meet more ordinary ends, typically at the end of a noose or the point of a crossbow bolt. Should any of these reactionaries rise from the grave, a Gray Gardener is sent to end their unlawful parole. 

**Inevitables:** The golden-armored maruts hunt those who have artificially extended their life spans. While the average resurrection does not warrant their attention, combining resurrection magic with wishcraft or spells that defy aging often does. Maruts also monitor life-granting esoteric rituals, particularly ones that demand mass sacrifice. Other inevitables occasionally hunt the resurrected: zelekhuts chase those who use death and resurrection to escape justice, while kolyaruts hunt those who do so to break a contract. 

**Knights of Ozem:** For generations, the Knights of Ozem have stood vigil over the death-haunted Gallowspire and the demon-tainted Worldwound. At both sites, some knights have come to fear the resurrected. Though nearly all crusaders can rattle off a list of comrades returned to life by Iomedae’s mercy, there are whispers of those who came back somehow... different, with the smell of grave dirt clinging to them, or walking as if tugged by an invisible puppeteer. The truth is that the corruption in these places can taint resurrection magic, and some knights are not willing to run that risk. Campfire rumors speak of the Wings of Night, a secret society dedicated to abolishing the practice of resurrection in and around Lastwall and the Worldwound by any means necessary. 

􀀳􀁄􀁗􀁋􀁉􀁌􀁑􀁇􀁈􀁕�􀀜 􀀐 �

**Nightmare Dragons:** Resurrected mortals do not remember their time in Pharasma’s realm—not consciously, at least. But sometimes in sleep, their dream selves recall snippets of their brushes with eternity. Nightmare dragons find the taste of these dreams intoxicating, and some actively hunt the dreamscapes of the resurrected in hopes of feasting on their souls as well. 

**Passengers of Charon:** By turns fascinated with and repelled by death, these cultists of Charon hope that a lifetime of service will buy them passage back to life when their shades reach the River Styx. To this end, Passengers hunt the recently resurrected, believing (incorrectly) that the Horseman of Death prefers these fugitive souls over all others. Passengers often pose as gondoliers, carriage drivers, or traveling surgeons, isolating their victims before capturing their souls via enchanted bottles or summoned cacodaemons. 

**Red Mantis Assassins:** Most assassins find resurrection frustrating, but to worshipers of Achaekek, it is nothing less than heresy. Red Mantis assassins go to great lengths to prevent their victims from being raised, and many are even gifted with a supernatural sense that alerts them to a former victim’s resurrection. A Red Mantis’s pursuit of a risen target is a portrait of grim determination. 

**Shinigami:** Supposedly impartial harbingers of death, shinigami typically dispose of those who would disrupt the delicate balance of life. The resurrected thus sometimes fall under a shinigami’s purview, especially if the person’s return upsets the natural or social order in some fashion. In truth, though, some shinigamis use their mandate as an excuse to simply dispatch risen mortals, particularly when bribed. 

**Sons and Daughters of the Mask:** Worshipers of Norgorber, god of murder, take a very dim view of resurrection, as it has a way of exposing old secrets, fostering unanticipated forgiveness or vengeance, and unknotting years of carefully woven plots. Interestingly, it is the politically minded followers of Norgorber who most doggedly hunt the risen. Professional killers who serve Father Skinsaw see resurrection as merely an added challenge—and they rarely leave enough body to be raised. 

**The Soul Trade:** Souls are a commodity traded throughout the multiverse, and those that have previously been resurrected—whether trapped in soul gems or still in their original bodies—can fetch high prices. Night hags are the most famous soul merchants, hunting in the Ethereal Plane and the Dimension of Dreams and then selling their catches throughout Abaddon.
