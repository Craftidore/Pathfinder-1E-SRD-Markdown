*Throwing out your hand and calling upon your deity for favor, you give your allies a chance to free themselves of the baleful magic.* 

This spell functions like *[[Resurgence (Spell)|resurgence]]*,

except as noted here. The spell grants a second save attempt against a single spell or ability chosen by you. For instance, if three of your allies have been *mind blasted* by mind flayers and two others have been turned into toads by *[[Baleful Polymorph (Spell)|baleful polymorph]]* spells, you must choose to affect either the *mind blast* (granting three new save attempts) or the *baleful polymorphs* (granting two new save attempts).
