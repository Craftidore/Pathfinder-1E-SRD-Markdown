*A cloud of rotting plant and animal matter swirls up from the ground around your target, encompassing it in a whirlwind of decay.*

This spell encompasses your target in a cloud of rotting debris. The target is [[Sickened|sickened]] for 2 rounds. Furthermore, all other creatures are treated as having concealment against the target. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickness, but not the concealment. Nonliving creatures are unaffected by the sickness effect.

A living creature already under the effect of *rot of ages* that fails a save against a second casting of the spell is [[Nauseated|nauseated]] (rather than [[Sickened|sickened]]) for as long as both effects last (and then [[Sickened|sickened]] for the remainder of the second spell's duration).

*Special:* A black dragon capable of casting 3rd-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
