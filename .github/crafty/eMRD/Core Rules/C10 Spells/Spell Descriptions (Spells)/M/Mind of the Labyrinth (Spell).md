*As you close your eyes to mere slits, a black miasma of energy floats around your head, sucking in light and the stray minds of others.*

You twist your mind to become a magical labyrinth, bewildering unsuspecting spellcasters. If an enemy casts a mind-affecting spell or ability that targets you, the enemy becomes *[[Confused|confused]]* for 1 round, disoriented by the maze-like confines of your consciousness. (This *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]* occurs whether or not the spell successfully affects you.) A successful Will save (DC 18 + your Int modifier) negates this effect and renders that foe immune to this casting of the spell.

Furthermore, while *mind of the labyrinth* is active, you can use an immediate action to activate a *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]* effect (as the spell, except that the duration is 1 hour) on one humanoid who casts a mind-affecting spell on you. Doing so ends the duration of *mind of the labyrinth*, though the *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]* effect lasts for 1 hour thereafter.

*Special:* A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks.
