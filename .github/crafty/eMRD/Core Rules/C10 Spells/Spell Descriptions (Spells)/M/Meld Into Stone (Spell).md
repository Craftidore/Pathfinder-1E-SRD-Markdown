*Meld into stone* enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.

While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone’s complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.

Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell’s duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.

The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|Stone to flesh]]* expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. [[Stone Shape (Spell)|Stone shape]] deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. *[[Transmute Rock to Mud (Spell)|Transmute rock to mud]]* expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, *[[Passwall (Spell)|passwall]]* expels you without damage.
