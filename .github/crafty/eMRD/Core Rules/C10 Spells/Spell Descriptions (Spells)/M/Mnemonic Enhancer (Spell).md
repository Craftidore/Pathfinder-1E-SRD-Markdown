Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.

*Prepare*: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.

*Retain*: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the *mnemonic enhancer*. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.

In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).

**GM Notes**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting this spell is known as *Rary's mnemonic enhancer.*
