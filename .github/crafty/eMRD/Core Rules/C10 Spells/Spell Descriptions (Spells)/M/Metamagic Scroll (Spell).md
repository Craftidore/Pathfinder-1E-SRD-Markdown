# Metamagic Scroll (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[1st Level Artificer Spells|Artificer 1]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 1st-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 1]]

**Casting Time:** 1 round

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Spell completion magic item touched

**Duration:** 1 round/level or until used

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)

**Source:** Magic of Eberron (Wotc), pg. 99

You apply a metamagic feat you know to a single spell written or stored on a spell completion item, such as a scroll or minor schema (*Magic of Eberron* 122). For the duration of this infusion, anyone who uses the imbued item applies the effect of that metamagic feat to the spell.

You can only apply the benefit of a metamagic feat that adjusts the spellâ€™s level by two levels or less ([[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]] or [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]], for example, but not [[Maximize Spell (Feat)|Maximize Spell]]). No more than one metamagic feat can be applied to any single spell by way of *metamagic scroll*.
