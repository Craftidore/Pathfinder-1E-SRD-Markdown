*Your melee weapon bursts into orange, red, and gold flames, and shining sparks trail in its wake.*

Your next successful melee attack deals extra fire damage equal to 1d6 points + 1d6 points per four caster levels. In addition, the flames splash into all squares adjacent to the target. Any creatures standing in these squares take half damage from the explosion, with a Reflex save allowed to halve this again. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this splash effect.

You are not harmed by your own *meteoric strike*.

You can cast *meteoric strike* before you make an unarmed attack. If you do, your unarmed attack is considered armed.
