*As you mutter this spell, your words burrow into your foesâ€™ minds like hungry maggots, spawning dark and disturbing thoughts.*

You can choose to inflict one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail their saving throws.

*Hysteria:* The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laughing or crying (equal chance for either). This hysteria affects subjects as though they were [[Nauseated|nauseated]]; they are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action a subject can take is a single move action per turn.

*Panic:* The subjects become [[Panicked|panicked]]. If cornered, a [[Panicked|panicked]] creature cowers.

*Violent Hallucinations*: The subjects perceive any nearby creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones and fighting until the subjects are slain or until no more creatures are in sight.

*Stupor:* The subjects curl up on the floor and remain oblivious to events around them. Characters in a stupor are effectively [[Stunned|stunned]] and prone.
