*Two black tentacles sprout from your shoulder blades and arch over your shoulders.*

The tentacles have 10-foot reach and are animate. Each round as a free action, starting on the turn when you cast the spell, you can direct each tentacle to attack one opponent within reach. The tentacles use your base attack bonus and Strength score, and each deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 points + your Str modifier. The tentacles threaten the area within their reach, and each can make one attack of opportunity per round.

The tentacles also grant you a +4 bonus on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks.

**GM Note**

*Spell Secret:* Using the tentacle of a mind flayer or kraken as an alternate material component allows the caster to use his primary casting attribute modifier in the place of his Strength score. This spell may be stacked up to 3 times by using tentacles from the same creature. Stacking this spell does not increase the damage each tentacle does but increases the number of tentacles active at one time and the [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check bonus to either +7 (two castings) or +10 (three castings).
