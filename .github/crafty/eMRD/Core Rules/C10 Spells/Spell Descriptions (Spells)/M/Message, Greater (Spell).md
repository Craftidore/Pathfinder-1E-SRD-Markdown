Functions as the spell *[[Message (Spell)|message]]* but it does not require line of sight to cast. The caster must know the target(s) well and the targets must be willing. You utter the name of the target and if they are awake and willing they begin to hear your words, and you theirs. An unwilling target can remove themselves from the conversation or refuse to hear a message without requiring a saving throw. The caster cannot make strenuous actions such as combat or spell casting while sharing a message with a distant friend or friends. At the same time, the spell does enable the caster to have a short conversation with one or more individuals from a great distance.

*Focus:* a piece of fine gold wire worth at least 50 gp.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 3, Witch 3 to Level.

*House Rule:* Changed Range from 1,000 miles to 10 miles/level for game balance
