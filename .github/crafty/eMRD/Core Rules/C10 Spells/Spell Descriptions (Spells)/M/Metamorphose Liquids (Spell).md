This spell turns one liquid into another. Magical liquids cannot be created. Poisons may be rendered harmless (although those already consumed are not affected). Living creatures are unaffected except those from the elemental plane of water or oozes, who suffer 1d4+1/level points of damage (Fort negates).

*Material component:* A drop of the liquid to be created, which must be placed on your tongue. (This makes creating poisons, acid, alchemistâ€™s fire, etc. somewhat dangerous.)

**GM Note**

This is a conversion of a spell from the Tome of Magic (WotC), pg. 19
