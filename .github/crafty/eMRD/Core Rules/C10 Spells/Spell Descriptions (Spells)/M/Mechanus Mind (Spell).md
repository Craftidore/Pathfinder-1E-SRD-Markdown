The subject gains a +4 resistance bonus on Will saving throws to resist mindaffecting spells and abilities.

While in the grip of *Mechanus mind*, the subject also becomes more analytical and less emotional. The subject gains a +2 competence bonus on Intelligence-based checks, but takes a â€“2 penalty on Charisma-based checks.
