You are able to create a link from your focus mirror to another mirror, wherever else it is on your plane of existence. You donâ€™t have to know exactly where the mirror is at the time of casting, but you must have studied the mirror carefully for the spell to work. The link grants those in front of your focus mirror to see through the other one as if it were a window (enables line of sight, but not line of effect), seeing the sights on the other side as well as hearing the sounds.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6 for game balance.

*House Rule:* Added Witch 6 to Level.

*House Rule:* A *mirror talk* spell may be made permanent by using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. Multiple mirrors may be linked to a single focus mirror; each requires a separate casting of the *mirror talk* and *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spells. Switching to a different target mirror is a swift action.
