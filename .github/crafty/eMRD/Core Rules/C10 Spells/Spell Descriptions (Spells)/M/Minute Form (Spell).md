When you cast this spell, you shrink to Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size, depending on your caster level). Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, size modifier to Armor Class and attack rolls, and space and reach all change as shown on the accompanying table. (You need not assume the smallest size you are capable of; you can choose to shrink only to a larger size if you wish.) None of your ability scores can be reduced below 1 by this spell. All your equipment changes size with you, allowing you to use weapons or magic items effectively in your smaller form.
