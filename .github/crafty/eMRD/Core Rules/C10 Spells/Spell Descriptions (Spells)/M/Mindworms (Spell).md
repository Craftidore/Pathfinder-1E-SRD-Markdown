This spell causes incorporeal green worms to fly through the target creature. The affected creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and loses three spell levels worth of spells. The spell levels can be in any form or combination of prepared spells or remaining spell slots (for spontaneous casters) of the target's choice. This spell-draining effect has no effect on spell-like abilities. The spells drained can be either arcane or divine spells, depending on what kind of spells the target has access to. If the target casts both arcane and divine spells, the target can choose any combination of arcane and divine spells that it currently has prepared (or spell slots that it still has available) to meet the three-level requirement. This spell has no effect on cantrips or orisons (0-level spells) and only affects spells of 1st level or higher. The target halves the Wisdom damage and negates the spell-draining effect with a successful Will saving throw.

If the target does not have the ability to cast spells or has no remaining spells or spell slots of 3rd level or lower, the spelldraining effect of the spell has no effect.

Whenever you successfully drain three spells from a target with this spell, you gain spell energy that can power your spells. Draining less than three spells grants you no benefit. You can use this spell energy in any of three ways:

- Recall one prepared spell of 3rd level or lower. The recalled spell must have been previously cast during the same day, and you must meet any other requirements for being able to cast the spell.
- Gain an additional spell slot of 3rd level or lower. Spontaneous spellcasters can use the spell energy to give themselves one additional use of a 3rd level or lower spell known.
- Spontaneously apply metamagic effects to a spell. You can use the spell energy to spontaneously apply the effects of one metamagic feat that you possess to a spell as you cast it. Applying this one metamagic feat totally consumes the spell energy.

Regardless of how the spell energy is used, it is available only one time. The energy is completely gone once used, and if not used within 1 hour it fades harmlessly away.

*Note:* This spell requires that the caster possess either the Wormbound Spellcaster feat or the wormspawn subtype (see the article in Dragon Magazine #343).

*Focus:* A Kyuss worm hosted within your body.
