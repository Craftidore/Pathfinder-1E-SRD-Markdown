This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Mind Stasis (Spell)|mind stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being [[Cowering|cowering]], feebleminded, insane, [[Panicked|panicked]], or [[Stunned|stunned]].

This spell also makes the character immune to all mind-affecting effects. It is not as powerful as a *[[Mind Blank (Spell)|mind blank]]* spell. In no way does it prevent divination effects.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
