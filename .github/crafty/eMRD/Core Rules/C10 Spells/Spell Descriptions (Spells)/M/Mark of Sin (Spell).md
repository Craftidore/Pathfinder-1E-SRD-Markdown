*You bring forth the subject’s inner sins and crimes, causing them to manifest in its appearance and aura.*

Your successful touch attack leaves a mystical mark upon the subject. After a number of rounds equal to your divine caster level, the subject is entitled to a Will save. Success ends the spell at that point, but failure renders the *mark of sin* permanent.

Though the mark is invisible, all living creatures can sense its presence and are repulsed by it. Thus, they begin their initial interactions with the subject one step nearer to a hostile attitude than they normally would, unless they already know the subject personally. Furthermore, the subject takes a –10 circumstance penalty on all [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks designed to change the attitudes of others.

In addition, the subject takes a –4 penalty to a specific ability score based on your deity, as given in the table for the *[[Divine Retribution (Spell)|divine retribution]]* spell. This penalty cannot be removed in any way as long as the *mark of sin* remains. If you do not worship a deity, you must choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own when you cast this spell for the first time. This choice is for the purpose of this effect only, and you cannot subsequently change it unless your alignment shifts in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable.

A *mark of sin* cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]]*, *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell. *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|Remove curse]]* works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than that of the *mark of sin.*
