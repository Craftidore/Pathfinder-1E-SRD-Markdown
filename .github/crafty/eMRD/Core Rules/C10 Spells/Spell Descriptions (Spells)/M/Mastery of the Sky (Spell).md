The air around you shapes itself to assist you and interfere with your foes’ attacks. While airborne, you gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. Your maneuverability becomes perfect, and your movement (whether airborne or not) is unaffected by winds of less than hurricane strength.

The winds whipping around you (the equivalent of a windstorm) cause ranged weapon attacks made against you to automatically miss, and even siege weapons take a –4 penalty on attack rolls. Melee attacks made against you by Huge or smaller creatures have a 50% miss chance. Medium or smaller creatures cannot enter your space (such as to bull rush you or tumble through your space).

This spell has no effect if cast underwater or in an airless environment.
