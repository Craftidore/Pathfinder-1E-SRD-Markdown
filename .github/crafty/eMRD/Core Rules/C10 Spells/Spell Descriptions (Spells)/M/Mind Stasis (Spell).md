This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Mind Stasis, Lesser (Spell)|lesser mind stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being [[Confused|confused]], enraged, [[Frightened|frightened]], held, or hopeless.

This spell also prevents all Intelligence and Wisdom drain received during its duration.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Spell)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
