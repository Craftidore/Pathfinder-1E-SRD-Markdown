*You cast the spell, and your hand is suffused with a ghostly white radiance. You point your finger at the target across the room, and it slowly rises in the air*.

A *greater mage hand* spell can lift an object and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the target up to 20 feet in any direction, although the spell ends if the distance between you and the subject ever exceeds the spellâ€™s range.

A creature can negate the effect against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or if you fail to overcome its spell resistance.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The spell has an effective Strength of 10.
