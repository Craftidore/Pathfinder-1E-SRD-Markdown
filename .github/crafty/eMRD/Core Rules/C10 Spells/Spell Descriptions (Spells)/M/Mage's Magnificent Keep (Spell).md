With a grand display of magical energies, you instantaneously create a castle of your design that has two rooms per caster level. The entire square footage of the castle cannot exceed 100,000 square feet. The castle walls are made of stone, the doors of wood (with DC 30 locks), although the hardness of all materials is increased by 5. The interior of the castle is fully furnished, and each room is magically lit with a brightness level that varies with your whim (from daylight to magical darkness). The castle also automatically contains weapons (melee and ranged) and chain hauberks enough to outfit 50 guards or defenders. In addition, you can choose one of the following options:

- The castle exists on another plane (an otherwise empty pocket dimension), with the only doorway existing on the plane on which you cast the spell. The doorway you attach the spell to must be in range at the time of casting or the spell creates a free-standing doorway to your specifications (cf. *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]]* spell).
- The castle floats in the air at a height of your choosing. The magic keeping the castle in the air cannot be dispelled or suppressed.
- The castle is surrounded by a ward through which one general type of creature, chosen by you, cannot pass (undead, aberrations, humanoids, etc.).

Lastly, you can choose to have any portion of the castle disappear or fall apart upon your death, or you can choose to have the whole place collapse at the time of your demise. If the castle floats, you can have it fall when you die.

**GM Note** 

*House Rule:* Name changed from *magic castle* to *mage's magnificent keep* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* In the world of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell is known as *Mordenkainen's magnificient keep.*

*House Rule:* When using the *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]]** spell* and choosing the Structure trait, this spell is effectively what you get.
