*With a mere utterance, you grant the creature special insight into how best to complete a task at hand.*

You cast this spell immediately before the target makes a skill check. The subject envisions how a master might accomplish the same task, gaining a +4 insight bonus on its skill check. *Masterâ€™s skillful touch* has no effect on skill checks that represent effort over more than 1 round of time ([[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] checks, for example).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *master's touch* to *master's skillful touch* to avoid duplication.
