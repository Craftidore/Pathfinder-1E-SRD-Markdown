Upon casting this spell, a phantasmal timepiece appears. It can either mentally sound in the caster's mind at the times prescribed; or it can audibly chime. If the audible chime is selected it can sound so softly it can only be heard from 5 feet away or so loudly that it can be heard from 120 feet away.

At the time of casting, the caster can select the appearance of the *mage clock* as well as when it chimes. The *mage clock* can appear as something as small as a round disk one inch across or as large as a 10 foot tall grandfather clock. It can chime on the hour, the half hour or even quarter hour as the caster wishes. 

Some casters use more than one *mage clock,* having each sound at differing times and with differing sounds.

The *mage clock* is stationary and unmovable; however if it is cast inside a moveable object such as a box, carriage or ship, it remains stationary relative to wherever it is cast.

*Mage clock* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
