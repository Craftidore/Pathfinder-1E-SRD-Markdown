*Your touch siphons some of the animating negative energ y from an undead creature, leaving a soul-numbing ball of darkness in your grasp.*

To employ this spell, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against an undead creature. If you do so, your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6). This damage represents negative energy that you draw from the subject, resulting in a ball of writhing shadow you hold in your hand. You can use this ball of negative energy in one of three ways.

- You can, in any following round, touch any other undead creature with that negative energy, as a standard action. The undead creature absorbs the energy, healing as many points of damage as you dealt to the initial subject, up to the new subject’s normal maximum hit points.
- You can use the ball of negative energy to make a melee touch against a living creature, dealing the same amount of damage you initially dealt.
- You can use it to power a rebuke undead attempt. The next rebuke attempt you make, so long as it occurs before the spell’s duration expires, does not count against your daily limit.

The ball of negative energy dissipates in 1 minute if not used, and it vanishes immediately if you use your hand for some other purpose.
