By use of this spell, the caster manipulates time so that the recipient gains more use out of a single combat round. The creature does not move faster, but this extra time grants several bonuses. The creature gains one extra melee attack for every five levels of the caster (up to four total attacks). Also, a +1 adjustment is applied to the creature's initiative roll and Armor Class due to the extra attention that can be paid to these details.

This spell is not cumulative with itself or any other spell granting extra attacks. Also, it does not allow for casting of more than one spell per round, or the use of more than one magical item.

**GM Note**

Note: In the World of Greyhawk, this spell is most often known as *Nehli's melee manager.*

In many ways this spell is a more powerful version of *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*, however, it is the same level due to the rarity of casters who can access the [[Chronomancy Spells|Chronomancy]] school of magic.
