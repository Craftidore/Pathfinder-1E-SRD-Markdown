*You feel a dark, oppressive weight pressing against your mind. When you touch your target, the weight lifts. The creature you touched seems now to be battling with a similar oppression.*

When you cast this spell and touch a creature that is under the influence of a mind-affecting spell or ability, that creature immediately receives another saving throw against the effectâ€™s original DC to break free of the effect. If the spell or ability did not originally permit a saving throw, this spell has no effect.
