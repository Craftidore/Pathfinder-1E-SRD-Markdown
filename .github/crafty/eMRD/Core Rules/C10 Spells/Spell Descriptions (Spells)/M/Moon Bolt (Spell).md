*Picturing a full moon in your mind you call upon the cyclical energies of the celestial body. You create a bolt of shimmering moonlight that streaks from your outstretched hand.*

A *moon bolt* strikes unerringly against any living or undead creature in range.

A living creature struck by a *moon bolt* takes 1d4 points of Strength damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d4). If the subject makes a successful Fortitude saving throw, the Strength damage is halved.

An undead creature struck by a *moon bolt* must make a Will save or fall helpless for 1d4 rounds, after which time it is no longer helpless and can stand upright, but it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and Will saving throws for the next minute.
