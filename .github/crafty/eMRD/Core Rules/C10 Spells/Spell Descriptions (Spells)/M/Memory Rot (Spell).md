*You blow across your open palm at your opponent, and your breath coalesces into a cloud of glowing yellow spores that surround your foe’s head, driving through its scalp into the brain beneath.*

You create a cloud of spores that infests the brain of the subject creature, gradually destroying its mind. The spores deal 1d6 points of Intelligence damage immediately. The spores then gradually eat away at the subject’s brain, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain each round thereafter at the beginning of your turn. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to combat the effect of the spores. A successful save ends the spores’ advance and halts any further Intelligence drain.
