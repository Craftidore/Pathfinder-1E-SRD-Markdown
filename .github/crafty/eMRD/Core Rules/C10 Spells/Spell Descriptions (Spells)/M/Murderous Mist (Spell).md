*Drawing the power of steaming volcanic vents into your body, you exhale, and a cloud of boiling steam roils away from you.*

You create a cloud of scalding hot steam that moves in a straight line, away from you, at a speed of 10 feet per round. Anyone within the cloud takes 2d6 points of damage and is permanently [[Blinded|blinded]]. If a creature within the area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage and is not blinded.

Any creature within the cloud has concealment. Winds do not affect the cloudâ€™s direction or speed. However, a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.
