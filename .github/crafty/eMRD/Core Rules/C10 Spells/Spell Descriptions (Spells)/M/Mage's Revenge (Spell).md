**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Source:** Book of Experimental Might I (Malhavoc Press), pg. 68

Any creature that attacks you suffers magical feedback that inflicts 2d6 points of force energy damage + 1 additional point per caster level. For the purposes of this spell, an attack is any action that requires an attack roll, whether or not the attack succeeds. If you willingly allow someone to touch you (such as a cleric casting a beneficial spell), no attack roll is needed, and thus the action does not trigger this spellâ€™s effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Oroster's revenge* to *mage's revenge* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Obviously, a spell such as *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|magic missile]]*, while not requiring an attack roll, is still an attack.
