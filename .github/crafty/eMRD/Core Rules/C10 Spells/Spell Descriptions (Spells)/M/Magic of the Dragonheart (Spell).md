*You speak your own name as you clench your fists at your side. An aura of bright energy forms around you, coalescing into the shape of a translucent dragon above your head.*

This spell grants you a variety of benefits related to your draconic feats. If you have no draconic feats, this spell has no effect.

While this spell is active, you are considered to have two more draconic feats than normal for the purpose of determining the benefit of your draconic feats. For example, if you have the Draconic Heritage feat, you would gain a +2 bonus to the specified saves for the duration of this spell, over and above the bonus already granted by that feat.

In addition, for the purpose of determining the benefit of a draconic feat, treat *magic of the dragonheart* as if its spell level equaled 1/2 your caster level. For example, an 8th-level sorcerer that has the Draconic Flight feat would gain a fly speed of 40 feet after casting this spell, as if it were a 4th-level spell.

Finally, you gain a competence bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on skill checks made with the class skill granted by your Draconic Heritage feat (if you have the feat).
