While the caster chants, blue light starts to form at the hull of the ship and slowly raises it from the water, until it hovers 6 ft. above the water or ground. The mageship now sails through the air instead of through the water with the same speed, dependent upon the wind of course. It can rise as high as is humanly possible, but will not protect the people aboard from cold winds or lack of air. At the end of the duration, the mageship gently floats towards the ground, instead of just crashing down. During the forced descent, the ship cannot be steered.

*Animate mageship* can be made permanent with the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *animate mageship* to *mageship* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Spells which affect ships with regard to speed also affect the speed of the *mageship* while they are in effect.
