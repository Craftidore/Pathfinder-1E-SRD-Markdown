*Forcefully presenting a silver ingot in your hand, you extol the virtues of the moonâ€™s beauty in a language both beautiful and dead. The words of your loving declaration call forth a silver-white glow around your target that swiftly fades.*

This spell instills in the target an obsessive fascination with the moon. If the target fails its save, it fixates on the moon, staring at the moon or imagining it in its mind, and is considered *[[Fascinated|fascinated]]* for the duration of the spell.

If the saving throw is successful, the subject is instead [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for the duration of the spell.

Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell.
