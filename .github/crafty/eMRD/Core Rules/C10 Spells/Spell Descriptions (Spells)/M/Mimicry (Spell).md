*You feel a brief tingle in your throat. When you open your mouth, your voice is no longer your own.*

You can perfectly mimic familiar sounds, voices, and accents. These sounds can be any that you’ve heard before, and must be within the range of noises your voice is capable of creating. For example, a normal human voice could recreate the roar of a lion—being roughly equivalent to a scream—or approximate the sound of shattering glass. It could not reproduce the rumble of a collapsing building or a high-pitched noise audible only to bats. This spell does not allow you to speak languages you can’t normally speak.

You can duplicate a specific individual’s voice by making a [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check; a listener familiar with the voice being imitated must succeed on an opposed [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check to discern that the voice is not genuine.
