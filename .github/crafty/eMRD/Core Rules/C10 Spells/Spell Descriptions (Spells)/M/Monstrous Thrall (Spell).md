*Calling upon your reserves of personal power, you reach outward with your mind and gain control of the will of your foe.* 

This spell functions like *true domination*, except that the subject can be any creature and is permanently *dominated* if it fails its initial Will save. A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a â€“4 penalty to resist taking that particular action. If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.
