You alter your Debilitating Touch discipline (see Chapter One: Classes of the Book of Experimental Might I) so that it affects ethereal and incorporeal creatures.

This spell is cast at the same time as you use your Debilitating Touch. It is a free action that can be used only on your turn, and never more than once per round. It cannot be used on the same round as a quickened spell or a quickened discipline.
