**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 313

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]**,* *[[Locate Creature (Spell)|locate creature]]**, [[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]],* and *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]*). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. *Mind blank* even foils *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, and *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]**,* the spell works but the creature simply isnâ€™t detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
