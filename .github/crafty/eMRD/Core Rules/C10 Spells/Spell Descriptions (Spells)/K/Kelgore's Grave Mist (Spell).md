*With a gesture, you create a cloud of clammy, thin mist. The light in the area seems to dim as the mist appears, and a slight wind washes over the area, sending a chill down your spine.*

This spell creates a thin mist within the spell’s area. The mist is too thin to have any effect on vision, but the necromantic energy infused within it hampers the living. All living creatures within the mist become fatigued and take 1d6 points of cold damage per round. If the spell fails to overcome a creature’s spell resistance, the subject takes the cold damage but ignores the fatigue.

*Material Component:* A handful of dirt taken from a graveyard or tomb.
