As *[[Temporal Vortex (Spell)|temporal vortex]]*, except you may pick a year and a month in any point in the past, up to 100 years per caster level. Visiting characters are still unable to interact with former versions of themselves.

*Material Component*: A precious gem of no less than 10,000 gp value.

*XP Cost*: The XP cost for casting *greater temporal vortex* is 1,000 XP per 100 years (rounded up) moved through time.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Clever characters might attempt to “chain” multiple castings of this spell together in order to effect travel into the past further than a single casting would allow. As a house rule, GMs might consider restricting such a character from casting more than *one greater temporal vortex* a day (or a week, or a month, etc). Also, the ability to cast in such a matter should only be discoverable through experimentation (ie, actually attempting to cast the spell, resulting in the consumption of a very expensive material component)
