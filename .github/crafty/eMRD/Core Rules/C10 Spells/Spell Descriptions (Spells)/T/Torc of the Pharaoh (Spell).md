A tangible field of force surrounding the subject appears as a gold collar studded with small gems. Though the torc is tangible, it weighs next to nothing and the field of force surrounds the subject on all sides. The force provides the subject with a +4 armor bonus to AC and protects vital areas more effectively. When a critical hit is scored on the subject or when sneak attack damage would be rolled, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit is negated and that damage is instead rolled normally. Additionally, there is a 25% chance that the sneak attack does not do additional damage.

Unlike mundane armor, a *torc of the pharaoh* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since the *torc of the pharaoh* is made of force, incorporeal creatures canâ€™t bypass it.
