*A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you and sweeps through the area, then vanishes as quickly as it appeared.*

You evoke a dragonâ€™s tail that savagely sweeps through the space around you in a 10-foot radius, dealing 1d6 points of damage per level to all creatures that fail a Reflex saving throw and half that damage to creatures that succeed on the save.

Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also knocked prone.

*Special:* A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
