You cause the water surrounding you to swirl and fill with suspended sediments, decreasing visibility and making it harder for foes to attack you*.* This roiling cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures within the area up to 5 feet from an attacker have concealment (20% miss chance), while those farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance). Creatures other than you within this cloud must make a Concentration check to cast a spell (DC 15 + spell level). Ranged attacks that pass through the *turbidity* automatically fail.

A vigorous current (1â€“3 knots) disperses the clouded water in 4 rounds; a dangerous or stronger current (4 or more knots) disperses it within 1 round.

This spell only functions under water.
