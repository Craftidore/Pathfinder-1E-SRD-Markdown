*After taking care to enact a precise ritual involving a rising and falling chant and swaying hand movements, you touch one target, and a slight magical discharge, like electricity, flows into your hand. When you touch your next target, the electricity flows back down your hand into the head of your next target.*

Upon touching the first target, you encapsulate what that target has learned about a particular skill or single feat, then transfer this magical knowledge to the other target.

Choose one skill or feat to transfer; the second target temporarily gains an insight bonus to that skill equal to the first targetâ€™s ranks in that skill, and is considered trained for the purposes of that skill or feat.

A target cannot have more than one instance of this spell granting them an insight bonus at any one time. If a new instance of this spell is cast upon them, the previous instance automatically is dispelled if the same skill is transfered. However, multiple castings of this spell may targeted on the same target so long as different feats are used.

The first target loses all access to the skill ranks or feat transferred while the spell is in effect.

**GM Note**

Note: Assassins frequently imploy this spell to help them in pass themselves off as craftsman, etc.
