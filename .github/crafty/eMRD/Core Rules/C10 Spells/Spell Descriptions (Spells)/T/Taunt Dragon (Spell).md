*Your dragonmark flares to life, and with a shout, you draw the instant ire of a dragon.*

This spell tricks a dragon into focusing all its fury on you. You must have line of sight to the dragon, and it must be able to see you. If the dragon fails its save and does anything except attack you or move to attack you, it takes a penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws based on the strength of your dragonmark.


| **Dragonmark** | **Penalty** |
|---|---|
| Least | –5 |
| Lesser | –10 |
| Greater or Siberys | –20 |

The spell ends abruptly if line of sight between you and the dragon is broken, or if you are disabled, dying, or dead. A dragon under the effect of multiple *taunt dragon* spells takes the penalties only if it fails to attack or move toward the caster who affected it last.

*Dragonmark:* Any true dragonmark.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 to Level.

Spell rarity changed from rare to very rare for game balance.

In non-Eberron campaigns, this spell requires a perfect, unflawed dragon scale from the type (chromatic, gem, metallic, etc.) of dragon you wish to taunt from as a material component. This dragon scale typically sells for 5 gold pieces for the more common sorts (chromatic and metallic). A slain dragon skin yield only 1-10 of these scales and removing them totally ruins the skin for any other purpose.
