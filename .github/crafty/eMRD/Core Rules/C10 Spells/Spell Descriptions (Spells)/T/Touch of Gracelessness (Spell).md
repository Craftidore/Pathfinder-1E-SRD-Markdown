[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[1st Level Bard Spells|Bard 1]], [[1st Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 1]], [[1st Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 1]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 1st-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 1]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature touched

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide, pg. 249

With a single touch, you reduce a creature to a fumbling clown. The target takes a penalty to its Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). This penalty cannot drop the targetâ€™s Dexterity score below 1.

In addition, if the subject moves more than half its speed, it falls [[Prone|prone]]. If the subject flies, its maneuverability is reduced by one step (perfect maneuverability becomes good, good becomes average, and so on).

A successful Fortitude save halves the penalty to Dexterity and negates the possibility of falling [[Prone|prone]] or the reduction to fly maneuverabilities.
