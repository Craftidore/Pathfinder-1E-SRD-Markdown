*Calling upon the lost voices of dead creatures, you cause the targeted area to become filled with the enraged roaring of a thousand dinosaurs. The ground beneath the area shakes with the sound.*

The resulting blast of sound from the casting of *thunderous roar* can be heard for miles, but the spell affects only those in its area. All creatures in the affected area take 1d6 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage. Additionally, any creature that takes damage from this spell must make a Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone from the force of the roar. Crystalline creatures take 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).
