You place yourself in a deep trance, during which you cannot move, speak, or take any action. In the trance, you are highly attuned to the powers and forces in the immediate area. You can sense certain magical creatures and effects within the spell’s area. Each round you remain in the trance, you feel the presence of any one lesser spirit, greater spirit, curse, permanent magical effect, or haunting within the spell’s area. You can determine the general type of thing contacted (such as natural spirit, evil haunting), but cannot communicate with it in any way or gain any other information about it. Using this spell does give you enough information to subsequently cast *[[Commune with Lesser Spirit (Spell)|commune with lesser spirit]]* or a similar spell to communicate with the spirit you desire to contact.
