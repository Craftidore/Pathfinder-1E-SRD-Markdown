# Transformation (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[6th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 6]], [[6th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 6]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 11th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 11]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a *potion of bull’s strength*, which you drink and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 360

You become a fighting machine—stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you can’t cast spells, even from magic items.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you multiple attacks).

You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.

**GM Note**

This spell is known as *Tenser's transformation* in the World of Greyhawk campaign settting.
