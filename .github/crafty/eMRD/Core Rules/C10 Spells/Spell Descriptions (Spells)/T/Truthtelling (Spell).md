This spell functions identically to the spell *[[Zone of Truth (Spell)|zone of truth]]*, except as noted above. The target momentarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Abadar's truthtelling* to *truthtelling* for campaign continuity. In non-Golarion campaigns such as the World of Greyhawk, this spell is known as *truthtelling*.
