The object you touch becomes imbued with an invisible field of mind-affecting magic. For the purposes of this spell, “portal” refers to any opening a creature can walk through be it cave mouth, cemetery gateway, or garden trellis-arch. When a humanoid creature attempts to pass through the warded area, he must succeed a Will save or become [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] in that exact spot for 1 hour. Even if moved out of the way by another creature, the magic remains in place and can paralyze any other humanoids that try to cross (up to one humanoid per caster level). You and any allies you designate at the time of casting can pass through your *threshold barrier* without ill effect. Only a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* can deactivate the spell.
