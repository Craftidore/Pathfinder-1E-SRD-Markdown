You push an item or creature 2d6 rounds into the future. The subject vanishes instantly from its location. When the time is up, the subject pops back into normal time, completing whatever action (if applicable) it was taking before it was displaced, in the exact position it was when it moved. For the subject, the trip is viewed much differently. No time passes and so anything around it (if moved or changed) wdl appear to have done so instantly. If a solid object is moved to occupy the location where the subject reappears, both the object and the subject take 8d6 points of damage with no save allowed (no form of damage reduction can affect this damage either).
