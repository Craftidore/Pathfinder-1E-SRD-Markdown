This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked stone of any sort into an equal volume of sand. If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into a heap of sand. Magical stone is not affected by this spell. The depth of the sand created cannot exceed 10 feet.

If *transmute stone to sand* is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the sand falls to the floor and scatters in a pile 5 feet deep. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into sand. Piling on the fl oor, this sand would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling sand and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.

Castles and large stone buildings generally have immunity to this spell, since *transmute stone to sand* can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.

The sand remains until a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or *[[Transmute Sand to Stone (Spell)|transmute sand to stone]]* spell restores its substance—though not necessarily its form.

*Arcane Material Component:* Sandstone and granite.
