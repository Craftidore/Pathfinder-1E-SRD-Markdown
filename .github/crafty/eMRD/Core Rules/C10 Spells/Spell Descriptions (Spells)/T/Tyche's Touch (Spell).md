This spell confers either a protection or a curse (your choice at the time of casting) upon a single living creature. The effects of the two options are as follows.

*Protection:* The subject gains a +4 sacred bonus on the first saving throw made after the spell is cast, a +3 sacred bonus on the second saving throw, a +2 sacred bonus on the third, and a +1 sacred bonus on the fourth.

*Curse:* The subject takes a -4 penalty on the first saving throw made after the spell is cast, a -3 penalty on the second saving throw, a -2 penalty on the third, and a -1 penalty on the fourth.

*Tyche's touch* lasts for 24 hours or until its power is exhausted (after the fourth saving throw). Only one *Tyche's touch* spell can affect a given creature at one time. *Tyche's touch* spells automatically counter and dispel each other if cast on the same creature, regardless of how many saving throws the first casting of the spell has already affected.

**GM Note**

In recent years, both Beshaba and Tymora have been known to grant *Tyche's touch.*
