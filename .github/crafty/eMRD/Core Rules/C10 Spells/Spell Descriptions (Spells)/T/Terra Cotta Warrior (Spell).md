This spell turns an innocuous statuette of decoration and devotion into a full-sized warrior, ready to fi ght your foes. The statuette becomes a Medium animated object (Medium construct, 35 hp, AC 14, hardness 6, speed 40 ft., attack slam +2, damage 1d6+1) that attacks a specifi ed target on your turn as directed by you. You can change the designated target as a move action (as if directing an active spell). The statuette can be reused if the terra cotta warrior remains intact at the end of the spell, but if the warrior is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the statuette is lost.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Cleric 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
