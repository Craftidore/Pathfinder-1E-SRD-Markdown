*The air around you crackles with the distant boom of thunder. A dome of translucent golden energy surrounds the spell’s area. The dome shakes and rattles, while the muffl ed sounds of explosive blasts echoes from it. Any creature within the dome is knocked into the air by the powerful, ear-splitting blasts.*

This spell creates an area of turbulent, sonic energy. For the duration of the spell, any creature that starts its turn in the spell’s area must make a Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of sonic damage. In addition, affected creatures must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature is already prone, failing this save has no effect on it.
