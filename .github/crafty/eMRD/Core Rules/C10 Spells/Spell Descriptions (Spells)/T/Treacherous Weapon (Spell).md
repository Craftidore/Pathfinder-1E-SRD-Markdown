*You make a gesture accompanied by a sharp arcane command, and your foe’s weapon gives off a momentary shower of sparks.*

You can cast this spell on any creature wielding a manufactured weapon. If the target fails its saving throw, the weapon takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, the penalty worsens by 1. Thus, at 3rd level, the weapon takes a –2 penalty; at 5th level, a –3 penalty; at 7th level, a –4 penalty; and at 9th level or higher, a maximum –5 penalty.

When this spell is cast on a creature wielding a magic weapon, subtract the weapon’s enhancement bonus from the penalty. For example, a 1st-level caster would reduce a +*1 longsword* to a *+0 longsword*.

If you extend the spell’s casting time to 1 standard action, the enhancement penalties double.
