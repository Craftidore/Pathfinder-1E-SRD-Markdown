A thousand needles surround the subject and pierce his flesh, worming through armor or any type of protection, although creatures with damage reduction are immune to this spell. The subject takes 2d6 points of damage immediately and takes a –4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for the rest of the spell’s duration. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage to half and negates the circumstance penalty.
