*You touch a weapon, causing it to shimmer briefly and then coalesce into three distinct duplicate images, each one gradually assuming physical form. Once they become solid, the three weapons shoot forward at your targets.*

This spell allows you to split a target weapon of up to Large size (such as a greatsword, shortspear, and so on) into three exact duplicates. These duplicates immediately launch themselves at a target or targets of your choice within close range. You can direct one or more of the weapons at the same target or split them up among three different targets. Make a ranged attack roll for each weapon (using your ranged attack bonus or the ranged attack bonus of a fighter of your caster level, whichever is higher) as if you were proficient with the weapon in the normal manner. (For example, if used on a greatsword, you would make a ranged attack roll as if you were proficient with the greatsword, without the normal penalty for using an improvised throwing weapon.) The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if it does not have an enhancement bonus already.

Each duplicate that hits deals damage as if you had struck the target with the weapon in melee (including any special effects such as *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]*, smite evil, critical hits, sneak attack, [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], and so on). Your Strength bonus does not apply, since the force of the weapon comes from the spell, not your own Strength. A duplicate does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one.

Casting the spell destroys the targeted weapon to create the duplicates, and the duplicates are destroyed whether or not they hit. Because of this, the spell is rarely used on magic weapons. It cannot be cast on artifacts, natural weapons, weapons animated with *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]* or similar spells, or weaponlike magical creations (such as *[[Mage's Sword (Spell)|mage’s sword]]*).

*Origin:* This spell was created by Delgarth of Sumbarin, a long-forgotten minor realm along the banks of the River Dessarin. Delgarth was a powerful barbarian who concealed his limited prowess as a sorcerer so he could use it as an unexpected advantage during the frequent assassination attempts launched by his estranged kinfolk.
