This spell fills the subject with a terrible sense of thirst. Desperate and unable to focus on any other goal, it must drink as deeply as it can. The affected creature runs to the nearest body of water in sight, grabs and empties the closest container of water or liquor (even those carried by allies), or runs toward the nearest known source of water. No matter how much the subject drinks, the sensation of thirst is not quenched.

If denied the opportunity to quench its thirst, an affected creature flies into a rage similar to the barbarian class feature. The subject attacks friend and foe alike in its quest to find water, though not necessarily with lethal force.
