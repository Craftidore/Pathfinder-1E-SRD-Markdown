*In the blink of an eye, the creature you touched grows the armor plating of a tortoise across its torso and a tough, leathery skin elsewhere.*

*Tortoise shell* grants a +6 enhancement bonus to the subject’s existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels beyond 11th, to a maximum of +9 at 20th level.

The enhancement bonus provided by *tortoise shell* stacks with the target’s natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.

*Tortoise shell* slows a creature’s movement as if it were wearing heavy armor. An elf subject to *tortoise shell*, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round. The spell affects only a creature’s speed; *tortoise shell* doesn’t carry an armor check penalty or an arcane spell failure chance.
