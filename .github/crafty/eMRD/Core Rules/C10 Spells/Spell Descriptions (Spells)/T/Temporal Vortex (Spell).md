You create a swirling vortex before you, essentially opening a gateway through time itself that leads to a point in the past of the Prime Material Plane. You and up to one companion (of your size or smaller) per 5 caster levels, may travel through before it closes one minute later. Each subject may carry up to 300 pounds of equipment and possessions, though each living creature aside from familiars count towards the limit of people you may bring through the vortex. You can pick a year and a month not to exceed 100 years in the past from the current time that the gate will lead to. Pinpoint accuracy to a particular arrival location is nearly impossible; the characters appear 5 to 500 miles (5d100) from the intended destination. They appear on a random day of the month chosen when the spell is cast.

At this point you and your companions can interact with and study anyone or anything in that time. If anyone in this group encounters a past version of themselves, the visiting character is hurled back to the vortex's point of origination and the character that belongs in that time will be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds and remembers nothing of the encounter.

This spell transports the caster and his companions instantaneously. The creatures need to find other means if they wish to travel back.

Anyone visiting the Prime Material Plane out of their normal time is considered an outsider to that time period, and any spell or powers that would effect outsiders will work against such creatures or characters (i.e., *[[Dismissal (Spell)|dismissal]]*) propelling a character back to his own time. A character arrives at a point in time just after he journeyed to the past.
