*With words of encouragement, you make the creature better able to handle the rigors of overland travel, at the expense of its ability to fight.*

The touched animal or magical beast gets a 20-foot enhancement bonus to its speed, and it can hustle without taking damage or becoming [[Fatigued|fatigued]] as long as the spell is in effect. While bearing a rider, the mount no longer attacks in combat. The steed willingly bears its rider into battle; it just canâ€™t use its own natural weapons for the duration of the spell.
