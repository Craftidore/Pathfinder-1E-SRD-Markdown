*A large glowing hand, the size of a human torso, appears in front of the creature and sweeps at its legs.*

The large hand sweeps at the target creature’s legs in a tripping maneuver. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Its attack bonus equals your caster level + your key ability modifier + 2 for the hand’s Strength score (14). The hand has a bonus of +1 on the trip attempt for every three caster levels, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.
