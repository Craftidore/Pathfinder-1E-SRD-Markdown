*You rub your hands along the length of the object, intoning the spell. A warm red glow emits from your hands, strengthening the object.*

This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every caster level, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material’s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a *greater hardening* spell cast by a 19th‐level caster would have hardness 29 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword’s hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A *greater hardening* spell does not in any way affect a substance’s resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on.

This spell affects up to 1 cubic foot of material per level of the caster whether or not the material is metal or mineral or something else entirely. This spell only affects objects, never creatures or constructs of any sort.

This spell may only be cast on a single item one time. Subsequent castings have no effect.
