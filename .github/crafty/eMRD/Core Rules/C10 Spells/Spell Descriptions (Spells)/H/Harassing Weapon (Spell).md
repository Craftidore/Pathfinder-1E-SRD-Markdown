A melee weapon of pure force springs into existence and attacks a designated opponent when he provokes attacks of opportunity, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit with a critical threat range of 19–20/×2. The weapon is visible and takes the shape of any appropriately-sized simple or martial weapon you desire. It uses your base attack as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures.

The weapon follows the foe you choose as long as he remains within range. Occupying the same area as the foe, it makes attacks of opportunity whenever that particular foe provokes them, but otherwise it takes no actions. Your feats (such as [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]]) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell’s range, the spell ends. Once you’ve designated a foe, you cannot choose a new opponent to harass with this spell. The *harassing weapon* cannot be attacked or damaged.

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, check for resistance the first time the *harassing weapon* strikes. Successfully resisting the weapon dispels the spell. Otherwise, the weapon retains its normal full effect for the duration.
