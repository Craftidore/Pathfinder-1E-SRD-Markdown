You make the area around your vehicle invisible (cf *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* spell). Creatures more than 30 feet from the vehicle cannot sense any activity going on inside the areaâ€”they cannot smell cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those onboard your vehicle  can see out normally. Once a creature comes within 30 feet of your vehicle, it can see everything in and around the vehicle normally. Unlike *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, a cloaked vehicle is not given away by the appearance of apparently displaced water, tracks left by its passage, fog, or mist since the power of the illusion makes the area occupied by the vehicle appear as its surroundings. The *hidden caravan* spell does not prevent detection by magical means such as *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]**,* *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*. 

An individual aboard a vehicle cloaked by this illusion may attack freely, but doing so removes the *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* effect of this spell with regard to him (and only him). The round in which he attacks he treats his target as if it were [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Bard 4, Sorcerer 4, Witch 4, Wizard 4 for game balance with *[[Cloak Ship (Spell)|cloak ship]]* spell.
