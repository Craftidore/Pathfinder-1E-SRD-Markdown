To cast this spell, you must be standing at least up to the knees in ocean surf; all additional creatures to be targeted by the effects of the *healing surf* must also be standing in the surf and within range of the spell. The surf qualifies as vigorous motion, and to cast in such conditions you must make a successful Concentration check (DC 10).

When the ten-minute casting time of this spell is achieved, you and up to three creatures per caster level selected by you are immediately healed of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points). Additionally, the healing surf removes all trace of disease on the targets, as well as the following conditions: ability damage (but not ability drain), exhaustion, fatigue, [[Nauseated|nauseated]], and [[Sickened|sickened]]. For the remainder of the spell's duration, the targets gain a +4 sacred bonus on all saving throws against effects that cause ability damage, [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], and [[Sickened|sickened]] conditions.

Undead targets are damaged by the positive energy unleashed by this spell, and they take 5 points of damage per caster level (or half on a successful Will save). For the remainder of the spell's duration, any undead that survive this damage are treated as 4 Hit Dice lower than their actual total when determining the effects of turn or rebuke undead attempts.
