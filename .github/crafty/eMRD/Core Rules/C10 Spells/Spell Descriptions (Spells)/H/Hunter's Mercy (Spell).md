*Your eyes glow red, but you see the world as normal except when you look at your target. A small glowing dot reveals the creature’s weakest point.*

This transmutation makes a bow strike true. Your first hit with a bow (not including crossbows) in the next round is automatically a critical hit. If you don’t hit in the round following the casting of this spell, the effect is wasted.
