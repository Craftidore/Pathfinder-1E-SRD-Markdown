*In the eyes of your enemy, you seem large, powerful, and indomitable.*

You fill a subject with doubts and misgivings, making it believe it is inferior to you. On a failed save, the subject can take no action other than a move action on its current turn. *Hesitate* confers no special bonuses for attackers attempting to hit the subject; the subject still defends itself. If you attack the affected creature, the spell ends immediately. Each round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. If the save succeeds, the subject can then act normally.

You can cast this spell even when it’s not your turn; however, you must cast it at the start of your opponent’s turn to gain the benefit.
