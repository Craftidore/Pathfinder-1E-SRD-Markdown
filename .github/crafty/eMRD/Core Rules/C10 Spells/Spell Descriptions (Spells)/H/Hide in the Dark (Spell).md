You become as one with the dark, drawing on its power to remain unseen. You cannot be seen by darkvision or blindsight, or be detected by blindsense or tremorsense. Characters attempting to observe you with those senses treat you as invisible, and you have total concealment against them. This spell does not prevent any creatures, including creatures with those senses, from observing you using normal vision; thus, a dwarf could still see you using regular vision, unless you were hidden from his sight (such as by being in an area of darkness and making a successful [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] \[v3.5 Hide] check).
