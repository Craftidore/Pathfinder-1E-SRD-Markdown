*You feel a sudden flame burning within you.*

This spell converts part of your body into elemental fire, which speeds your step and toughens your flesh. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed and resistance to fire 20.

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a *[[Fire Shield (Spell)|fire shield]]* effect (as the spell; fire-based protection only) on yourself as a swift action. This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends.

If *heart of fire* is active on you at the same time as *[[Heart of Air (Spell)|heart of air]]**,* *[[Heart of Earth (Spell)|heart of earth]]**,* or *[[Heart of Water (Spell)|heart of water]]**,* you gain light fortification. If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Each *heart* spell in effect provides 25% fortification, if all of them are in effect simulataneously, the caster has immunity (100% fortification) to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
