*You trace a pattern in the air, and a faint aura the same color as your dragonmark appears around you.*

While you are under the effect of this spell, dragons cannot see, hear, or smell you. Even extraordinary and supernatural sensory capabilities (including blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense) cannot detect or locate you. If you touch a dragon or attack any creature (even with a spell), this spell ends. If a dragon learns of your location by other means (for example, if another creature tells it where you are, or if you disturb its treasure hoard), it can attempt to attack you. However, you still have total concealment against it.

*Dragonmark:* Any true or aberrant dragonmark.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed from Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 for game balance.

Spell rarity changed from rare to very rare for game balance.

In non-Eberron campaigns, this spell requires a perfect, unflawed dragon scale from the type (chromatic, gem, metallic, etc.) of dragon you wish to hide from as a material component. This dragon scale typically sells for 5 gold pieces for the more common sorts (chromatic and metallic). A slain dragon skin yield only 1-10 of these scales and removing them totally ruins the skin for any other purpose.
