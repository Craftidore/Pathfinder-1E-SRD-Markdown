*You invoke this spell and heavenly rays lance down from above. Out of these sparkling rays manifest great glowing balls of power. The shadows of greater warriors coalesce within this light.*

When the spell is complete, 2d4 lantern archons  appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 hound archons appear. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.

The creatures obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the creatures. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.
