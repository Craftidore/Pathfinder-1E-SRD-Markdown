*With a wave of your hand and a few hissed words, you cause the target creature to suffer as if it had been toiling for hours on end under the merciless hammer of the desert sun.*

If the target creature fails to resist the spell, it immediately becomes [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. If it is already [[Fatigued|fatigued]], it instead becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]]. The subject takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from the oppressive heat as well, even if it makes the Fortitude saving throw to avoid fatigue or exhaustion.

A creature wearing heavy armor takes a â€“4 penalty on its save. Creatures with immunity or resistance to fire are not affected by this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level per Wizards of the Coast website.
