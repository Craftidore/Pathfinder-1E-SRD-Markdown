*A diffuse glow of golden light spreads from you, wrapping those you have chosen in a soft nimbus. The subjects of your spell look relaxed and rested, the stresses of the day forgotten.*

*Healthful rest* doubles the subjectsâ€™ natural healing rate. Each affected creature regains twice the hit points and ability damage it otherwise would have regained during that day, depending on its activity level.
