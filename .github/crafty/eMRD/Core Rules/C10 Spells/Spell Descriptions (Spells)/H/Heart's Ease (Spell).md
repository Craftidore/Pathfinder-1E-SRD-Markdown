*Heartâ€™s ease* cures emotional wounds in the same way that *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* wipes away physical ones. The subjects are cured of any fear effect, despair effect (such as the *[[Crushing Despair (Spell)|crushing despair]]* spell), or similar mind-affecting condition, excluding charms and compulsions (such as *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]*, *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]**,* and similar spells). It removes any lingering psychological effects of torture (including the increased effectiveness of torture devices, as described in the *[[Book of Vile Darkness]]*). It cures *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]* and *[[Insanity (Spell)|insanity]]*, restores 2d4 points of Wisdom damage (but not permanent Wisdom drain), and leaves the targets feeling refreshed and at peace.
