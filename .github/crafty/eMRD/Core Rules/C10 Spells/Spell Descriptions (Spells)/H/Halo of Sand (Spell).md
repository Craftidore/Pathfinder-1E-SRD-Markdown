*Halo of sand* creates a thin band of sand that swirls and twists around your body, helping to deflect incoming attacks. The sand does not make it difficult for others to see you, but it grants a +1 deflection bonus to AC. This deflection bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +4 at caster level 12th.
