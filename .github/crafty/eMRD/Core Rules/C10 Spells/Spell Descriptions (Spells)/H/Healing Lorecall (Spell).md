*With a mint leaf under your tongue, you whisper quiet words of soothing comfort. You feel a divine touch guiding your healing hand.*

A caster with 5 or more ranks in [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] can, when casting a conjuration (healing) spell, choose to remove any one of the following conditions affecting the subject of the spell, in addition to the spellâ€™s normal effects: [[Dazed|dazed]], [[Dazzled|dazzled]], or [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. A caster with 10 or more ranks in [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] can choose from the following conditions in addition to those above: [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], or [[Sickened|sickened]].

Also, when determining the amount of damage healed by your conjuration (healing) spells, you can substitute your total ranks in [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] for your caster level. The normal caster level limit for individual spells still applies; thus, a 3rd-level cleric with 6 ranks in [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] when under the effect of *healing lorecall* cures 1d8+5 points of damage with a *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* spell.
