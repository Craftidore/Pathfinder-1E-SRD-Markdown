*A 1-foot-diamater ball of light appears and moves by your command, healing those it touches.*

You conjure an incorporeal object of magical energy that appears in any square within range. This *healing spirit* resembles a 1-foot-diameter ball of light. It sheds bright illumination in a 10-foot radius and shadowy illumination for another 20 feet. A *healing spirit* cannot be affected by attacks or spells.

A *healing spirit* flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability. In the round you cast the spell and at the start of your turn once per round thereafter, you can direct the *healing spirit* to move and touch a creature by entering its space. The spirit’s touch carries positive energy, healing a living creature of 1d8 points of damage.

Since undead are powered by negative energy, a *healing spirit* damages them instead of healing them. The spirit can affect an unwilling target (such as an undead) by succeeding on an incorporeal touch attack, using your base attack bonus and a Strength bonus of +0. An undead creature hit by such an attack can use spell resistance against the effect and is allowed a Will save for half damage.

If a *healing spirit* travels farther from you than the spell’s range, it winks out of existence and the spell ends.
