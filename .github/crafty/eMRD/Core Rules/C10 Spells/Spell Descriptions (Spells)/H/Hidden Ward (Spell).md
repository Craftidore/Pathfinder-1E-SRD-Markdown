This spell helps disguise the presence of any spells (including *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]*) that have been cast upon the target object. If *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or a similar effect is used to detect the presence of magical auras on the object, the caster must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level) to find any magical auras that are the result of active spells. (The DM should make this roll in secret to prevent suspicion by the players.) A single successful check will reveal both the *hidden ward* and the spells it hides. In addition, casting this spell on a magic trap (such as a *[[Fire Trap (Spell)|fire trap]]* spell cast on an object) increases the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] DC to find the trap by one-half your caster level (maximum +5). This spell cannot be used to conceal nonmagical traps, nor does it hide the magical properties of an item that arenâ€™t dependent on active spells (such as the magic aura of a *+1 longsword*).

*Special:* When cast by a character with any Mark of Warding dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Kundarak), the duration increases to one day per level.
