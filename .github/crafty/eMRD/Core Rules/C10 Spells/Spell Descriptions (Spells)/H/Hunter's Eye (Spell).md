Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, *hunterâ€™s eye* greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, *[[Blur (Spell)|blur]]*, *[[Displacement (Spell)|displacement]]*, *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
