As *[[Humanoid Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser humanoid essence]]* with the following additional effects. The construct becomes subject to critical hits, sneak attacks, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain, death effects, and necromancy effects. In addition, a warforged affected by this spell loses its racial fortification against critical hits and sneak attacks (including any improvements to that fortification).

This spell counters and dispels *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]* and *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]*. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence, Lesser (Spell)|lesser construct essence]]*, the latter spell is automatically ended. If this spell is cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence (Spell)|construct essence]]*, both spells are dispelled and have no effect. It has no effect if cast on a creature under the effect of *[[Construct Essence, Greater (Spell)|greater construct essence]]*.
