*You feel light as a feather, as if the slightest breeze might knock you about.*

This spell converts part of your body into elemental air, freeing you somewhat from the bonds of gravity. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks, and if you have a fly speed, that speed gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus. Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a *[[Feather Fall (Spell)|feather fall]]* effect (as the spell) on yourself as an immediate action. This benefit lasts for 1 round per level, at the end of which time the spell's entire effect ends.

If *heart of air* is active on you at the same time as *[[Heart of Earth (Spell)|heart of earth]]**,* *[[Heart of Fire (Spell)|heart of fire]]**,* or *[[Heart of Water (Spell)|heart of water]]**,* you gain light fortification. If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you become immune to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Each *heart* spell in effect provides 25% fortification, if all of them are in effect simulataneously, the caster has immunity (100% fortification) to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.
