You create a fanged, biting mouth in the palm of your hand. When you lay your hand upon a creature by making a touch attack, the mouth deals 1d8 points of damage.

If you scored a crtical hit with your touch attack, you may start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its teeth into the targetâ€™s flesh and continues to bite for an additional 1d6 points of damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends.
