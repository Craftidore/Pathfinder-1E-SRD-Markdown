When you successfully strike a creature with a melee weapon and deal damage to it, you can cast *hemoarmor* as a swift action. The blood flowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of plate armor around you, granting you a +6 armor bonus to AC for the spell’s duration. Additionally the armor prevents any of your own blood from flowing too copiously, making you immune to [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] effects.

Unlike mundane armor, *hemoarmor* has no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Unlike *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]*, *hemoarmor* is not a force effect and thus [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]] creatures can bypass it normally.

The foe you strike must be one that contains blood—targets immune to [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|bleed]] effects cannot be used as the focus for this spell.

If the focus of this spell has divine blood (demigods, outsiders with 20 or more HD, or characters with godling class levels from The Genius Guide to the Godling), the *hemoarmor* also gives you a +2 bonus to Will saves.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *blood armor* to *hemoarmor* to avoid duplication.
