The caster holds forth his empty hand, and the still-beating heart of the subject appears within it. The subject dies in 1d3 rounds, and only a *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]**,* *[[Regenerate (Spell)|regenerate]]**,* *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**,* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell will save it during this time. The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the target succeeds at the save, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level from general damage to the chest and internal organs. (The target might die from damage even if it succeeds at the saving throw.)

A creature with no discernible anatomy is unaffected by this spell.

*Disease Component:* [[Soul rot]].
