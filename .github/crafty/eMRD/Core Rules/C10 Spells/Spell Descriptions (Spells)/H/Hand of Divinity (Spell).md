*You call upon your beliefs and a great pair of hands appears around your target, cradling it in its power. The effect fades, but your target briefly glows with a healthy orange nimbus.*

If your deity is non-evil, this spell grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws, and the spell is a good spell. If your deity is evil, this spell grants a +2 profane bonus on saving throws, and the spell is an evil spell.

This spell works only on a creature with the same deity as you or the same alignment as your deity. If cast on a target that does not meet this criteria, the spell has no effect.
