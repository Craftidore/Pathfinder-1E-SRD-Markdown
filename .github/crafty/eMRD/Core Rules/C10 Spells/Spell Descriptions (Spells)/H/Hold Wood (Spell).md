This spell prevents the use of alteration spells upon a given area of wood, Spells such as *[[Warp Wood (Spell)|warp wood]]* simply do not function in the area of effect, nor can beings pass through the area. *[[Passwall (Spell)|Passwall]]* and similar spells do not work, though *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* (which does not affect the material itself) does. Evocations might damage the wood (though its hardness is increased by + 2), but the wood will not magically change form, no matter what the spell.

This spell only works on wood, however, and sand, stone, or earth are not affected by it.

*Hold wood* may be made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

Spells which have already altered the target wood having an instantaneous or permanent duration or which has been made permanent using a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell are not effected by *hold wood*.
