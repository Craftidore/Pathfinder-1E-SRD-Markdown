*With a sweep of your hand, invisible magic slams into your target. With a bloody pop and squelch, the heart of your target bursts out its back, dropping the creature like a discarded rag doll.*

Invisible bolts of force instantly slay the target you designate by driving its heart from its body unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. If the target has HD higher than your caster level, it does not die on a failed saving throw, but instead is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that don’t depend on their hearts for survival, creatures with no anatomy, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are unaffected by the spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Maho 4 per Oriental Adventures.

*House Rule:* Added Wu jen 4 per Complete Arcane.

*House Rule:* Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 added to Level.

*House Rule:* The *[[Heart of Stone (Spell)|heart of stone]]* spell provides immunity to this spell and any creature under this spell’s effect is in fact completely unaffected by it.
