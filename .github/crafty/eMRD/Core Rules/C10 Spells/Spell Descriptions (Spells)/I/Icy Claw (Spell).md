*You conjure a wraithlike, faintly glowing cloud of white vapor that coalesces into a disembodied dragon’s claw made of ice.*

This spell creates a Medium four-taloned claw about 5 feet long. The *icy claw* has a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability), hit points equal to your full normal total, saving throw bonuses equal to your own, and AC 25 (+10 Dex, +5 natural). It has damage reduction 15/magic and bludgeoning and is immune to cold, poison, critical hits, and magical effects that don’t deal damage. It takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire. An *icy claw* never provokes attacks of opportunity. It cannot push through a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* or enter an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**,* but it is affected by *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]* or *[[Prismatic Sphere (Spell)|prismatic sphere]]**.* A *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell or a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* destroys it.

An *icy claw* attacks an opponent of your choice once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively) +10 for the claw’s Strength score (31). An *icy claw* deals 1d6+15 points of damage plus 3d6 points of cold damage. If it successfully damages a Medium or smaller foe, it attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, with a grapple check bonus equal to your caster level +10. On a successful grapple check, an *icy claw* deals normal damage (see above). The claw ignores effects intended to mask or conceal the selected target, including darkness, invisibility, displacement, hiding in plain sight, and the like.

Directing an *icy claw* to a new target is a free action.

*Arcane Focus:* A white dragon’s talon.
