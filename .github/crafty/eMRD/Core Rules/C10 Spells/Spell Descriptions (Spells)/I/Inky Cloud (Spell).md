You create an inky cloud that billows out from your location. The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment.

A moderate current disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong current disperses the cloud in 1 round.

This spell functions only underwater.
