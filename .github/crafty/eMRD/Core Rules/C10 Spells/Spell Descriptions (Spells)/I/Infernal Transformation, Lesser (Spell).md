*Your blood runs cold as a feeling of utter evil imbues you with unholy power. A cackle of sadistic glee escapes your changing mouth, and you feel your body grow in both size and power.*

When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a [[Devil, Bearded (Bestiary 1)|bearded devil]]. While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (baatezu, evil, lawful), and your size changes to Medium. You have the space and reach of a [[Devil, Bearded (Bestiary 1)|bearded devil]] (5 feet/5 feet). You gain a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution and darkvision out to 60 feet.

You grow a snaky beard. Whenever you take a full attack action, you can use the beard to make an additional attack each round at your highest attack bonus plus all appropriate modifiers. A successful attack deals 1d8 points of damage + your Str modifier. This attack overcomes damage reduction as if it were an evil weapon. Creatures hit by the beard attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier) or be affected by the devil chills disease. You gain the ability to speak and understand Infernal.
