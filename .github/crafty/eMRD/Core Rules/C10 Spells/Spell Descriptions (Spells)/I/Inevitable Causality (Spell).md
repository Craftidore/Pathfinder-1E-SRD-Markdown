You peer into the future, watching your target's fate and altering the flow of time so that it negatively affects the target in the present. Once per round as a standard action, you can force the target to fail a saving throw or suffer a hit from a single attack roll.

When casting this spell, the caster must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) each round or suffer 4d8 points of damage as temporal backlash strikes at you for altering the time line.
