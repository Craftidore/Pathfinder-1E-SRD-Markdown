If a spirit fails its saving throw, it can’t perceive the warded creatures and acts as though the warded creatures are not there. The warded creatures can move freely among spirits without being noticed, although they are perfectly visible to all other types of creatures. If a warded creature touches or attacks a spirit (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.

Note: A spirit gets one saving throw against the spell. It either sees all the warded creatures or none of them.
