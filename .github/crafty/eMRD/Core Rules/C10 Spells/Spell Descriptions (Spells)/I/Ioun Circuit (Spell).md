# Ioun Circuit (Spell)
## Overview

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 10th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 10]]

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Components**: S, F (an implanted ioun)

**Range**: Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration**: Permanent

**Saving Throw:** None

**Source:** The Mage’s Tower

When this spell is cast upon an implanted ioun stone that resides in one of your chakra points, it creates an invisible bond that stretches from the implanted stone to the center of your forehead. This *ioun circuit* is bonded to your skin and even if you are cut over it, it will immediately restore itself atop the wound. *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|Arcane sight]]**,* *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]**,* and other such divinations reveal the circuit as a glowing golden ribbon 1/64th of an inch wide that is seemingly tattooed onto your skin and which runs from the targeted stone to the center of your forehead.

This circuit causes your body to resonate as if it were a *wayfinder* with an ioun stone set within it. Roll using the table below and ignore all rolls above 94. Wizards and sorcerers may adjust this roll upwards/downwards as they desire using their caster level plus primary casting attribute modifier with a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 45).

The circuit can also be used to make an implanted ioun stone which is a part of an *ioun circuit* to go dormant. This is a move action and involves touching both the affected ioun stone and the center of your forehead in sequence. The ioun remains dormant until the sequence is reversed. This is most often used when the target has multiple ioun stones and two or more of them have powers that would otherwise cancel one another out.

Creatures who do not have chakra points (such as constructs, undead, etc.) can still use this spell.

GMs are encouraged to modify the Resonant Powers table as they desire.

| 99 | Feedback damages the *wayfinder*, giving it the [[Broken\|broken]] condition and rendering it nonfunctional until it is repaired. The stone is unharmed.\*\* |
| 100 | Feedback destroys the *wayfinder* unless it makes a DC 19 Fortitude save; success means it gains the [[Broken\|broken]] condition and is nonfunctional until repaired. The *ioun stone* is unharmed.\*\* |
| \* If the stone’s normal power gives the same kind of bonus, these effects stack. For example, a *deep red sphere* (+2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity) that has the resonant power of “+2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity” gives a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. No power effect stacks more than 3 times. ||
