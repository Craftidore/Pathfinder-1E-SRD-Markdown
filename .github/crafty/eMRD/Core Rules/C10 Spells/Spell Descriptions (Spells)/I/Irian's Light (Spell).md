You channel the light of Irian, the Eternal Day, into one or more brilliant rays of positive energy that heal the living and reave the undead. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (so two rays at 7th level and a maximum three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Any living or deathless creature struck by a ray heals 2d8 points of damage. Any undead creature struck by a ray takes 2d8 points of damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

**Special:** Aerenal elf spellcasters cast this spell at +1 caster level.
