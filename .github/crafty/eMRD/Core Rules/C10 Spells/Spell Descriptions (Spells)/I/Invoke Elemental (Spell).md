You temporarily release a bound elemental and compel it to obey you. In the round you imbue the infusion, you must touch the vehicle to which the elemental has been bound, with the elemental appearing adjacent to you when the casting is complete. The elemental acts immediately on your turn, attacking your opponents to the best of its ability. You can verbally direct the elemental not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

While the elemental is invoked, it is no longer bound to the target vehicle. The vehicle is treated as if the elemental is suppressed until the infusion ends (see Suppressing a Bound Elemental). Should the elemental be destroyed or affected by a spell that would send it back to its plane of origin while it is invoked, it vanishes and remains suppressed for 24 hours, during which time it cannot be invoked again with this infusion. You can dismiss this effect as a free action on your turn, sending the elemental back to its bound state.

If the elemental is uncontrolled at the time the infusion is imbued (or controlled by someone other than you), it receives a Will saving throw to resist the infusion.
