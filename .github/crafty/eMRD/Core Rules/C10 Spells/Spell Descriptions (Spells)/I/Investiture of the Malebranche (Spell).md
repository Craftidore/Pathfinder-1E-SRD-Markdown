*A fearsome roar splits the air when you conclude the arcane words that invest the target with hellish power drawn from a malebranche.*

You infuse a creature with the raw power of the mighty malebranche, causing it to grow twisted horns of blackened bone from of its brow. While under the effect of this spell, the subject deals extra damage whenever it successfully hits with a charge attack, depending on its size.


| **Size** | **Damage** |
|---|---|
| Tiny or smaller | â€” |
| Small | 1d6 |
| Medium | 2d6 |
| Large | 3d6 |
| Huge | 4d6 |
| Gargantuan | 6d6 |
| Colossal | 8d6 |

In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the malebranche).*

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
