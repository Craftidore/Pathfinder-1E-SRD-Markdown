You allow a creature to skate across any icy surface, either level or inclined, increasing its base land speed by 60 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) No [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks are required for this movement (even during combat on ice) unless the recipient attempts exceptional maneuvers, such as jumping a crevasse or gliding up a frozen waterfall, or takes damageâ€”even then, the recipient gains a +4 enhancement bonus on its [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check.
