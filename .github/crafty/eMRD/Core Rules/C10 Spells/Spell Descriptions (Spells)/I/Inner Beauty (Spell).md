*You change the subject’s physical appearance to reflect its personality and morality, revealing its true beauty or exposing its revolting ugliness.*

Although this spell is particularly effective for rooting out demons that have used magic to assume pleasing forms, it also works well for augmenting good-aligned creatures.

If the subject is evil, its body and visage twist and deform, taking on a hideous, bestial appearance. In addition, the subject takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma (minimum 0) for the duration of the spell. Furthermore, on the round that this transformation occurs, every creature within a 15-foot radius of the subject that can see it must succeed on a Fortitude save or become [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 1d4 rounds by this sudden revelation of wickedness.

If the subject is good, its body and visage grow lovelier and more elegant, taking on an appearance of rapturous beauty and grace. In addition, the subject gains a +4 sacred bonus to Dexterity and Charisma for the duration of the spell. Furthermore, in the round when this transformation occurs, every creature within a 15-foot radius of the subject that can see it must succeed on a Fortitude save or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round by this sudden revelation of virtue.

If the targeted creature is neither good nor evil, the spell has no effect.

*Focus:* A handheld mirror worth at least 500 gp.
