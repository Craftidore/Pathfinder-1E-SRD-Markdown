You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level, see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You may summon the [[Wasp Swarm (Bestiary PF1)|wasp swarms]] so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and wonâ€™t pursue creatures that flee.
