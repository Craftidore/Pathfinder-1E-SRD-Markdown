*With the sound of low chanting, you invest the target with the power of a steel devil.*

While under the effect of this spell, the target is infused with the magical energy and deadly skill of a steel devil. While the spell is in effect, the target gains a +3 profane bonus on attack rolls and to Armor Class, This bonus increases by 1 for every adjacent creature that is also under the effect of an *investiture of the steel devil* spell.

In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the steel devil).*

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
