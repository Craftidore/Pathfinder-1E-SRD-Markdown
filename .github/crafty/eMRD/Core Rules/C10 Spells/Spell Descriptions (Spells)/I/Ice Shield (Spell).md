The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction 15/â€”. The spell prevents a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points). While protected by the spell, the creature also has vulnerability to fire and takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from the effect, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

The duration increases to 10 minutes per level when in a frostfell environment.
