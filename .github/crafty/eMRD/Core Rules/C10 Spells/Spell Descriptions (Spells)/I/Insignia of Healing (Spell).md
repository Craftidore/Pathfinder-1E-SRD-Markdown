This spell works just like *[[Insignia of Alarm (Spell)|insignia of alarm]]* except the insignia wearers are instead healed by positive energy. The spell cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to all wearers of the insignia. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. Any undead creature can apply spell resistance and attempt a Will save to take half damage.
