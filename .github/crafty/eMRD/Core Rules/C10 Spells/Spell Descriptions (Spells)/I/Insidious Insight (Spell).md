The gnomes of Zilargo use knowledge of any sort as leverage to ensure that their negotiations and social interactions lead to a preferred outcome. Gnome spellcasters developed the *insidious insight* spell for just this purpose, turning the inner feelings and desires of opposing creatures against them.

While this spell is in effect, you gain great insight into the target creatureâ€™s secret motivations and desires, granting you a +10 insight bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks made against it.

*Special:* Gnome spellcasters cast this spell at +1 caster level.
