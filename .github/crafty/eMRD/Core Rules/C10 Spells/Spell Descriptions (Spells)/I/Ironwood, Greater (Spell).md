# Ironwood, Greater (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[8th Level Druid Spells|Druid 8]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 16th-Level Druid Spells List|Druid 16]]

**Casting Time:** See text

**Components:** V, S, F (wood to be transformed)

**Range:** 0 ft.

**Effect:** A permanent ironwood object

**Duration:** 1 day/level or permanent (see text)

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Fane of the Fallen (Frog God Games), pg. 114

This spell functions as the spell *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]*, but the effect may be permanent (instantaneous), and the caster may create larger amounts of *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]*. Any size wooden object can be turned into *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* with this spell, as can living creatures, such as treants (see the ironwood treant in Appendix 3 of the *Fane of the Fallen (Frog God Games)* adventure for an example of a creature augmented with this spell). Wooden creatures that are augmented with this spell gain damage reduction (5/[[Adamantine|adamantine]]) if medium size and (10/[[Adamantine|adamantine]]) if large size, and so on.

The caster of this spell may decide whether she wishes the effect to be permanent (instantaneous), or if she wishes it to be temporary. The caster must decide when she casts the spell, and once the decision has been made the effect cannot be changed.

All weapons, shields, and suits of armor created with this spell are treated as magical items with +2 enhancement bonuses. However, these bonuses fade after a duration period of 1 day/ level (even if the spell has been cast permanently), whereby the item returns to its normal state (or stays *ironwood* but without the bonuses if permanently altered).

The casting time for this spell is 1 half-hour for a medium object, 1 hour for a large object, 2 hours for a huge object, 3 for a gargantuan object, and 4 for a colossal object. Objects smaller than medium size take 1 minute per pound created. The casting time is doubled if the caster wishes to make the spell permanent (instantaneous).

*Material Component:***** An effigy of the intended object, carved from wood and transmuted into *ironwood* with the lesser spell, *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]*.
