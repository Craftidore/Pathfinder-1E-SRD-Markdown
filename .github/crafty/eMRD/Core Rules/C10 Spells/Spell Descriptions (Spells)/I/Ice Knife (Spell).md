*You shake your hand as if to free it from some substance you disdain. As you do, a magical shard of ice blasts from your hand and speeds to its target, the sound of cracking ice following in its wake.*

You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to hit (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll for every two caster levels). If it hits, an ice knife deals 2d8 points of cold damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage (a successful Fortitude save negates the Dexterity damage). Creatures that have immunity to cold also take no Dexterity damage automatically.

A knife that misses creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10-foot-radius burst, to determine where the shard hits). The icy burst deals 1d8 points of cold damage to all creatures within the area (Reflex half).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Wu jen 2 (water), Warmage 2 to Level per Complete Arcane.
