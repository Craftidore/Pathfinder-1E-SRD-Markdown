*Ice web* creates a many-layered mass of strong, frigid strands of pure coldfire. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points—floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like—or else the *ice web* collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within the *ice web* become [[Entangled|entangled]] in the strands. Attacking a creature in an *ice web* won’t cause you to become [[Entangled|entangled]].

Any creature moving into or through the spell’s area takes 1d6 points of frostburn damage per round.

In addition, anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is [[Entangled|entangled]], but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal (see below). If the save fails, the creature is [[Entangled|entangled]] and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check), a creature remains [[Entangled|entangled]], but may move through the *ice web* very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of *ice web* between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of *ice web* between you, it provides total cover.

The strands of an *ice web* are immune to damage from cold. Any fire—a torch, burning oil, a [[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]] sword, and so forth—can melt 5 square feet of coldfire strands in 1 round.

*Ice web* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. A permanent ice web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

Creatures with the cold subtype may pass unimpeded and unharmed through an *ice web.*
