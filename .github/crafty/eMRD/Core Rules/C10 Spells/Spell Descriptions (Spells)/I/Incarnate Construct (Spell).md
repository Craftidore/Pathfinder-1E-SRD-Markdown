This spell turns a humanoid-shaped construct into a living creature. The spell does not work on constructs that are only constructs temporarily (such as objects affected by an *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]* spell). The construct gains the incarnate construct template (see Chapter 10 of *Savage Species*). The incarnated creature is independent of both you and the being who originally made it, though it is initially friendly toward both you and its maker.

*Material Component:* The heart of a humanoid that has been dead less than 8 hours.

*XP Cost:* 5,000 XP
