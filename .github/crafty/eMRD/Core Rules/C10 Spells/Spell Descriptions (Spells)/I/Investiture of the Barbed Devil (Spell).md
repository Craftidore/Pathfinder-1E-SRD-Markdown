*With brisk arcane gestures that glow with a fiery red light, you imbue a target with the might of a barbed devil, causing long thorns to sprout all over its body.*

You cause the target of this spell to grow a number of long barbs similar to those found on a barbed devil. While under the effect of the spell, the target does not provoke attacks of opportunity when initiating a grapple. If the subject already has improved grab or the [[Improved Grapple (Feat)|Improved Grapple]] feat, it instead gains a +4 profane bonus on grapple checks.

Whenever the subject successfully makes a grapple check to grab a foe, pin a foe, or deal damage, it impales its foe on its barbs, dealing extra damage based on its size.


| **Size** | **Damage** |
|---|---|
| Tiny or smaller | 1d8 |
| Small | 2d8 |
| Medium | 3d8 |
| Large | 4d8 |
| Huge | 5d8 |
| Gargantuan | 6d8 |
| Colossal | 7d8 |

The subject also gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the barbed devil*).

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spellâ€™s duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
