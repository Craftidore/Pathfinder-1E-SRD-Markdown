*Iceberg* is a brutal and direct spell. When cast, the spell creates a single large block of ice that drops from the sky onto a spot you select. The iceberg then shatters if it encounters a solid surface. Elephant-sized blocks of ice scatter in all directions, affecting nearby creatures based on how far they are from the center of the area.

*Within 20 Feet of the Center Point:* Any creature or object directly beneath the iceberg takes 20d6 points of crushing damage (no save) and is buried in snow (see page 90 of *Frostburn*).

*Between 20 Feet and 40 Feet of the Center Point:* Creatures and objects in the middle section of the area also take 20d6 points of crushing damage, but are entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. They are buried in snow (see page 90 of *Frostburn*).

*Between 40 Feet and 60 Feet of the Center Point:* Creatures in the outermost section may be struck by flying debris for 10d6 points of damage. They are entitled to a Reflex save for half damage, and are not buried regardless of whether the saving throw is successful or not.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* If cast to drop upon an object, the object receives no save and takes 20d6 points of crushing damage.
