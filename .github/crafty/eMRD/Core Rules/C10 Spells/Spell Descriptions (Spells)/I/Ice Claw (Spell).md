*You finish this evocation and a great white claw appears before you, cold air wafting off its crystalline surface.*

This spell creates a massive reptilian claw made of ice. The ice claw can make one grapple attack per round. Its attack bonus and grapple modifier are equal to your caster level + your Int modifier or Cha modifier (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively) + 7 for the clawâ€™s Strength (24). In any round when the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage.

The claw can attack in the round it appears. Directing it to change targets is a standard action. It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. The claw has as many hit points as you do when undamaged and has AC 20 (+10 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that do not deal damage do not affect it. The claw cannot push through a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* or enter an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. It suffers the full effects of a *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]* or *[[Prismatic Sphere (Spell)|prismatic sphere]]*. The claw has your saving throw bonuses. *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|Disintegrate]]* or a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* destroys it. It has immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire.

*Focus:* A white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal.
