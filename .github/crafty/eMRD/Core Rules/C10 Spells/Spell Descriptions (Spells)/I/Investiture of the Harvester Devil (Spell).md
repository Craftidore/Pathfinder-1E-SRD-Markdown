*A deep chuckle sounds as you complete the incantation, and motes of violet light surround the target, imbuing it with infernal energy drawn from a harvester devil.*

The target of this spell deals horrific, lingering wounds with its melee attacks. If it successfully strikes an opponent with a melee attack, it causes an infernal wound that deals an extra 1d6 points of damage each round until the creature dies, or until the struck creature is the recipient of a DC 20 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check, a *cure* spell, or a *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* spell. A creature can be affected by the lingering damage of only one such infernal wound at a time.

In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the harvester devil).*

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
