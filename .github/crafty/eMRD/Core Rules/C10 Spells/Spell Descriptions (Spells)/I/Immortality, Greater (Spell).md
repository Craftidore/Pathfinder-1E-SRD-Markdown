The target stops aging. He continues to experience age effects but has no maximum age. When casting this spell, first make a check, adding your caster level plus your key ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics and druids); the Difficulty Class is 45. If you succeed, the target looks youthful and remains that way. If you do not succeed, he continues to look older and older as time passes, becoming a dreadful, shriveled husk.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *immortality* to *greater immortality* to avoid duplication.
