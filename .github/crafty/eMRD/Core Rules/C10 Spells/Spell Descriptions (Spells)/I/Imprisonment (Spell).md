When you cast *imprisonment* and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the *[[Temporal Stasis (Spell)|temporal stasis]]* spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]* spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a *[[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]],* a *[[Locate Object (Spell)|locate object]]* spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but *[[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]]* does. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target’s name and some facts about its life, the target takes a –4 penalty on its save.
