*With the sound of flapping wings, you grant the target the power of an erinyes.*

The target gains the sinister allure of an erinyes. While the spell is in effect, the subject can beckon a creature it can see clearly, forcing it to approach unless the creature succeeds on a Will save against the spellâ€™s save DC. On a failed save, the creature can do nothing on its next action except to attempt to move closer to the subject of *investiture of the erinyes*. The beckoned creature will not take obviously suicidal actions, such as walking off the edge of a cliff. However, it will move normally through squares threatened by other creatures. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Once the beckoned creature enters an adjacent square, or if it was already in an adjacent square, it takes no further action that round. The subject of this spell can use this effect once

per three caster levels.

In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of *investiture of the erinyes).*

While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|evil outsider bane]]* special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture.

After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] for 1 minute.
