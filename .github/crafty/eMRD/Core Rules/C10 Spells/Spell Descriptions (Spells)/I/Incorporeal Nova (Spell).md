*A nova of dissolution dissipates the immaterial bodies of incorporeal and gaseous creatures, destroying them instantly*.

The spell destroys 1d4 HD worth of creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4) in the area. Usually, creatures such as shadows, [[Wraith (Bestiary PF1)|wraiths]], [[Spectre (Bestiary PF1)|spectres]], [[Ghost (Bestiary PF1)|ghosts]], and similar creatures are destroyed, though [[Vampire (Bestiary PF1)|vampires]] and living creatures in gaseous form are also affected, as are other incorporeal creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those that are closest to the point of origin of the burst are affected first. No creature with 9 or more HD is affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
