The *ghost ward* is a useful trick for witches (and other casters) plagued by incorporeal nemeses. The character spends the casting time placing appropriate symbols on all entrances to the warded room. Once the spell is in place, the walls of the room are rendered completely impassable to gaseous, ethereal, astral, and otherwise incorporeal creatures. The symbols provide absolutely no protection from physical entities, magical or otherwise. The spell ends the moment the barrier is physically broken, either by opening one of the entrances or if any section of the wall, ceiling or floor is breached (hit points reduced to 0).

*Material component:* The chalk or charcoal used to mark the room.

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Ghost ward* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. When this has been done, entrances such as doors being opened do not break the ward; only temporarily suspend it.

*House Rule:* This spell can be very effectively used as a form of trap by warding several powerful incorporeal undead in a room and then teleporting away (since this spell in no way prevents teleportation). The creatures are trapped there until someone opens the door or breaches a wall.
