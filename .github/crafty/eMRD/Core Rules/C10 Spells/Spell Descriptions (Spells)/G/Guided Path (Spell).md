*With a sudden flash of insight, you know exactly where to turn and which streets to travel.*

This spell imparts to you the most direct route to a type of location within 1 mile. In this instance, a location is defined as a particular sort of building or establishment. For example, you could learn the route to the nearest tavern, temple, or blacksmith's workshop. You can't obtain directions to a *specific* location, such as the shop of Rufus the blacksmith. Additionally, the location's purpose must be publicly known. If the thieves guild secretly operates out of a warehouse, you can't obtain directions to the “headquarters of the thieves guild,” because that is not publicly available information.
