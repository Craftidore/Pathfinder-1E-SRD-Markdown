As *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]**,* except that instead of a spell effect or a blast of energy, the spell unleashes a burst of positive or negative energy, depending on whether you channel positive or negative energy. When you cast this spell, it uses one of your turning attempts for the day. If you have a feat or special ability that alters your turning check (such as Empower Turning), you may apply that modifier to the turning or rebuking stored in the glyph.

When the glyph is triggered, the turning or rebuking attempt functions as if you were making the turning roll. A successful turning or rebuking attempt causes the undead to flee the glyph. If the result is that the undead are commanded, they guard the area of the glyph for 24 hours and then are released from the effects of the command. The commanded undead do not serve you.
