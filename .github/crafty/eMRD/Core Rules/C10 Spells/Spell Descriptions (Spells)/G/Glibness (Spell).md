Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. This bonus doesnâ€™t apply to other uses of the [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

**GM Note** 

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 4 to Level per *Dungeon Master's Guide*.
