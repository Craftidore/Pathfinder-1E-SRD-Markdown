*A sickly green flame springs forth from an object that you touch.*

The effect looks like a regular flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, except for its green hue, but it creates no heat and doesnâ€™t use oxygen. *Ghoul light* can be covered and hidden, but not smothered or quenched.

All undead within 30 feet of a source of ghoul light gain +1 turn resistance. Multiple ghoul light sources do not stack.

Darkness spells of 2nd level or higher can counter *ghoul light.*
