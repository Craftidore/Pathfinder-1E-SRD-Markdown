You bestow a prescient unborn soul on the creature touched, giving him an uncanny ability to anticipate danger. As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the *guardian spirit.* While active, the spiritâ€™s prescience provides the recipient of the spell with a +2 insight bonus on Armor Class, Reflex saving throws, Dexterity checks (including initiative checks), and Dexterity-based skill checks. The *guardian spirit* remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.

No creature can be the target of more than one *guardian spirit* spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the fi rst has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.

*Essentia:* For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus provided by the spirit improves by 1.
