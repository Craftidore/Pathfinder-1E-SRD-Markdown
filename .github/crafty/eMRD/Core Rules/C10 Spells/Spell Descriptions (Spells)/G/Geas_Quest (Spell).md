This spell functions similarly to *[[Geas, Lesser (Spell)|lesser geas]]**,* except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas/quest* for 24 hours, it takes a –3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *geas/quest.*

A *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell ends a *geas/quest* spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|Break enchantment]]* does not end a *geas/quest*, but *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, and *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as *geas,* while clerics call the same spell *quest*.
