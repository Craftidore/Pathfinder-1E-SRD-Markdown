*A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you, as if it had always been there, and slaps at foes that leave themselves open to attack.*

You evoke a partially translucent, scaled tail that can attack foes that are vulnerable to attacks of opportunity. If your foe takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you, even if you are not holding a melee weapon that would normally threaten your foe, your evoked dragonâ€™s tail attacks the target with a melee touch attack, dealing 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. You can only strike with a *ghostly tail* if you have not already taken your allowed number of attacks of opportunity in the round.

*Special:* A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, deals an extra 1 point of damage per level with a *ghostly tail* (maximum 20 points).
