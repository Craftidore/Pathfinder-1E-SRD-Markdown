You utter shrieks of nonsense and gibberish that thinking creatures find distracting and confusing. The spell affects only creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. Any such creatures within the spell’s area must succeed on Fortitude saves or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores of 20 or higher), [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 10 and 19), or [[Shaken|shaken]] for 1 round (if they have Intelligence scores between 3 and 9).

In addition, a creature within the spell’s area loses any psionic focus it might have had and takes a –4 penalty on Concentration checks for 1 round. These effects happen whether or not the creature succeeded on its save.
