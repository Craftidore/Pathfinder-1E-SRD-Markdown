A *grease* spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check. Failure means it canâ€™t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]].

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the *greased* item. A creature wearing *greased* armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their CMD to avoid being [[Grappled|grappled]].
