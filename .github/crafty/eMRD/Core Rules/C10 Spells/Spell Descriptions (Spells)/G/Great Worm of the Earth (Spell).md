*With a fearsome roar, an enormous wormlike mouth bursts from the earth beneath your opponent's feet, attempting to swallow him whole.*

You conjure a great worm-like maw from the ground beneath the feet of another creature, which immediately bites and tries to swallow that creature. A successful Reflex save means the creature takes only 4d6 points of damage and the spell ends.

If the creature fails its save, it takes 8d6 points of damage and becomes “swallowed” by the mouth, dragged beneath the ground. A creature so trapped can't act except to try to escape and takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage each round on your turn as the worm “digests” it.

Each round on its turn, a creature trapped within the worm can take a full-round action to attempt a new Reflex save to escape. If successful, the creature appears prone in its original space and the spell ends. An ally in or adjacent to the creature's original space can use the aid another action to help unearth it; a successful DC 10 Strength check grants a +2 bonus on the creature's next Reflex save to escape.

You can place this spell's effect only on a horizontal area of dirt or stone at least 10 feet thick. Any creature more than 5 feet off the ground can't be affected by this spell.
