You create an extradimensional prison where you store captured foes in stasis. Those affected by the spell must be either helpless or willing (often, when granted the options of this type of imprisonment and death, a subject will submit to the spell and thus get no saving throw). Subjects must also be of 5 HD or less.

Using this spell, you place them in a state of suspended animation. For the creatures, time ceases to flow and their condition becomes fixed. They do not grow older. Their bodily functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm them.

This spell is known to some as *bonds of mercy*.
