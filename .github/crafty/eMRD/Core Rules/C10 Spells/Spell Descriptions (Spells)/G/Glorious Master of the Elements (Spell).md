*A surge of arcane energy explodes from your fingertips, sending white, red, and yellow jolts lancing outward.*

This spell allows you to channel the awesome energy of the primal elements. For the duration of the spell, you can, as a standard action, make a ranged touch attack against any target within 60 feet. If successful, you deal 1d6 points of energy damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). Before making the attack, select the energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, and fire.

Additionally, each time you successfully make an attack on a target using this spell, you gain a cumulative +2 bonus on the damage roll for each subsequent attack on the same target. This bonus is cumulative only for the duration of the spell and applies only to damage dealt by this spell.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, your ranged touch attacks from this spell instead deal 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8).
