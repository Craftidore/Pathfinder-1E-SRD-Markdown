*Getaway* teleports you and allies you designate at the time of casting to a predetermined location. You must initially cast the spell at that location—all creatures affected by the spell must be present at that time and within 30 feet of you. At any time before the spell’s duration expires, you may trigger the spell as a swift action. At this time, all affected creatures (or their remains and gear) within 30 feet of you are teleported to the location where you first cast the spell. Creatures more than 30 feet away from you are left behind. Selected creatures within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with you at that time can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is an exception to the rule regarding teleportation magics and vehicles (such as ships). Because the initial casting of the spell is at the location (the vehicle) and in effect the completion of that casting *snaps* the caster (and any others designated) back to the vehicle it is an exception to that rule.
