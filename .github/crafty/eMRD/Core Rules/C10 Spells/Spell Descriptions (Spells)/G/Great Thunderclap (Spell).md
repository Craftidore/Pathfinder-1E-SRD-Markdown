*You grip the bell in your fist and raise it over your head, intoning the spell and calling down a thunderous blast in the midst of those who oppose you.*

You create a loud noise equivalent to a peal of thunder. The spell has three effects. First, all creatures in the area must make Will saves to avoid being [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. Second, the creatures must make Fortitude saves or be [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1 minute. Third, they must make Reflex saves or fall prone. Creatures that cannot hear are not [[Stunned|stunned]], but might still fall prone.
