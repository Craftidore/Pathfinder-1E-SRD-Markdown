*Your targetâ€™s eyes gleam with a sudden wave of insight... but then his face twists into a rictus of agony and confusion.*

You call upon the ancestral memory and experience of the long-lived elves, visiting all the burden of that knowledge on a single creature. The target of the spell takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and is *[[Confused|confused]]* for the duration of the spell unless it makes a successful Will save. A successful save results in half damage and negates the *confusion.*

Elves and similarly long-lived creatures are affected normally by this spell. No creature can experience millennia of knowledge in such a short time without feeling its weight.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Cleric 6 to Level per Magic of Eberron.
