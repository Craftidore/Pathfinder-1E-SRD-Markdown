*You blow a mixture of pollen and ground mandrake root from your palm toward the targeted area. The granules are carried by a directed wind and explode into a cloud of yellow dust and seed.*

*Gnome blight* creates a thick cloud of agonizingly itchy pollen similar to that created by *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]**,* except that the pollen is sickening. Living creatures in the cloud become [[Sickened|sickened]]. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each [[Sickened|sickened]] individual.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.

Creatures with sensitive olfactory senses (such as gnomes or creatures with the scent ability) take a â€“4 penalty on their saving throws.

*Material Component:* Flower pollen and ground mandrake root.
