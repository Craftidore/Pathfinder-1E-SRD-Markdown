The *glamerwall* spell transforms a solid wall so that it is transparent on one side and appears as a solid wall from the other. In effect, it turns the wall into a one-way glass; those on one side of a stone wall can see into the room as if through a window, while those on the opposite side see only a stone wall.

The properties of the wall, appearance, hardness, hp, etc. do not change; the wall is simply transparent to those on one side. The caster may transform, or partially transform part of a wall, up to one 10-ft. square/level area. The caster also chooses which side to make invisible.

*Glamerwalls* are frequently used in sieges, to give those within a tactical advantage. Also glamerwalls are often times used in pleasure houses for the more peculiar tastes. 

*Arcane Material Component:* A piece of mirror painted black on one side.

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Glamerwall* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. 

*House Rule:* Added Witch 4 to level.
