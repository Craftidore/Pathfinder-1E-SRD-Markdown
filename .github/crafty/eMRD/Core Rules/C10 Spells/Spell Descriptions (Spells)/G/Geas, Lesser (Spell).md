A *lesser geas* places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a *geas* cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The *geased* creature must follow the given instructions until the *geas* is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *lesser geas* for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *lesser geas.*

A *lesser geas* (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by *[[Break Enchantment (Spell)|break enchantment]]*, *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*. *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|Dispel magic]]* does not affect a *lesser geas*.
