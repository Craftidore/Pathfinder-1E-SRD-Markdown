*Hundreds of disembodied hands burst from the wall, forming a sea of clutching, probing appendages.*

You cause hands to sprout from a wall within range. This spell simply adds grasping hands to an existing wall rather than creating a wall of a substance.

All opponents adjacent to the wall are [[Entangled|entangled]] unless they succeed on Reflex saves. An opponent must repeat this save each round it remains adjacent to the wall.

Allied creatures are not [[Entangled|entangled]], and in fact can use the hands to gain a +10 competence bonus on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks to scale the wall. If the spell ends while you are climbing, you immediately fall but can make a normal [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check to catch yourself.

Any objects on a wall affected by the spell are unharmed; doors, windows, and other apertures in the wall can be opened or closed as normal.
