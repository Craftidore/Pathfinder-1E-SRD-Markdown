By means of this spell, you can cause one musical instrument you touch to float a few feet above the ground and play itself. The instrument must be intact and in playable condition (no missing strings, clogged mouthpieces, or other impediments to proper use). The instrument plays any tune you desire as though a skilled musician were playing it, regardless of whether you can play the instrument in question. If used in conjunction with your bardic music ability, the *ghost pipes* grant a +2 competence bonus on your [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check.
