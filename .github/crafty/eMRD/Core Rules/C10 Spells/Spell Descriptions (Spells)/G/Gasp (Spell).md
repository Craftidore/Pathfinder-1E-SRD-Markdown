The subject of the spell inhales deeply, as if short of breath. If the subject creature is holding its breath, it must start making Constitution checks to continue holding its breath or drown, as though it had already been holding its breath for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score.

Aquatic spellcasters, including merfolk and sahuagin, enjoy casting this spell on surface-dwellers who try to fight them without the benefit of wafer breathing.
