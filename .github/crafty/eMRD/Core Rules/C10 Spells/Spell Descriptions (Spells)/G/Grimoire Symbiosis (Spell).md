When casting this spell a wizard is able to retrieve a spell from one of his spellbooks bearing his *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]*. But certain prerequisites must be met first.

First, the wizard in question must know the spell *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]* and must have previously cast it on his spellbook(s). Also, this spell will only work on a spellbook that was scripted by the character personally; merely placing an *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]* on someone elseâ€™s spellbook will not work. And finally, the wizard must leave at least one spell slot open when preparing his daily spells, in addition to having this spell prepared.

If all these conditions are met then upon completion of this incantation a previously unprepared spell is instantly prepared into the open spell slot, be it of equal or lower level than the open slot. The wizard may not alter the spell with metamagic feats or the like (if any).

This spell may be prepared more than once as long as an equal number of spell slots are left open. The level of the spell slot left open and spell retrieved are not affected by the level of this spell. For example, Jebadoah may leave a level 9 spell slot open and use this spell (level 4) to retrieve a level 9 spell.

This spell will work over any distance as long as the character and his spellbook are on the same plane of existence.

**GM Note**

Especially crafty spellcasters have been known to prepare several scrolls with this spell and then cast the spells from the scroll while leaving open spells from each of their higher level spell slots.
