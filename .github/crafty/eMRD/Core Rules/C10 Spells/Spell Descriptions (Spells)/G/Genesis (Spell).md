You create an immobile, finite demiplane with limited access. Demiplanes created by this spell are very small. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate of 1-foot-radius per day, up to a 180-foot radius. You determine the environment in the demiplane, reflecting most any desire you can visualize, such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the shape of the terrain. The spell cannot create life, nor can it create buildings. If desired, these must be brought in by some other fashion.

You can cast this spell again to enlarge the demiplane by 60 feet per casting if you are inside its boundaries.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Cleric 9, Sorcerer 9, Witch 9, Wizard 9 to Level.

Note: The demiplane created by this spell can be subsequently affected by any of the *[[Create Demiplane (Spell)|create demiplane]]* spells just as if had been created using one of them.

Note: Most demiplanes must be created from either a [[Material Plane (Plane)|Prime Material]], the [[Astral Plane]], or the [[Ethereal Plane]]; demiplanes created from the *genesis* spell are exceptions to this rule. Demiplanes created by using *genesis* may be created from [[Extradimensional Spaces|extradimensional spaces]] (cf. *bag of holding*), other demiplanes, and even other dimensions.
