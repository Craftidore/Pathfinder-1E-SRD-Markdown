*Shimmering ghostly hands pull your crossbow’s string back into the catch as you prepare to fire another bolt.*

After the wielder shoots a projectile from the crossbow affected by this spell, the magic immediately cocks the crossbow so that the weapon can be loaded again.

*Ghostly reload* pulls the string of a [[Crossbow, Hand|hand crossbow]] or light crossbow into place once per caster level (maximum ten times at caster level 10th) and the string of a heavy crossbow into place once per two caster levels (maximum five times at caster level 10th). Cumulative castings of *ghostly reload* do not stack.

This spell allows the crossbow’s wielder to fire a light crossbow or heavy crossbow as a standard action and move in the same round. If the character benefits from a high base attack bonus, the crossbow can be fired multiple times as a full attack, but only if *ghostly reload* can be applied to each attack in that round.
