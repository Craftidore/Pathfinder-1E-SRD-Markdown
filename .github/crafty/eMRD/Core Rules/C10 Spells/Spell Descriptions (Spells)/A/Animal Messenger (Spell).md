You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own. You can attach a small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.

During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it’s written in a language he doesn’t know, for example).

**Mythic Rule**

You can implant a verbal message in the target animal, along with a triggering condition for that message to activate, as the *[[Magic Mouth (Spell)|magic mouth]]* spell. The *mythic animal messenger* travels to the place you designate and waits there until the spell expires or the message is delivered, whichever occurs first. A *mythic animal messenger* does not need to eat, drink, or sleep while waiting for the message, and it gains DR/epic and a bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks equal to your mythic tier.

**Augmented (3rd):** If you expend two uses of mythic power, your *mythic animal messenger* gains the agile simple mythic template, as described in the Mythic Monster Advancement section of Chapter 6 of *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures.*
