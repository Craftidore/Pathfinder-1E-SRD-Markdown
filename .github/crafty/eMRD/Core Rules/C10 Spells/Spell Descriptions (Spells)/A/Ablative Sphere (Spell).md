An immobile, crystalline, web-like globe surrounds you. When the *ablative sphere* winks into existence, it provides you with improved cover. The barrier does not impede a spell's line of sight or effect.

The sphere is 1 inch thick per caster level, has hardness 5, and 3 hit points per inch of thickness. When an *ablative sphere* loses hit points, the level of cover it provides is reduced. When the ablative sphere has lost one-third of its hit points, it provides cover instead of improved cover. Once it has lost two-thirds of its hit points, it provides only partial cover. Finally, when the *ablative sphere's* hit points reach 0, the globe is destroyed. When an attack reduces an *ablative sphere's* hit points to 0, you take any remaining damage.

**Improved Cover**

In some cases, such as attacking a target hiding behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains [[Improved Evasion|improved evasion]] against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks.
