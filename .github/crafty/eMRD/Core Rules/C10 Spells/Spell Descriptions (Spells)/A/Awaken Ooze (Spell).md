Similar to the *[[Awaken (Spell)|awaken]]* spell, *awaken ooze* grants human-like sentience to an ooze. For the spell to succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the target's HD). The *awakened* ooze is indifferent toward you, feeling no particular debt of gratitude for its condition. You can command it, however, forcing it to perform a certain task if you win an opposed Charisma check. If you win the check, the ooze obeys your instructions for 1 minute, then reverts to its indifferent attitude.

An *awakened* ooze gains the aberration type but keeps all of the characteristics of the ooze type except immunity to mind-influencing effects. (Since it now has a mind, it is no longer immune to such effects.) It gains new Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 3d6. It gains skills and feats according to its new type: skill points equal to 2 x its new Intelligence score +2 per Extra Hit Die, and a number of feats equal to it's Intelligence bonus +1 per 4 Extra Hit Dice. (Use the variant skill and feat calculations in Savage Species if you are using the other rules in that book.)

An *awakened* ooze can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).
