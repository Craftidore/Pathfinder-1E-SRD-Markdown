You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate within one day’s travel. Once it arrives at its destination, the creature remains there for the remaining duration of the spell. If the animal cannot reach its destination before the spell’s duration ends, it travels in the destination’s direction but travels randomly once the spell ends.

Any humanoid creature that comes within 30 ft. of the animal during the spell’s duration must make a Fortitude save or contract one of the following diseases: [[Blinding Sickness|blinding sickness]], [[Bubonic Plague|bubonic plague]], [[Cackle Fever|cackle fever]], [[Filth Fever|filth fever]], [[Mindfire|mindfire]], [[Red Ache|red ache]], [[Donovan Montgomery|shakes]], or [[Slimy Doom|slimy doom]] (you choose which at the time of casting). The disease sets in immediately; there is no onset period, but only one save is required to cure the disease. All other disease effects proceed normally.
