Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be [[Fascinated|fascinated]] by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.

**Mythic Rule**

Add your mythic tier to the number of Hit Dice of animals you can fascinate. In addition, affected animals remain [[Fascinated|fascinated]] after you cease concentration for a number of rounds equal to your mythic tier.

**Augmented:** If you expend two uses of mythic power, *mythic animal trance* also affects magical beasts and vermin (including mindless vermin).
