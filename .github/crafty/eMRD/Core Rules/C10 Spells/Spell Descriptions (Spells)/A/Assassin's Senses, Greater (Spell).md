When the caster uses this spell, his target's eyes change color to a deep crimson, and the target acquires the senses of a professional killer. Any of his attacks, from the heaviest blow to the softest strike, can be deadly.

*Greater assassin's senses* increase the target's weapon critical threat range and multiplier by one.

**GM Note**

*Greater assassin's sense* will stack with the *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]* spell and the *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* weapon ability since it is a divination effect and they are based on a transmutation effect/spell. It also stacks with the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat.
