You surround the subject with a brilliant violet glow that grants temporary immunity to poisons and diseases. *Amethyst aura* absorbs all poisons and diseases that target the subject for the duration of the spell, regardless of how they are delivered. Any weapon or natural attack normally used to deliver a poison or disease (such as a mummy's touch or a snake's bite) still deals the normal amount of hit point damage, but the poison or disease is blocked.

This spell does not reverse or prevent the effects of poison and disease in a subject already affected by one or both at the time of casting.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Nezram's amethyst aura* in the Forgotten Realms.
