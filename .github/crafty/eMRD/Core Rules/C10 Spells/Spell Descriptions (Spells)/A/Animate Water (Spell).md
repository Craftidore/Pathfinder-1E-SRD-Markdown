You imbue water with cohesiveness, giving it a humanoid shape and a semblance of life.

The volume of water affected determines the possible sizes of the creature you create. You can animate a larger amount of water based on the following: A Medium creation counts as two Small or smaller creatures; a Large creation as four; a Huge creation as eight; a Gargantuan creation as 16; and a Colossal creation as 32. You can change the size and number of the creations as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The creations have the statistics of [[Animated Object (Bestiary PF1)|animated objects]] as described in the Pathfinder Bestiary with the following difference: Instead of hardness the animated water has DR 10/magic and takes half damage from piercing and slashing weapons. This spell cannot affect any liquids carried by a creature.

*Animate water* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell at a cost of 17,500 gp and a minimum caster level of 13th.
