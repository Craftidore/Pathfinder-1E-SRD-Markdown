As *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]*, except that it even protects against *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spells and adds 20 to the DC to open the lock. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 30 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill check. Add 15 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. Furthermore, the caster can designate up to one creature per caster level who can open the door, chest or portal as freely as himself.
