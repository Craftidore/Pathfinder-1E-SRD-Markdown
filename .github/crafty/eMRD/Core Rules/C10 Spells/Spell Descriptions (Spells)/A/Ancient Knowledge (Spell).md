You tap the ancient knowledge of fate and fortune, giving you a greater ability to focus on a particularly diffi cult academic problem. Before making a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check, you can decide to discharge this spell as an immediate action to give yourself a +5 insight bonus on the check. If you do not have any ranks in the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill, it is still treated as an untrained check.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Finding dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Tharashk), treats any [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check made in conjunction with this spell as a trained check, even if he doesnâ€™t have any ranks in the skill.
