You must cast this spell on a clear night, allowing you to read and measure the positions of the stars and planets. When you have completed the casting, you gather the creatures you wish to affect with the reading and spend the next hour explaining the intricacies of magical astrological readings and each of the creatureâ€™s place in your findings. Each creature participating in that explanation has any curse, compulsion, or charm currently affecting them removed. Furthermore, they gain a +4 insight bonus to resist all emotion, curses, compulsions, and charm effects, and are immune to *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]* for the duration of the spell.

If the reading is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.
