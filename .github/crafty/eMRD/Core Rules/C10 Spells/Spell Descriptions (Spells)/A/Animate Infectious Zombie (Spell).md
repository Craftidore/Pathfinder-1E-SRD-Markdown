This spell functions as *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* except as noted here. It raises a zombie (not a skeleton) that carries a disease in its natural weapons. Apart from the carried infection, infectious zombies are no different from their normal counterparts.

Anyone damaged by an infectious zombie’s natural weapon must make a successful DC 16 Fortitude saving throw to avoid contracting the disease, known as zombie plague (see below).

Only the initially created infectious zombie is under the caster’s control. Other infectious zombies that are created by succumbing to the disease of the first zombie are uncontrolled unless other spells are put in place to control them.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Each successful attack by an infectious zombie's natural weapon requires a separate save and subsequent attacks continue to require a saving throw even when the character has already saved.

**Zombie Plague:** The disease carried by an infectious zombie has an incubation period of 24 hours. After that time, a victim who failed its Fortitude save loses 1d6 points of Constitution. An additional save must be attempted every day thereafter until the victim either succeeds, negating the plague, or dies, rising as an infectious zombie.
