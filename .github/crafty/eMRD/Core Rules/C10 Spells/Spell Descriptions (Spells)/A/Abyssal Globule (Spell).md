You create a poisonous glob of disgusting and pulsating green flesh that thrums with the power of Abyssal corruption, and you lob it at your enemy. With a successful touch attack, the globule deals 1d4 hp acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or become poisoned. This poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to end the affliction, but they become [[Sickened|sickened]] for the remaining duration.

**Mythic:** The initial acid damage increases to 1d8 hp per caster level (maximum 10d8). Those who successfully save are [[Sickened|sickened]] for the duration of the spell, and those who fail the save are [[Nauseated|nauseated]] and take the Constitution damage. Creatures that must save each round to end the affliction receive a â€“4 penalty to those saves, and those who make the save are still [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for the remaining duration.
