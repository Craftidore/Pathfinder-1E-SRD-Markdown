*You dust your ally with gelatin and silently evoke the spell. Immediately her bones begin to soften and she and her belongings slump, becoming malleable ooze.*

The subject and all its gear become amorphous and oozelike. This new form is boneless and fluid, enabling the subject to pass through holes or narrow openings as small as 2 inches in diameter. While amorphous, the subject is immune to poison, polymorphing, and stunning, it cannot be flanked, and it is not subject to extra damage from critical hits. It gains a swim speed (if it does not have one already) equal to its land speed. The subject can remain submerged as long as desired without breathing.

The subjectâ€™s armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its modifiers for size, Dexterity, and deflection still apply to Armor Class, as do armor bonuses from force effects (for example, from the *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* [[Eschew Materials (Feat)|Eschew Materials]], [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]], and [[Still Spell (Feat)|Still Spell]].) The subject loses all supernatural abilities while in amorphous form, and its magic items, aside from those bonuses noted above, cease functioning as long as it remains amorphous.

*Material Component:* A pinch of gelatin.
