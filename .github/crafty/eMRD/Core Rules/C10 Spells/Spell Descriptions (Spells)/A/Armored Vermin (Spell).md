*The vermin you select pause for a moment as their exoskeletons take on a metallic sheen.*

You cause the exoskeletons of up to three vermin to harden to the strength of steel. The spell increases the vermin’s natural armor bonus by 2. This bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 7th, to a maximum of +6 at caster level 19th.

The enhancement bonus provided by *armored vermin* stacks with the target’s natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A vermin with no natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
