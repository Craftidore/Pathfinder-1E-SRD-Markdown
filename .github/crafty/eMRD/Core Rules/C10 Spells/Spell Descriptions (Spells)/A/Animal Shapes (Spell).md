As [[Beast Shape III (Spell)|beast shape III,]] except you change the form of up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.

**Mythic Rule**

You may affect a number of targets equal to your caster level plus your mythic tier. Creatures gain the benefits of *mythic [[Beast Shape III (Spell)|beast shape III]]* when polymorphed by this spell. In addition, creatures can transition from animal form to their normal form (or the reverse) as a move action and may do so any number of times during the spellâ€™s duration.
