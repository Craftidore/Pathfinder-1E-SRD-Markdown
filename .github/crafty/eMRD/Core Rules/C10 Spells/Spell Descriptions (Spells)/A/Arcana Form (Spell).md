You transform yourself into a being of pure magical energy. You are incorporeal, immune to critical hits, and can fly with good maneuverability at a speed of 100.

Because you can draw magical essence from your own form, you can use this energy to cast spells. At the cost of 5 hit points per spell level, you can cast spells with no loss of prepared spells or spell slots. You may cast only spells you know, or those you have prepared for that day, if you prepare spells. At the cost of 1 Constitution point (temporary damage), you can use a charged item and not expend a charge; 2 Constitution points will save two charges, if needed.

Should you enter an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, you cease to exist for the rest of the spell’s duration (or the antimagic’s duration, whichever is shorter).
