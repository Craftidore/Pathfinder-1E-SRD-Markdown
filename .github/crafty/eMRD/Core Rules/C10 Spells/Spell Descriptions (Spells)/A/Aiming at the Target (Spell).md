*As you intone the words of power to release this spell, you feel far more focused on the spell on which you have been concentrating.*

When you cast this spell, you increase your ability to concentrate on a spell you have already cast. You can cast this spell while maintaining concentration on another spell. *Aiming at the target* gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on the other spell, and its effect lasts as long as you concentrate on the other spell (to a maximum of 20 minutes).
