You create a tattoo upon your own body that has the ability to move and attack (using your base attack bonus plus the relevant casting ability modifier) out to a range equal to your natural reach. Moving the tattoo around your body is not an action. Attacking with the tattoo is a melee attack action (it can be used to make attacks of opportunity). The tattoo deals damage equal to 1d6 plus the relevant casting ability modifier (successfully disbelieving after interacting with the tattoo reduces the damage by half). The spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, you cannot change them. The tattoo can move all over your body if you wish.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell creates an engraving when cast upon constructs made of metal, stone, wood, etc.

*House Rule:* Changed material component cost from 10 gp to 100 gp for game balance. The first (base) casting of this spell counts as a +0 magical weapon with regard to enchanting it as a magical weapon.

*House Rule:* A subsequent casting of this spell at each odd level with an increase in component cost of 100 gp/level allows for an increase in this spell's power:

Add spell casting modifier to Will DC to increase difficulty; after this is taken then the second increase changes to no Will save allowed. \*<sup>5</sup>

Change to a touch attack instead of straight melee attack. \*<sup>3</sup>

Change from a touch attack to a 30 foot ranged touch attack

Increase critical modifier by +1; can be taken no more than twice.

Increase critical threat range by +1; can be taken no more than twice.

Increase damage by +1/3 levels, second time taken damage increases by +1/2 levels.

Increase reach by 5 feet; can be taken no more than twice.

May attack as a swift action; after this is taken then may enhance again so it attacks as an immediate action.

Use caster level as base attack bonus instead of class level.

Use caster level as base attack bonus for iterative attacks.

Use attack(s) to parry an incoming blow by making an attack roll using the same bonuses as the attack you chose to forego during your previous action. If your attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than medium the attack roll takes a â€“4 penalty

Once an *animate tattoo* spell has been modified by subsequent castings, it can no longer be transferred via the *transfer tattoo* spell.
