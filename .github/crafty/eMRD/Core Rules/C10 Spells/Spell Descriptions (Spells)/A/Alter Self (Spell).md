**GM Note** 

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 2 to Level per *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

**Mythic Rule**

After casting the spell, you can change your shape an additional number of times equal to your mythic tier. Alternatively, you can cast this on a willing target with a range of touch (Fortitude negates (harmless), Spell Resistance yes). The subject of this spell can resume its normal form and then shift back into the same assumed form without ending the spell; however, the spell’s duration continues to elapse while the target is in its own form. If the target of this spell is a mythic creature, it can spend one use of its own mythic power as a full-round action to shift into a different humanoid form.

**Augmented (3rd):** If you expend two uses of mythic power, increase the spell’s duration to 1 hour per level.
