This powerful spell defends against the greatest evils, warding a location with angelic power. It acts in all ways as an *[[Angelic Seal (Spell)|angelic seal]]* with the following exceptions: Damage suffered by an evil creature touching or entering the warded area is 20d6 hp; evil, extraplanar creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are instantly killed, and they only make a Will save against being forced back to their home plane if they survive the Fortitude save. Only a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* can remove a *greater angelic seal* magically. The physical means are identical to the less powerful version of the spell.

Also, a *greater angelic seal* can instead be focused inward, trapping any evil creatures within the area of effect at the time of casting. Any attempts to leave the area trigger the spellâ€™s effects.
