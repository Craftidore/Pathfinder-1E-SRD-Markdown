When in the presence of a demon, the caster conjures a bebilith—a demon that hunts other demons—to kill or chase off the original demon. This spell is a risky proposition, however. To determine the effect of the spell, subtract the Hit Dice of the demon from 12 (the HD of the bebilith), add the result to a caster level check, and consult the table below.

If this spell is cast while not in the presence of a demon, the bebilith acts as if the caster level check result was a 10.


| **Check**<br>**Result** | **Outcome** |
|---|---|
| 9 or lower | Bebilith and demon both attack caster. |
| 10–12 | Bebilith ignores demon and attempts to grab another random creature (possibly caster) within 100 feet of where it appeared. It tries to grab the creature, then retreat to the Abyss to feed, never returning.\* |
| 13–18 | Bebilith flees without taking action. |
| 19–21 | Demon flees, and bebilith attempts to grab another random creature (possibly caster) within 100 feet of where it appeared. It tries to grab the creature, then retreat to the Abyss to feed, never returning.\* |
| 22–30 | Demon flees, and 1 round later the bebilith starts hunting for it. |
| 31 or higher | Bebilith grabs demon, and the two disappear.\* The demon is never seen again. |

\*Bebilith attempts to start a grapple with its target. On a successful grapple check, bebilith and its victim are both affected by the bebilith’s *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* ability (this ability allows the bebilith to take a creature with it, which it can’t otherwise do).
