*Encircling your eye with thumb and forefinger as if holding a jewelerâ€™s lens*, *you speak the arcane words that complete the spell. Objects near you suddenly seem clearer, more in focus. You note blemishes and imperfections you had missed before.*

You gain an intuitive insight into the value of objects you come into contact with. You gain a +10 insight bonus on [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] checks to determine the value of items you touch while this spell is in effect. Using the [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] skill in this fashion requires 2 minutes instead of the normal 1 minute.

Even if you fail an [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] check while this spell is in effect, you never mistakenly estimate the worth of an item by more than 50%.
