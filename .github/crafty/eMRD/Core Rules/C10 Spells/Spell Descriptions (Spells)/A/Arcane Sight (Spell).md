This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell, but *arcane sight* does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning level or an item’s caster level, as noted in the description of the *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

As with *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.

*Arcane sight* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**Mythic Rule**

You know the location, power and school of all magical auras within your sight, and you may expend one use of mythic power to identify the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. If a creature has multiple spells or spell-like abilities of the same level, you identify one at random. *Mythic arcane sight* requires *mythic permanency* to be made permanent.

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Arcane sight* automatically allows the user to detect invisible creatures unless some means has been used to mask the magical aura of the effect used to gain *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*. 

Someone using [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] to determine the school of magic of a spell can do one magical aura per level in a round. The difficulty to determine the magical school of the aura increases the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check by +1 per aura after the first one (up to the maximum of one aura per level per round). (This is a house rule in testing and subject to change.)
