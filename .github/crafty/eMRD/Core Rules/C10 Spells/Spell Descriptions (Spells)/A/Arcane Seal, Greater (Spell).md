This spell holds closed a single door (no more than 40 square feet per level), chest, lock or scabbard until a condition set at the time of casting is met. Conditions include speaking a command word or short phrase (four words at most), the touch of a specific race, being struck by a specific object or the presence of a descendant of someone who was present during the casting. The seal can not determine class, ability score, alignment, or any other trait not listed above. Note that the seal can be keyed to only one condition. The effect can be dispelled by *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or suspended by a *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell only if the caster's level is higher than that of the one who placed the seal. Attempts to force open a door under this speII are at +15 DC over the normal difficulty.

*Material* Components: Powdered diamonds worth 50 gp.

*Arcane Focus:* A signet ring.

**History:** Hedrada taught this spell to his followers to help them maintain order by keeping intruders out of important places. Temples commonly contain a number of doors that are locked by this spell, which can only be opened with a command word known to the high priests.

With so many valuables to protect, it wasn't long before the loremasters in Darakeene were commissioned to create an arcane version of this effect. Kings used it to prevent all but their descendants from accessing their treasuries. Elves enchanted scabbards so that no goblin could ever draw from them. Secret orders locked their strongholds so that none may enter without the badge of membership.

Then came the scarring of the land. Now, many seals have outlived anyone that once knew how to open them. Fortunately, it was a tradition of arcane castings of the spell to inscribe a riddle on the sealed object that gave a clue as to the nature of the key. New owners now scour the land for the person, word or object that can unlock the prize.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *seal of Hedrada* to *greater arcane seal* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Level changed to Cleric 5, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5.

*House Rule:* Changed DC to attempt to open from +15 to +20 for game balance with *[[Arcane Seal (Spell)|arcane seal]]**.*

*House Rule:* It should be noted that when the condition is met, the object sealed opens and then closes one minute later unless steps are taken to keep it open. Once closed, it is again sealed until the condition is met again.
