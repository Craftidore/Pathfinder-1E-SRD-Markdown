With the ingestion of a small iron ball (the material component), you are infused with aspects of the fearsome iron golem. For the duration of the spell you gain damage reduction 50/+3 and heal 1 hit point for every 3 points of fire damage you would normally suffer if stricken with a fire-based attack (such as a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell). However, you cannot exceed your maximum hit points. Once you have regained your maximum hit points, you do not gain any further until you suffer damage from another source and again gain hit points from a fire-based attack. These effects last for the duration of the spell or until you are affected by an electrical attack, spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect. If you are stricken with a successful electrical effect, you must make an opposed level check (1d20 + character level) against your opponent. If you lose the opposed check, the electrical attack dispels the effects of this spell instantly, regardless of the duration remaining. If you win the opposed check, the spell remains in effect until either the duration passes normally or you are affected by another electrical attack.
