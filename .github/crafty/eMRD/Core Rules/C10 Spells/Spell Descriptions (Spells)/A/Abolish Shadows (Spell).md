A burst of dark energy leaps forth from your body and disrupts all shadows in the area of effect. This has two primary effects: First, shadow creatures (including shadows, shades, and other monsters or beings of the shadow type) take 1d6 points of damage per caster level, to a maximum of 10d6. Creatures subject to this effect are entitled to a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Second, spells of the shadow subschool or the darkness descriptor (including shadow conjurations and shadow evocations) may be dispelled. Make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the target spellâ€™s caster level.
