When you cast this spell, you take on the aspect of a ram, including some aspects of its appearance. Your body hair grows thick and woolly, and a curling pair of horns sprouts from your head. These horns can make a gore attack as a primary natural weapon, dealing 1d4+1/2 Ã— your Strength bonus. In a charge attack, the damage die increases to 1d8.

You also become more nimble in mountainous environments. You are not hindered by dense rubble, ice sheets, scree, or steep slopes. Additionally, you gain a +8 racial bonus to [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks and [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks made for jumping or balance for the duration of the spell, and you take no penalty for accelerated climbing. The spell does not give an affected creature a climb speed.
