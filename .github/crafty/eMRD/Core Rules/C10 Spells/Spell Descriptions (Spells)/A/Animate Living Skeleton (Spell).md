# Animate Living Skeleton (Spell)
## Overview
[[Necromancy Spells|Necromancy]] ([[Animation Spells|animation]]) \[[[Evil Spells|evil]]]

**Level:** [[5th Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 5]], [[5th Level Oracle Spells|Oracle 5]], [[5th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 5]], [[5th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 5]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 9th-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 9]], [[BoXM 9th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 9]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (an onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per HD of the target)

**Range:** Close (25 f. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One living creature

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (see text)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 121

The target’s bones take on a life of their own and move within the target’s flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save each round this spell is in effect as the target’s skeleton animates from within. Each failure means the target takes 1d6 hp of negative energy damage and 1 point of Constitution damage, and it becomes [[Staggered|staggered]] and [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round. If the target makes its save, it takes no hp or Constitution damage but is still [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round.

If the target creature dies during the duration of this spell, its remaining flesh immediately falls away and its type changes to [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|undead]] as it becomes an animated skeleton (wearing and wielding all of the target’s equipment). Starting on your next turn and lasting until the spell ends, the skeleton is under your direct control. When the spell duration expires, the controlled skeleton collapses into a heap of bones.

*[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|Protection from evil]]* negates this spell’s effects for as long as the two durations overlap. *[[Dispel Evil (Spell)|Dispel evil]]* automatically ends the spell.

This spell has no effect on creatures without internal [[Skeleton (Bestiary PF1)|skeletons]].

**Mythic:** This spell deals 2d6 hp negative energy damage and 2 points of Constitution damage upon each failed saving throw, as well as the target becoming [[Staggered|staggered]]. A successful saving throw results in 1d6 hp negative energy damage, no Constitution damage, and the target is [[Sickened|sickened]] for 1 round.

If the target dies during the duration of a mythic animate living skeleton it becomes an animated skeleton under control of the caster as per the *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]* spell.
