You bestow a small portion of the soul-energy of the animal kingdom on the creature touched, granting him some of an animal’s sensory capabilities. As an immediate action, the target creature can activate the *animal spirit*. While active, the spirit’s keen senses provide the recipient of the spell with low-light vision and scent, as well as a +2 insight bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks. The *animal spirit* remains active for 1 minute, and then its power is expended and the spell ends.

No creature can be the target of more than one *animal spirit* spell simultaneously. If a second is cast before the first has been discharged, the second spell dissipates to no effect.

*Essentia:* For every point of essentia you invest in this spell, the bonus on Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks provided by the spirit improves by 2.
