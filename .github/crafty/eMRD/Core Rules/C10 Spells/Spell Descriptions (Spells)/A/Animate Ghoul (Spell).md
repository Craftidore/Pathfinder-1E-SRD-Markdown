You raise one humanoid corpse as a [[Ghoul (Bestiary PF1)|ghoul]] under your control. As long as the corpse is a Medium humanoid, it rises as a standard [[Ghoul (Bestiary PF1)|ghoul]], regardless of any class levels, HD, or abilities it had in life. This spell can also be used on a Small humanoid to create a Small [[Ghoul (Bestiary PF1)|ghoul]]. If you are 11th level or higher, it can be used on the corpse of a Large humanoid to create a Large [[Ghoul (Bestiary PF1)|ghoul]]. If you are at least 13th level, this spell can be used to create a [[Ghoul (Bestiary PF1)|ghast]] instead, but the material component changes to an onyx gemstone worth at least 200 gp.

[[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Undead]] created by this spell are loyal to the caster, but are subject to the usual Hit Dice limit for the number of [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|undead]] that can be controlled (as per *[[Animate Dead (Spell)|animate dead]]*).
