This spell adds +20 to the break DC of the object and doubles its hardness and hit points. An *augmented* object also gains a saving throw against spells when unattended as if it were a magic item (save bonus equals 2 + half the caster level).

**GM Note**

*House Rule: Augment object* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

*House Rule:* A single object may only have one casting of *augment object* affecting it any time.

*House Rule:* An object that has been magically hardened (using either *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* or *[[Hardening, Greater (Spell)|greater hardening]]*) may be augmented using this spell; when this is done the doubling of the object's hardness and hit points is done to the increased hardness and hits.

*House Rule:* An object that has been hardened using this spell or either *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* or *[[Hardening, Greater (Spell)|greater hardening]]* prevents magical passage through it; such as *[[Passwall (Spell)|passwall]]*, *earthglide*, etc. unless a successful caster level check is made.
