You rip a supernatural ability of your choice away from one creature and transfer it to another. The two creatures must be within 30 feet of each other and remain conscious throughout the casting of the spell. In exchange for this new ability, the recipient permanently loses a supernatural ability it already possesses. If it has none to exchange, it instead loses two class levels (or 2 Hit Dice if it has no class levels).

Class features cannot be transferred by means of this spell. The spell fails if used to transfer an ability to a creature that lacks the proper body parts, size, or other criterion for its use, or if the target creature has fewer than 2 Hit Dice and no supernatural abilities to trade. Either subject may negate the transfer with a successful Fortitude save.
