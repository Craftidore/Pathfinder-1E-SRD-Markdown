*A thunderous rumble echoes from within you, Washing over cowed creatures and forcing them to show you respect*

Upon casting this spell, you radiate a magical aura that causes fearful creatures to shy away from harming you. While this spell is in effect, any creature within the spell's area that is [[Shaken|shaken]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or [[Panicked|panicked]] has its attitude toward you shifted to friendly. This effect ends for a given creature if the fear effect is removed, or if you or an ally attacks the creature or otherwise takes any hostile act toward it.

*Special:* A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks.
