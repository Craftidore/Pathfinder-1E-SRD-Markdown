*With a touch, you feel the bond between you and your companion grow stronger.*

The subject of the spell knows the direction and approximate (within 10%) distance he must travel to reach you, enabling him to find you under almost any circumstances. He might not know the best route, however, since the spell does not account for obstacles. The spell works at any distance and continues even if you die. If you travel to a different plane, or if either you or the target enters an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* or similar area, the spell is temporarily suppressed.
