# Awaken the Deep Magic (Spell)
## Overview
[[Universal Spells|Universal]]

**Level:** [[0 Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 0]], [[0 Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 0]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 1st-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 1]]

**Casting Time:** 1 full-round action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** An active ley line

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 124

You concentrate on pulling additional magical energy through a functioning ley line as a full-round action. The following round, make a DC 15 caster level check for a weak ley line or a DC 20 caster level check for a strong one. If you succeed, the weak line generates a new effect determined randomly from the Strong Ley Line table (*Deep Magic 43*) and a strong ley line subject to this spell generates a new effect randomly from the Titanic Ley Line table.

Once the ley line’s power is increased, you must concentrate each round to maintain the new level of power. If the concentration ends or when the cantrip’s duration expires, the ley line power immediately reverts to its prior level.

**Mythic:** If you expend one use of [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|mythic power]] and make a DC 25 caster level check, you may awaken additional resonances of a Titanic ley line. A Titanic line awakened through this spell shifts its power from the normal effect to any one Titanic power chosen by the caster.
