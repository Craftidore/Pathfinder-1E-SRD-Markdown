The caster opens a portal to one of the good-aligned outer planes and calls forth celestials to aid in battle against the most fearsome forces of evil. The spell takes place over a period of time. The first round, 2d4 avorals arrive. Two rounds later, a ghaele eladrin arrives to join the fight. Two rounds later, an astral deva arrives. Once these creatures appear, they serve the caster for the duration of the spell. The spell’s duration begins the instant the first celestials appear. At the end of the spell’s duration, all summoned celestials disappear at once.

The celestials only heed the summons if the caster is of good alignment and there are evil foes to fight. After their arrival, the celestials obey the caster explicitly and never attack her, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain control over the celestials. She can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

*Sacrifice:* 1 character level.
