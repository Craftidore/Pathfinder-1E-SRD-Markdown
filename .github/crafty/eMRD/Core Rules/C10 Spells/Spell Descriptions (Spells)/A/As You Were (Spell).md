By casting this spell and touching the target, you change the target’s appearance to what it was just before the creature died. The target looks, feels, and detects as a healthy, living creature, and it must eat, drink and sleep as a living creature does (although it requires only 2 hours sleep per night). The target can benefit from first aid and long-term care (see the [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] skill) but it also becomes susceptible to poisons (treat the target’s Constitution score as 0.)

The target is still destroyed when it reaches 0 hp. Positive energy still harms it, and negative energy heals it as is usual for undead. Any amount of positive energy damage, Constitution damage, or [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|energy drain]] immediately ends this spell.

This spell can also affect a corpse. In this case, treat as *[[Gentle Repose (Spell)|gentle repose]]*, except for the change of appearance. If this spell is cast on an intelligent undead, the target must be willing or it is entitled to a Will save.
