This spell turns normal water (or watery solutions) into a frothy substance that is as breathable as air. Both air-breathing and water-breathing creatures within the area can breathe normally.

Moving through *airy water* is easier than moving through normal water. Swimmers make a DC 10 [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] check once per round; they swim at their normal speed on a success, or half their normal speed on a failure. Creatures with a swim speed can simply use their swim speed without penalty. Creatures can instead use their land speed to move along the bottom at their normal speed. Creatures walking on the bottom do not pay any movement penalty for walking on sand, stone, or pebble seafloor and only pay 2 squares of movement per square of muck or mud entered (see Marine Dungeon Terrain in *Stormwrack* page 21).

Finally, *airy water* negates underwater combat penalties for all melee attacks, although ranged attacks still take the normal underwater penalty. 

The spell does not filter or purify solid particles, so casting *airy water* on very turbid liquids, for example, would produce an area filled with dust or smoke (and impose similar penalties).

*Material Component:* A small handful of alkaline salts.
