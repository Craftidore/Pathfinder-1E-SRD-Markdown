*“Stay together,” you shout, and intone the words of this spell, casting the crushed gemstone in the air at its conclusion. You are all bathed in a silver-green nimbus of light.*

You and all creatures within 10 feet of you gain evasion, but only against breath weapons. (If a breath weapon would normally allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a creature within an *aura of evasion* that successfully saves takes no damage instead.) Creatures within the spell’s area that already have evasion or improved evasion get a +4 bonus on Reflex saving throws against breath weapons.

*Material Component:* Powdered emerald worth 500 gp.
