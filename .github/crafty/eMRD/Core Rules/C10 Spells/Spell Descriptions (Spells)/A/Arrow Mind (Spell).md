*The bow in your hand feels more like an extension of your body as you complete the spell*—*as if it’s become a part of your arm. Creatures nearby seem sharper to your eyes, more in focus.*

While this spell is in effect and you are wielding a projectile weapon that fires arrows, such as a longbow or shortbow, you threaten all squares within your normal melee reach (5 feet if Small or Medium, 10 feet if Large) with your bow, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity with arrows shot from the bow. In addition, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you shoot a bow while you are in another creature’s threatened square.

*Material Component:* A flint arrowhead.
