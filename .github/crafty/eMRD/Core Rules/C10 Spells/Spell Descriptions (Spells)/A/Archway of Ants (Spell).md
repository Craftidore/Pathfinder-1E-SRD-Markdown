You summon a swarm of non-stinging insects (ants are traditional) that cannot be used to attack, but sacrifice themselves to build a structure such as a bridge, wall, or even a ladder or stairs from one point to another, including between two structures or over empty air, gorges, water, etc. Due to the light-weight nature of the ants, the archway may be moved, but it cannot change shape once built. The archway supports only 10Ã— the maximum encumbrance of the caster; if a single pound more is taken onto the bridge, it crumbles. The archway has AC 5 and the same amount of hp as the caster.
