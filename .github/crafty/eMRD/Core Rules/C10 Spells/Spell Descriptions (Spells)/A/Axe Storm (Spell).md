A roiling, clanking cloud appears and rains axes down on all creatures in the designated area. The axes deal 4d6 hp slashing damage to each creature in the area, and they bypass [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|damage reduction]] as if they were magical, silver weapons. By using as this spellâ€™s material component replica axes crafted from different [[Special Materials|special materials]] other than silver (which increases the total material component cost), your axes bypass damage resistance or hardness per the special material. As a move action, you can direct the *axe storm* to move 60 ft. before it rains more axes down on its victims.

The axes conjured by the *axe storm* remain until the spell ends.
