You can tell whether an area contains a planar touchstone. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the location of any touchstone in the area. Once you find a touchstone, you can study it. (If you find more than one touchstone—an extremely rare occurrence—you can study only one at a time.)

Each round you study a touchstone, you can discover one property of the touchstone, in this order:

- The base ability gained by someone who takes the Planar Touchstone feat related to the site.
- Any conditions that must be met in order to recharge the higher-order ability granted by the site.
- The higher-order ability gained by someone who visits the touchstone and fulfills the recharge condition.
- The number of uses of the higher-order ability that the character gains from visiting the site and fulfi lling the recharge condition.

For each of these properties, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. If you fail, you can try again in the next round.

*Material Components*: A crystal lens, a drop of ink, and a piece of paper or parchment.
