You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.

A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creatureâ€™s Dexterity score by 4 points. 

*Antipathy* counters and dispels *[[Sympathy (Spell)|sympathy]]*.

**Mythic Rule**

You can choose an additional number of alignments or specific kinds of creatures equal to half your mythic tier to affect with this spell. Alternatively, you can select a single creature type (and subtype, if a humanoid or outsider); *mythic antipathy* affects all creatures of that type (or subtype). A creature failing its saving throw but forced to remain in the area or adjacent to the object becomes [[Sickened|sickened]] and [[Shaken|shaken]] for as long as it remains there, even if normally immune to those conditions. *Mythic antipathy* cannot be dispelled by a non-mythic effect unless the caster level of the dispelling caster equals or exceeds yours.

**GM Note**

Added emotion descriptor per *Ultimate Magic*.
