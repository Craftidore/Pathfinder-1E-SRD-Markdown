You set up a contingency with your armor, so that if a predetermined event (such as a specific word or gesture from you as a free action) takes place during the duration, the armor appears on you, fully donned and prepared. The armor must be within one mile per level for this spell to function, and it cannot bring anything else with it. For example, you cannot attach your weapon to your armor and expect that to appear with the armor. A shield cannot be prepared with this contingency, only a suit of armor.

An obvious contingency event might be, “If I am attacked.”

**GM Note**

This spell counts as a contingent spell for purposes of how many contingent spells a character may have in effect.
