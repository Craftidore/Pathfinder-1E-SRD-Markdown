*You feel an instant of searing pain from your back, which swiftly fades into a sensation of ultimate freedom. You sprout a pair of dull gleaming wings made of overlapping feathers of dark metal.*

You grow a pair of [[Adamantine|adamantine]] wings. The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability.

If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons). Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19â€“20. The wings are considered both magic and [[Adamantine|adamantine]] for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness. Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action.

As a swift action, you can choose to launch the [[Adamantine|adamantine]] feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades. This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst. All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies). Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone. This action immediately ends the spell's duration.

**GM NOTE**

*House Rule:* When not flying, the wings provide a +3 shield bonus to AC.

*Spell Secret:* A successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 35) changes the slashing damage modifier from strength to the caster's primary casting attribute modifier.
