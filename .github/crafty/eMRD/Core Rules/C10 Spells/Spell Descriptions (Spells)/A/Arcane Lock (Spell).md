An *arcane lock* spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own *arcane lock* without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell does not remove an *arcane lock;* it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.

**Mythic Rule**

Add your mythic tier to the DC of any lock present on the object; if the object has no lock, it can be opened with a DC 30 Strength check or DC 30 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check. If a creature tries and fails to open a door warded with this spell, that creature takes 2d6 points of magical force damage (Reflex negates). This damage is subject to spell resistance.
