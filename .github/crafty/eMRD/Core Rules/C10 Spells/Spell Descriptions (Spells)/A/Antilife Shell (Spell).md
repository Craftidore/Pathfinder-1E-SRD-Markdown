You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures. The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants,humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.

This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

**Mythic Rule**

You may add your mythic tier to caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of non-mythic creatures seeking to enter a *mythic antilife shell*. Even if you fail to overcome their spell resistance, any living creature other than you (and your familiar or animal companion) beginning its turn within a *mythic antilife shell* takes damage equal to your mythic tier (no save). Non-mythic creatures take double damage.
