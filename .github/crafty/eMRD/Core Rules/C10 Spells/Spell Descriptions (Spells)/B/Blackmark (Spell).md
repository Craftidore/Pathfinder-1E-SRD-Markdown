You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark’s exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The *black mark* functions as a *[[Mark of Justice (Spell)|mark of justice]]*, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes [[Shaken|shaken]] anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the *black mark* is active, the target is affected as if subject to *[[Nature's Exile (Spell)|nature’s exile]]*, but all creatures with the aquatic or [[S3.3 - Creature Subtypes (Bestiary 6 Apx)|water subtype]] or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|animal]] type, though nonaquatic animals are not.
