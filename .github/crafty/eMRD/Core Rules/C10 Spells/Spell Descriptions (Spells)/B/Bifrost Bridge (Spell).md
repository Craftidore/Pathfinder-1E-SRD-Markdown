This spell causes an anchored bridge of solid crystal to form, stretching from two areas indicated during the casting (both of which must be in range of the spell) to join in the center. The bridge cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. It can join two areas of differing heights, as long as the bridge does not climb or descend at an anagle of more than 45 degrees (in other words, the vertical distance cannot exceed the horizontal distance between its anchor points.

The *bifrost bridge* is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. It can support up to 1,000 pounds of weight per inch of thickness. If the weight limit is exceeded, the bridge instantly crumbles into a fine white powder and vanishes in 1 round. Each 5-foot square of the bridge has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the bridge automatically, but it has hardness 5. If any part of the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, the entire *bifrost bridge* collapses.

*Material Components:* A rectangular piece of quartz.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** This spell is sometimes known as *Billim's Bifrost Bridge*.
