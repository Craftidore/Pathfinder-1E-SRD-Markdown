*As you cast the spell, a large black tear in the universe appears in the form of a crackling ebony sword made of the material of the planes. The blade flies off at your mental command to destroy your foes.*

You create a black blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long. The blade strikes at any creature within its range, as you desire, starting the round you cast the spell. The blade makes a melee touch attack against its designated target once each round. Its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively).

Anything hit by the blade is disintegrated if it fails a Fortitude save, taking 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6), or 5d6 points of damage if the saving throw is successful. The blade can pass through any magical barrier equal to or less than its spell level, but cannot penetrate dead magic areas or an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**.* It can harm ethereal and incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect.

The blade always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends. You can direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action.

A *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* spell can be used to counterspell a *black blade of disaster*. A *[[Dimensional Anchor (Spell)|dimensional anchor]]* spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**,* a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]*, or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]* can affect it. Its touch attack AC is 13.
