You create a chain of force that whirls into a loop around a single creature of your choice, making a metallic rattling sound as it does so. The chain creates an oscillating ring surrounding the target at a distance of 5 feet (so all squares adjacent to the target creature are within the chain). If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates harmlessly. Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the following effects:

The target creature cannot leave the area defined by the chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they must succeed on a DC 15 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check or a DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (v3.5 Tumble) check to slip past the chain). If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid floor on which to stand.

The chain prevents the target from changing form, including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]* or similar effects.

The chain acts as a *[[Dimensional Anchor (Spell)|dimensional anchor]]* upon the target.

The chain deals 2d6 points of force damage per round to the target.

No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. This means that the target cannot use any magic, and no magic from outside the chain affects the creature.

The chain cannot be dispelled, but it is automatically destroyed by *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]]* (v3.5 *Mordenkainen’s disjunction)*, or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added force descriptor to spell.
