You change yourself into a behir. Your type changes to magical beast. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a behir but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the behir’s bite damage, Armor Class, speed, breath weapon, constrict ability, improved grab, rake, swallow whole ability, immunity to trips, darkvision, immunity to electricity, low-light vision, and scent. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the behir’s feats and racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You can speak, cast spells, and use disciplines in behir form.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *behir’s form*, but it is nonfunctional.
