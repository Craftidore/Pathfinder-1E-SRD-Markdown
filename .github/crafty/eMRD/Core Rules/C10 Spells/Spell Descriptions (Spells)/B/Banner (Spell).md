A simplified form of *[[Minor Image (Spell)|minor image]]*, it allows you to cause a banner (such as a battle standard, family crest, or other identifying device) to appear anywhere within range, accompanied by musical fanfare or the sound of a horn blowing. The banner may appear large or small (up to 10 feet square), new or old, clean or dirty, and of any color or pattern you desire and bearing any identifying images you desire. The banner sheds light as a *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell. You can move it anywhere within range as a move-equivalent action. The fanfare or horn is normally of the sort announcing the presence of an important person or a military unit, although the spell can create any sort of horn signal. Normally, casters use the spell to rally troops or direct people to a particular location, especially at night when its light aspect becomes more useful.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Alustriel's banner* to *banner* for campaign continuity.
