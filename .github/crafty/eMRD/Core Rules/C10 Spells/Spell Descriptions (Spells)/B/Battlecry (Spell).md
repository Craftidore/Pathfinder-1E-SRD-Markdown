*Your bold shout bolsters the resolve of your allies.*

When you cast *battlecry,* you and your allies gain a burst of confidence and combat prowess. The next single attack made by any affected creature gains a +5 morale bonus on the damage roll, provided the attack is made before the end of your next turn. This bonus applies only to a single attack.

In addition, any ally who is currently under a charm, compulsion, or fear effect can attempt a new save against that effect with a +2 morale bonus.

*Battlecry* also extends by 3 rounds the duration of inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics bardic music effects currently affecting any ally. If an ally is under the effect of more than one of these, all durations are extended.
