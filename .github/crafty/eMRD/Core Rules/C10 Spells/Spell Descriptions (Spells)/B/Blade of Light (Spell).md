This spell infuses a weapon with pure sunlight (the weapon need not be a bladed weapon). A weapon enhanced by this spell sheds light as if *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* had been cast on it. It functions as a magic and good weapon for the purposes of overcoming [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|damage reduction]]. The weapon grants a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls against [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|undead]] and deals +1d6 points of damage on a successful hit against such foes; against [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|incorporeal]] [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|undead]], it functions as if it had the *[[Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)|ghost touch]]* weapon special ability. The weapon automatically confirms critical hits against foes that are vulnerable to sunlight.
