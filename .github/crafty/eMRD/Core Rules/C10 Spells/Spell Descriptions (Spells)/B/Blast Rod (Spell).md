You store energy within a rod, then unleash it in rays of destructive power. The *blast rod* can deal a total of 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), either focused into a single blast or divided up among multiple blasts.

To use the rod, you designate how many dice of damage you wish to release, then make a ranged touch attack as a standard action against any target within 60 feet. Regardless of whether the attack hits or not, the damage dice you specified are subtracted from the total stored in the rod.

*Focus:* The rod to be infused.
