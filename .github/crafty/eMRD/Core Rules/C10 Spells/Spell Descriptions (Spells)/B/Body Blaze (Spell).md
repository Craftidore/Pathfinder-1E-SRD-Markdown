You are surrounded in flame, which does not harm you or your equipment. When you move, you leave a vertical trail of flame in your wake. The sheet of flame left behind you is up to 20 feet high, 2 inches wide, and lengthens as you move, exactly following the path you take across a horizontal surfaceâ€”you leave no trail on vertical surfaces or through the air because the sheet of flame must be anchored on a horizontal surface.

The blazing wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. If you pass through a square more than once, the damage dealt by the wall to creatures moving through that square does not increase. You take no damage from your own blazing wall.

If you overrun a creature or otherwise manage to pass through its square, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that section goes out.
