You create a strong blast of arctic air that originates from your fingertips and moves in the direction you are facing. As a stronger form of *gust of wind,* this boreal wind automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar protected or unprotected flames, including lanterns. Large fires (such as bonfires, a blacksmith’s coals, or even a house fire) have a 50% chance to be extinguished by the *boreal wind.* Forest or grassland fires are too large to be extinguished by this spell.

All creatures caught in the area take 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the gust’s effects. Those that fail the save are pushed away from the caster a distance of 3 feet per caster level. Creatures that remain in the area past the first round must make an additional saving throw each round.

A *boreal wind* can do anything a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, overturn tents and blow down small huts, scuttle a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of the range.

The wind can change direction if you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely blows in the same direction.
