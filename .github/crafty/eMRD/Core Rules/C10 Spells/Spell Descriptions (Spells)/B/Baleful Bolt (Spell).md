You conjure a black bolt of dark energy that begins at your fingertips and crackles out to the maximum range. The bolt deals temporary Constitution damage and temporary Strength damage to each creature within its area, each equal to 1d3 points +1 per 4 caster levels (maximum 1d3+3). Lost ability score points are recovered normally at the rate of 1 point per day.

Constitution loss also causes a reduction in hit points by lowering the victimâ€™s Constitution modifier. (Creatures cannot be reduced to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die by Constitution loss.) This hit-point loss may be fatal to a creature already injured, even if the Constitution loss alone does not kill it. Creatures without Strength scores or Constitution scores are unaffected by this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Sinsabur's baleful bolt* to *baleful bolt* for campaign continuity.
