When you drink this extract, your mind shatters and partitions itself into multiple personalities, some of which are less than sane.

For the duration of the extract, you gain a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. You are also immune to attempts to read your mind or detect your alignment. Attempts to do so via spells such as *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* result only in hearing an endless stream of insane tittering and giggling. Spells such as *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]/good* detect only chaotic and indecipherable auras.

While under the influence of this extract, you suffer from a tendency to laugh inappropriately and argue with yourself. As a result, you suffer a –5 penalty to [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks and –2 penalty to Intelligence-based skill checks.
