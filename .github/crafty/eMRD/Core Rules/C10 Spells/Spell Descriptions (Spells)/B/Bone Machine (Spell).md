This spell transforms all metal in a contruct’s body into bone. Though easily mistaken for a skeleton, it is not [[S3.2 - Creature Types (Bestiary 6 Apx)|undead]], and it retains all statistics and abilities with the exception of any natural armor bonus. Bone’s relative lightness grants the construct several enhancement bonuses. While the spell is in effect, the construct’s land speed is doubled and it gains a +10 bonus to [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks as well as to [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks made for jumps or falls.
