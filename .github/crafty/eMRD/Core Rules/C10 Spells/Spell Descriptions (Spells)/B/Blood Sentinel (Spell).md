# Blood Sentinel (Spell)
## Overview
[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**Level:** [[3rd Level Alchemist Spells|Alchemist 3]], [[3rd Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 3]], [[3rd Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 3]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 5th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 5]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a life-sized animal sculpture of a familiar made of clay, cloth, stone, or wood, plus mandrake root worth 25 gp)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One animal sculpture

**Duration:** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No (harmless)

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 176

After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the [[Alertness (Feat)|Alertness]] feat or the special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinelâ€™s body becomes a destroyed statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood sentinel.
