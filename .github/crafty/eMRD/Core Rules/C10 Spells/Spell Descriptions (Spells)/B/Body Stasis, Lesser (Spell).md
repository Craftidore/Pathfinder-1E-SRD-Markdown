The subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being [[Dazzled|dazzled]] or [[Deafened|deafened]].

Subjects of this spell are never [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]], regardless of whether they are [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] when the spell is cast.

This spell also prevents all Strength and Dexterity damage received during its duration. Existing damage to these ability scores are unaffected by this spell.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
