*A halo of blue fire flares around the target’s head, which transforms into the head of an arachnid. As the light fades, two oversized claws explode from the target’s torso, snapping and clawing at the air.*

You infuse a target with the essence of a bebilith, causing it to gain the mandibles and claws of this demon. The target gains two primary claw attacks (in addition to its normal claw attacks, if any) and a secondary bite attack (replacing its normal bite attack). The claws deal 1d6 points of damage, and the bite deals 1d8 points (assuming Medium size). If it is wielding a weapon, the target can attack with either a single claw or a bite as a secondary attack. 

The target can sunder objects with its claw attacks as if it had the [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]] feat.

The target’s bite attack carries a poison (injury; Fort save equal to the spell’s save DC; 1d6 Con/2d6 Con).

The target of this spell is also treated as an outsider of the evil subtype in addition to its normal type and subtypes.
