This spell creates an area of black sand (*Sandstorm* 20), infused with shadowstuff and negative energy. A region of black sand literally swallows light, emitting magical darkness rising to a height of 20 feet over the surface. Creatures that come in contact with the sand take 1d4 points of damage per round from negative energy (no save). Those reduced to 0 hit points crumble into black sand themselves. Creatures can make Reflex saves to avoid being caught in the area upon which the spell is first cast. Only the surface of the sand is affected by the spell, so creatures burrowing beneath an area of black sand are unaffected unless they break its surface. Creatures that do so immediately take damage from the spell.

*Black sand* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
