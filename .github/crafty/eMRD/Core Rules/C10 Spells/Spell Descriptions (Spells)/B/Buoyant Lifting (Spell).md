You command the water supporting or surrounding a swimming or floating creature or object to rise and hold the creature above the surface of the water. An object so lifted may contain creatures or other objects (for example, a boat). The creature must be willing to be lifted in this manner, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The spell causes a smooth wave of water to rise under the subject and hold it 20 feet above the rest of the water's surface. If obstructions prevent the subject from being raised that high (such as being in a cave with a low ceiling), the wave lifts the subject until it touches the obstruction. The subject is otherwise resting at the top of this wave (rescuing it from drowning if it was a sinking air-breather) and can swim away under its own power or be moved by others (such as with a rope). If the subject is removed from the wave, it collapses gently and the spell ends.
