This spell changes the appearance of the affected creature so that it better blends in with its surroundings. As chosen by you, the affected creature takes on the appearance of a statue, furniture, a tree, a bush, a rock, or another object of similar size. As long as the target stays still, it gains a +20 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks, and it can use [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] even if it is being observed. The target’s armor blends in perfectly with the illusory shape, and the target’s armor check penalty on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks is negated for the duration of the spell. If the target moves at all while this spell is in effect, the spell ends.
