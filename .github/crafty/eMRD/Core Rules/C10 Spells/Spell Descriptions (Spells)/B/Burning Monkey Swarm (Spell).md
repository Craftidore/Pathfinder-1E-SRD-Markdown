You summon a shadowy, quasi-real swarm of monkeys (Pathfinder Bestiary 2). These creatures appear as a howling mass of primates and flames, and the entire swarm is burning for the duration of the spell. The illusory flames cause no damage to the monkeys despite their screaming and chattering. The swarm appears on your turn and understands and obeys your commands.

The [[Primate, Monkey Swarm (Bestiary 2 PF1)|monkey swarm]] deals three-fifths (60%) of normal damage to disbelievers, and non-damaging effects are 60% likely to work against disbelievers. The monkeys attack as a normal [[Primate, Monkey Swarm (Bestiary 2 PF1)|monkey swarm]] but cause a further 1d6 hp fire damage in melee. The save DC for distraction is increased to 18.

Characters within 30 ft. of the screaming swarm must make a Will save each round or be [[Confused|confused]] (as the condition). Once the saving throw is made, the character is no longer susceptible to the [[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]] effects.
