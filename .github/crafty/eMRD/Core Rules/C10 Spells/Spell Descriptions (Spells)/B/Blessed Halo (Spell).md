This spell surrounds your head with a nimbus of golden light. The halo gives off light equivalent to a *[[Continual Flame (Spell)|continual flame]]* spell, and temporarily represses any darkness effect, even those of higher level, within the radius of its own light.

While the halo is in effect, you gain [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|fast healing]] 1. This ability increases by 1 for every three additional levels above 7th ([[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|fast healing]] 2 at 10th, 3 at 13th, etc., to a maximum of 5 at 19th level.) Any cure spells you cast while the *blessed halo* is active heal 1 extra hp per die. Finally, good-aligned creatures are impressed with your bearing and demeanor and you gain a +4 sacred bonus to all Charisma-based checks towards such creatures for the duration of the spell.
