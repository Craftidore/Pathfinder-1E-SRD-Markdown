This spell inscribes an object with protection, setting a guardian in a similar way to a* [[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]]* spell. When casting the spell, a faint trace of a pair of [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] claws or a [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] maw is etched into the object. These images vanish when the spell is complete.

The caster chooses the conditions of the *bestial lure* when casting. The lure always leaves a scent, which can be identified with a DC 15 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check by those who have the scent ability. This scent hangs within 120 ft. of the lure, and [[Rakshasa (Bestiary PF1)|rakshasas]] often use it to lure prey. The scent of any available creature can be used.

Typically, any creature passing through the area guarded by the lure or opening or using the object protected by the lure triggers it unless a set password is spoken or an object immediately shown.

Triggering the *bestial lure* conjures a phantasmal [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] (see Pathfinder Bestiary for base stats), which attacks for 1 round/level of the caster. Unlike most illusory creatures, though, the [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] is imbued with the power of [[Rakshasa (Bestiary PF1)|rakshasas]] and deals full damage. If you are 9th level or above, the phantasmal [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] summoned is a dire [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] and deals full damage. The summoned shadow creature must remain within 60 ft. of the lure.

The phantasmal creature summoned can be partially disbelieved as a standard shadow illusion spell to avoid damage. A creature that succeeds its saving throw sees the [[Tiger (Bestiary PF1)|tiger]] as a transparent image superimposed on a vague outline of the object.
