Immediately upon casting this spell, and once per round thereafter, you may shoot a 10-ft.-long line of boiling-hot blood from your eyes as a swift action. The blood deals damage equal to 1d6+1 hp per 2 caster levels. Each time you fire a stream of blood, you take 1 hp damage. You cannot use this spell if it would drop your hp to 0; if you try to do so, the spell simply ends.

If you have divine blood (you are a demigod, an outsider with 20 or more HD, or have godling class levels from Super Genius Games’ The Genius Guide to the Godling), targets damaged by this spell are also [[Dazzled|dazzled]] for the spell’s duration.

**Mythic:** Once per casting of the spell you may fire a line of blood that is 5 ft. long per caster level.
