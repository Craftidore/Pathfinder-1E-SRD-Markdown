*You point the shard of carved ram’s horn at your foe and snap off the last words of the spell. An invisible wedge of force slams into the creature’s midsection, doubling it over and driving it back.*

You create a ramlike force that can strike with considerable power. The force can target a creature or an object. The force deals 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the subject is a creature, this attack initiates a bull rush (as a Medium creature with Strength 30, for a +10 bonus on the bull rush attempt). If the subject is a movable object, such as a door, you can make a Strength check (with a +10 bonus) to attempt to force open the door.

*Focus:* A piece of carved ram’s horn.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is sometimes known as *disarm.*
