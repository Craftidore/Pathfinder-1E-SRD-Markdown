You emanate vibrations that draw the eyes of nearby creatures toward a strange, unknown dimension that exists behind the fabric of reality. All living creatures that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 ft. of you must make a Will save, even if they have previously made a successful save against the effect.

Creatures that fail any Will saves required by this spell are [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Fascinated|fascinated]], and [[Blinded|blinded]]. Their eyes vanish from front to back, leaving empty eye sockets as they turn their gaze to the maddening geometry of the alternate dimension. Neither allies nor potential threats can shake a victim free of the spellâ€™s effects. Taking any amount of damage ends this spell and its effects.
