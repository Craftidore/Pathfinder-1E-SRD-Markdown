# Breath of Veles (Spell)

[[Transmutation Spells|Transmutation]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 19th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 19]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Area:** Cone-shaped burst

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude: Partial (see text)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

**Source:** Deep Magic (Kobold Press), pg. 136

You exhale a breath of oblivion. Each creature and object in the area is subject to a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell that deals 2d6 hp of damage/2 caster levels (maximum 20d6). Like *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, a successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to 5d6 hp.

When an object is in the coneâ€™s path, *breath of Veles* simply disintegrates as much as a 30-ft. cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as *[[Forceful Hand (Spell)|forceful hand]]* or a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, but not magical effects such as a *[[Globe of Invulnerability (Spell)|globe of invulnerability]]* or an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*.
