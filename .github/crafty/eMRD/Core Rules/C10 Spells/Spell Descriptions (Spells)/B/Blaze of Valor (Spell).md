You envelop yourself in a red-gold aura that shines like bright, fiercely raging flames (but isn’t hot or aflame and can ignite nothing). This *blaze of valor* increases your Charisma by 4+1d4 points. All allied creatures that can see you lose all fear and shake off all fear-based effects (and they cannot feel fear while the spell lasts). They stop fleeing if they are retreating, and they rally to you (move toward you, if not prevented from doing so).

Wounded allies regain 2 hp, and unwounded allies are refreshed (regain all lost Strength and Constitution) and heartened. Whenever you speak a command while imbued with *blaze of valor*, it carries to the ears of all who can see you (even if it’s whispered), and allies obey you without hesitation unless they save versus the spell.
