This spell must be cast on a snow field. That snow field instantly freezes, impeding movement through the area. A creature caught within the area can move only at half its normal speed. By making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check, the creature can move at its normal speed for that round. A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not impeded.
