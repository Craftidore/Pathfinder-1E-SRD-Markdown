*You cast the spell and lay your hand upon your ally, and beneath your glowing fingers, give him a mixed gift*—*the ability to fight on, but at the cost of not knowing when to stop.*

The subject becomes such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while [[Disabled|disabled]] or [[Dying|dying]]. While between –1 and –9 hit points, the creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. If the creature is reduced to –10 hit points, it dies normally.
