You animate a touched melee weapon that a dead creature has recently used in battle.

The weapon leaps into the air and fights beside you or an ally with 30 ft. The weapon has an attack bonus equal to your caster level. The weapon’s normal bonuses also apply. The weapon fights for 1 round per your caster level or until the effect is dispelled, at which point it drops to the ground.

The weapon shares the same space as the creature it fights beside and never leaves, not even if magically moved. If the item is forced to leave the creature’s square for any reason, the spell ends. If spells or maneuvers are used against the weapon, treat it as if you wield it.

**Mythic:** Add your mythic tier to your caster level to determine the weapon’s attack bonus. Furthermore, each round the spell is active, you can instruct the weapon to fight beside another creature within your line of sight as a free action, but you can only change targets once per round.
