*With a word, the indicated weapon glows with a soft blue-white halo that emits a low, slowly pulsating hum. The faint smell of ozone permeates the air.*

You transform a single melee weapon, natural weapon, thrown weapon, or group of projectiles into a weapon with the *[[Brilliant Energy (MagWpnSpcAb)|brilliant energy]]* special ability. If this spell is cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.
