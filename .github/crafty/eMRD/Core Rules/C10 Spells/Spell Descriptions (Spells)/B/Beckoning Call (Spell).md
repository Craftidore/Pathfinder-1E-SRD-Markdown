*With a word and a gesture, you draw the targeted creature toward you.*

The subject becomes overwhelmed with the desire to be near you. It remains aware of its surroundings and breathes normally, but it must take any actions it can to reach a square adjacent to you if it is not already by your side. The subject must take at least one move action each round and can activate spells or use abilities only if doing so brings it physically closer to your position. It avoids obvious danger where it can, but if given no other choice, it takes the least dangerous route to reach your side. If prevented from reaching you, the subject can do nothing but stand motionless and watch you in despair. Each round at the end of its turn, regardless of whether it reaches you or not, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.

Once the subject reaches a square adjacent to your space, it stands motionless and can take no actions. If you move, it moves to follow you. The subject is considered fl at-footed against you, but if you take any obvious hostile actions against it, the spell ends at the start of its next turn. Thus, you could use this spell to lure a creature to your side and gain a roundâ€™s worth of sneak attacks against it before it came to its senses.
