A *bow spirit* is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the *bow spirit* lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the *bow spirit* to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the *bow spirit* were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The *bow spirit uses* your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses. A *bow spirit*’s attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available for the *bow spirit* to use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you.

A *bow spirit* occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]*, a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]*, or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]* affects it. A *bow spirit*’s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
