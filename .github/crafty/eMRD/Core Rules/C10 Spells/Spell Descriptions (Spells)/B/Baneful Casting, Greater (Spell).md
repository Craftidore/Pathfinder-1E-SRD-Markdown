The unfortunate recipient of this spell suffers from a magical backlash when he or she attempts to cast a spell. Unlike *baneful casting* this backlash can interfere with the casting of spells (roll backlash damage, to successfully cast the caster must make a Concentration check DC 10 + level of the spell being attempted + damage taken) with the caster suffering damage equal to 1d6/level of the spell cast.
