With this spell you can touch a book or scroll and absorb the knowledge contained within as if you had just read it. This is equivalent to a solid reading but not deep study—the character does not gain perfect recall of the information, just whatever he would have gotten from reading it completely once. If you can’t read the language of the source, the spell has no effect. This spell cannot be used to prepare spells or to cast magical scrolls, nor does it have any effect when reading a magical book (such as a *tome of understanding*).
