*You toss the marble in the air, and it vanishes as you speak the words of the spell. A larger version of the marble, five feet across, appears in the hallway and bears down on your foe.*

You create a smoothly polished, 5-foot-diameter sphere of stone that moves under your control at a speed of 30 feet. A *stone sphere* has AC 5, hardness 8, and 500 hit points.

In the round when you cast the spell, the *stone sphere* appears at the spot you designate within the spellâ€™s range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the *stone sphere* in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a *stone sphere* in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action.

If you move a *stone sphere* into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage.

*Material Component:* A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter.
