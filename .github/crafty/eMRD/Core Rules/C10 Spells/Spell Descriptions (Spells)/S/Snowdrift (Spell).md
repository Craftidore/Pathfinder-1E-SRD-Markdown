You can form existing snow into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, you can make a snowbank for concealment, sculpt a snow statue or idol, open a tunnel in deep snow, or simply cover a set of tracks. *Snowdrift* also permits you to raise snowy barriers around a door or house to prevent vision in or out, or to clog a chimney with snow. Snow cannot be made into weapons with this spell, and *snowdrift* does not affect solid ice in any form.
