*A wreath of crackling energy encircles your body, twisting madly around you before sinking into your skin in an unsettling fashion.*

This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the primal forces of chaos. You gain a +5 competence bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks, as well on grapple checks to resist or escape a grapple. Your natural weapons are treated as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Regardless of your normal alignment, you are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of effects that rely on alignment (such as *[[Protection From Chaos (Spell)|protection from chaos]]* or *chaos hammer),* if *soul of anarchy* and *[[Soul of Light (Spell)|soul of light]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/evil or lawful. If *soul of anarchy* and *[[Soul of Shadow (Spell)|soul of shadow]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/good or lawful.

*Soul of anarchy* counters and dispels *[[Soul of Order (Spell)|soul of order]]**,* and vice versa.

*Special:* A chaotic-aligned dragon capable of casting 4th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
