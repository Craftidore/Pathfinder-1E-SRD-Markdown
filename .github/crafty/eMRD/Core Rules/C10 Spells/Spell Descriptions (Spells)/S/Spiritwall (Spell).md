*With a deep groan, as from a being subjected to eternal pain, you unleash the spell. An immobile, swirling mass of green-white forms resembling tortured spirits forms nearby. The mass continues the low groaning you uttered while casting the spell.*

One side of the wall, selected by you, emits a low groaning that causes creatures within 60 feet of that side to make a Will save or become [[Frightened|frightened]] and flee for 1d4 rounds. Any living creature that merely touches the wall takes 1d10 points of damage as its life force is disrupted. A living creature passing through the wall takes 1d10 points of damage, as above, and must make a Fortitude save or gain one negative level.

The barrier is semimaterial and opaque, providing cover and total concealment against physical attacks, and it blocks line of effect for magical effects (including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities).
