Certain elven bards of Kyonin are known for the restorative power of their performancesâ€”mostly as a result of this spell. You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell (although this spell is called *song of Kyonin*, the bardic performance need not be singing). As long as that performance continues, up to 3 creatures affected by the performance gain [[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|fast healing]] 2. When this bardic performance ends or you change to a different bardic performance, the [[Fast Healing (Grand Alchemical Discovery)|fast healing]] granted by this spell ends as well, but all creatures affected by this spell heal 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and are cured of any of the following conditions: [[Exhausted|exhausted]], [[Fatigued|fatigued]], [[Nauseated|nauseated]], [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Sickened|sickened]], or [[Stunned|stunned]].

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *song of Kyonin* to *song of healing* for campaign continuity.
