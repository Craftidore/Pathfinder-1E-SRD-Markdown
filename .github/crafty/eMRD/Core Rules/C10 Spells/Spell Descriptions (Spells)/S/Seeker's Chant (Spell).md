You gain a +1 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks while you utter this chant. However, you also incur a -2 penalty on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks as you must constantly intone the words of the chant while concentrating. The chant itself sounds rather like a children's rhyme and is spoken in a firm voice.

**GM Note**

**Lore:** An absentminded apprentice authored this spell to make up for his habit of misplacing things, helping him locate lost spellbooks, notes, and even his familiar. Sadly, the young wizardâ€™s later more advanced magical accomplishments were always eclipsed by the usefulness of this first creation.
