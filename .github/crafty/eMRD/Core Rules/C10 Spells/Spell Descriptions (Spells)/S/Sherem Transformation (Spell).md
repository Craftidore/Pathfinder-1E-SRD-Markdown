You enhance the abilities of an unborn human child, giving the child exceptional sorcerous ability (if female) or exceptional clarity of mind (if male). Upon reaching adulthood, the child may select the Kihu-Sherem Guardian or Sherem-Lar Sorcery feats.

While the spell affects an unborn child, it is targeted at the pregnant mother, who may resist the spell with a Will saving throw. If the mother is bearing multiple children, the spell randomly affects one of the unborn (in these cases, the spell is usually cast multiple times in order to affect all of them).

If the mother is from an unbroken line of sherem-lar sorcerers at least ten generations long, a female child born of this spell may choose the Sherezem-Lar Sorcery feat. This spell is normally used on only Bazareene nobles, and most nobles consider it a crime to use the spell on anyone but a noble. Conversely, most people outside of Bazareene consider magically altering an unborn child to be a repugnant act and would never allow it.

*Focus:* A flawless emerald worth at least 1,000 gp.

*Material Components:* Blood from a Bazareene sorcerer of at least 6th level, an iron ring that has touched lava, and three golden spheres worth 50 gp each.
