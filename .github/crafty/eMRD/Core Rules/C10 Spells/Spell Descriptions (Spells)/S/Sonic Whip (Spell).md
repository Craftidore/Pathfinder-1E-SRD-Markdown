*As you make a cracking sound and hold out your hand, the small silk whip within your grasp dissipates and a life-sized whip of hissing blue force appears in your grasp. With expert precision, you manage to make the invisible whip in your hand crack.*

This spell creates a whip of sonic energy that you wield as if you had proficiency with it. Simply cracking a *sonic whip* as a free action keeps normal animals (but not dire animals, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits. On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become [[Frightened|frightened]].

Against other creature types, you can use a *sonic whip* in combat as if it were a normal whip.
