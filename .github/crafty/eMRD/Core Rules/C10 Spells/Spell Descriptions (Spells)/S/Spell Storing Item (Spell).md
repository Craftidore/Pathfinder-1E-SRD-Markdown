This infusion allows you to place a spell effect into an item to draw it forth later, at your command. The item becomes, in effect, a wand with a single charge, which only you can use.

You can imbue any spell of 4th level or lower into the item, as long as its spell level is no greater than one-half your artifi cer level. Your artificer level is the spell’s caster level. You must make a successful [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 20 + \[spell level × 3]) to emulate the spell and store it in the item. If you fail this check by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. The DM determines the result of a mishap, as with scroll mishaps. As a default, either the spell is activated immediately instead of being placed in the item, affecting you if possible, or the spell erupts in a burst of uncontrolled energy, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you.

A single item can carry only one spell at a time.

You must provide any expensive material components or XP component the spell requires at the time you imbue it into the item. You must provide any focus the spell requires at the time you cast it from the item.

*XP Cost:* Your caster level × the spell level. For example, to place a *[[Scorching Ray (Spell)|scorching ray]]* spell in an item, you must spend XP equal to your caster level × 2.
