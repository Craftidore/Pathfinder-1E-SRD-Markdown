*You slide your finger over a coin, imbuing it with a tiny fraction of your own senses.*

You imbue a Fine object (such as a coin, stone, or other innocuous item) with a dormant magical scrying sensor. Anyone attempting to detect its magical aura must succeed on a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level).

At any one time during the spell’s duration, as a standard action you can concentrate upon the object, enabling you to hear or see (your choice) as if you were in the object’s location. This effect otherwise functions as if you had cast *[[Clairaudience_Clairvoyance (Spell)|clairaudience/clairvoyance]]* in the object’s area. You have no control over the object’s movement and gain no special senses. *Spymaster’s coin* functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

You must continue to concentrate to see or hear through the *spymaster’s coin*. If you stop concentrating, the spell’s effect ends. Once activated, the scrying effect of the spell lasts for a maximum number of rounds equal to your caster level.
