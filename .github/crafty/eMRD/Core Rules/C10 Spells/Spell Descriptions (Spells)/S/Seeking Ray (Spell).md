*A ray of electricity springs from your hand. It snakes around obstacles, cover, and other impediments on its way toward your target.*

You create a ray that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage if it strikes your target. While this ray requires a ranged touch attack to strike an opponent, it ignores concealment and cover (but not total concealment or total cover), and it does not take the standard penalty for

firing into melee.

In addition to the damage it deals, the ray creates a link of energy between you and the subject. If this ray struck the target and dealt damage, you gain a +4 bonus on attacks you make with ray spells (including another casting of this one, if desired) against the subject for 1 round per caster level. If you cast *seeking ray* a second time on a creature that is still linked to you from a previous casting, the duration of the new link overlaps (does not stack with) the remaining duration of the previous one.
