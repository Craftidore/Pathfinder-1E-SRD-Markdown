A *spell snare* takes advantage of an Eberron dragonshardâ€™s innate magical affinity, tuning the shard so that it readily absorbs the energy of a spell. The next spell or spell-like ability of 3rd level or lower that targets the bearer of the *spell snare* is absorbed into the dragonshard and has no effect. Only spells or spell-like abilities that affect a single target, or orb or ray spells directed at the bearer, can be absorbed. Once the *spell snare* has absorbed a spell, its magic expires and the dragonshard disintegrates. It requires no action to absorb a spell, but you must have the dragonshard in hand.

A *spell snare* does not discriminate between harmful or beneficial spells, and will just as readily absorb a *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* spell as *[[Vampiric Touch (Spell)|vampiric touch]]* (though a character could temporarily put away or set aside the *spell snare* to receive a benefi cial spell).

A character can only benefit from one *spell snare* at any given time. If more than one affected shard is carried, they will all activate (and be destroyed) by the fi rst spell to target the bearer.

*Material Component:* An Eberron dragonshard worth at least 25 gp. Unlike most material components, the dragonshard is consumed when the *spell snare* effect functions, not when the spell is cast.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In non-Eberron campaigns, a burned out, gray ioun stone is used as the material components for this spell.
