*Your stomach growls as you near completion of the spell. As you declare the target of the spell, your hunger disappears, but you note with satisfaction that your target seems wracked with pain.*

You inflict wracking hunger pangs on the target creature. It must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and become [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. A creature that makes a successful save takes half damage and is not [[Fatigued|fatigued]] by the spell.

A [[Fatigued|fatigued]] creature becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]] when doing anything that causes the creature to become [[Fatigued|fatigued]] (such as dangerous environmental temperatures or ending a barbarian rage). A [[Fatigued|fatigued]] creature that fails its saving throw against *starvation* takes nonlethal damage as normal and becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]].
