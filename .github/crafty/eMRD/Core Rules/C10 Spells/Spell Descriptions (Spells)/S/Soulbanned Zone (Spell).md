# Soulbanned Zone (Spell)
## Overview
[[Abjuration Spells|Abjuration]]

**Level:** [[8th Level Sorcerer Spells|Sorcerer 8]], [[8th Level Wizard Spells|Wizard 8]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 16th-Level Wizard Spells List|Wizard 16]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Area:** 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

**Duration:** 10 minutes/level (D)

**Saving Throw:** None

**Spell Resistance:** No

**Source:** Magic of Incarnum (Wotc), pg. 104

You create an immobile area within which no incarnum can be used. All soulmelds are suppressed within the soulbanned zone. Essentia cannot be invested or reallocated by any creature within the area; currently invested essentia has no effect inside the zone. Incarnum creatures are not otherwise affected by the soulbanned zone (they can enter normally).

Only creatures entirely within the soulbanned zone are affected. Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the soulbanned zone (or only partially within it), it can use its essentia incarnum-based abilities normally.
