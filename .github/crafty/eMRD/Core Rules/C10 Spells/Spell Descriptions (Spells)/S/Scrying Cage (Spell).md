This spell modifies the functioning of all divination spells and spell-like abilities into, out of, and within its area of effect, and it bars the functioning of all divination (scrying) spells into, out of, and within its area of effect.

If the spell is cast in an area adjoining or overlapping another *scrying cage*, the effects of both spells merge to create a single *scrying cage*. Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faerûn, is believed to have been enclosed within the largest scrying cage in existence in the Realms by means of this combinatorial effect.

When this spell is cast within, into, or out of a *scrying cage*, divination (scrying) spells simply fail to work and the spell is wasted. Other divination spells cannot bypass any continuous physical barrier, such as a wall, ceiling or floor. Such spells can pass through any aperture, even one as small as a keyhole.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's scrying cage* to *scrying cage* for campaign continuity.

In the Forgotten Realms of Toril, this spell is known as *Halaster’s scrying cage*.
