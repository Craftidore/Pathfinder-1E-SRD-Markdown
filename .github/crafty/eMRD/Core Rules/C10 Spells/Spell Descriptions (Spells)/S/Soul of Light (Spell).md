*Bright, clear light sprouts from your body, quickly flaring before fading to a faint white pulse.*

This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the Positive Energy Plane, making it easier to repair injuries. Whenever you cast or are the target of a conjuration (healing) spell, you can choose for the spell to heal a number of extra points of damage equal to twice the spell's level. It such a spell heals at least 10 points of damage, it also removes the [[Fatigued|fatigued]] condition from the target (or reduces exhaustion to fatigue).

If *soul of light* and *[[Soul of Anarchy (Spell)|soul of anarchy]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/evil or lawful. If *soul of light* and *[[Soul of Order (Spell)|soul of order]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/chaotic or evil.

*Soul of light* counters and dispels *[[Soul of Shadow (Spell)|soul of shadow]]**,* and vice versa.

*Special*: A good-aligned dragon capable of casting 5th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
