When you cast this spell, your snake tattoos (the spellâ€™s focus) transform into real poisonous snakes that fly from you to the target or targets you select, striking like darts. The snakes always hit, dealing 3d6 points of damage each. The poison each snake carries deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage immediately and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of ability damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save.

After striking the targets, the living snakes fly back to you and must be swallowed before you can cast the spell again. Swallowing the snakes is a standard action that causes you no harm and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Once they are swallowed, the tattoos reappear immediately on your arms.

*Focus:* Two snake tattoos on your skin, usually one coiled around each forearm.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4 to Level.
