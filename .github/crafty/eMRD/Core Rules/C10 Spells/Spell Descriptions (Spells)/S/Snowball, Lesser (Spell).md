An icy sphere of bitter cold appears in your hand, harming neither you nor your equipment. You can use the *lesser snowball* to strike opponents with a melee touch attack, or you can throw the orb as a ranged touch attack (maximum range 120 feet, no range penalty). Either use deals 1d6 points of cold damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+5). Right after you hurl the icy sphere, another appears in your hand. You may throw up to one *lesser snowball* per caster level (maximum five orbs) before exhausting the spell*.*

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Snilloc's snowball* to *lesser snowball* for campaign continuity.
