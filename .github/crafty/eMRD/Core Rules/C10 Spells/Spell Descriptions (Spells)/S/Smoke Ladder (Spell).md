You create a misty ladder up to 10 feet long per caster level, shaped from the smoke given off by a fire as you cast the spell. A *smoke ladder* weighs virtually nothing and can be easily handled at any length. Always steady and rigid, the ladder needs no support or object to lean against, but can simply be placed in the desired position and climbed.

By casting the spell again on an existing *smoke ladder* before it dissipates, you can reset its duration.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1 to Level.
