*As the bit of dried food vanishes from your hand, you gain a wolf’s-eye view of the world—and a wolf’s-nose view as well.*

You sense through an animal’s senses, seeing through its eyes and hearing through its ears. While doing so, you use either your [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen or Spot modifiers) modifier or the animal’s, whichever is better. This spell gives you no special ability to understand what you sense.

You can switch your perceptions between the animal’s and your own on your turn as a free action. You and the animal must be on the same plane for the spell to function.

*Material Component:* An edible treat that would appeal to the animal (vegetable or meat).

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.
