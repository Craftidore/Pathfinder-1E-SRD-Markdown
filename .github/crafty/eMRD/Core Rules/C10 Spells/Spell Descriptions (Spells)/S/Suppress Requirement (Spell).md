You alter a magic item that requires a certain class feature, race, ability score, or alignment to function to its fullest potential, so that it no longer carries that requirement. You must make a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check sufficient to emulate the requirement as if you were attempting to use the item yourself. If you succeed, the requirement is suppressed for the duration of this infusion.
