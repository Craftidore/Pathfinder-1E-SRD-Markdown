This spell functions like *[[Sign of Sealing (Spell)|sign of sealing]],* except that it can also be used to seal an open space (such as a corridor or an archway), creating a magical barrier of force that repels any creature attempting to pass. In addition, doors and objects protected by a *greater sign of sealing* are strengthened, increasing their hardness by 10 and granting them an extra 5 hit points per caster level. Any object protected by a *greater sign of sealing* is treated as a magic item for the purpose of making saving throws and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If its seal is broken, a *greater sign of sealing* deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) in a 40-foot radius (Reflex half).

A *greater sign of sealing* cannot be passed with a *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell, but it can be dispelled (DC 15 + the caster level of the signâ€™s creator). It can be disarmed with a DC 31 [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check.
