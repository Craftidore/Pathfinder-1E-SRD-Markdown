You channel the spirit of an ancient elf warrior into your steed, which must be a living animal. For the duration of the spell, your mount gains:

- A +30-foot enhancement bonus to its base land speed.
- The benefit of the [[Run (Feat)|Run]] feat. If the mount already has the [[Run (Feat)|Run]] feat, it can run even faster: six times its speed (if wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load) or five times its speed (if wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load).
- The ability to hustle for the duration of the spell without taking any damage (lethal or nonlethal) or becoming [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. This ability doubles the distance the steed can cover in a period of overland movement.

When the duration of the spell expires, the mount becomes [[Fatigued|fatigued]].
