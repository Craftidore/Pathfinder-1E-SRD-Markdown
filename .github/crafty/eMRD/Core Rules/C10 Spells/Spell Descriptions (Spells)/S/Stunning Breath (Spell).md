*You breathe out, and your breath weapon is mixed with heavy, blue spheres of magical energy. Those that survive your onslaught are left standing but stunned.*

For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon that deals hit point damage, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as *dragon breath*. When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue your breath weapon with concussive force that can stun those caught in its area. Creatures that take damage from the breath weapon must make successful Fortitude saves (DC equal to your breath weapon save DC) or be [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round.
