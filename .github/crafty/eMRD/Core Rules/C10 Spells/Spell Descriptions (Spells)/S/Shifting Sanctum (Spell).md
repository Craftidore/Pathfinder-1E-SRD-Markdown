You transport yourself and an area you choose (along with everything in that area) to another location that you have physically visited. The destination must somehow befit the shifted locale. Thus, if a dragon’s lair is a system of caves built into a cliff side, you can shift the lair to another set of cliffs nearby, on another continent, or on another plane. The spell then creates the space needed for the shift, magically and instantly digging out new caves in the new cliff wall that conform to the original caves. It also fills in the space left behind—the old caves at the original location are filled in with natural stone. The lair conforms as well as possible to the new site. Conforming may include shifting the layout, size, and entrance of a location slightly (subject to DM adjudication).

Using this spell, you could transport a whole building to a new location, if the building fit within the spell’s area. You could also move only a few rooms, making them into their own separate structure at the destination or attaching them onto an existing structure. They could even replace rooms in an extant structure.

Within reason, the existing contents and environment of the moved location travel with it. However, some environmental conditions must conform to the new locality. For example, moving a small keep underwater causes the keep to fill with water unless some other magic is at work to make the place watertight. Moving an area of the Elemental Plane of Fire to an icy plain will cause the heat of the fiery area to melt the ice and snow in the new locale, but fairly quickly the temperature of the transplanted area will lower and become consistent with the environment around it.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* It is possible for a group of casters to cast this spell simultaneously in order to move a larger structure than a single caster might on his own. In order to do this, each caster must make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 45). Each that does so successfully moves a separate part of the structure in concert with any others, allowing for groups of casters to move entire castles.
