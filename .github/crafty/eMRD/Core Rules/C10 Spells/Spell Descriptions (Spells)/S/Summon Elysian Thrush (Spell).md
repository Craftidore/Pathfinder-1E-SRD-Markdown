*You evoke the powers of Elysium and of song, and the bird responds. It is about two feet long, with a resplendent orange breast and multicolored feathers. It settles upon a branch and begins to sweetly warble.*

This spell summons an Elysian thrush (*Planar Handbook* 118), a birdlike creature native to the Blessed Fields of Elysium. The creature has no significant combat utility, but its song accelerates the natural healing rate of living creatures. Those within 30 feet who listen to the thrushâ€™s song while resting recover at twice the normal natural healing rate.
