You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the objectâ€™s size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a *shrink item* spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.

*Shrink item* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell effects containers and their contents (even if the contents are magical). This spell can also be used on vehicles so long as they fit the target size requirements. Objects physically connected to another object which is not an organic part of the target object cannot be shrunk using this spell (ie., a door connected by hinges to a wall cannot be shrunk). It is a standard action to unshrink an object by command work. This specifically precludes shrinking an object in order to drop it onto something (or someone) else.
