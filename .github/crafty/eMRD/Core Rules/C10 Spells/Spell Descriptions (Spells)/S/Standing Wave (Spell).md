*Roaring a binding phrase, you take command of the water, causing a wave to rise and propelling it in the direction you desire.*

You command the waters to lift a creature or object and propel it forward. An object so lifted can contain creatures or other objects. The maximum size of the creature or object the wave can lift depends on your caster level.


| **Caster Level** | **Size of Creature or Object** |
|---|---|
| 5th | Medium |
| 7th | Large |
| 9th | Huge |
| 11th | Gargantuan |
| 13th | Colossal |

*Standing wave* moves the lifted creature or object in a straight line at a speed of 60 feet over water. The spell dissipates when the wave contacts land, lowering its burden harmlessly to shore. If you are riding in or standing on the object, the object continues to move until you are no longer in or on the object or the spell is dismissed; otherwise, the object is moved to the extent of the spell’s range when you cast the spell.
