The *spear of Valarian* spell transforms one nonmagical weapon into a shimmering silver spear. You must be carrying the weapon and have it drawn for the spell to work.

The shimmering spear functions as a *+1 silvered spear*. Against magical beasts, the weapon becomes a *+3 silvered spear* that deals +2d6 points of bonus damage (as the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* special property).

If the *spear of Valarian* is sundered, the original weapon breaks as the spell suddenly ends. If the wielder relinquishes the spear, willingly or not, it immediately reverts to its previous state and the spell ends.
