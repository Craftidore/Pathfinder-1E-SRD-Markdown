*Your skin tingles as you radiate a field of powerful magic.*

When you cast this spell, designate either a school of magic or a subtype of magic (such as evil spells or fire spells). Spells of that type are suppressed within the area of your spell. Anyone attempting to cast such a spell in (or into) the area must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. (Abilities and feats that improve the ability to defeat spell resistance, such as [[Spell Penetration (Feat)|Spell Penetration]], apply here as well.) Anyone attempting to activate an item that produces a spell or effect of that type must make a similar roll, using the item's caster level for the level check. Constant items or precast effects make this check when first exposed to your *suppressing field.* If they succeed, they remain unaffected for the duration. If they fail, they are suppressed for the duration, resuming function (if their duration has not expired) when they leave the area.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, this spell commonly known as *Otiluke's Suppressing Field*.
