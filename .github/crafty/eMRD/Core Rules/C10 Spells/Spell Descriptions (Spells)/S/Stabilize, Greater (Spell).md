*Filled with compassion and concern, you draw upon your deityâ€™s power. A burst of golden energy springs forth, spreading from you. Those still alive around you seem less bloody and in less pain.*

This spell, designed to work on the battlefield, allows you to stabilize the dying all around you. A burst of positive energy spreads out from you, healing 1 point of damage to all living creatures in the affected area, whether allied or not. This spell deals 1 point of damage to undead creatures, which are allowed a Will saving throw to negate the effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *stabilize* to *greater stabilize* to avoid duplication.
