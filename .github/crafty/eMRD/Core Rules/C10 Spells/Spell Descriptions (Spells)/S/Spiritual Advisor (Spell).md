*When you chant the final words of your incantation, a soft, comforting voice seems to whisper in your ear, “What knowledge may I impart to you?”*

*Spiritual advisor* allows you to consult with a spirit, an angel, or some other divine aspect of your deity. This advisor manifests as a barely shimmering orb that floats above one of your shoulders. When it speaks, only you can hear its counsel.

As long as the *spiritual advisor* is present, it helps you recall bits of trivia, history, or other knowledge. This knowledge can be as general or specific as is required, and the information gained grants you a +4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks while the spell is in effect. You can even attempt checks with [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills in which you have no skill ranks or retry a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check you failed before casting the spell.
