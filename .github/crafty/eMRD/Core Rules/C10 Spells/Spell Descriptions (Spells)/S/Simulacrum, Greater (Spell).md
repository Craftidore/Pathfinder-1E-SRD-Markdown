This spell creates many of the effects produced by *[[Simulacrum (Spell)|simulacrum]]* and improves upon them, creating more powerful duplicates.

First, *greater simulacrum* uses clay as the primary creation material, rather than ice and snow. Next, *greater simulacrum* creates a duplicate with 65% to 85% of the originals hit points, knowledge, and personality.

Also, *greater simulacrum* allows the duplicate to increase in power. The duplicate may advance up to four levels higher than the level it is created at. All of the rules for advancement and multiclassing apply to the duplicate as they would any character.

Finally, all other rules for repairing the *greater simulacrum* apply. For more details see the *[[Simulacrum (Spell)|simulacrum]]* spell.

*Arcane Material Component:* The spell is cast over the clay form and a small piece of the original, such as hair or a fingernail. The spell also requires a fire opal worth 1,000 gp, which acts as a focus for the *improved simulacrum’s* power. The fire opal is placed inside the *greater simulacrum’s* torso.

GM Note

*House Rule:* Name changed from *improved simulacrum* to* greater simulacrum* for campaign continuity. 

*House Rule:* Level changed to Sorcerer 9, Wizard 9 for game balance.
