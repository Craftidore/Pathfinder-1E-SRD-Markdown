When this spell is initially cast, the caster sacrifices a number of his own hit points. He may not sacrifice more than his current hit point \[total + 10, although temporary hit points can be sacrificed. Once this is done, the caster makes a ranged touch attack on his target. He may do this even if he sacrificed enough hit points to cause unconsciousness, thus falling unconscious immediately after making the attack roll. If the ranged touch attack succeeds, the target then suffers damage equal to the number of hit points sacrificed. As this is a positive energy anack, it inflicts double damage upon undead.

The caster may not regain any of his sacrificed hit points for 12 full hours by any means short of a *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]**,* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*. After 12 hours have elapsed, these hit points can be regained through the usual means.

**GM Note**

When the scholars of Lokil allowed access to the newly discovered esoteric writings of the pre-Titanswar necromancer Nordriss the White, they probably did not realize that they would set off a race between the mages of Glivid-Autel and Hollowfaust to capitalize on Nordriss' work. This spell, first adapted from Nordriss' work by Hollowfaust's necromancers but soon after successfully duplicated by those at Glivid- Autel, represents one of their first fruits of this rivalry.
