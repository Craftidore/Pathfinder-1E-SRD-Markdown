*You cast a silver bar in the direction of the portal and it vanishes, becoming a semitranslucent net of silver magic that briefly encases the portal before disappearing.*

You can permanently seal an interplanar *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* or portal*.* The spell prevents any use of the portal, although *seal portal* can be dispelled by a *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell. A *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell does not function on a sealed portal, but a *[[Chime of Opening|chime of opening]]* dispels *seal portal* if *seal portal* was cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.

Once a portal is opened, *seal portal* does not remain in effect and must be cast again.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell was originally named *gate seal,* but the name was changed in the Spell Compendium.
