*The ground quakes as native stone erupts from the ground. This sharply rising stone takes the form of a sarcophagus.*

This spell creates an airtight stone coffin that forms around the target. The stone is 1 inch thick, has hardness 8, and requires 15 points of damage to break through. Decreasing its size does not change the thickness of the walls; the coffin is always just large enough to hold the subject. This coffin is sealed upon formation and completely impervious to air and gas. A creature trapped within a *sarcophagus of stone* has 1 hour worth of air, and after that time must hold its breath or begin to suffocate. A creature that has no need to breathe (such as a construct, elemental, or undead) needs not fear suffocation, but it remains trapped within the sarcophagus until it breaks free or is freed.

A creature within the coffin can attack the stone with a natural weapon or light melee weapon. A creature can attempt a DC 26 Strength check to break free of the stone, and allies can also help to break the trapped creature free.

*Material Component:* A fragment of a sarcophagus.
