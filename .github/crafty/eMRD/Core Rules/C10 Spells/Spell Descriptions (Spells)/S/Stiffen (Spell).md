*As you touch your foe, blue spiderwebs appear on his skin, slowing him down and gradually paralyzing him.*

Upon touching a target, you set in motion a devastating effect that gradually deadens his nerves. On the first round, the target takes a –4 penalty to his Dexterity score, and all his movement rates are reduced by 5 feet. If the target can fly, his maneuverability is reduced by one step.

On the following round, the target can make a new Fortitude save to halt the spell’s progress. If the save fails, the penalty to Dexterity worsens to –8, his movement rates are reduced another 5 feet, and his maneuverability is reduced by another 2 steps. This deterioration continues each round until the target succeeds on his save, at which point his condition no longer worsens, or until the target’s Dexterity drops to 0. Targets whose movement rates drop to 0 feet cannot move, and targets whose maneuverability drops below clumsy cannot fly. All penalties vanish when the spell’s duration expires.
