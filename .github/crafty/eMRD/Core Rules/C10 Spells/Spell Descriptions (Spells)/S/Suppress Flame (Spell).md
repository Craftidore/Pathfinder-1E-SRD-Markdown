You imbue an area with a combination of cold and negative energies that suppresses flame. Illumination emitted by fire (torches, *[[Continual Flame (Spell)|continual flame]]*, and so on) is reduced by half. For example, a hooded lantern within the area of a *suppress flame* spell clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius (instead of a 30-foot radius) and provides shadowy illumination in a 30-foot radius (instead of a 60-foot radius).

In addition, all damage caused by fire, including all fire spells and spell-like effects, is reduced to 1 point per die. So, a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* cast by a 10th-level wizard would deal 10 points of fire damage to those who fail their Reflex save or 5 points of fire damage to those who make their Reflex save, rather than 10d6 points of fire damage or half that amount, respectively, outside the confines of a *suppress flame* spell. A caster can make a caster level check (DC 10 + the *suppress flame’s* caster level) to cause normal amounts of damage from fire spells. A new caster level check must be made for each spell cast.
