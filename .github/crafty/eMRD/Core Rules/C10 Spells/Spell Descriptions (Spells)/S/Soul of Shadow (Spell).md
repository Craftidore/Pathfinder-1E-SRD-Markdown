*Flecks of darkness whirl in your eyes, and your shadow seems to grow and writhe, echoing darkness within you.*

This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the Negative Energy Plane. Whenever you cast or are the target of an inflict spell, you can choose for the spell to deal a number of extra points of damage equal to twice the spell's level. (Only undead casters typically choose for such spells to "deal" extra damage to them.) If you cast such a spell that deals at least 10 points of damage to any one target, it also removes the [[Fatigued|fatigued]] condition from you (or reduces exhaustion to fatigue).

If *soul of shadow* and *[[Soul of Anarchy (Spell)|soul of anarchy]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/good or lawful. If *soul of shadow* and *[[Soul of Order (Spell)|soul of order]]* are active on you at the same time, you gain damage reduction 3/chaotic or good.

*Soul of shadow* counters and dispels *[[Soul of Light (Spell)|soul of light]]**,* and vice versa.

*Special:* An evil-aligned dragon capable of casting 5th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
