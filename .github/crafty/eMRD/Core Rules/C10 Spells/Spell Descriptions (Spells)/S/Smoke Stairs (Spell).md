*You step into intangible smoke and ascend as nimbly as if it were a flight of steps.*

You gain the ability to run up columns of smoke as if they were normal stairs. Casting this spell successfully requires smoke from a natural fire large enough to fill a 5-foot square, such as a normal campfire, bonfire, or any significant amount of burning debris (torch flames or creatures made of fire or smoke do not suffice).

After casting this spell, you can move into the column of smoke produced by such fires and can ascend vertically into a square filled with smoke. To your eyes the smoke coalesces into ghostly steps, though other observers see nothing different. When stepping into the column you are considered to be in the smoke above the flame and take no damage from the fire. Every 5 feet of upward movement costs 2 squares of movement. For example, an assassin with a speed of 30 feet casts *smoke stairs* on himself, then moves 10 feet across the ground to ascend 10 feet vertically in a single move action.

If anything dissipates the column of smoke while you are moving though it using this spell, you lose your footing and fall. Examples include a *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* spell and an air elemental’s whirlwind form. If the fire creating the smoke is extinguished, the *smoke stairs* effect lingers for 1 round before dispersing.
