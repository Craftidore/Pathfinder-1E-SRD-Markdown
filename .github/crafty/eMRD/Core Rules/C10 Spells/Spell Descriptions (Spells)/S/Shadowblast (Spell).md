*Light flashes bright and white for an instant in the area of this spell, dispersing portals to the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] and stunning the unnatural creatures that fear the light.*

Natives of the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] caught in a *shadowblast* are [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw. Shadow natives that are also undead or vulnerable to light take an additional 2d10 points of damage if they fail a second Fortitude save. Creatures that fail either Fortitude save cannot use spell-like or supernatural abilities to open any portal to the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] for 3d6 minutes.

*Shadowblast* closes all portals, *gates*, and other openings to the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] in its area. Creatures on the other side of a portal are unaffected by *shadowblast*.

*Material Component*: A handful of grave dirt, squeezed tightly and flung.
