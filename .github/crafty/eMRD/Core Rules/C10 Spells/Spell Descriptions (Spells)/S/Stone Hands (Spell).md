Your fists turn into menacing, rocky lumps capable of inflicting deadly wounds. While this spell is in effect, your unarmed attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and they deal lethal bludgeoning damage. The damage that your unarmed attacks deal increases as well, according to your size as given on the table below.


| | **Unarmed** |
|---|---|
| **Size** | **Damage** |
| Fine | 1d3 |
| Diminutive | 1d4 |
| Tiny | 1d6 |
| Small | 1d8 |
| Medium | 2d6 |
| Large | 3d6 |
| Huge | 4d6 |
| Gargantuan | 6d6 |
| Colossal | 8d6 |

If your unarmed strike already deals more damage than the indicated amount, you always use the higher value. In addition, if you are a dwarf or a goliath under the effects of this spell, your unarmed attacks overcome damage reduction as if they were cold iron weapons.

**GM Note**
