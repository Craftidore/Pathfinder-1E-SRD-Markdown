This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming it into a glowing missile that destabilizes other forms of magic. In addition to dealing normal damage, a *spellslayer arrow* deals an extra 1d4 points of damage for each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target. For example, an arrow would deal an extra 3d4 points of damage to a creature under the effects of *[[Bull's Strength (Spell)|bull’s strength]]**,* *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]**,* and *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]*. The arrow or bolt must be fired during the same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost. The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3 to Level.

*House Rule:* This spell is especially useful when combined with either the *[[Launch Bolt (Spell)|launch bolt]]* or *[[Launch Item (Spell)|launch item]]* spells.

*House Rule:* By default any magical arrow or bolt that was created using the [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] feat is masterwork and would meet the material component requirement.
