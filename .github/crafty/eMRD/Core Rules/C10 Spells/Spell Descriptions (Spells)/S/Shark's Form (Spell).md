You change yourself into a Medium shark. Your type changes to animal. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further). If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead.

You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a shark but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the shark’s bite damage, Armor Class, swim speed, ability to breathe underwater, blindsense, and keen scent. You lose the ability to breathe air. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the shark’s feats and racial bonuses to skills (but not its skill ranks). You cannot speak or cast spells unless they have no components (that is, modified with the proper metamagic feats). You can use disciplines that do not require a free hand or a spoken word.

The equipment you wear is subsumed into the *shark’s form*, but it is nonfunctional.
