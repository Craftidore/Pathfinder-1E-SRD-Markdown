*You spit out the words of the spell, and the shadow of your foe darkens, becoming a solid black pit. Your opponent pinwheels its arms as it topples backward into the darkness.*

You cause the target’s shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]]. The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway. Inside the pocket realm, the creature sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt it without causing actual harm. Each round, the creature can attempt another Will save to return from the *shadow well.* Otherwise, the subject returns to the real world when the spell’s duration expires.

Being trapped in a *shadow well* can be terrifying; upon returning to the real world, the subject must succeed on another Will save or be [[Frightened|frightened]] for 1d4 rounds.

Upon leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the *shadow well* spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest adjacent empty space.

Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* and *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]],* do not help a creature escape a *shadow well* spell, although a *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* spell allows it to flee to another plane as normal. The target might still become [[Frightened|frightened]] upon leaving.
