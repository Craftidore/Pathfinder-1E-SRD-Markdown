*You speak a word of abjuration and thrust aloft the bone disk and silver wheel, held together by a single tear. The disk and wheel begin to spin, then vanish, but you feel the power of the mystic engine created nearby.*

Upon casting this spell, you can swap out any or all of your prepared spells for other spells from your spellbook. Each prepared spell must be swapped for a spell of the same level. Empty spell slots from a spell cast earlier in the day (including the casting of this spell) cannot be refreshed.

Preparing spells within the light provided by a* spell engine* takes only half as long as normal.
