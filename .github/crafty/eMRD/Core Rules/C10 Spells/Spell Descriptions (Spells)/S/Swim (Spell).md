*Making the sound of crashing waves with your throat completes the spell. With a wave of your hand, your subject seems more streamlined, with a hint of webbed appendages.*

This spell gives the recipient a swim speed of 30 feet (although not the ability to breathe water or hold one’s breath beyond normal limits). As long as the creature isn’t carrying more than a light load, it can swim without making [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. It also gains a +8 bonus on any [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks to perform special actions or avoid hazards, though it still takes the normal penalty for weight carried (–1 per 5 pounds). The recipient can choose to take 10 on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line.

If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply.
