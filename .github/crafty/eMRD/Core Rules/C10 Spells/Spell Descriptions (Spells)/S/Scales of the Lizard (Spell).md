When you cast this spell, your skin toughens and shimmers as if covered with scales. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus, increasing to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th level, and +5 at 12th level or higher. The enhancement bonus provided by *scales of the lizard* stacks with your own natural armor bonus (if any), but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0.
