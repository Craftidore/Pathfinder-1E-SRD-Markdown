This spell functions like *[[Spell Matrix, Lesser (Spell)|lesser spell matrix]]*, except that you can store up to two spells of up to 3rd level, and you take 2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon casting. The matrix closes after 2 rounds and no more spells can be added, even if it is not full.

In addition, you can decide to link the two spells stored in the matrix into a spell sequence if both are 2nd level or lower. You can then discharge the two linked spells as a single swift action, just as if you were casting the lone spell from a *spell matrix*.
