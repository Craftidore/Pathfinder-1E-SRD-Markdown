*Through an act of will and the utterance of a terrible word of power, you sacrifice a bit of your own life in order to open a visible, blood red conduit through which you siphon off the life of another, capturing their very soul if they die.*

When cast upon a sentient, living creature which has either a soul or a spirt, this spell creates a blood red line of effect which causes 1d4 + 1/caster level points of damage per round for a number rounds equal to the caster's level. If the spell slays the target, its vital essence is captured and coalesces into a soulshard (a precious, ruby‐colored gem that pulsates with an inner light) which appears in the hand of the caster. If the caster has no free hand, it drops to the ground in front of him.

If the caster is slain or moves beyond the range of the spell, the spell ends immediately. Any effect (such as *[[Globe of Invulnerability (Spell)|globe of invulnerability]]**,* *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]**,* or *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]**)* or object which breaks the line of effect also ends this spell. The target creature may end the spell by moving beyond its range. Concealment (to include *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*) does not terminate this spell, and only complete cover will do so.

A creature slain by this spell cannot be contacted via a *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* spell or similar effect unless the soulshard created at the time of their death is held by the caster while contacting them.

Those slain by* lesser soul drain* cannot be returned to life by *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]**,* *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*, *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* or other means unless the soulshard created by the creature's death is used as a material component for the spell that returns them to life. A *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* can return them to life and complete health even without the soulshard.
