*You summon a draconic mass made entirely of shadow.*

You create a Large dragon-shaped mass of shadows that attacks under your control. Each round, you can move the *spectral dragon* up to 60 feet and attempt a bite attack against a single creature. The attack bonus of the dragon is your caster level + your key ability modifier. If the dragon hits with its bite, the target takes 1d6 points of Strength damage and gains one negative level. After 24 hours, the victim is entitled to a Fortitude save to avoid losing the level permanently. The mass itself is not dangerous to the touch, and creatures can pass through it without suffering harm.

A *spectral dragon* cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**,* *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]**,* a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]],* or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]* affects it. Its AC against touch attacks is 9 (10 minus size bonus for a Large creature). It can pass through solid objects, though it has no ability to see through them. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the *spectral dragon* strikes it. If the attack is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the dragon has its full normal effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

An undead creature struck by the dragon’s bite receives 1d4×3 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

*Special:* Shadow creatures (such as shadows, shadow dragons, and shadar-kai) and creatures descended from shadow (such as half-shadow dragons and shadovar) cast this spell at +1 caster level and deal an extra 1 point of Strength damage with each attack. This bonus is also granted to creatures that derive their power from the Shadow Weave.
