*Shadows rise from the ground to envelop you. The shadows easily move with you, guiding your steps and how to hold your body.*

While this spell is in effect, you gain a number of benefits. The shadows wrapping your form grant you a +4 competence bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], Hide, and Move Silently checks. Your shadowy form also provides you with concealment. This shadowy concealment is not negated by a *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* spell, but a *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* spell counteracts the effect. Standing within the radius of a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell or in bright natural sunlight temporarily suppresses the concealment effect.

In addition, if you have 5 ranks in [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], you can attempt to slip through a solid object or barrier up to 5 feet thick with a DC 20 [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check, though doing this ends the spell as soon as the attempt is completed (regardless of success). If you have 10 ranks in [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], you can attempt to pass through an object or barrier up to 10 feet thick. If you have 15 ranks in [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]], you can attempt to pass through a barrier composed of magical force (or similar magical obstacles).

*Material Component:* A small piece of black cloth taken from a funeral shroud.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *shadow form* to *shadow shape* to avoid duplication.
