Your voice is amplified greatly. Subtract 10 from the DC of [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks made to hear you talking (even whispering). You also gain a +2 competence bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks. While this spell is active, you can use a swift action to create a 15-foot-long cone-shaped burst of intense sound with a shout. Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round. Doing this discharges the spell.

Creatures that cannot hear are not [[Stunned|stunned]] but are still damaged.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Level changed to Cleric 2, if Initiate feats are used, change back to Initiate of Horus-Re 2.
