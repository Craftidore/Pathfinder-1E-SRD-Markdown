You are able to shrink one nonmagical item, structure, or vehicle (if it is within the size limit) to 1 inch in size in each dimension. This change, unlike *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]*, can reduce an object's size by more than four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a cloth-like one (1 inch across). Objects changed by a *greater shrink item* spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command (this is a standard action and the word of command must be spoken within 10 feet of the object) from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
