One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, *spellbane* creates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. *Spellbane* otherwise functions like *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected—a *spellbane* set to prevent the casting of *[[Summon Nature's Ally II (Spell)|summon nature’s ally II]]* would not prevent castings of *[[Summon Nature's Ally I (Spell)|summon nature’s ally I]]* or *[[Summon Nature's Ally III (Spell)|summon nature’s ally III]]*. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out.

*Spellbane* can even negate an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, another *spellbane*, or any spell that specifies immunity to *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* (such as *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*, *[[Prismatic Sphere (Spell)|prismatic sphere]]*, and *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]*). Multiple *spellbane* effects can overlap. Their effects stack, preventing the functioning of every spell targeted by any of the multiple *spellbane* emanations. Spell effects created by artifacts or deities cannot be suppressed by *spellbane*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Aroden’s spellbane* to *spellbane* for campaign continuity.

Note: I would use this spell at 17th+ level against *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]], [[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage's disjunction]],* and *xx*.
