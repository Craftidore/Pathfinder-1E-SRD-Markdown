This spell transports an entire vehicle and its contents as *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]*, so long as the vehicle is not carrying more than its maximum capacity. The driver of the vehicle is allowed a saving throw to resist this teleportation. If the driver successfully saves, the spell ends. Unlike *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*, all other creatures onboard the vehicle that do not wish to be transported do not get a saving throw if they are on board the vehicle. This teleportation only allows a ship to move horizontally and a teleported ship must end its movement in water.
