The subject gains the ability to see to the normal limits of its vision even in whiteout conditions, and ignores all penalties due to snow glare and snow blindness. *Snowsight* is no better than normal vision. During daylight, this usually means the subject can see to the horizon; at night, vision is restricted to ambient light or darkvision as appropriate for the subject creature. *Snowsight* does not grant creatures the ability to see in darkness.
