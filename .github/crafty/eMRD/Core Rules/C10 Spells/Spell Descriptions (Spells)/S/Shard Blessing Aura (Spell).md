This spell creates an aura of shimmering blue-white light similar to moonlight that fills your space and moves with you. The aura sheds light equal to a candle. This aura functions like a *[[Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser (Spell)|lesser globe of invulnerability]]**.*

If you are a sorcerer and moon related deity is your patron, the aura also grants you the benefit of *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]**.*

The spell is named for the Shards, planetar servants of Selûne drawn from the ranks of her greatest priestesses. Because some shards return to Faerûn to visit their mortal lovers, supernatural bloodlines (usually aasimar, but not always) with ties to Selûne exist in some parts of the world.
