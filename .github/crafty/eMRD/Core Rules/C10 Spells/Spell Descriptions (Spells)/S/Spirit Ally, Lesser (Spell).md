By casting this spell, you request the services of a spirit (of up to 8 HD) that shares your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual spirit’s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the casting of the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).

You may ask the spirit to perform one task for you, and the spirit may request some service in return. The more demanding your request, the greater return favor the spirit asks for. This bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the spirit begin in the round after it arrives. If you agree to the service, the spirit performs the task you requested, reports back to you afterward (if possible), and returns to its home. You are honor bound to perform the return favor.

A spirit may accept some form of payment, such as a magic item, in return for its service. The spirit may keep it or may deliver the item to another shaman somewhere else, where it can help the spirit’s cause.

Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, *lesser spirit ally* is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental.
