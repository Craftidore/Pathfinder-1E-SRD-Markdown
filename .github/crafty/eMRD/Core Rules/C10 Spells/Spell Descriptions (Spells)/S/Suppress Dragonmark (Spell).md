Using an inversely charged Siberys dragonshard, this spell absorbs the magical energy of the target creatureâ€™s dragonmark. In casting the spell, you must touch the target creature with the charged dragonshard, requiring either a ranged or melee touch attack. If the creature is struck by the Siberys shard and fails its Will save, it loses the ability to use any spell-like abilities granted by its dragonmark for the duration of the spell.

*Focus:* A Siberys dragonshard worth at least 25 gp and inversely tuned, a process requiring 1 hour of uninterrupted concentration. Once the spell is cast, the inverse tuning must be repeated for the focus to work again.
