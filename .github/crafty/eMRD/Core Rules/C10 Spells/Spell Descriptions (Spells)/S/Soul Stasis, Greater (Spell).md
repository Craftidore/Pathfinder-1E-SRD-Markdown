This spell provides all of the protection of a *[[Soul Stasis (Spell)|soul stasis]]* plus the subject of this spell becomes immediately immune to any effect that would cause him to become or recover from being dead (death magic, life-giving magic, etc), energy drained, soul bound (or other *[[Trap the Soul (Spell)|trap the soul]]* effects), or [[Unconscious|unconscious]]. If the subject’s hit points reach –10, the character can continue to take normal actions. He cannot lose any more hit points once he reaches –10.

If cast on an [[Unconscious|unconscious]] [[Dying|dying]] creature, the creature will wake up. If cast on a dead creature, this spell will prevent all forms of *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]*, raising and reincarnation.

If cast on an undead creature, the creature become immune to any effect that would cause it to become destroyed as a result of a turning attempt.

This spell also makes the subject immune to all effects of negative energy. This includes most special attacks by undead and most evil spells of the Necromancy school.

**GM Note**

This spell (as well as its variants) makes any form of the *[[Celerity (Domain)|celerity]]* spell immensely powerful. However, it doesn't 'break' the rules as neither spell is commonly used by most spellcasters and only one stasis spell can be in effect at a time.
