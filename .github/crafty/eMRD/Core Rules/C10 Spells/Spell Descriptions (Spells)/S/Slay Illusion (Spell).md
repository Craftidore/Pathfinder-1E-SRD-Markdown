You create an illusion of a horrible creature of Large size that you choose (or design). The illusion has both visual and audible components. This illusion moves at a speed of 40 to the nearest illusion within range, detecting it without possibility of error. Your illusion can charge and double move, but not run, and its movement requires no action on your part.

As soon as it reaches the other illusion, it destroys it in a visual display of illusory obliteration. The remnants of the destroyed illusion fade. The next round, your illusion moves again to the nearest illusion within range and does the same thing, continuing the attacks until the spell ends. If there are no illusions within range, the illusory creature disappears in a blast of phantom fire.

For example, say you cast this spell near an illusion of a dragon. You make your illusionary creature a troll. The “troll” moves to the illusion of the dragon and tears it apart, the bloody dragon bits fading after a moment. The next round, the “troll” moves across the room to an *[[Illusory Wall (Spell)|illusory wall]]* (which you did not even know was an illusion) and destroys it, ripping the rocks and mortar apart. The rocks and mortar fade and, with no other illusions within range, the “troll” disappears.

As with all illusions, interaction with the illusory creature allows other characters a saving throw, although their belief or disbelief in the illusion has no effect on its ability to seek out and destroy other illusions.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The *slay illusion* spell ends *[[Mirror Image (Spell)|mirror image]]* immediately, destroying all images simultaneously.
