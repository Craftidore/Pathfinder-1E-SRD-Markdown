You can send your spirit outside yourself in an incorporeal form while maintaining some semblance of life within your physical body. Your spirit is treated as an incorporeal creature for the purposes of determining movement, special qualities, and weaknesses, and has a speed of 90 feet but cannot move more than 200 feet from your body. In your spirit form, a spellcaster using *[[Commune with Lesser Spirit (Spell)|commune with lesser spirit]]* or *[[Commune with Greater Spirit (Spell)|commune with greater spirit]]* can contact you, and you can cast spells that have only verbal components. You cannot attack physically or otherwise affect the physical world, and you can return your spirit to your body on your turn as a standard action.

While you function in your spirit form, your body assumes a half-awake state, able to take only one move action per round, losing its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any), and granting its foes a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it. Within 5 feet of your body, you can command it to take simple actions such as walking, talking (in a slow, slurred fashion), or eating. Damage taken by either your spirit or your body is subtracted from your hit point total, and if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you die. Likewise, you die if your body moves more than 200 feet from your spirit form and you cannot follow (while under the effects of a *spirit needle,* for example), or if you are otherwise prevented from returning to your body when the spell ends.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** Added Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 to level.
