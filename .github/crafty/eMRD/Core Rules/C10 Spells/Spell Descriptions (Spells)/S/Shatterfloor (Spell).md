*You strike the bell with the hammer and evoke a loud thrumming vibration. It quickly builds to a painful crescendo, then fades. In its wake it leaves a circle of crushed stone and rubble.*

Creatures and objects in the area take 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and can make a saving throw to take half damage. If the floor of the area is made of stone, wood, ice, or material with hardness less than those, the floor is pulverized, resulting in an area of difficult terrain composed of soft dust, wood fragments, or loose crushed ice, as appropriate.

*Focus:* A miniature hammer and bell worth at least 10 gp.
