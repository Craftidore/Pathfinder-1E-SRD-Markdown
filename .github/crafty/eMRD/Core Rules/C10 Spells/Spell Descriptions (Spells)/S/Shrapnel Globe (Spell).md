You create a small metal sphere that exists for no longer than the duration. At any point during the duration, if you hurl or drop the globe, it detonates, spraying metal shards in all directions within 20 feet. The shrapnel inflicts 1d6 points of damage for every two caster levels, to a maximum of 5d6. Throwing or dropping the sphere where you want to requires a standard action, resolved as a grenade-like missile. You can give the globe to another creature to use, but it requires a standard action to do so.
