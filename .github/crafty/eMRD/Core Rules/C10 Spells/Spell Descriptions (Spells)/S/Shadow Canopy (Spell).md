You create a field of shadow. The outer surface of the field is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, granting 100% concealment to creatures and objects within the spellâ€™s area. A creature under the effect of *blacklight* cannot see through the field. The interior of the field casts a deep shadow on everything within, reducing normal vision to 5 feet; creatures with darkvision can see normally within the field. Light, including sunlight, cannot penetrate the field. Creatures that would normally be adversely affected by sunlight, such as shades and vampires, are able to function normally within the field.

You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance to resist this spell.

*Shadow canopy* counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. Light spells of equal level have no effect on *shadow canopy*, but light spells of higher level counter or dispel *shadow canopy*.

*Material Component:* A handful of coal dust and the dried eyeball of any diurnal creature.
