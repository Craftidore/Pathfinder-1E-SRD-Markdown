*Instinctively, you know the depth of the nearest pool of water, as well as other pools nearby of a similar depth. In your mindâ€™s eye you see the pools connected to one another magically, as if each were a doorway with a tunnel linking it to all the others.*

This spell functions like *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]*, but it is used for diving into pools of water rather than trees. Each pool must be at least 1 foot deep, and the exit pool of water must be similar in depth to the entry pool (within 1 foot). Unlike with *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]],* each jump has a maximum range of 500 feet. All other effects and limitations are the same.
