When this spell is cast it creates an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse ("planes") within the caster's own shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 2 Large or 8 Medium creatures (ie., 10 ft deep by 20 ft. wide by 20 ft. high). 

The caster can "pull" his shadow into the space, making it "disappear." When this has been done, the caster has no shadow even in the presence of the brightest of light sources (DC 10 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to notice that the caster has no shadow when he normally should). While the shadow is pulled within itself, neither the caster or any creature within the shadow can access it or enter/leave.  If in an area where there is so much light that the caster has no shadow, the *shadow space* cannot be accessed.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if the caster's shadow (now an erect 2 dimensional plane) were a doorway. The doorway is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can sense the window can't see or pass through it unless they make an opposed caster level check. 

Only one creature at a time may enter or leave the extradimensional space. The caster may place or remove an item with the *shadow space* as a free action once per turn; however, the caster cannot enter the *shadow space.*

Anything inside the extradimensional space emerges when the spell ends.

**GM Note**

It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one unless the proper precautions are taken (cf. *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]*).
