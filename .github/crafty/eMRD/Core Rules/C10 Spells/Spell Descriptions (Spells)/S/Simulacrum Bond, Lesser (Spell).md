This spell can only be cast on a simulacrum created by the caster. It can not therefore be used on a captured simulacrum created by someone else. Read the memories of simulated animals, aberrations, demons, devils, etc., at your own risk.

To cast the spell, the caster and simulacrum must each place one hand on a specially prepared journal (the focus costing 500 GP). From there, the caster reviews the memories of the simulacrum at the rate of 1 day per level of the caster, each day taking 1 minute.

These memories are not perfect but are somewhat better than the recollection a person would normally have over the same time period. It cannot be used to learn skills, new spells, or have the simulacrum conduct study or read books for the caster. The simulacrum may assist in preparing such things, but the actual work must still be done by the caster.

What this spell can do is allow a rapid update of events that the simulacrum has witnessed, such as a simulacrum of the caster left behind to oversee the stronghold, local events and any business that has taken place as witnessed by the simulacrum. It is advised that detailed written records still be kept for precision. By the same token, a simulacrum working in a tavern could remember events that took place there, people and the like as a normal person could, depending on skills, specific instructions as to what to watch for, etc.
