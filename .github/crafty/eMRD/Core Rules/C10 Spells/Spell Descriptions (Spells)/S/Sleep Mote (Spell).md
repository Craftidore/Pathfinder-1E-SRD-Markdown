You create a dust devil composed of slumber-inducing particles. It flies at a speed of 30 feet per round (perfect maneuverability), and you can concentrate on controlling its every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the vortex’s movement is a move action, while changing its programmed movement is a standard action. If you don’t move or program the vortex, it merely stays at rest, spinning and howling. The vortex dissipates if it exceeds the spell’s range.

If the *sleep mote* enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and causes a magical slumber to come upon any creature whose space it completely engulfs that fails a Will saving throw (thus, creatures larger than Medium size have immunity to a *sleep mote*). Even on a successful Will saving throw, affected creatures are sleepy, and take a –2 penalty on all Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma checks for the spell’s duration.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). *Sleep mote* has no effect on unconscious creatures.

*Arcane Material Component:* A pinch of fine sand and a live cricket.
