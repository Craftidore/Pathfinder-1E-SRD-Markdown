This spell functions like *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, except that every creature within 60 feet of a *symbol of weakness* instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.

Unlike *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, *symbol of weakness* has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol of weakness* simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of weakness* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill to find a *symbol of weakness* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for *symbol of weakness*.
