You grant one creature, plus one additional creature for every five caster levels, the ability to teleport a short distance as a move action. Each subject can use the ability once per round, on its turn, to travel to a spot it knows intimately or can see, which can be no more than 5 feet per two caster levels away (maximum 50 feet at 20th level). Creatures affected by this spell can carry objects, as long as the weight of those objects doesn’t exceed the subject’s maximum load. If a subject of *shuffle* would arrive in an area occupied by solid material, that attempted teleport simply fails.
