*Strength and power flows through your limbs, and blows rebound off flesh that is suddenly as hard as steel.*

This spell can be cast only by a creature that has been altered due to the use of polymorph, alternate form, or a similar effect. Compare the natural armor, damage reduction, and physical ability scores of the caster’s current and original forms; for the duration of the spell, the caster uses the highest value in each category. This spell has no visible effect.

If the caster has the [[Silent Spell (Feat)|Silent Spell]] feat, he can apply it to this spell without increasing the casting time or spell level.

Although this spell was first developed by dragons, casters of any race can master it; in particular, the rakshasas of the Lords of Dust often make use of this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The alteration in scores lasts for the duration of the original polymorph effect.

*House Rule:* Added Druid 2, Wizard 1 to Level.

Note: Duration changed from 1 round to Special per WotC forum errata.
