*Holding the glass lens before you, you take a series of slow, deep breaths. Whispered words of arcane power seep past your lips with each exhalation. As you complete the spell you feel infused with deadly ability.*

When you cast *sniper’s eye,* you gain the following benefits.

- +10 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) checks.
- Darkvision out to 60 feet.
- The ability to make a ranged sneak attack at a range of up to 60 feet, rather than 30 feet.
- The ability to make a death attack with a ranged weapon rather than just with a melee weapon. The target must be within 60 feet.

This spell doesn’t grant you the ability

to make a sneak attack or death attack if

you don’t already have that ability.

*Sniper’s eye* attunes you completely to the vantage point you had when you cast the spell. You understand the nuances of the breeze and every angle and shadow—from that spot. If you move even 5 feet from the place where you cast the spell, you lose the benefits of *sniper’s eye* until you return to that spot.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4 to Level.
