*With the sound of twisting wood, the weapon you touch grows sharp spikes like rose thorns.*

This spell functions like *[[Brambles (Spell)|brambles]]*, except that the affected weapon gains a +2 enhancement bonus on its attack rolls, and its threat range is doubled. This effect does not stack with other effects that increase a weaponâ€™s threat range, such as the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat.
