*Spirit fog* produces a bank of thin yellow mist that weakens the reactions of those caught in it. Creatures in the *spirit fog* take a –10 competence penalty on Dexterity checks and Reflex saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

**GM Note**

*Spell Secret:* Using the blood of a blink dog as a material component and succeeding on a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 25) causes the *spirit fog* to become persistent, ie. a creature remaining in the *spirit fog* must succeed each round they remain within it or be affected by it.
