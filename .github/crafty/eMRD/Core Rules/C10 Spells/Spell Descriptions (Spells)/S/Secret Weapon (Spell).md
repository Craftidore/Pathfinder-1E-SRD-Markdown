*At your touch, the weapon seems to disappear from view.*

You enable someone to hide a weapon on his person. The weapon does not become truly invisible so much as easily overlooked. *Secret weapon* adds +20 to the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] check to conceal a light weapon, and +10 to the check to conceal a larger weapon (even one normally too large to conceal). A “weapon” is defined as any manufactured weapon. With the aid of this spell, you can attempt to hide a weapon even if you do not possess the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] skill. Additionally, you can hide the presence of a weapon from detection spells, although *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* penetrates the glamer.
