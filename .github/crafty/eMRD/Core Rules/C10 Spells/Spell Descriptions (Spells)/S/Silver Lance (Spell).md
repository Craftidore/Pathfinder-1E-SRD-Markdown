This spell brings into being a shimmering, silver lance-like column of force, equivalent to a Large lance. The lance flies toward a single creature you pantomime throwing it at when you cast the spell. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus and a +2 bonus for charging. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 20 and a critical multiplier of ×3. In addition, the creature struck must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the impact.

*Focus*: A miniature platinum lance engraved with arcane runes that costs 250 gp to construct.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Laeral’s silver lance* to *silver lance* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Laeral’s silver lance* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.
