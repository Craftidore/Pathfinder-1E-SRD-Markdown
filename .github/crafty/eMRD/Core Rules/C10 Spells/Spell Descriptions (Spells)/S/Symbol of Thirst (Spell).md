This spell functions like *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a *symbol of thirst* are consumed by a terrible sense of thirst (as the *[[Tormenting Thirst (Spell)|tormenting thirst]]* spell) for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note:* Magic traps, such as *symbol of thirst,* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5 Search) skill to find a *symbol of thirst* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for *symbol of thirst.*
