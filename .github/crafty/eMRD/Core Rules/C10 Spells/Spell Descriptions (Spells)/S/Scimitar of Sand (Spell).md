A curved, 3-foot-long blade of sand springs forth from your hand, screaming and churning like a caged sandstorm. Attacks with a *scimitar of sand* are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d6 points of damage, +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The blade is not solid, so your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. You can use a *scimitar of sand* without penalty even if you lack proficiency with a normal scimitar. In addition to being dealt damage, a creature struck by your weapon must succeed on a Fortitude save or become dehydrated.

*Arcane Material Component:* A pinch of sand, salt, and iron filings.
