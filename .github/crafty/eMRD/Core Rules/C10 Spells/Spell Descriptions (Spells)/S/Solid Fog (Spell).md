This spell functions like *[[Fog Cloud (Spell)|fog cloud]]*, but in addition to obscuring sight, the *solid fog* is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a *solid fog* move at half their normal speed and take a â€“2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into *solid fog* is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in *solid fog*. *Solid fog*, and effects that work like *solid fog*, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.

Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

*Solid fog* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell. A permanent *solid fog* dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

**GM NOTE**

The effects created by this spell do not move with a ship, but they do reduce the speed of a ship moving through them to half.
