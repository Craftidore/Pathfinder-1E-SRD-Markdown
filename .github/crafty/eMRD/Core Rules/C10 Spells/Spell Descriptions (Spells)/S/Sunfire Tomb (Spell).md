You transfer a target, body and soul, into the sun, where he is held entombed in stasis forever. For the subject, time ceases to flow and he does not grow older. His bodily functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm him. He is, however, aware of the heat and light around him—those sensations are all he experiences while entombed in the sun. The subject remains there unless a *[[Freedom (Spell)|freedom]]* spell is cast at the locale where this spell was originally cast. Magical search by *[[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]* or similar divination does not reveal the fact that the creature is entombed, but *[[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]]* does. A *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* spell does not free the subject but will reveal where he is entombed. The *sunfire tomb* spell functions only if you know the target’s name and some facts about his life.

This spell is often used against creatures such as dark elves, vampires, or other beings that hate the light of day, as a fitting punishment for their misdeeds.
