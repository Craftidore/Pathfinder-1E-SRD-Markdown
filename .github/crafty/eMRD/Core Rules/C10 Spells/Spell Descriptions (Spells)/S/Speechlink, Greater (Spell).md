*Tapping your finger to the side of your head and to your intended subject, you whisper words of greeting to complete the spell. You then hear your subject’s voice as if it were speaking directly into your ear.*

You and a willing subject can communicate verbally no matter how much distance you put between yourselves even if one or both of you are on different planes. Either participant can end the spell at any time. *Greater speechlink* allows you and your allies each to hear the other’s vocalizations, whatever their volume. It does not transfer other sounds from either participant’s location. This spell works on any creatures, including animals, but does not convey any special language comprehension ability.

*Greater speechlink* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell does not allow for the selective perception of the linked subjects' vocalizations; each hears everything the other is saying unless some powerful magic prevents the functioning of divinations (of 5th level). Consequently, most casters of this spell are reluctant to cast it on just anyone.
