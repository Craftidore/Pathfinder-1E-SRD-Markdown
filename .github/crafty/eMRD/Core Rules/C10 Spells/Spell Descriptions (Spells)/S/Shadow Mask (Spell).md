*You draw raw energy from the Plane of Shadow to obscure your face.* 

You cause a mask of shadows to form around your face. It does not impede your vision, cannot be physically removed, completely hides your features, and protects you against certain attacks. You receive a +4 bonus on saving throws against light or darkness spells and any spells that rely on bright light for damaging effects, such as the *[[Flare (Spell)|flare]]* spell or the fireworks effect of *[[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]]*. You also gain a 50% chance each round to avoid having to make a saving throw against gaze attacks, just as if you averted your eyes. If you avert your eyes while using *shadow mask,* you get to check twice to see if you avoid having to make the saving throw.

When the spellâ€™s duration ends, the *shadow mask* fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden by other means. A successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* cast against a *shadow mask* effectively ends the spell and causes the same slow fading.
