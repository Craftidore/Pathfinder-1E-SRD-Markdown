*Skyrift* cloaks a large circular region with a radius of one mile in eternal night. The focal point of this region must be an obsidian stele of at least 10 feet in height carved with arcane runes by the caster. Once the spell is cast, the sun never seems to rise in the region. The affected area is either dark or lit with shadowy light, depending on the conditions outside. For example, the area has shadowy light when the sun is up on a clear day. Artificial light sources work normally within the affected area. Creatures and magical effects that rely upon night to work can function at all times in an area that a *skyrift* cloaks. Likewise, beings and objects that sunlight harms can exist with comfort anywhere in a *skyrift* at any time of day.

This spell may be cast in outdoor areas only, although its area can contain structures provided they are wholly within the area affected. Viewed from outside, a region blanketed under a *skyrift* seems to be dark and gloomy, as if on an overcast day late in the afternoon.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell cannot be dispelled through normal means. Instead, in order to dispel this spell, the stele must be destroyed. Only then can the *skyrift* be dispelled using *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or similar means.
