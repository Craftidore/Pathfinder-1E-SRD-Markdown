A violent burst of sand and howling wind streams forth from your hand, extending outward in a cone. Every creature and object within the cone takes 6d8 points of damage and is subjected to winds of hurricane force that blow directly away from you. These winds blow away Medium or smaller creatures, knock down Large creatures, and check Huge or larger creatures.

Any creature that succeeds on a Fortitude save takes half damage from the sandblast and ignores the wind effect.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *sandblast* to *greater sandblast* to avoid duplication.
