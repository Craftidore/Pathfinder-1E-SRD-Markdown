*The object begins to darken, imbued with the malice of the Dark Lady.*

The touched object radiates darkness with all the properties of a *[[Deeper Darkness (Spell)|deeper darkness]]* spell, except that evil dragons and dragonblood creatures can see normally. The darkness from this spell also has a number of additional qualities:

First, the darkened area acts as a *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* spell. Second, a good dragon or dragonblood creature cannot enter the area of darkness unless it makes a Will save. If it makes the saving throw, it can enter the area, but each round that it remains in the area of darkness, it takes 2d6 points of damage and is [[Dazed|dazed]]. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the daze effect.

Third, *shadow of the Dark Queen* counters and dispels *[[Light of Xymor (Spell)|light of Xymor]],* and it also counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* and *[[Light (Spell)|light]]*.

*Special:* Divine spellcasters who derive their power from Tiamat cast this spell at +1 caster level.
