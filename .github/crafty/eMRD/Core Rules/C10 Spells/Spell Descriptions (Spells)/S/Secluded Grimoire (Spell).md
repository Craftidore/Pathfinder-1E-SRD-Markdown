This spell sends a spellbook into a random but safe location on the [[Ethereal Plane]], where it remains indefinitely. When you cast this spell, the target spellbook dissolves into quickly fading lines of energy and runes that reflect all of the spells stored within. Thereafter, you can retrieve the spellbook by concentrating as a standard action, causing it to reappear in your hands. You cannot cast this spell on another spellbook if you currently have a spellbook in the [[Ethereal Plane]]. No other creatures or objects accompany the spellbook you send away, and the duration of any spells currently affecting the spellbook continue normally.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* To return your spellbook back to the [[Ethereal Plane]], you merely have to set it down (free action as in drop item). Should the spellbook be taken from you, it will also immediately return to the [[Ethereal Plane]].
