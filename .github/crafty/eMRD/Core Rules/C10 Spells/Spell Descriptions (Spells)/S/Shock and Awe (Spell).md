*Upon completing this spell, you feel a nagging compulsion to divert your attention from your enemies. Shaking off the feeling, you note with satisfaction that your targeted enemies seem even more distracted than you.*

This spell distracts its targets, preventing them from reacting with the deftness they might otherwise possess. Only effective when cast in the surprise round of combat and against [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] creatures, this spell causes those it affects to take a â€“10 penalty on their next initiative check. Targets that cannot be caught [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] (such as a rogue with uncanny dodge) cannot be affected by this spell.
