You control your spells with delicacy and precision. With this spell active, the range and duration of the spells you cast can increase up to 50 percent (spells with range of Touch or Personal, or durations of Instantaneous, go unaffected). Your spell effects can be delayed up to 3 rounds. You can shape spell areas (without changing their sizes) to the point of excluding single targets from bursts if you desireâ€”in other words, creatures within spell areas are affected only if you want them to be.
