When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by *sequester* become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

*Note*: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being *sequestered.* There is no save to see the *sequestered* creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
