A needle flicked from your fingers magically penetrates a spirit creature’s aura. If you hit with a normal ranged attack, the spirit loses the protective benefits of being incorporeal and is held in place (losing any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and giving attackers a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it). Though the spirit cannot move for the duration of the spell, it can still take standard and full-round actions (including attacks). A pinned spirit is unable to use any supernatural or spell-like ability that would transport it from its current location (such as *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]* or *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]*) or alter its substance or state (such as *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]* or *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]**)*. The spirit cannot remove the needle that pins it in place, but another creature can do so as a standard action.

**GM Note**
