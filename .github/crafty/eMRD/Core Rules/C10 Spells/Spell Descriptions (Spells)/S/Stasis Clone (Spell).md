As *[[Clone (Spell)|clone]]**,* except that if the original individual is still alive, the cloned body falls immediately into stasis and does not rot. If the original individual later dies, the soul transfers to the *stasis clone,* which leaves stasis and immediately begins to function as per the normal *[[Clone (Spell)|clone]]* spell.

If multiple *stasis clones* exist for the same original creature when it is slain, the soul goes into the most recently created.
