An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically reduced rate, as the *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* spell. It can only take a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor can it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

In addition, any attack by the creature that would normally include poison (such as a spider’s bite) does not do so, but all other effects associated with that attack apply. For example, if an aranea subject to *spiderbind* cast a touch spell and then bit a creature, the attack would deal normal bite damage and trigger the touch spell, but the bite would not inject poison.

While you have this spell prepared, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against poison.

Clerics of Eilistraee created this spell to help battle the many spider-like creatures that serve Lolth. Araneas, bebiliths, chitines, choldriths, driders, ettercaps, myrlochars, phase spiders, retrievers, and yochlols are sufficiently spiderlike to be affected by this spell.
