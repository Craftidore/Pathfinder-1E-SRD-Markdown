*You cast the spell, and a dancing crown of ruby runes orbits your head briefly.*

You gain an enhanced awareness of magical writing within range. Magical writing such as a *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]], [[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]], [[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*, or *symbol* is covered by a blue nimbus of light (which sheds light equal to a candle). This effect reveals the location of the writing without triggering it. For every source of magical writing, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC equal to 11 + the writingâ€™s caster level. If you are successful, the magical writing is suppressed for 1 minute per caster level. You and other creatures could then read a book warded by *[[Explosive Runes (Spell)|explosive runes]]*, or open a drawer guarded by a *[[Glyph of Warding (Spell)|glyph of warding]],* or pass through a doorway protected by a *symbol* without effect.

This spell covers and negates any active or triggered magical writing (such as a quickly scribed *[[Symbol of Fear (Spell)|symbol of fear]]* or a triggered *[[Symbol of Death (Spell)|symbol of death]]*), although creatures that have already succumbed to the effect of the writing are unaffected. Once this spell ends, all magical writing in the area can be triggered normally, and active or triggered writings resume their function if they have any duration left.
