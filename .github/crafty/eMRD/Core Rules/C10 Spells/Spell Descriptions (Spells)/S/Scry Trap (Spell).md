You ward a creature against scrying, granting it defenses capable of terribly wounding any would-be scryer. If the subject of this spell comes within 10 feet of a sensor created by a divination (scrying) spell, the *scry trap* automatically activates. The caster of the scrying spell takes 1d6 points of damage per your caster level (maximum 15d6) and is [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the blindness; spell resistance also applies against this effect.

In addition, the caster of the scrying spell must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level) or the scrying spell is dispelled immediately (spell resistance does not apply against this effect). The subject of *scry trap* becomes automatically aware when the spell triggers, although the subject gains no knowledge as to the nature of the scrying spell or its caster.

*Special:* A character with any Mark of Detection dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Medani), casts this spell at +1 caster level.
