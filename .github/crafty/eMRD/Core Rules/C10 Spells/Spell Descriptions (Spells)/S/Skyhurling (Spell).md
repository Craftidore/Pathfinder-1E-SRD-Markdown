You envelop the target creature in a globe of wind and fog and then hurl it violently into the air. You determine where the creature lands, although the landing point must be within the spell's range. The maximum height the victim's flight reaches is equal to 5 feet per caster level, otherwise, the caster chooses the height when casting the spell. When the victim lands, it takes the appropriate amount of falling damage as set by this maximum height.

Creatures may take incidental damage from objects in the path of their trajectory, such as tree branches, flimsy roofs, or other yielding barriers. If this is the case, the victim takes an extra 2d6 points of damage in addition to the standard falling damage.

A creature that would strike an unyielding surface before it reaches the height of its upward fall cannot be targeted by this spell.

Rather than hurl targets into the air, you can use this spell to hurl airborne creatures to the ground. The targeted creature must be within 5 feet/level of the ground, and, if it fails to resist the spell, it is hurled to the ground and takes damage as if it had fallen from the appropriate height.

If you cast this spell outside and the victim does not encounter any yielding barriers during his upward fall, the maximum height reached is doubled (10 ft./caster level).
