For the duration of the spell, the caster’s melee attacks issue forth from any shadow or area of darkness which is within the spell’s radius; he quite literally reaches out of any shadow within the area of effect at will, to strike with impunity.

Each round, the caster can attack any target with the radius of effect as though he were within melee range. He makes all attack rolls as normal, deals damage as appropriate to his weapon (including magical effects, if applicable), and can use any applicable melee feats or special abilities. The caster can use disarm or trip manoeuvres when attacking as well; his opponent can attempt to disarm should the caster fail a disarm check, but he is not subject to retaliatory trip attempts. Likewise, he can strike with unarmed attacks should he so choose, but may not attempt to initiate a grapple. Since the caster’s attacks can literally come from anywhere, his opponents are considered to be flatfooted whenever he makes a melee attack with *greater shadow fangs.* Unlike *shadow fangs*, the caster's threat range for attacks of opportunity extend throughout the affected area.

**GM Note**

Some GMs may feel more comfortable changing the subschool from [[Teleportation Spells|Teleportation]] to [[Shadow Spells|Shadow]]. This change will not really impact the utility of the spell.

This spell is especially powerful when the caster uses any form of darkness or shadow producing magic prior to casting.
