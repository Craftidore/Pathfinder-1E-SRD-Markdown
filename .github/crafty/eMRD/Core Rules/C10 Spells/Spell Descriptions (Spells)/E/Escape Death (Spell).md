When casting this spell, you must specify a locale that you have visited. Henceforth, should you die, you and your gear are immediately transported to that location and you are alive and conscious for 1d4 rounds (during which time you or others may attempt to undo the cause of your demise) before you actually die.

For example, if you have died from reaching a hit point total lower than your Constitution score expressed as a negative number , healing in the form of hit points can restore you. If you have been decapitated, however, much more drastic measures are needed.

Utter destruction of your physical form, such as with a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell or the crushing weight of a 100-ton stone block, likely prohibits any meaningful action on your part (subject to DM discretion) once this spell transports you. It does not prohibit the assistance of others, although a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* likely is needed to bring you back.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** This spell counts towards the total number of contingent spells you are allowed. This spell allows for interplanar travel unlike a simple *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell.
