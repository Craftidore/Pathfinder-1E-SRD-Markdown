One of the caster’s eyes grows out of her head on an eyestalk, becoming like that of a beholder. Due to the mobility of the eye, the caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. More important, the eye has one of the beholder’s eye powers, determined randomly. The caster can use this power as a standard action during the spell’s duration.

Each type of eye produces an effect identical to that of a spell cast by a 13th-level caster, but it follows the rules for a ray. All of these effects have a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 18.

Roll 1d10 to see which eye the caster gains.
