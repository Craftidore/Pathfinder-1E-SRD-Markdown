*A sense of security fills you as you complete the spell. As you touch the intended target of the spell, the feeling lingers for a moment before fading.*

This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete immunity to damage from one of the five energy typesâ€”acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. *Energy immunity* absorbs only hit point damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drowning in acid, being [[Deafened|deafened]] by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice (and thus helpless).

Energy immunity overlaps *[[Protection From Energy (Spell)|protection from energy]]* and *[[Resist Energy (Spell)|resist energy]].* As long as *energy immunity* is in effect, the other spells absorb no damage.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Wu jen 7 to Level per Complete Arcane.
