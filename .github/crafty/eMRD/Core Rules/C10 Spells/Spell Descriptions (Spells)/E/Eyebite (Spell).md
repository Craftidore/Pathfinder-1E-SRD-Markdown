**Target:** One living creature

**Duration:** 1 round/level

Each round, you can target a single living creature, striking it with waves of power. Depending on the target’s HD, this attack has as many as three effects.


| **HD** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 10 or more | [[Sickened]] |
| 5–9 | [[Panicked]], [[Sickened\|sickened]] |
| 4 or less | Comatose, [[Panicked\|panicked]], [[Sickened\|sickened]] |

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

*Sickened:* Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject’s body. A creature affected by this spell remains [[Sickened|sickened]] for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a *[[Remove Disease (Spell)|remove disease]]* or *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* spell, but a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* is effective.

*Panicked:* The subject becomes [[Panicked|panicked]] for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains [[Shaken|shaken]] for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes [[Panicked|panicked]] again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

*Comatose:* The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]* effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.
