The caster infuses a substance with energy and creates a magical version of a drug. The magical version manifests as greenish fumes that rise from the chosen focus. The fumes must then be inhaled as a standard action within 1 round to get the drug’s effects.

The type of drug extracted depends on the substance used.


| **Material** | **Drug Extracted** | **Effect on Focus** |
|---|---|---|
| Metal | Baccaran | Metal’s hardness drops by 1. |
| Stone | Vodare | Stone’s hardness drops by 1. |
| Water | Sannish | Water becomes brackish and foul. |
| Air | Mordayn vapor | Foul odor fills the area (up to 50-ft. radius) for 1 hour. |
| Wood | Mushroom powder | Wood takes on a permanent foul odor |

There may be other drugs that can be extracted with rarer substances, at the DM’s discretion.

*Focus:* 15 lb. or 1 cubic foot of the material in question.
