Translucent, ornate armor surrounds your form. At the time of casting, you may reasonably alter its visual appearance including its color, ornamentation, and reducing its translucency (although it never looks fully solid).

*Elf lord’s battle armor* provides a +8 armor bonus to AC. Unlike mundane armor, this magical battle armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since it is made of force, incorporeal creatures can’t bypass it the way they do normal armor. Armor training has no effect.

Allies within 30 ft. and with line of sight to the caster receive a +1 morale bonus to saving throws and attacks. Additionally, the *elf lord’s battle armor* may provide a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] or [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks, depending on the visual appearance selected at time of casting.
