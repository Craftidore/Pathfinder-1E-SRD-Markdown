*You wriggle your tentacles in a complicated choreography of movement, and your tentacles lengthen.*

This spell lengthens your tentacles, increasing the reach of your tentacle attacks by 5 feet. The tentacles attack as normal. If you do not already have tentacles, the spell has no effect on you.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell affects both natural tentacles and those created through magical means such as spells or wondrous items.

*House Rule: Extend tentacles* can be made permanent with a *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
