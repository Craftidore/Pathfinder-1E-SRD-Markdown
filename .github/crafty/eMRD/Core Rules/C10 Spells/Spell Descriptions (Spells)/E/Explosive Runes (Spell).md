You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object  bearing written information. The *explosive runes* detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the *explosive runes* (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the *explosive runes* is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the *explosive runes* were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the *explosive runes.* Likewise, you can remove the *explosive runes* whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the *explosive runes* and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

Magic traps such as *explosive runes* are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart *explosive runes*. The DC to find magic traps using [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for *explosive runes*.
