You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you succeed at a save against an enchantment effect, you identify the effect as if you had succeeded at a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check to do so. Furthermore, you can choose to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks to convince others that you failed your save and are under the enchantmentâ€™s effects. A creature that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 4 to Level.
