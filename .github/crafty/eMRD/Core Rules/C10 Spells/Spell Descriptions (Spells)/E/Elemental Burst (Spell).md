When you cast this spell, you designate a target composed of one of the five wu jen elements—earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. The target then releases magical energy in a sudden, explosive burst, as follows:

*Wood, Metal, or Earth:* The target throws off sharp slivers and fragments; creatures within the burst take 1d8 points of damage (Reflex save for half damage).

*Fire:* The target shoots out glowing sparks that deal 1d8 points of fire damage to creatures within the burst (Reflex save for half damage).

*Water:* Water pushes out in a fierce wave, knocking creatures within the area prone unless they make successful Reflex saves. Creatures get a +4 bonus on their saving throws for each size category they are larger than Medium, or a –4 penalty for each size category smaller than Medium. Exceptionally stable creatures, such as dwarves or creatures with four legs, get an additional +4 bonus.

The spell does not noticeably affect the structure or form of the target object.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1 to Level.
