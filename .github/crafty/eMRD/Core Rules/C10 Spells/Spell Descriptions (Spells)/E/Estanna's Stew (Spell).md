This spell calls upon [[Estanna]], goddess of hearth and home, to fill a specially crafted stewpot with a potent healing stew. The caster must be hold the pot in hand when *Estannaâ€™s stew* is cast; otherwise, the spell fails and is wasted.

The spell creates one serving per two caster levels (maximum 5). A single serving heals 1d6+1 points of damage and requires a standard action to consume. Any portion of the stew that is not consumed disappears after 1 hour.

The stew can be splashed onto a single undead creature within 10 feet. If a ranged touch attack succeeds, the undead creature takes 1d6+1 points of damage per serving splashed on it. The undead creature can apply spell resistance and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
