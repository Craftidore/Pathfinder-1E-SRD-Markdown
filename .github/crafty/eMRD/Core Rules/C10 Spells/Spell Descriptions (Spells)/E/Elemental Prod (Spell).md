The need to control elementals more easily during the binding process led to the creation of an infusion that imbues a staff or pole with the ability to move elementals.

As a standard action, the wielder of an *elemental prod* can gesture with the staff, indicating the starting and ending position for a target elemental creature. The total distance covered must be no greater than 10 feet + 5 feet/2 caster levels. The target creature immediately understands the command to move, and it can elect to be pushed along without resisting. Elementals that choose to resist take 1d6 points of damage and are moved only 5 feet in the desired direction.
