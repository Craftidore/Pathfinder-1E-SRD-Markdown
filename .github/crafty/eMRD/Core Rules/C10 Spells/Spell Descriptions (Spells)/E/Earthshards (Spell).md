*A pillar of rock explodes upward from the ground.*

Each round as a standard action, you conjure a pillar of rock that bursts from a stone or earthen surface anywhere within the spell’s range. Each pillar fi lls a 5-foot square and grows to a height of 20 feet or until it hits a barrier such as a ceiling or wall. A Large or smaller creature in a square where a pillar erupts must succeed on a Reflex save or be carried upward by the force of the pillar. If a pillar is created in a room with a ceiling height of 20 feet or less, the rock slams into the ceiling, dealing 4d6 points of damage to any creature atop it.

In a location with a ceiling height of more than 20 feet, a creature carried up by a pillar must succeed on a DC 20 Arcobatics (3.5 Balance) check or fall from the top of the pillar when it reaches its maximum height. On a failed check, the creature plummets to the ground, taking 2d6 points of damage from the fall.

You can also cause a pillar to erupt from a vertical surface, in which case any creatures in the pillar’s path must succeed on their Reflex saves or take 2d6 points of damage and be knocked prone.

The pillar created is permanent and has AC 3, hardness 8, and 900 hit points. A pillar can be climbed with a DC 20 [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *bones of the earth* to *earthshards* to avoid duplication.
