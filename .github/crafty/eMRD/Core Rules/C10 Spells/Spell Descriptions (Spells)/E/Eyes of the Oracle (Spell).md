*Vague, translucent shadows of your body's form move just out of sync with your own motions, a visible sign that you exist in two places in time.*

You can see into the future, slightly anticipating your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +2 insight bonus on Reflex saves.

Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can ready a single standard action regardless of the number of actions taken this turn. Thus, you can move at your movement rate, make a single attack, and then at the end of your turn ready an action to cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action. This behaves as a readied action in all other ways, including the change in your initiative, if you take the readied action, the spell's effect ends immediately.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, your bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves improves to +3.
