You coat the subject with protective energy of an emerald green hue. This energy shield does not affect the subject's movement, senses, or ability to cast spells. While surrounded by this energy, the subject is immune to any natural or magical effect that causes deafness and to all language-dependent, mind-affecting spells and effects. The subject also gains sonic resistance 10 and a +4 bonus on saves against all spells and effects with the sonic descriptor to which it has not already been rendered immune.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is known as *Nezram's emerald energy shield* in the Forgotten Realms.
