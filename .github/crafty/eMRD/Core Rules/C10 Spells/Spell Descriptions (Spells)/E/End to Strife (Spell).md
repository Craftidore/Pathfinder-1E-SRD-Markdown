This spell creates an invisible aura of divine power around the caster. All intelligent creatures within the spell’s area suddenly become aware that any hostile actions they take will be met with dire consequences.

Any creature in the spell’s area that makes an attack takes 20d6 points of damage. The caster decides whether the spell deals lethal or nonlethal damage but cannot change her mind once the spell is cast. Creatures with multiple attacks take the damage after every attack they make.

Targets outside the area of the spell may freely attack creatures in the area without taking damage from this spell.

**GM Note**

This spell is particularly effective when its caster's allies have an existing *protection* effect (cf. *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]*) in effect.
