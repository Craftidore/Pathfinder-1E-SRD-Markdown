*The air wavers and shimmers, finally coalescing into a large cube of glistening ooze.*

*Engulfing terror* creates a gelatinous cube in a space you designate. The space must be large enough to accommodate the creature. If not, the spell automatically fails.

Upon appearing, the cube acts on your turn, attacking the nearest living creature each round. You have no control over it and cannot direct it. The gelatinous cube remains until it is destroyed or has no remaining targets to attack, at which point it moves away in a random direction.
