The caster can give the subject demon-haunted dreams so vivid and frightening that sleep provides no rest and the subject eventually turns to suicide. The caster must have a chunk of flesh from the target and succeed at a touch attack when she casts *plague of nightmares.* If the target fails the Fortitude save, the spell begins to take effect. Thereafter, the caster must chant for 12 hours per week and pay the corruption cost each week to maintain the spell.

The subject begins to feel the effect of this spell the next time he sleeps, as nightmares of evil gods and demons plague him. These nightmares continue each night, and each night the subject takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage and gains no natural healing for that day. When the subject reaches 0 Charisma, he enters a trance in which he mentally offers his soul to a demon to be devoured. That night the subject dies and is beyond even a *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell.

The subject gets a new saving throw each day to resist the spell, and one success is enough to end the nightmares. If the spell ultimately succeeds, the focus disappears, alerting the caster that the subject is dead.

*Focus:* A fresh or preserved (still bloody) 1-ounce portion of another creatureâ€™s flesh.

*Corruption Cost:* 1d6 points of Strength damage, taken all at once at the end of each week.
