When this spell is cast, it creates a radiant cone of pure light, drawing it from the spirit of the spellcaster and channeling it through an artifact of light. Against nonlawful creatures, the spell has multiple effects, depending upon the creature's alignment.

If the spellcaster is on his home plane, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instanly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least one day per caster level.

Any creatures of neutrality (neutral good, neutral, neutral evil) caught within the cone of light are [[Dazed|dazed]] 1d6 rounds and are dealt 3d6 points of damage (a successful Will save negates the daze effect and reduces the damage by one-half).

Against creatures of chaos (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil) *perfect light* deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a Will save is successful. If the creature fails on its Will save, it is subject to additional effects depending upon its HD:


| **HD** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 15 or more | [[Dazed]] |
| Less than 15 | [[Stunned]], [[Dazed\|dazed]] |
| Less than 10 | [[Paralyzed]], [[Stunned\|stunned]], [[Dazed\|dazed]] |
| Less than 5 | Killed, [[Paralyzed\|paralyzed]], [[Stunned\|stunned]], [[Dazed\|dazed]] |

 The effects are cumulative.

**[[Dazed]]****:** The creature is [[Dazed|dazed]] 1d6 rounds.

**[[Stunned]]****:** The creature is [[Stunned|stunned]] 2d6 rounds.

**[[Paralyzed]]****:** The creature is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 2d6 minutes.

**Killed:** Living creatures die. Constructs and undead creatures are destroyed.

*Focus:* An artifact or intelligent magic item (minimum caster level 15th) of lawful alignment.

*XP CosI:* 500 XP.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Magius's light of truth* to *perfect light* for campaign continuity.

In the Dragonlance campaign, this spell was used by Palin to help defeat Chaos during the Chaos War. *Magius's light of truth* was developed by the famous war-mage during the time of Huma, though it had never before been used until it was given to Palin by his uncle, the archmage Raistlin Majere, with the permission of the Orders of High Sorcery
