Spells cast on other targets are vulnerable to *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* as normal. The GM may allow other spells to be made permanent.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* When *permanency* is cast to make another spell permanent; the other spell’s duration is considered to be permanent (subject to a *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* by a caster of equal level or higher than the caster at the time *permanency* was cast) and the *permanency* spell itself is expended; ie., no longer subject to any form of *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* or other spells which might interact with it (for example: *[[Spellslayer Arrow (Spell)|spellslayer arrow]]*).

The GM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell (see the rules for spell research for details). If the GM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that you never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of your research.

Spells in red above are spells that have been researched in campaign and added to the list. The XP Cost column above is for those campaigns that have house ruled in using XP to craft items and make spells permanent.

**[https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2lbds?Permanency-Scroll-with-UMD](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2lbds?Permanency-Scroll-with-UMD)**

**Can UMD be used to give you a Caster Level? The answer is yes.**

Found under UMD.

*Emulate a Class Feature: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).*

*Use a Scroll: Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check.*

So, you would need at the very least a:

\* An INT of 15, or a UMD of 30 to emulate the 15 INT.

\* UMD of 29 to emulate the Caster Level of 9th.

\* UMD of 29 to cast the 5th level *Permanency*.

\* UMD of 23 to cast 2nd level *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|See Invisibility]]*.

**So yes it would take 4 rolls, but yes.**

Does allowing the caster level requirement for permanency to be UMD'd break it (and the game)? 

Caster level guidelines:

1st = 9th, 2nd = 10th, 3rd = 11th, 4th = 12th, 5th = 13th, 6th = 14th, 7th = 15th?
