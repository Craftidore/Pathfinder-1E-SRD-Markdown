*The weapon glows faintly, and seems to settle more firmly into its sheathe.*

The weapon targeted by this spell remains stuck in its sheath, holder, quiver, or whatever object is used to hold it when not in use. A “weapon” is defined as any manufactured weapon. No amount of physical effort can draw it forth before the spell expires or is dispelled. The precise nature of the holder doesn’t matter; it can be an ornate sheath, or simply a belt through which the weapon has been stuck. The weapon glows faintly for the duration of the spell.

This spell has no effect on weapons currently held in the hand or otherwise not contained in some sort of holder. If the bearer of the targeted weapon is attacked, he is immediately entitled to a second save to overcome the effect and draw the weapon. The bearer can repeat this save in every round that the assault continues.

*Material Component:* A small strip of cloth or a leather thong.
