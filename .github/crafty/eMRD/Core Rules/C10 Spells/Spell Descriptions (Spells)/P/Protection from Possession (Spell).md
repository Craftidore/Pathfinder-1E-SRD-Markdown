This spell wards a creature against mental control and possession attempts. The spell blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a *[[Magic Jar (Spell)|magic jar]]* attack or certain ghost feats) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire’s supernatural domination ability, which works similarly to *[[Dominate Person (Spell)|dominate person]]*). The protection does not prevent a vampire’s domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the *protection from possession* effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the spell keeps out a possessing life force, but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.

*Arcane Material Component:* A bit of powdered silver, which is used to mark the forehead of the target creature.
