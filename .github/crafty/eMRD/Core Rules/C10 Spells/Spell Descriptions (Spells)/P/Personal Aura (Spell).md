This spell grants the caster the ability to perfectly sense the immediate space surrounding his body, generally oneâ€™s own clothes and pockets. Once cast the caster knows the precise location of every item on his person. This allows the subject to find and retrieve any item he carries as a move-equivalent action, even if said item is buried in a deep pocket amongst similarly sized and textured items. Additionally, the caster receives a +10 insight bonus on any roll made to detect any type of invading movement or creature on his person. This would include, for example, a spider crawling up his back, a scorpion hiding in a deep pocket or the hand of a thief picking his pocket.

*Personal aura* can be made permanent with the *[[Permanency (Spell)|permanency]]* spell.
