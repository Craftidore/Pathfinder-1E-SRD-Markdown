*Angry red boils spread across the skin of your enemy.*

This spell causes the subject's skin to erupt in a blistering rash accompanied by a maddening itch. An affected creature is [[Sickened|sickened]] while the spell lasts. In addition, if the creature takes any actions on its turn other than free, swift, or immediate actions, it takes 1d8 points of damage at the end of its turn.

While affected by this spell, a creature takes a â€“2 penalty on saves to resist the distraction effect of any creature of the swarm subtype (in addition to the save penalty from the spell's sickening effect).

If a subject under the effect *of prickling torment* is targeted by *[[Fever Dream (Spell)|fever dream]]*, the two spells interact to create a greater effect. See the *[[Fever Dream (Spell)|fever dream]]* spell for details.
