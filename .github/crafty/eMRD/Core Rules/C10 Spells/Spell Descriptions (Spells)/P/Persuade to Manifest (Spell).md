This spell sends a powerful signal to the soul of a creature that has died and not yet manifested on the Material Plane or passed on to the True Afterlife. The soul immediately appears on the [[Ethereal Plane]] and can immediately make a Wisdom check with a +10 morale bonus to manifest on the Material Plane. If that check is failed, the ghost may make Wisdom checks normally every minute to manifest.
