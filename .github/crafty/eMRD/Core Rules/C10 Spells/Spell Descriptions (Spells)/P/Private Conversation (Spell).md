The targets can converse without anyone overhearing what they are saying. Characters who can read lips might still be able to determine what is said, but no [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check can possibly allow one to overhear the conversation. While under the effect of this spell, a character can speak to someone not affected by this spell, but all can hear that conversation normally. Only when an affected character speaks to another affected character does the conversation remain private.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Assassin 1, Bard 1 to Level.
