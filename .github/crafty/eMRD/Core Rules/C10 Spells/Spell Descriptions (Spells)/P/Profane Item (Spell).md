*Negative forces flow through your hands and into the object you hold, filling it with a darkly glowing power that gleams for a moment, then subsides.*

You imbue a touched object with latent negative energy. If the item thereafter touches or is touched by an animal or plant of any alignment, or by an outsider or shapechanger of good alignment, the negative energy discharges with a loud snap, dealing 1d4 points of negative energy damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to that creature.

If the creature discharging the item is an animal or plant, it must save against fear or flee in terror (or cower, if it cannot move) for 1d4 minutes. On a successful save, the creature is merely [[Shaken|shaken]] for the same length of time.

If the creature discharging the item is a shapechanger, an image of its natural form or most common alternate form appears for 1d4 rounds, superimposed over its body, revealing its true nature to all witnesses.

*Profane item* counters and dispels *[[Sacred Item (Spell)|sacred item]]*.
