A *portal reformat* spell permanently removes or adds one or more keys to a *portal* (see Portals in Chapter 2 of the *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting*). The caster must have studied the *portal* with the *[[Analyze Portal (Spell)|analyze portal]]* spell (or some similar means) and must know its properties before he can add or remove any keys.

**Removing a Key:** Removing a key from a *portal* changes it from a *portal* activated only by that specific key to either a *portal* that cannot be activated at all or a *portal* that can be activated by any creature (caster’s choice). If the key controlled the behavior of the *portal,* the caster can decide which behavior to remove. For example, in the case of a variable *portal* that leads to one destination if activated by a drow and another destination if activated by any other creature, the caster could remove either destination, making it a *portal* that sends any other creature to one destination or a drow to one destination.

**Adding a Key:** You can add a key to an existing *portal* to prevent it from being activated unless the creature attempting to activate it has the key. If you designate a specific object or type of object as the key, you must have that object on hand for the casting of the spell. You can also add a key that changes the behavior of a variable *portal,* if you so choose. For example, if a variable *portal* formerly operated one way for drow and another way for all other creatures, you could add a key that is nearly impossible to obtain for the “all other creatures” function, effectively changing the *portal* into a drow-only *portal*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 9, Wizard 9 to Level.
