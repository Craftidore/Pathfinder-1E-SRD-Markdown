This spell functions like *[[Planar Binding, Lesser (Spell)|lesser planar binding]]*, except that you call a single creature of 1 HD or fewer. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

This spell is often taught to apprentice conjurers specializing in planar binding. Along with the ability to prepare a magic circle, they begin to learn their craft by summoning gremlins and planar vermin.
