When you communicate using the Telepathy discipline, you transmit a mental shock that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to the creature you are communicating with. The telepathic link with the target must already be established, and the saving throw involved with this spell is in addition to any save required to resist the initial link.
