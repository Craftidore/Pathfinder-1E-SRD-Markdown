*By calling on the ancient and timeless magical energies of the elements, you complete the spell. Immediately your form begins to change, taking on aspects of the element you envisioned while casting the spell.*

When you cast this spell, choose an element (air, earth, fire, or water). You assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a Medium elemental of the chosen element. *Primal form* also grants you the elemental subtype appropriate to the chosen element.

You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities. There is a 25% chance that critical hits and sneak attacks scored on you are negated, as if you were wearing armor with the light fortification special ability. You cannot cast spells, and you lose any spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities of your own form. You gain additional abilities depending on the element you chose when you cast the spell:

*Air:* Fly speed 20 feet (perfect).

*Earth:* Damage reduction 5/â€”.

*Fire:* 1d4 fire damage, resistance to fire 10, burn.

*Water:* Swim 90 feet, drench.

Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional.
