This spell functions as *[[Polymorph (Spell)|polymorph]]* except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as *[[Beast Shape IV (Spell)|beast shape IV]]*. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as *[[Elemental Body III (Spell)|elemental body III]].* If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as *[[Alter Self (Spell)|alter self]]*. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as *[[Plant Shape II (Spell)|plant shape II]].* If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as *[[Form of the Dragon I (Spell)|form of the dragon I]].* The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.
