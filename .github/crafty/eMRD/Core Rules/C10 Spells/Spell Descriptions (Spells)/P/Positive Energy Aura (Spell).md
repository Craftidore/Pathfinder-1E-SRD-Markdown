*You speak the eldritch phrases of power and an aura of white, shining, positive energy surrounds you.*

Each round on your turn, every living creature within 10 feet of you gains 1 hit point per three caster levels (maximum 5). Creatures canâ€™t exceed their full normal hit point totals as a result of this effect. Undead creatures take 2 points of damage per round. Characters with immunity to positive energy effects are not affected by this aura. A *positive energy aura* does not affect you.
