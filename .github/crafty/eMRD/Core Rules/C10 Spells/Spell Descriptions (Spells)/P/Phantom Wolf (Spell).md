**Frightful Presence (Su)** 30-ft. radius, Will DC 24 negates. Creatures with less than 12 HD become [[Frightened|frightened]] for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. An opponent that succeeds on the save is immune to that same phantom wolf’s frightful presence for 24 hours.

You conjure forth an incorporeal white wolf with abnormally large, frosty jaws. This *phantom wolf* follows your mental commands, acting on your behalf as long as it remains within range and you continue to concentrate on it.

A *phantom wolf* appears where you designate and acts as you direct on your turn. You don’t need to maintain line of effect once the spell is cast, but the spell ends if the *phantom wolf* is ever outside the spell’s range.
