*You cast the spell and sprinkle silver dust around you. Where it lands the dust sparkles and evaporates, and the elemental region around you calms and becomes more hospitable.*

This spell creates an area around the subject creature that emulates its native planar environment. Thus, a character hailing from the Material Plane would have normal gravity, temperature, magic, and so on. This spell cast on a native of the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] would make the area around the creature mimic its home planeâ€™s normal gravity, a mild neutral alignment, enhanced shadow spells, and impeded light or fire spells.
