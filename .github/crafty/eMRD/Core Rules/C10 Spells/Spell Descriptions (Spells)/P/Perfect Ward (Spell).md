Any subject creature or object touched is protected with a magical ward for twenty-four hours. The ward transports any creature touching the subject 1d100 × 10 miles away instantaneously in a random direction unless the creature succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (spell resistance also applies). Even creatures who make their saves are transported away 1d20 + 10 feet in a random direction. The creatures arrive safely in the new destination and are never transported into a solid object or into mid-air (if these are the only options, the spell does not function). Even if a subject with this ward cast upon it wants to be touched, the spell’s effects remain the same. Creatures that touch the warded subject multiple times must attempt a saving throw each time.

If cast on an area, the duration becomes one day per level instead of twenty-four hours, and the ward affects anyone entering the area.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the cases where this spell as been cast as an area ward, creatures able to *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]* or even see it (cf. *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]*) will realize there is an abjuration in effect but nothing more. Also, in such cases, rogues may detect a magical trap, but have no way of disabling it.
