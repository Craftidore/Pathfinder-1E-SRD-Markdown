You create a translucent blue protective shell around yourself and your surroundings. The hemispherical shell moves with you, and you can resize it as a free action every round, up to its maximum size. Those within the shell remain impervious to all ranged attacks, whether physical (arrows, javelins, falling boulders) or magical (Eldritch Bolts, *[[Searing Light (Spell)|searing light]]*, dragon breath, gaze attacks). Likewise, such attacks cannot be launched from within the confines of the shell at targets outside its area. No creature can pass through the barrier, either way, without your conscious consent (although it is a free action for you to allow it), so melee attacks through the shell are impossible as well. (Creatures with your mental permission can move through the shell and make melee attacks, but then they are outside its confines.) Creatures cannot pass through the shell more than once per casting of the spell, even with your permission. You can never make attacks through the shell or move outside it without ending the spell. Environmental threats, from poison gas to horrible cold or a raging fire, do not affect those within the area of the shell—the interior always stays safe and comfortable.

Should you move, you do not “drag” creatures or objects with you. If your movement or reshaping of the shell would cause something to no longer be within its confines, the shell passes through it harmlessly. Thus, the shell can pass through walls or stationary objects without problem, and its size is not subject to the limits of the surrounding area. Even magical movement—such as teleportation or creatures moving incorporeally—does not allow passage through the shell if you do no wish it. Likewise, conjured creatures, objects, or energies cannot appear within the area of the shell without your consent if the conjurer is outside it.
