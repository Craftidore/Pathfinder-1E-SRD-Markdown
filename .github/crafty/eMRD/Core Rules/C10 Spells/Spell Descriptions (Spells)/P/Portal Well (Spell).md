When you step into a *portal* affected by this spell, you can wait for a short time within an extradimensional space between the *portal*’s entrance and exit. This spell only works on a *portal* you are able to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target *portal* doesn’t work for elves, you can’t use this spell on the *portal.* 

The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to that created by a *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]* spell but can only hold you and your gear (up to your maximum heavy load). When the spell ends, you exit the *portal* at either your point of entry or the *portal*’s destination.

While within this extradimensional space, you can see the origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry (much like viewing the Material Plane from the [[Ethereal Plane]]). *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|Dispel magic]]* or *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]** seal* traps you within the extradimensional space for as long as the *portal* is negated or sealed (as would surrounding both ends with a dead magic area). *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|Disjunction]]* or some other effect that destroys a *portal* outright forcibly ejects you from one random end of the *portal* and deals 5d6 points of damage to you.

This spell originated in Shaundakul’s church and is hard to find elsewhere.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:***** Spell rarity changed from rare to very rare due to its limited spread. There are known copies of this spell in at least two spellbooks in Greyhawk City.
