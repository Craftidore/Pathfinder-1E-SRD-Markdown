Developed by particularly haughty elves long ago (but usable by all races), this strange spell allows you to select a specific race or humanoid subtype, such as human, dwarf, halfling, or goblinoid (or in the case of nonhumanoids, a type, such as dragon, giant, or fey). Within the bounds of the spell, only creatures of the specified race or type can take actions. All other creatures remain frozen within an energy fieldâ€”held in a stasis that does not allow them to be harmed or affected in any way.
