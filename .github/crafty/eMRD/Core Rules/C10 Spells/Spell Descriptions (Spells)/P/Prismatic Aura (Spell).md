*You are surrounded in a flashing aura of multiple colors.*

The *prismatic aura* spell obscures your image, offering you concealment. In addition, any creature that hits you with a nonreach melee weapon is subject to a random prismatic effect. Roll 1d8 and consult the table under *[[Prismatic Spray (Spell)|prismatic spray]]*; reroll any result of 8, since a *prismatic aura* can't generate two effects at once. Each time an effect is expended, that color disappears from the *aura* (reroll if it comes up again on the table). Thus a *prismatic aura* can affect a maximum of seven attackers before it disappears, and the spell ends. An attacker is entitled to any applicable saves, and spell resistance applies to this effect.
