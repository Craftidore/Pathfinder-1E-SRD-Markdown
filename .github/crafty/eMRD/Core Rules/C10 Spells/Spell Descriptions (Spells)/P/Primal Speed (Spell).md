*A shower of sparks flies off your shoulders, cascading to the ground and dinging to your anus and legs.*

This spell draws upon the natural reflexes of hunters and prey, giving you the ability to react to danger as more primitive beings might. You gain a +5 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to all your speeds.

If *primal speed* is active on you at the same time as *[[Primal Hunter (Spell)|primal hunter]]**,* *[[Primal Instinct (Spell)|primal instinct]]**,* or *[[Primal Senses (Spell)|primal senses]]**,* you gain uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature). If all four of these spells are active on you at the same time, you gain improved uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature; your barbarian level for the purpose of being flanked equals your caster level).

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, you can cast this spell as an immediate action.
