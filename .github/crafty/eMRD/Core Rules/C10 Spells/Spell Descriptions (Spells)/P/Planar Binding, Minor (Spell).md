This spell functions like *[[Planar Binding, Lesser (Spell)|lesser planar binding]]**,* except that you call a single creature of 3 HD or fewer, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 1. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

This spell is often used to summon mephits, lemurs, or very weak elementals. Conjurers specializing in planar binding often make great use of this spell.
