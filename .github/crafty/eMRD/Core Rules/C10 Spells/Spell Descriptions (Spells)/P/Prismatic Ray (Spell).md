A ray of light made of shifting color springs from your hand. Its effect varies depending on which color is dominant when the beam strikes its target; the ray may inflict damage as listed below, or it may impose a condition on the target.

Maximum damage is always 15d6 hp. Conditions inflicted by the green, blue, violet, and multi-colored rays last 1 round per caster level. A successful save halves the damage or negates the effect, whichever is applicable.

On a critical hit, the caster may choose the color of the beam which hits the target. Otherwise, roll a d8 to determine the rayâ€™s effects, as listed below.

**Table 2-12: Prismatic Ray Beams**

| 1 | Red | 1d6 hp fire damage/level | Reflex |

| 3 | Yellow | 1d6 hp electricity damage/level | Reflex |
