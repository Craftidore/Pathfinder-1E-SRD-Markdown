*You entire body sparkles as color fades from your form. A stiff breeze picks up as you collapse into thousands of particles of sand, sent flying on the warm wind.*

You and all your belongings become a flying cloud of sand, swirling and formless yet retaining your consciousness. You lose your normal shape and become a sand cloud, taking up the same space you do in your normal form. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet (perfect maneuverability), but you lose any other movement rates you had in your normal form. Treat this otherwise as *[[Gaseous Form (Spell)|gaseous form]]*. 

If you end your movement in the same space as another creature, that creature is [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Spell resistance does not apply against this effect.

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* effect (as the spell) as a swift action. Doing so ends the duration of *passage of the shifting sands.*

*Special:* A blue dragon capable of casting 6th-level sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
