*With a word, you sap strength from your target.*

You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become weaker, dealing 2 points of damage to its Strength, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The specific effect and duration of the spell depend on the target’s current hit point total, as shown below. Any creature that currently has 75 or more hit points is unaffected by *power word weaken*.


| **Hit Points** | **Effect/Duration** |
|---|---|
| 25 or less | The Strength damage is ability drain instead |
| 26–50 | Strength damage lasts 1d4+1 minutes |
| 51–75 | Strength damage lasts 1d4+1 rounds |
