To invoke this spell, you speak the name of an offense that your target has committed. Then you speak the inevitable doom that will fall upon her as a result of her transgression. (The target need neither understand nor even hear this pronouncement.) An affected target takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and checks for the duration of the spell. If the offense you named was committed against you personally (although not necessarily against you alone), the target also has a 50% chance of losing all actions on her turn for the duration of the spell. 

The spell’s power can be more difficult to resist, depending on who suffered from the offense specified by the casting. If you were personally affected by the offense (in the DM’s judgment), then the target can only hope to reduce the deleterious effects of the spell by half on a successful Will save. You receive a +4 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the spell resistance of any creature whose crime affected you personally. A successful save in these circumstances results in the target taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and checks. In addition, she has a 25% chance to lose all her actions for the duration of the spell.

Any target whose offense did not affect you personally gets her full spell resistance, and a successful Will save negates the effects of the *pronouncement of fate*.
