*You speak a word to make your target ungainly and awkward.*

You utter a single word of power that instantly causes one creature of your choice to become clumsier, dealing 2 points of damage to its Dexterity, whether the creature can hear the word or not. The specific effect and duration of the spell depend on the target’s current hit point total, as shown below. Any creature that currently has 75 or more hit points is unaffected by *power word maladroit*.


| **Hit Points** | **Effect/Duration** |

| 25 or less | The Dexterity damage is ability drain instead |
| 26–50 | Dexterity damage lasts 1d4+1 minutes |
| 51–75 | Dexterity damage lasts 1d4+1 rounds |
