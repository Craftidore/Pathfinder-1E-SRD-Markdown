*You cloak your surroundings with phantasmagoric figures, creating a horrific dreamscape.*

You make any terrain look, sound, and smell like something out of a nightmare. Writhing vegetation, disembodied limbs, animated corpses, and smoking pits cover every surface. Miasmic vapors fill the air, along with various foul stenches.

The nightmare terrain you create is mostly illusory, but the obstacles are partially real. Creatures within, entering, or viewing the area are entitled to Will saves to discern the illusion. Creatures that fail their saves become [[Entangled|entangled]].

Regardless of the outcome of the save, creatures within 5 feet have concealment, while those 10 feet or farther away have total concealment. Furthermore, as long as you are within the area of this spell, you can attempt [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks even while being observed. (Other creatures don't gain this benefit.)
