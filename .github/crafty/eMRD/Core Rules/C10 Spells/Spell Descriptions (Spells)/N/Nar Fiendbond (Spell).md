You turn the subject into a half-fiend by imbuing it with the essence of the infernal planes. The subject can have no more character levels than you do, and it must either be willing to undergo the transformation or be restrained in some manner. Upon completion of the spell, the subject can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the half-fiend template. In addition, the subject's type changes to outsider, and the moral component of its alignment changes to evil. For the purpose of this spell, treat the half-fiend template as an acquired template rather than an inherited one.

The newly created half-fiend also gains a +4 level adjustment, raising the XP required for it to achieve its next character level. For example, a 5th-level sorcerer who becomes a half-fiend by means of this spell becomes a 9th-level character who needs 45,000 XP to gain his sixth class level.

You cannot cast *Nar fiendbond* on yourself.

*Arcane Material Component:* Precious gems with a total value equal to the XP cost of the spell.

*XP Cost:* 500 XP per character level of the half-fiend created.
