You specify a spell that you can cast of 4th level (BoXM: 8th level) or lower; for the duration, no one may successfully cast that spell in the area. Casters outside the area can still cast the spell normally, but all within the area remain immune to its effects. The effect is suppressed if it comes within the *nonesuch spellâ€™*s area. For example, if a wizard casts *nonesuch spell* and specifies *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]*, no one may cast *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]* within 50 feet of her, no creature within 50 feet of the wizard can be affected by *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]*, and any creature already under the compulsion of *[[Charm Monster (Spell)|charm monster]]* coming within 50 feet of the wizard can ignore the effects of the *charm* while remaining in the area.

You may have only one *nonesuch spell* cast at any time.
