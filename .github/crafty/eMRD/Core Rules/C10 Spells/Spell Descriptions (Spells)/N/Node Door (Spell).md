You instantly transfer yourself from your current node to any other node of the same type that you have visited. You always arrive at the exact spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by describing your destination (for example, “the Shadow Weave node in the garden at the Temple of Old Night”). After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn.

If you arrive in a node that is already partially occupied by a newly added object, you arrive in the closest clear space in that node. If the node is completely filled or has been destroyed by any means, you bounce to the next closest node of the same type (determined randomly or by the DM). Each such “bounce” deals 2d6 points of damage to you and any who accompany you.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You can also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels; a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells for which the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

*Special:* You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this spell.
