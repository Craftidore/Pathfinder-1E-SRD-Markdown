*You cast the spell, and the surrounding shadows shift at your command, flying toward your targets and wrapping themselves around them.*

This spell gives the subjects concealment, but the shifting magic shadows also inhibit the subjectsâ€™ ability to ascertain their surroundings. The subjects can see only 5 feet through the shadows that coat them, and foes within that range have concealment from the subjects. Darkvision does not penetrate a *net of shadows*.
