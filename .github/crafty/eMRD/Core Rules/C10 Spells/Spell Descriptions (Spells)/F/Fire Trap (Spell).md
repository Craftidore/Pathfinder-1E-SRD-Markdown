*Fire trap* creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A *fire trap* spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.

When casting *fire trap,* you select a point on the object as the spell’s center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.

A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spell does not bypass a *fire trap*. An unsuccessful *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.

You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.

Magic traps such as *fire trap* are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill to find a *fire trap* and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid’s *fire trap* or DC 29 for the arcane version).
