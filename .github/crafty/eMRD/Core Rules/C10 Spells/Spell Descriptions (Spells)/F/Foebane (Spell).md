*Holding aloft the weapon, you name the kind of creature you wish to slay. With a flash, the weapon takes on a blue glow that quickly fades to a barely perceptible aura surrounding it.*

When you cast this spell, choose one of your favored enemies. Against creatures of the selected enemy kind, the weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. Furthermore, while you wield the weapon, you gain a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against effects created by creatures of that kind.

The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand for any reason. You cannot have more than one foebane weapon active at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell.

This spell is not cumulative with any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts.
