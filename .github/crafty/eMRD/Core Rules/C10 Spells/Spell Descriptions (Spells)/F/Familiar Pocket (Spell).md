*You move your hand along the mouth of the pocket intended for your familiar, and a line of glowing white energy follows in its wake. The glow fades, and the space seems strangely larger inside than a normal pocket.*

When you cast this spell, a garment or container becomes a safe haven for a Tiny or smaller familiar. The spell turns the target pocket into a comfortable extradimensional space (about 1 cubic foot). The familiar can fit inside the space without creating any noticeable bulge in the item. Whenever the familiar is touching you, you can whisk it inside the space as a free action by speaking a command word chosen by you when the spell is cast. If the familiar can speak, it can command itself inside. As a free action, you can call the familiar forth or it can leave the space on its own.

Once inside, the familiar has total cover and total concealment, and as a free action, you or the familiar can further seal the space to make it airtight and waterproof. The air supply inside the sealed space lasts for 1 hour, but with the pocket unsealed, the familiar can remain inside indefinitely. The familiar cannot attack or cast spells from within the space, but can use supernatural or spell-like abilities as normal (provided they donâ€™t require line of sight, which the pocket blocks). You continue to gain the special ability granted by your familiar. While inside the pocket, the familiar continues to benefit from the share spells ability as if it were adjacent to you.

The spell ends if the *familiar pocket* is placed within or taken into another extradimensional space (such as a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*). If your familiar is within the pocket when the spell duration expires or if the spell ends abnormally (as above), the familiar appears in your space unharmed.

*Material Component:* A tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half twist and fastened at the ends.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Witch 1 to Level.
