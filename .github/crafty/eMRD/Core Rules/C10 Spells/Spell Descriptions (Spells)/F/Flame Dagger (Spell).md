*You evoke the spell and a blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand, ready to be used as a weapon.*

You create a bladelike beam that you can wield as if it were a dagger. Attacks with a *flame dagger* are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +10). Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A *flame dagger* can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on.

This spell does not function underwater.
