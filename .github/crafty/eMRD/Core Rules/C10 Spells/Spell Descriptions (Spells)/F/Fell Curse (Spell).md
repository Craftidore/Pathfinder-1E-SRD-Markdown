*You place a powerful curse on a single item.*

Once cast, this spell does not activate until such time as an attempt to identify any magics upon the "cursed" item is made using either an *[[Identify (Spell)|identify]]* spell or the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill. When triggered, this curse causes the one attempt to do so to suffer a ‐5 penalty on their next Will save. 

This curse is particularly effective when cast in conjunction with a *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]** spell*.

**GM Note**

*History*: This spell was developed by the archmage Melandrue, a secretive wizard who was obsessed to the point of paranoia about being watched or scried upon. He used it along with *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]* to make it seem as if his possessions were not enchanted. Consequently this spell is often called *Melandrue's fell curse.*
