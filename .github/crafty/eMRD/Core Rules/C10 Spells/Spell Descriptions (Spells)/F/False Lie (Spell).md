*Your subject takes on a shifty, dishonest demeanor.*

*False lie* causes the subject to appear dishonest and deceptive. [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks made against the subject take a â€“10 penalty, and any failure convinces the observer that the subject is lying, even if she is not. Anyone who casts a spell that reveals lies (such as *discern lie)* can attempt a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level); if this fails, the spell registers the individual as lying even when she is not.
