*Force hammer* is designed to bring down a single opponent without causing lasting harm. You fire a ray of force at a single target, making a ranged touch attack. If you hit, the bolt deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per level (maximum 10d4). If the target fails a Fortitude save, it is [[Dazed|dazed]] for one round. (A successful saving throw does not reduce the damage.) *Force hammer* has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects. Creatures that are immune to nonlethal damage cannot be dazed by the spell.
