*Your breath becomes cold and frosty as you intone this spell, and blue-white crystals erupt from the soil, chill air swirling around their needle-sharp tips.*

Razor-sharp ice crystals surround the targets. Each target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6); half of this damage is cold damage, and half is slashing. In addition, each targetâ€™s speed is reduced by 20 feet for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that succeed on Reflex saving throws take half damage and their movement is unaffected.

*Focus:* A silver shuriken worth 50 gp that looks like a snowflake.
