Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain the ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that alignment (see *[[Detect Evil (Spell)|detect evil]]*, *Core Rulebook* 266). This is treated as tracking using the [[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|scent]] special quality, except you are following the traces of their aura upon the ground rather than their scent, and you receive no bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. At 10th level, you can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment aura as well.

When you use this spell to track a given alignment, it gains the descriptor of the opposite alignment. For example, when *follow aura* is used to track evil, it gains the good descriptor.
