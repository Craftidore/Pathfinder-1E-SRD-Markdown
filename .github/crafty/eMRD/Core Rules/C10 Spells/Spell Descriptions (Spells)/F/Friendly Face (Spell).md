You subtly change your appearance so that it seems particularly friendly to the viewer. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (v3.5 Diplomacy and Gather Information) checks made to influence or gain information from creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher, as long as those creatures arenâ€™t already hostile toward you.

This spell does not alter your appearance in any significant way, and thus provides no bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] checks.
