*Blood seems to pour from your eyes as an irregular red glow whirls around you chaotically.*

This spell imbues you with a supernatural ferocity, giving you an edge in melee combat. You gain a morale bonus on your melee damage rolls (with weapons or natural attacks) equal to 1/2 your caster level. This has no impact on your ability to cast spells or perform other actions.

Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a *[[True Strike (Spell)|true strike]]* effect (as the spell) on yourself as a standard action. This effect lasts for the normal duration of the *[[True Strike (Spell)|true strike]]* spell (a single attack), after which the entire spell's duration ends.

*Special:* If you are of the dragonblood subtype, you cast this spell at +1 caster level.
