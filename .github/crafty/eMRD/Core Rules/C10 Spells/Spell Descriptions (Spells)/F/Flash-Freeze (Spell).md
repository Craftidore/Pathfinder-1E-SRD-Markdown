All earth, stone, and water in the spellâ€™s area is drained of heat. Earth, mud, and stone become everfrost and water freezes. You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 foot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth, stone, or water creatures are not affected.

This spell can be used to create small icebergs in large bodies of water. These icebergs float, but are extremely slippery and unstable, requiring a DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check per round to stay on the iceberg. Icebergs may be propelled through the water by the current, paddling, or other means.
