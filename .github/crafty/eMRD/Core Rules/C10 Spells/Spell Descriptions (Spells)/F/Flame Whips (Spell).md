*At the conclusion of this spell, your arms stretch into whiplike appendages and burst into flames.*

Your forelimbs transform into flaming whips. You gain two melee touch attacks with a 15-foot reach that each deal 6d6 points of fire damage. Attacks with these flaming whips replace any natural attacks you had with those limbs.

While this spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with material components, nor can you carry items with your forelimbs. Any items worn on your forelimbs cease functioning while the spell is active.
