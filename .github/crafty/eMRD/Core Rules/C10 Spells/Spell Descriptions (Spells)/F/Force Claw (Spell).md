*Curling your hand into a claw, you finish the final gesture. Your foes see no result from your spell, but you know they’re in for a surprise.*

*Force claw* creates a Medium claw of invisible force at any spot you designate within the spell’s range. The claw guards the area of a 20-foot cube that you specify. You can move the claw’s location up to 60 feet to another point within range each round on your turn as a move action.

The claw is able to make attacks of opportunity against any enemy that provokes such attacks within the guarded area. It has a +10 bonus on the attack roll and deals 1d8+6 points of damage with a successful hit. It can make an unlimited number of attacks of opportunity each round, though it can make only one such attack per opportunity.
