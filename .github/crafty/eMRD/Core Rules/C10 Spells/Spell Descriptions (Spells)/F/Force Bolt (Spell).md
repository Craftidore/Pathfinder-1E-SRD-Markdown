This spell causes a small bolt of force to shoot out from the caster's palm and unerringly strike a single target. If used to attack a creature, it causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 5d6 points of damage with a Reflex save for half damage. If used to strike an object, it does the same damage to any unattended item (which does not receive a saving throw). The bolt can be used to break down walls, destroy traps, etc.
