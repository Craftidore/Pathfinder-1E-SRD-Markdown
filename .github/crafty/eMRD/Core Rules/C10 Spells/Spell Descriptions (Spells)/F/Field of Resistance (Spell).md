*The air in this spell’s effect shimmers with arcane energy. A buzzing sound echoes in your mind as the flow of magic into the affected area chokes off and ends.*

This spell creates a zone that impedes the flow of magic. The energy of this zone clings to creatures and objects, granting them a shield against spells. All creatures in the spell’s area gain spell resistance of 11 + caster level for as long as they remain in the area. If a creature already has spell resistance higher than this amount, this spell does not affect it. Unlike personal spell resistance, this spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. A creature loses this spell resistance when it leaves the spell’s area, and gains it again if it returns.
