This spell is a far more potent version of *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas]]*. The duration of the geas is unlimited; it lasts until the subject(s) either discharge the obligation or the effect is dispelled.

The initial subject of the spell gains no save, as per a standard *geas*. If the target dies before completing the obligation, the geas transfers to his closest adult relative. This new subject is entitled to a save; if she succeeds, the geas is broken and the spell ends. If not, she labors under the geas until she either completes the obligation, succeeds in dispelling the geas, or dies and potentially passes the geas to her closest adult relative. Each new subject has an instinctive understanding of the nature of the obligation. A *familial geas* can be broken only by a successful save on the part of the next successor, *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* (if cast by someone two caster levels higher than the *familial geas*), *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*.
