You create an extradimensional space hidden on your person that can store up to 5 lbs. per level of objects able to fit through a 6-inch-square opening. This space resembles a *bag of holding* in most ways. If this spell ends with objects stored, they fall to the ground at your feet.

Although some say the spell gains its name from the fact that you could store a pixie in the space, it actually comes from the fact that it was created by a fey caster.
