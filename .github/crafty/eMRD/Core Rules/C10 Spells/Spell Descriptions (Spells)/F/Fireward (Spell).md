*You stomp on the ground, and fire snuffs out all around you, rippling away to nothingness faster than you can blink.*

This spell functions like *[[Quench (Spell)|quench]]*, except as noted above. In addition, it has the following effects. While *fireward* remains in effect, no magical fire effect can function inside its area. This effect is similar to that of an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, but only magical fire is suppressed. Any nonmagical fire created inside or brought into the spellâ€™s area is immediately extinguished as well.
