*Your body twists and reshapes itself, allowing you brief freedom from the confines of a wholly humanoid shape.*

Upon casting this spell, you briefly acquire a new movement mode and speed, as given on the table below. Unlike most deity-variable spells, *footsteps of the divine* does not limit you to the option offered by your own deity; you are free to choose any option presented on the table. If you choose an option offered by a deity other than your own, however, the spell duration is halved. You can choose only one option per casting.


| **Deity** | **Movement Mode** | **Speed** |
|---|---|---|
| [[Bahamut]] | Fly | 60 ft. (poor) |
| [[Boccob]] | Fly | 40 ft. (perfect) |
| [[Corellon Larethian]] | — | +40 ft. |
| [[Ehlonna]] | Climb 3 | 0 ft. |
| [[Erythnul]] | — | +40 ft. |
| [[Fharlanghn]] | — | +50 ft. |
| [[Garl Glittergold]] | Burrow | 20 ft. |
| [[Gruumsh]] | Burrow | 20 ft. |
| [[Heironeous]] | — | +40 ft. |
| [[Hextor]] | — | +40 ft. |
| [[Kord]] | Climb | 30 ft. |
| [[Kurtulmak]] | Burrow | 20 ft. |
| [[Lolth]] | Climb | 30 ft. |
| [[Moradin]] | Burrow | 20 ft. |
| [[Nerull]] | Fly | 50 ft. (average) |
| [[Obad-Hai]] | — | +40 ft. |
| [[Olidammara]] | Climb | 30 ft. |
| [[Pelor]] | Fly | 50 ft. (average) |
| St. Cuthbert | — | +40 ft. |
| Tiamat | Fly | 60 ft. (poor) |
| Vecna | Fly | 40 ft. (perfect) |
| Wee Jas | Burrow | 20 ft. |
| Yondalla | Climb | 30 ft. |

Your assumption of a new movement mode, if any, imposes certain physical changes on you. For instance, if *footsteps of the divine* grants you flight, you grow wings; if it grants you a burrow speed, you grow heavy digging claws; and so forth. A “—” entry indicates that you gain no new movement type, but your base speed increases by the amount indicated.

At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to employ a burst of truly inhuman speed. Doing so adds an additional +10 feet to your speed per round remaining in the spell’s duration. However, this effect lasts for only a single round, after which the spell ends.
