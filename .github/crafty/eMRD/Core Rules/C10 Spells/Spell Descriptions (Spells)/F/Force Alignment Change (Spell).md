You force the subject of the spell to change alignment, specifying the creature’s new alignment. Creatures whose alignments are listed as “always” a specific alignment, and characters who would lose class abilities if they changed to the alignment you specify, gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws against the spell. Outsiders with an alignment-based type modifier (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) are immune to the effects of this spell. Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the spell thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. If the subject’s comrades have an alignment outlook that differs significantly from his, he may abandon them or even take actions against them. This is up to the discretion of the GM; the spell has no effect on determining this, as it is more a matter of conscience.

Another *force alignment change* spell, a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*, or a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* is required to reverse the effects of the spell; the subject makes no attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. Thus, if a spellcaster were to cast *force alignment change* upon him again, causing him to revert to his former alignment or following a new one, he would again receive a saving throw as outlined above.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *compel* to *force alignment change* to avoid duplication.
