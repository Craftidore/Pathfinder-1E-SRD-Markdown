As *[[Aiming at the Target (Spell)|aiming at the target]]*, except that you no longer need to maintain conscious concentration on the spell you cast before casting this one. Your unconscious mind maintains the required concentration, allowing you to take other actions (including movement, attacks, and even casting more spells) as normal. Short of dying, only mind-affecting spells and conditions (such as *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]* and *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]*) can affect your concentration on the other spell, though you might be convinced to willingly dismiss *finding the center* (and the previous spell with it) under the effect of a *charm* or *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Sorcerer 8, Wizard 8 to Level.
