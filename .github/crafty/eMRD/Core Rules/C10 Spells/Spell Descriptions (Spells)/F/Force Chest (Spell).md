*Holding your hands as if to grip a box, you feel the pressure of one appear as you complete the spell. The password you choose to unlock the box echoes through your mind.*

This spell brings into being a lidded box of force. The box appears in your hands, and you can choose to make it either invisible or merely translucent. The chest has no weight worth noting. Solid walls of force form the chest’s five sides and lid. You and other creatures cannot open the lid except by first speaking the password (determined by you at the time of casting). Both objects and Tiny and smaller creatures can fit in the box; it holds enough air to supply one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures for 1 hour.

Like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* spell, a *force chest* is immune to damage of all kinds and resists *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*, but it is susceptible to *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* and *[[Mage's Disjunction (Spell)|mage’s disjunction]]*, and it can be destroyed by a *[[Sphere of Annihilation|sphere of annihilation]]* or a *[[Cancellation|rod of cancellation]]*. The box is a spell effect, and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] (3.5 Open Lock) and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] cannot open it.
