*Waiving your arm about your head to trace the curve of a dome, you call up a hemisphere of force as clear as glass.*

You create an unmoving, transparent sphere of force centered on you. The sphere negates force effects and provides an impassable barrier against incorporeal creatures. Spells with the force descriptor do not affect anything within the sphere, and any force spell that overlaps the area, such as *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]],* is automatically countered. Incorporeal creatures, or creatures with the force descriptor must make a Will save to enter the area of the sphere.

*Forceward* does not push a creature out of the way if you move toward an incorporeal creature or force effect, and such creatures are treated as if they automatically succeeded on their saving throws against this spell.
