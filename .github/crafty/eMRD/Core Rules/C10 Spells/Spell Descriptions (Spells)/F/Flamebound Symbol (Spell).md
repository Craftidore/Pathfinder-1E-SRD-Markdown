Clerics of the Silver Flame devised this spell to dispose of Karrnathi undead legions, since turning them was seldom enough.

Casting this spell is a swift action. If you cast the spell before attempting to turn undead, your turn undead ability changes as follows: Instead of being turned or destroyed, all undead within 60 feet take 1d6 points of sacred damage per caster level. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your cleric or paladin level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half. Undead creatures destroyed by the damage are utterly consumed in silvery fire, leaving nothing behind except their possessions.

**Special:** Only clerics and paladins of the Silver Flame can cast this spell.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is only exclusive to paladins of the Silver Flame in the Eberron campaign setting. In other campaign settings, this spell is granted by deities of good alignment whose domains must include two of the following: [[Fire (Domain)|Fire]], [[Good (Domain)|Good]], ****Law, [[Protection (Domain)|Protection]], and/or [[Sun (Domain)|Sun]].
