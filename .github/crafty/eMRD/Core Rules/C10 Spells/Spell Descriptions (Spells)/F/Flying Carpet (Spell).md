This special flying spell is not cast upon a creature but an object. The targeted object gains the power to fly at the rate of 180 ft. with perfect maneuverability, under your control. You must remain within range of the targeted object at all times, and directing its movement is a move-equivalent action for you. The target object may not make double moves, run, charge, or dive. The object may carry aloft up to 100 lbs./level, not including its own weight. The target object must be able to normally support any weight placed upon it. During any round in which you do not spend a move-equivalent action directing the motions of the target object, the object does not move but merely hovers in place.

*Material Component:* A wing feather of a roc.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the world of Greyhawk campaign setting this spell is known as *Drawmij's flying carpet.*
