*Your subject breaks out in a cold sweat as a burning fever sinks into its mind.*

A creature subjected to this spell feels a spiking fever accompanied by vertigo and a phantasmagoric confusion of the senses.

The target first gets a Will save to recognize the dream as unreal. If that save fails, the creature becomes [[Exhausted|exhausted]] while the spell lasts. A successful Fortitude save lessens the condition to [[Fatigued|fatigued]].

Regardless of the outcome of the Fortitude save, the subject has difficulty focusing its mind on spellcasting. Each time it attempts to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell, it must first succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to this spell's save DC + the level of the spell being used).

When this spell ends (whether because its duration ends, you dismiss it, or it is dispelled), the subject is [[Confused|confused]] for 1 round afterward.

If the subject of *fever dream* is already under the effect of a *[[Luminous Swarm (Spell)|luminous swarm]]* spell, the Will save DC of this spell (as well as the DC for Concentration checks required by this spell) increases by 2.

If the subject of *fever dream* is already under the effect of a *[[Prickling Torment (Spell)|prickling torment]]* spell, the Fortitude save DC of this spell increases by 2.
