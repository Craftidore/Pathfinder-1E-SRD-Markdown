This spell produces a stream of wind that can fill a ship’s sails, disperse vapors and gases, and keep flying creatures at bay. The wind force is strong, with a speed of about 30 mph. It begins where you stand and blows directly away from you; you can easily propel a sailing vessel by standing astern of the mast and directing the wind forward to fill the sails.

Tiny or smaller creatures in the path of the wind are knocked prone, or if flying are blown back 1d6×10 feet.

Small creatures are checked and cannot make headway against the wind. Small airborne creatures are instead blown back 1d6×5 feet. 

Medium and larger creatures can move normally within the effect.

A *favorable wind* can’t push a creature beyond the limit of its range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –2 penalty on ranged attacks and on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen) checks in the area of a *favorable wind*.

The wind automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames.

In addition to the above-noted effects, *favorable wind* can do anything that a strong natural wind could do. It can fan a large fire, disperse gases and vapors to the limit of its range in 1 round, and make sailing difficult for small craft nearby.
