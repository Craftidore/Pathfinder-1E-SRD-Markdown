You call upon fiends, hungry for murder, to come forth and aid your cause. This spell conjures an area of reddish, unholy light that inflicts 10d6 points of damage on all good creatures. Further, in the middle of the area, one vrock or osyluth for every four caster levels appears to serve you, as long as you command them to commit only evil acts. You can choose whether vrocks or osyluths appear, although normally it depends on your own alignment (chaotic vs. lawful).
