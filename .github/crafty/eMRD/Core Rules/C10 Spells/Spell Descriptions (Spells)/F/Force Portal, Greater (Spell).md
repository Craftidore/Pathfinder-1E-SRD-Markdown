Window opens a hole in a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* without collapsing the wall. Unlike *force portal*, casters may place a *greater force portal* in a wall other than their own casting. Because the wall is invisible and so is the portal, only the caster and creatures that can *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* know where the window is. Casters that cannot *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* cannot see the window, although they can pin point it since they chose the location of the spell.

Casters may stand behind their wall and hurl spells through the hidden window and receive 90% hard cover. Attackers who cannot see the window (including the caster) suffer a 50% miss chance with each attack.
