You send one to four creatures or objects into the [[Ethereal Plane]] for a very short time. At the end of the duration, the subjects return to the exact location from which they left, unless that spot is no longer safe (it has been filled with stone, a fire has been set there, and so on); in that case, they appear in the nearest safe spot.

During their time on the Ethereal, creatures can take whatever actions are available to them—if they have the power on their own, they can even return to the Material Plane. They cannot, however, move outside the range of the spell, nor can they see into the real world. Unless the creatures ostracized to the Ethereal take actions against each other, assume they stay safe on that plane for the duration. The point of the spell is simply to get rid of them for a short while, so that actions can take place in their absence.

Unattended objects gain no saving throw unless they are magical. An object must be smaller than a 10-foot cube to be affected. Creatures, however, can be of any size. Due to the “fourfold” nature of this spell, if you choose to affect fewer than four targets, you can force one or more of them to make multiple saving throws. If any of the saves fail, the spell affects the subject.

For example, if you affect three targets, one (your choice) must make two saving throws while the others each make one, as normal. If the spell targets two subjects, both must make two saves, or one must make three and the other just one. If this spell is cast upon one target, that creature or object must make four saving throws and succeed at all of them or suffer the spell’s effect. A creature with spell resistance must attempt an SR check for each save required of it. This spell has no effect if cast on the [[Ethereal Plane]].
