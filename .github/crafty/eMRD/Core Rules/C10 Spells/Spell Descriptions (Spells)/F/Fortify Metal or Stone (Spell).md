*The object you touch glows momentarily with a heatless light. In your hand, you feel a subtle change in the item's heft, and its surface gleams with new strength.*

*Fortify metal or stone* alters the internal structure of stone or metal in order to strengthen it. Any single object of up to 10 feet on a side (weapons, armor, chests, sarcophagi, doors, and so on) has its hardness and hit points doubled, and has its break DC increased by 10.

If cast on weapons, *fortify metal or stone* bestows an enhancement bonus of +1 on damage rolls. Armor or shields affected by this spell grant their wearer damage reduction 1/magic.

Suits of armor are considered single objects for the purpose of being affected by this spell, but armor and shields must be targeted with separate castings.

You can use *fortify metal or stone* on masterwork weapons and armor, but magic items have an effective spell resistance of 20 + caster level. Artifacts cannot be affected by this spell.

Metal or stone cannot be enhanced more than once by this spell. *Material Component:* A mixture of coal dust and lime.
