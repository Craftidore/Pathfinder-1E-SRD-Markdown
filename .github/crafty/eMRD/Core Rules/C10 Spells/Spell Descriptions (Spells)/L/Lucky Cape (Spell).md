A cape imbued with this infusion allows the bearer to draw upon the luck stored within it, gaining an immediate reroll of a saving throw. The decision to use this ability must be made before the GM declares whether the saving throw results in success or failure. The wearer must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. The magic of this infusion functions only one time.
