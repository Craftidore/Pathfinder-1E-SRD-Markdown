*The object begins to glow brightly, imbued with the light of the Platinum Lord.*

The touched object radiates light with all the same properties of a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell. The light from this spell also has a number of additional qualities.

First, the radiance imbued by this spell is considered natural daylight for the purposes of creatures harmed by that type of light.

Second, an evil dragon or dragonblood creature cannot enter the area of full daylight unless it makes a successful Will save (though it can enter the area of shadowy illumination outside this). If it makes the saving throw, it can enter the area, but each round that it remains in the area of daylight, it takes 2d6 points of damage and is [[Dazed|dazed]]. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the [[Dazed|dazed]] effect.

Third, *light of Xymor* counters and dispels *[[Shadow of the Dark Queen|shadow of the dark queen]]**,* and it also counters and dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as *[[Darkness (Domain)|darkness]]**.*

*Special:* Divine spellcasters who derive their power from Xymor ([[Bahamut]]) cast this spell at +1 caster level.
