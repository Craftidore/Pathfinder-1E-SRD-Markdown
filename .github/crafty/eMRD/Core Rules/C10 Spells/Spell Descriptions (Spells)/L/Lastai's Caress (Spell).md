**Level:** [[2nd Level Cleric Spells|Cleric 2]], [[Pleasure (Domain)|Pleasure 2]]

**BoXM:** [[BoXM 3rd-Level Cleric Spells List|Cleric 3]]

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (a peach seed)

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One known evil creature touched

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None

Your gentle touch fills the target with tremendous feelings of love and compassion, and has the power to unnerve and debilitate evil creatures. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to affect an unwilling target. It has no effect on a creature that you do not know is evil.

An evil creature touched by the spell must wrestle with the pleasant feelings invoked by the spell. Roll on the table below at the beginning of the creatureâ€™s turn each round to see what condition applies to the subject in that round.


| **d4** | **Condition** |
|---|---|
| 1 | [[Cowering]] |
| 2 | [[Frightened]] |
| 3 | [[Nauseated]] |
| 4 | [[Shaken]] |

Instead of rolling on the table above, the caster may elect to leave the creature [[Shaken|shaken]] for the duration of the spell.
