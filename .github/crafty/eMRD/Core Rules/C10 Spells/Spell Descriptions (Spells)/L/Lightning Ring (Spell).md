*Your body quakes as a ring of crackling electricity explodes from your chest to whirl about you.*

The ring of electricity moves with you and does not interfere with your spellcasting or attacks, or with others attacking you. As long as the *lightning ring* is in effect, you gain resistance to electricity 20. At the beginning of your turn each round, adjacent creatures take 10d6 points of electricity damage, or half that with a successful Reflex save.

In addition, each round as a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can direct two lightning bolts that deal 5d6 points of electricity damage each, exactly as the *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]* spell (caster level 5th), in any directions you choose. Each bolt can be aimed separately. A creature struck by one of these bolts can make a Reflex save for half damage. The DC for this save is calculated for an 8th-level spell, even though the bolts mimic a 3rd-level spell.
