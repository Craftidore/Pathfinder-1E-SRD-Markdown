*Lead blades* increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium [[Longsword|longsword]] normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from *lead blades* (see page 145 of the *Core Rulebook* for more information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added Elven archer 1 to Level per New Paths Compendium (Kobold Press), pg. 20.
