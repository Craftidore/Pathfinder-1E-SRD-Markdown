You create a crackling lance of lightning that you can hurl at your foes. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack roll to hit. The lance deals 3d6 points of damage from the impact of the strike, plus 1d6 electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The impact damage is not subject to being reduced by *protection from the elements (electricty),* *[[Spark Shield (Spell)|spark shield]]**,* and similar magic or effects, but the target is entitled to a Fortitude save to halve the electricty damage.

You can create and hurl a second *lightning lance* at 10th level, and a third at 15th level. All bolts must be aimed at enemies within 30 feet of each other.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This spell is sometimes known as *Dalamar's lightning lance.*
