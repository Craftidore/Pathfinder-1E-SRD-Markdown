*With a low thrumming sound, a blue beam lances from your finger to strike your foe and weaken him.*

You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray causes creatures it hits to become weak and slow for the spell’s duration. A struck creature takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+10). In addition, a subject that fails a Will save is *slowed.*

The spell’s *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* effect counters and is countered by *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]].*
