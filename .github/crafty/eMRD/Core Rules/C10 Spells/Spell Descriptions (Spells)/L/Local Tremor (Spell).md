*The earth around your feet begins to ripple, and a directed shock wave of tectonic force is released that shoots through the ground.*

Immediately upon completion of the casting of this spell and as often as once per round thereafter, you can cause the ground to shake along a 30-foot line. You can produce a number of these tremors equal to your caster level (maximum five).

The tremors begin at your location and extend in the direction you indicate; any creature caught standing within the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. A spellcaster caught standing on one of these squares must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell that was being attempted.

You need not produce a tremor immediately upon finishing the casting of this spell. You can perform other actions, even the casting of other spells, between producing new tremors. Calling up a new tremor in any round after the spell has been cast requires a standard action (as you refocus your concentration on the spell).
