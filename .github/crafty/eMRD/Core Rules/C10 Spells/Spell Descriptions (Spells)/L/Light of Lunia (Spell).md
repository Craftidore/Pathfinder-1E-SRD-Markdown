*You invoke the powers of good and you begin to glow with the silver light of fabled Lunia, the first layer of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia.*

The silvery radiance created by this spell emanates from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light extends for an additional 30 feet.

Beginning one turn after you cast this spell, you can choose to expend some or all of the *light of Lunia* as a ray of light. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet. Spell resistance applies to this attack. This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet). You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round. Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell.
