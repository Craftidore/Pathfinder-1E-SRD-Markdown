This spell, favored among eladrins visiting the Material Plane, envelops the target in a protective, shimmering aura of light. The *luminous armor* resembles a suit of dazzling full plate, but it is weightless and does not restrict the target’s movement or mobility in any way. In addition to imparting the benefits of a breastplate (+5 armor bonus to AC), the *luminous armor* has no maximum Dexterity restriction, no armor check penalty, and no chance for arcane spell failure.

*Luminous armor* sheds light equivalent to a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell and counters *darkness* spells of 2nd level or lower with which it comes into contact. In addition, the *armor’s* brightness causes opponents to take a –4 to penalty on melee attacks made against the target. This penalty stacks with the attack penalty suffered by creatures sensitive to bright light (such as dark elves).

*Sacrifice:* 1d2 points of Strength damage.
