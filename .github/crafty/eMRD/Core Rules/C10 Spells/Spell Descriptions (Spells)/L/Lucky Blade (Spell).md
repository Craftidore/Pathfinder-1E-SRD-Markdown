A weapon imbued with this infusion allows the bearer to draw upon the luck stored within it, gaining an immediate reroll of an attack roll (or of the roll to confi rm a critical threat) made with that weapon. The decision to use this ability must be made before the DM declares whether the roll results in success or failure. The wearer must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. The magic of this infusion functions only one time.
