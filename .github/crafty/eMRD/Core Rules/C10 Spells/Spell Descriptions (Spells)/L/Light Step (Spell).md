**Range:** Touch

**Source:** City of Splendors, Waterdeep (WotC), pg. 154

As *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]*, except *light step* provides a maximum speed of 30 feet (20 feet if the subject wears medium or heavy armor). Additionally, the subject cannot ascend or descend vertically unless hovering 1 foot or less above terrain that ascends or descends at an angle of less than 45 degrees.

The practical impact of this spell is to allow the recipient to walk along reasonably level terrain without leaving tracks and to stride across chasms at will. It also adds a +15 circumstance bonus on [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks, a +10 circumstance bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (v3.5 Move Silently) checks (which does not stack with the bonus provided by *[[Boots of Elvenkind|boots of elvenkind]]*), and negates any chance of falling. When this spell is used in combination with *[[Levitate (Spell)|levitate]]*, the combined effect is equivalent to a slow-speed *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* spell. It provides no additional benefit if used in combination with *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]*.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from *Halaster's light step* to *light step* for campaign continuity.

*House Rule:* Also known as *Halaster's light step* in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.
