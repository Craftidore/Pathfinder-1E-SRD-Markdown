You call forth the heat and drought of the deep desert. The creature or object you target emanates heat to a radius of 1,000 feet for 20 hours. The emanated heat deals 2d6 points of dessication damage per round to unprotected creatures, or 2d8 points to plants or elementals with the water subtype (the target is susceptible if not magically protected or otherwise resistant to energy). The intense heat evaporates water from the soil, killing ordinary plant life. The difference in temperature from the surrounding area causes a strong wind, which blows the soil away and produces a duststorm within the area (see Sandstorms, page 16). Creatures damaged by this spell are dehydrated.

*Dire drought* counters and dispels *dire winter* (*dire drought* is also countered and dispelled by *dire winter;* see that spell description on page 76 of the *Epic Level Handbook*).

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.
