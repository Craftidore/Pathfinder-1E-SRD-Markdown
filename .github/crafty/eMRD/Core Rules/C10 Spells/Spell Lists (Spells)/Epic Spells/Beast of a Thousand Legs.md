You manipulate the atmosphere to create a terrible, roiling storm from which tornados sprout randomly and writhe across the land. The storm forms over the course of 10 minutes after the spell is cast. At any time, ten tornados are active in the storm, and each tornado is 150 feet across. A particular tornado touches the ground for 1d6×10 minutes; when this duration expires, another tornado appears at a random location elsewhere within the storm. See page 95 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* for details on the effects of tornadoforce winds.

*XP Cost:* 10,000 XP.
