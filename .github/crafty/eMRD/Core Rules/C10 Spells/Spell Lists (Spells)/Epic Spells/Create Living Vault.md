You can create a construct known as a living vault to protect and hide your treasures. Upon completion, the vault initially measures only 5 feet on a side, but it gradually increases to its proper size over the following 4d4 days. The vault is attuned to you and you only, allowing you entrance and egress in a manner similar to a *dimension door* spell. When you desire the vault to hide itself, you give it a simple command. To summon the vault, you may cast a *sending* spell or arrange some other manner to contact it.
