You and any creatures you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie to the edge of conscious thought and into the region of dreams. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your weight limit), but all must be touching each other. You physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind.

In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of dreamers everywhere. For every minute you move through the dream landscape, you can “wake” to find yourself five miles displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering where only dreams normally prowl, moving for a certain length of time (at five miles per minute) and then stepping back into the waking world.

You do not know precisely where you will come out in the waking world, nor the conditions of the waking world through which you travel. You know approximately where you will end up based on time spent traveling in dream.

Dreamscape can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where you are subject to the dangers of alien dream realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition, at your DM’s option. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey.

Any creatures touched by you when *dreamscape* is cast also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow you, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the region of dreams receive a Will save, negating the effect if successful.
