You send your foe to hell, if you succeed at a melee touch attack, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = the standard epic spell DC + 15). If he fails his saving throw, he is sent straight to a layer of the Nine Hells (or the Abyss, at your option) swarming with fiends. The subject will not willingly leave the Nine Hells for 20 hours, believing that his predicament is a just reward for an ill-spent life. Even after the compulsion fades, he must devise his own escape from the Nine Hells.

Unless your DM devises a specific location and scenario in the Nine Hells, the subject encounters a group of 1d4 pit fiends (or balors, if in the Abyss) every hour he spends in hell. See the *Monster Manual* for statistics for these creatures, as well as Chapter 5 for statistics for infernals, a new kind of creature.
