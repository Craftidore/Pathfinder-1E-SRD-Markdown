# Sanctified Spells
## Overview
Sanctified spells are available to any class that prepares spells rather than casting them spontaneously. Following the sanctified spells are lists of new spells for the bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, and wizard classes. Each spell’s effect is summarized here, with all the details provided in the spell descriptions that follow.

An **<sup>M</sup>** or **<sup>F</sup>** appearing at the end of a spell’s name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch. An **<sup>X</sup>** denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the caster.
