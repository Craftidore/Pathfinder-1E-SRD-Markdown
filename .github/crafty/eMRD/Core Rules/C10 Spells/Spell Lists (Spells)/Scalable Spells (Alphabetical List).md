# Scalable Spells (Alphabetical List)
## Overview
Scalable spells allow the caster to increase the relative power level of either that particular spell or another (see each scalable spell's text for details}, making them much more effective. Once a spellcaster knows the spell, she may use any spell slot available to her to cast it.

For an example, let's look at the scalable spell *[[A Moment Ago (Spell)|a moment ago]]*. Samantha, who is playing a 7th-level dwarven wizard from the Malachite Heights, casts a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell at a troop of advancing hobgoblins. The *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* does 25 points of damage, but the hobgoblins still advance and Samantha is unable to cast *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* again that day. During the next round, Samantha decides to cast *[[A Moment Ago (Spell)|a moment ago]]* to exactly duplicate the effects of the *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* spell. Because *[[A Moment Ago (Spell)|a moment ago]]* must be cast one level higher than the spell she is attempting to duplicate (*[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]'s* a 3rd-level spell), Samantha casts *[[A Moment Ago (Spell)|a moment ago]]* as a 4th-level spell. Another *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* strikes the hobgoblins for 25 points of damage. Any survivors flee, and Samantha can now relax.

Another example is the scalable spell *[[Spellscatter (Spell)|spellscatter]]*. Bret, who is playing a 12th-level elven sorcerer, is entering into an arcane duel with a wizard. He thinks about casting *[[Spellscatter (Spell)|spellscatter]]* at 6th level, causing his opponent to lose 1d3 prepared spells of 3rd level (half the spell level of *[[Spellscatter (Spell)|spellscatter]]*). Instead, he decides to save his 6th-level slot for something else, and casts *[[Spellscatter (Spell)|spellscatter]]* at 5th-level, causing his opponent to lose 1d3 spells of 2nd-level (half the spell level of *[[Spellscatter (Spell)|spellscatter]]*, rounded down).

Unfortunately for Bret, his opponent Samantha decides to return the attack and devastates him with a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* (a 3rd-level spell). If only he had gone with his first instincts...
