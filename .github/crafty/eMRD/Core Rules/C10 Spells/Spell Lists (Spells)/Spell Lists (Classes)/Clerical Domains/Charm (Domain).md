**Granted Powers**: You can baffle and befuddle foes with a touch or a smile, and your beauty and grace are divine.

- *Dazing Touch (Sp)*: You can cause a living creature to become [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round as a melee touch attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your cleric level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
- *Charming Smile (Sp)*: At 8th level, you can cast *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]* as a swift action, with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. You can only have one creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of rounds of this effect per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a free action. Each attempt to use this ability consumes 1 round of its duration, whether or not the creature succeeds on its save to resist the effect.
