# Liberation (Domain)
## Overview
| **Deities:** | *Asgardian:* |  |
|---|---|---|
| | *Eberron:* |  |
| | *Golarion:* | [[Desna]] |
| | *Greyhawk:* |  |
| | *Kalamar:* |  |
| | *Krynn:* |  |
| | *Olympian:* |  |
| | *Other:* |  |
| | *Pharaonic:* |  |
| | *Toril:* |  |

**Granted Powers**: You are a spirit of freedom and a staunch foe against all who would enslave and oppress.

- *Liberation (Su)*: You have the ability to ignore impediments to your mobility. For a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level, you can move normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if you were affected by *freedom of movement.* This effect occurs automatically as soon as it applies. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
- *Freedomâ€™s Call (Su)*: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of freedom for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Allies within this aura are not affected by the [[Confused|confused]], [[Grappled|grappled]], [[Frightened|frightened]], [[Panicked|panicked]], [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]], [[Pinned|pinned]], or [[Shaken|shaken]] conditions. This aura only suppresses these effects, and they return once a creature leaves the aura or when the aura ends, if applicable. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
