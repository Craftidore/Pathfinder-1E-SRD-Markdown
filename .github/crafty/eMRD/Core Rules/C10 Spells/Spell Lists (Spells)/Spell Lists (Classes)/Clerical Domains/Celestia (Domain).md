**Requirement:** Must be lawful good

**Granted Powers:** Once per day, as a free action, you can generate an aura of menace similar to that of the archons. The aura lasts for 1 minute. Any hostile enemy within a 20-foot radius of you must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Cha modifi er) to resist its effects. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, Armor Class, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit you. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by your aura for 24 hours. This is a supernatural ability.

Add [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] to your list of cleric class skills.

A planar domain counts as both of a cleric’s domain choices. The granted powers of a planar domain are more potent than those of other domains, and each level offers two spells from which a cleric can choose when preparing spells. Each day, a cleric with access to a planar domain chooses one of the two spells available to prepare in his domain spell slot for each spell level. Unlike other domains, planar domains each have an alignment requirement that must be met by a cleric who wants to access the domain.

A cleric need not select a specific deity to have access to a planar domain. A cleric who devotes himself to a specific alignment (LG, NG, CG, LN, CN, LE, NE, or CE) rather than a deity can select a planar domain in place of his two normal domain choices. If the DM wishes, he can make domains specific to other planes, using these as representative guides.
