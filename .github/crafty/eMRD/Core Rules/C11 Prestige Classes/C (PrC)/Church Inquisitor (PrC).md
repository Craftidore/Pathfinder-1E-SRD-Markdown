# Church Inquisitor (PrC)
## Overview
While many champions of good are dedicated to fi ghting

forces of evil that are external to them and their church—as

clerics and paladins of Heironeous are devoted to destroying

followers of Hextor—the church inquisitor is at least as

concerned about evil and corruption within. When greed

eats away at a church hierarchy, when devils infi ltrate a

knightly order and seduce its leaders to evil, when high

clerics succumb to evil enchantments and fall from the

path of their deities, it is usually a church inquisitor who

uncovers this kind of taint and cuts it away.

Church inquisitors specialize in divination (to seek out

evil and corruption) and abjuration (to protect themselves

and others from evil magic). They are most often drawn

from the clerics or paladins of a lawful church or order.

Members of other classes usually fi nd it diffi cult to meet

the requirements of the prestige class, and rarely have the

incentive to do so.

Player characters might encounter NPC church inquisitors

if they are involved in a lawful church or order—perhaps

even as subjects of the inquisitor’s investigations.

Church inquisitors are particularly likely to appear after

incidents involving demons or devils, since they combat

the widespread corruption these creatures tend to leave in

their wake.

Adaptation: As written, this prestige class isn’t specifi c

to a deity or organization—but in your campaign it certainly

could be. Perhaps a particular church has an “Order

of the Watchful Eye” that functions as an internal-affairs

department for the paladins and clerics in other orders. Or

a theocracy might have an FBI-style organization full of

church inquisitors that investigate demon-spawned crimes

across the nation.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the church inquisitor

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Church inquisitors

gain no weapon or armor profi ciencies.

*Detect Evil* (Sp): A church inquisitor can use *detect evil* at

will as a spell-like ability.

Inquisition Domain: Upon adopting the church inquisitor

class, a character gains access to the Inquisition domain,

described in Chapter 7: Domains and Spells. The character

gains the granted power associated with the domain (a +4

bonus on dispel checks) and can choose the spells in that

domain as his daily domain spells.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A church inquisitor

continues advancing in divine spellcasting ability as well as

learning the skills of inquisition. Thus, when a new church

inquisitor level is gained, the character gains new divine

spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if he had also gained a level in

whatever divine spellcasting class he

belonged to before he added the prestige

class. He does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance

of controlling or rebuking undead,

more frequent *remove disease,* and

so on). This means that he adds the

level of church inquisitor to the level

of another divine spellcasting class the

character has, then determines spells per

day accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine

spellcasting class before he became a church

inquisitor, the player must decide which

class to assign each level of church

inquisitor for the purpose of determining

divine spells per day and

spells known.

Immune to Charms (Ex): A

church inquisitor of 2nd level or

higher is immune to all enchantment

(charm) spells and effects.

Pierce Illusion (Su): At 3rd level,

the church inquisitor gains the supernatural

ability to penetrate illusions

and disguises at will. Whenever an

inquisitor sees an illusion or disguise

spell of any sort, he immediately

makes a Will save to see through

it. The inquisitor need not interact

with or touch the illusion, visual

contact is enough to give the Will

save.

Pierce Disguise (Ex):

The inquisitor has a +4

competence bonus

on Spot checks against

the Disguise skill.

Immune to Compulsions (Ex): A church inquisitor of

5th level or higher is immune to all compulsion spells and

effects.

Force Shapechange (Su): A church inquisitor of 6th

level or higher can force a creature into its natural form.

The church inquisitor must make a successful melee touch

attack against the creature. If the attack is successful, the

church inquisitor makes a caster level check as if casting

*dispel magic* against the shapechanging effect. The church

inquisitor’s +4 bonus on dispel checks (the Inquisition

domain granted power) applies to this check. This ability

undoes the effect of *alter self*, *polymorph*, *shapechange*, and

alternate form abilities, whether exceptional, spell-like, or

supernatural in nature. The affected creature cannot change

its shape again for 1d6 rounds. The church inquisitor can use

this ability at will.

Immunity to Possession (Ex): A church inquisitor of

8th level or higher has immunity to *magic jar*, *soul bind*, *trap*

*the soul*, a ghost’s malevolence ability, and all other spells or

effects that displace or replace a character’s life force. The

character can still travel to the planes via *astral projection*, if

so desired.

*Discern Lies* (Sp): A church inquisitor of 9th

level or higher can use *discern lies* as a spelllike

ability three times per day.

Learn the Truth (Su): By touching a

creature that has lied to him, a church

inquisitor of 10th level or higher can

force the creature to tell the truth. The

creature can make a Will save (DC

10 + the church

inquisitor’s level

+ the church

inquisitor’s

Cha modifier)

to resist this mindaffecting

compulsion

effect. If the saving throw

fails, the creature must speak

the true version of the lie it

uttered. The church inquisitor

can use this ability 3

times/day.
