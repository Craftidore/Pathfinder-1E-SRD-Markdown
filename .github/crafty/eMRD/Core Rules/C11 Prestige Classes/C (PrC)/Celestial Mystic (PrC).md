# Celestial Mystic (PrC)
## Overview
The mysteries of the seventh mounting

heaven, the celestial layer of Chronias,

are unplumbed even by the archons

who inhabit Celestia’s lower

layers. Tales say that those who

enter have their inherent goodness

magnified until their essence

joins with Celestia itself.

From their homes and studies on

the Material Plane, celestial mystics

strive to attain this ultimate unity

with the perfect good. By contemplating

the mystery of the Illuminated Heaven,

they believe that they become more pure,

more good, and more perfect. As they

improve themselves, they become

suited—after long effort and much meditation—

to ascend to the seventh heaven

and find what they describe as simultaneously

a perfect extinction and a perfect

immortality, a oneness with the highest

good in all the planes.

The path of the celestial mystic is

esoteric and mysterious, and appeals

most commonly to wizards and

other characters with an academic interest

in the planes, particularly the upper planes,

their denizens, and the fabric of reality itself.

Clerics, sorcerers, and monks are often drawn to

the class as well. Barbarians, druids, fighters, rangers,

and rogues rarely have the interest or discipline to follow the

demanding contemplative path of the celestial mystic.

Celestial mystics are often loners, poring over cryptic manuscripts

and practicing their meditative techniques. However,

they have a strong ethic of involvement in the world even as

they seek to transform it, and strive to live out their increasing

goodness by helping the weak and helpless. Thus, they are often

found as part of adventuring groups (made up of similarly

high-minded individuals) or otherwise actively involved in

fighting evil or promoting good.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS

FEATURES

All of the following are

class features of the celestial

mystic prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Celestial mystics gain no proficiency with any

weapon or armor.

Blessing of the Silver Heaven (Su): A 1st-level celestial

mystic gains electricity resistance 10 and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against disease, poison, and petrification. In addition,

a magic circle against evil effect always surrounds the mystic,

identical with the spell cast by a cleric whose level equals the

celestial mystic’s character level.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd level, and each level

thereafter, a celestial mystic gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige

class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character

of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning

or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so

on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a

character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming

a celestial mystic, he must decide to which class he adds

the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Celestial Spells: Once he reaches 2nd level, a celestial

mystic can cast spells as if he were an archon. Specifically,

the mystic can cast any spell described in Chapter 6 that has

a celestial or archon component, as long as he can otherwise

cast the spell (it appears on his spell list, it is of a level of

spells that he can cast, and he has a sufficient ability score to

cast spells of that level). He does not gain any other celestial

qualities. For instance, he is not immune to the blast of a

trumpet archon.

Blessing of the Golden Heaven (Su): A celestial mystic of

3rd level or higher is immune to death spells and magical death

effects.

Blessing of the Pearly Heaven (Su): A 5th-level celestial

mystic retains his Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being

caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. In addition,

a celestial mystic may make a mystical knowledge check with a

bonus equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier to see

whether he knows some relevant information about legendary

people, places, or items. If he has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge

(history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check. Otherwise this

works as a bardic knowledge check.

Blessing of the Crystal Heaven (Su): At 7th level, a celestial

mystic can cure his own wounds. He can cure up to three times

his class level in hit points each day, and he can spread this healing

out among several uses. In addition, he gains immunity to

disease and poison, and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws

against Enchantment spells and effects.

Blessing of the Platinum Heaven (Su): At 8th level, a celestial

mystic gains the ability to channel spell energy into a bolt of

holy power. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range

(400 ft. + 40 ft./class level) and deals 4d6 points of damage plus

1d6 points of damage per level of the spell channeled to create

the effect. For example, a celestial mystic who channels a 7thlevel

spell into holy power deals 11d6 points of damage to the

target if the bolt hits.

Blessing of the Glittering Heaven (Su): At 9th level, a

celestial mystic gains spell resistance 20 and damage reduction

10/unholy.

Blessing of the Illuminated Heaven (Su): A 10th-level

celestial mystic is surrounded by an aura of positive energy to a

radius of 10 feet. Within that emanation, life flourishes: colors

are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations

are more intense. (This effect is purely sensory; game effects

such as energy damage are not affected.) All living creatures

within the aura, including the celestial mystic, gain fast healing

2 as an extraordinary ability as long as they remain there. No

undead creature with fewer than 10 HD can enter the aura, and

those brought into it act as if they had been turned. Undead

with 10 HD or more can enter the aura unharmed, but they do

not gain fast healing.
