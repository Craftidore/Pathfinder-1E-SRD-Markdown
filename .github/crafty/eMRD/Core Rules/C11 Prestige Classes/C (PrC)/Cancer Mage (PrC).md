# Cancer Mage (PrC)
## Overview
Scurrying about in sewers, back alleys, and abandoned

buildings, the cancer mage feeds upon the corpse of society.

The cancer mage hides in the darkness where no one wants

to look, digging through trash long forgotten. Cancer mages

are some of the most disgusting individuals a character is

ever likely to meet, for they revel in filth, disease, and decay.

They usually have their own foul goals, sometimes venerating

deities of disease or corruption and other times spreading

disease for its own sake.

Cancer mages use their power to equip themselves with a

deadly array of weapons, but these are not the weapons of a

warrior. The cancer mage strikes from darkness. He makes

quick, poisonous attacks and then retreats, allowing his contaminated

wounds to fester and hopefully kill his victims

slowly.

Rogues, rangers, druids, and clerics are most likely to

become cancer mages. Rats, insects, worms, and diseases are

the cancer mage’s allies. Cancer mages sometimes work in

horrible, hidden societies of the disease-ridden underclass,

such as beggars and thieves. Sometimes they enjoy the company

of assassins or vermin lords. They hate good-aligned

clerics and paladins—particularly paladins—with a burning

passion. Occasionally, an intelligent monster such as a

troglodyte or a medusa will become a cancer mage, but these

creatures are ostracized even by their own kind. One might

imagine, however, that an otyugh or vermin such as giant

maggots and cockroaches would not mind the company of a

cancer mage. The most obvious allies of the cancer mage are

undead creatures.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the cancer mage prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Cancer mages are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of

armor, and with shields.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If a cancer mage can catch an opponent

when she is unable to defend herself effectively from

his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically,

any time the cancer mage’s target would be denied her

Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity

bonus or not), the cancer mage’s attack deals +1d6 points of

damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every

four levels (+2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 9th level). Should

the cancer mage score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this

extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a cancer mage can make

a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal

damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage

to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the

usual –4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of his

weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

A cancer mage can only sneak attack a living creature with

a discernible anatomy—undead, constructs, oozes, plants,

and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally,

any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune

to sneak attacks. Also, the cancer mage must be able to see

the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be

able to reach a vital spot. A cancer mage cannot sneak attack

while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking

the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

If a cancer mage gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.

Disease Host (Ex): At 1st level, a cancer mage suffers no

ill effects of diseases, except for purely cosmetic ones such

as boils, pockmarks, watery eyes, blackened skin, hair loss,

foul smell, and so on. The cancer mage becomes a carrier of

every disease he encounters, though he remains immune to

most of their effects.

However, the cancer mage takes 1d6 points of damage

per caster level if someone casts a cure disease spell or effect

on him (he can make a Fortitude save to try to resist the

effect). Furthermore, if the cancer mage has a cancerous

companion (see below), he loses all abilities gained from

the companion for 1d10 days after being the subject of a

cure disease spell.

Contagion (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, the touch of a

cancer mage carries a contagion spell once per day per class

level. The DC for the target’s saving throw is 13 + the cancer

mage’s Wisdom modifier.

Cancerous Companion (Ex): At 2nd level, a cancer

grows within the cancer mage, forming a large tumor. This

cancerous growth gains intelligence and a personality distinct

from the cancer mage. The companion and the cancer

mage can communicate telepathically. When needed, the

cancerous companion uses the cancer mage’s scores for

saves, ability scores other than Intelligence, and so forth.

The cancerous companion gains abilities as the cancer mage

gains levels.

Cancer

Mage Companion

Level Int Ability

2nd 6 Blindsight 30 feet.

3rd 7 Can use a spell or spell-like ability of the cancer mage on its own as a standard action once per day, requiring no action on

the part of the cancer mage.

4th 8 Can warn the cancer mage of danger, granting him the evasion ability.

5th 9 Can warn the cancer mage of danger, granting him the uncanny dodge (Dex bonus to AC) ability.

6th 10 Mind-affecting spells and effects have a 50% chance of affecting the companion rather than the cancer mage.

7th 11 Can use a spell or spell-like ability of the cancer mage on its own as a standard action three times per day, requiring no

action on the part of the cancer mage.

8th 12 Can warn the cancer mage of danger, granting him the uncanny dodge (can’t be flanked) ability.

9th 13 Can form a 1-ft. tendril of flesh capable of making touch attacks, including the cancer mage’s contagion and poison spelllike

abilities.

10th 14 Blindsight 60 feet.

Tatterdemalion (Ex): Gathering scraps of clothing and

old, discarded rags, a 3rd-level cancer mage is able to make

such articles into light armor with a the following stats:

armor bonus +4, maximum Dex bonus +5, armor check

penalty –1, arcane spell failure 15%, speed 30 ft./20 ft.,

weight 20 lb. Only a 3rd-level or higher cancer mage can

wear this armor and gain these benefits; other wearers treat

it as padded armor. This armor is considered masterwork

quality and can be fashioned into magic armor.

Poison (Sp): Once per day per class level beginning at 3rd

level, the touch of a cancer mage carries a poison spell. The

DC for the target’s saving throw is 14 + the cancer mage’s

Wisdom modifier.

Children of the Night (Su): A 4th-level cancer mage

commands the lesser creatures of the world and can call

forth a swarm of 2d6 Small monstrous spiders or a pack of

4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10 bats, once per day, as a standard

action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve

the cancer mage (understanding his mental commands) for

up to 10 minutes per class level.

Viral Agent (Su): At 5th level, a cancer mage befriends a

disease or virus that infests his body. He supernaturally

enhances a disease, making it smarter by giving it a point of

his own Intelligence. He establishes a telepathic link with

the disease that functions at a range of one mile per class

level of the cancer mage.

The cancer mage can then attempt to infect a target with

his viral agent, using his contagion ability. If successful, the

viral agent can tell the cancer mage telepathically what its

host experiences. In all other respects, the viral agent is a

normal disease; if the victim fights it off or a cure disease spell

is used, the disease and the viral agent die. The cancer mage

regains his Intelligence point 24 hours after the viral agent

dies. The cancer mage can create as many viral agents as he

is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.

Infected Wound (Ex): Once per day per class level

beginning at 6th level, a cancer mage can infect his foe with

an infectious taint after making a successful melee attack.

The foe takes 1 point of Constitution damage and must

make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + cancer mage’s class level +

cancer mage’s Wis modifier) 1 hour later or take a further

1d6 points of Constitution damage.

Insect Plague (Sp): At 7th level, a cancer mage invokes

insect plague once per day as a cleric of his class level.

Insect Armor (Su): By allowing insects and worms to

crawl over his body, a 7th-level cancer mage gains a +4 natural

armor bonus. The cancer mage cannot wear armor heavier

than light armor and keep this benefit, however.

Viral Ally (Su): In a fashion similar to the viral agent ability,

a cancer mage of 8th level or higher can create a viral ally

by devoting 3 points of Intelligence to a disease or virus in

his system. The cancer mage can then bestow his viral ally

upon a humanoid victim using his contagion ability, and the

viral ally can communicate telepathically with the cancer

mage. The viral ally (and thus the cancer mage) controls its

host as surely as with a dominate person spell, although the

host gets no separate saving throw to avoid the dominate

person effect. The viral ally is a normal disease, however, and

the victim can fight it off with successful Fortitude saves or

a cure disease spell, either of which kills the viral ally. The

cancer mage regains his missing Intelligence points 24

hours later. A cancer mage can create as many viral allies as

he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.

Disease Form (Su): At 10th level, a cancer mage gains

the ability to tranform into a disease once per day. (This ability

also affects up to 100 pounds of gear the cancer mage is

carrying, plus tatterdemalion armor, insect armor, and a cancerous

companion.) As a disease, the cancer mage is intangible

and invisible to standard methods of observation, even

blindsight. Creatures with the scent ability note a foulness

in the air. The cancer mage cannot move, except with the

wind (if any), or within a host.

The cancer mage may adopt his disease form as a standard

action, attempting to infect a living creature within 100 feet.

A potential victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20)

to avoid being infected with the cancer mage. Any creature

that comes within 10 feet of a cancer mage in disease form is

subject to the saving throw to resist infection as well. Once

inside an infected host, the cancer mage deals 1d3 points of

Constitution damage per day after a 24-hour incubation

period. The victim has no way of knowing that the cancer

mage is anything other than a normal illness.

The cancer mage travels with the victim, aware of whatever

the victim is aware of. A number of times per day equal

to the cancer mage’s Charisma bonus, the cancer mage can

attempt to force the victim to take one round’s worth of

actions of the cancer mage’s choosing; a successful Will

save (DC 18 + cancer mage’s Wis modifier) allows the

victim to resist this. While controlling his victim, the

cancer mage has access to all skills, feats, spells, and special

abilities of the host, plus any of his own that he can use in

his disembodied state.

The cancer mage can leave his host at any time, allowing

the victim to recover normally. The victim can also attempt

to force the cancer mage out by making Fortitude saves as if

the cancer mage were a normal disease. Heal checks help

the victim as they would normally. A cure disease spell kills

the cancer mage if he fails a Fortitude save (calculating the

save DC as for spells of the same level). Even if the cancer

mage succeeds at the saving throw, he is forced to reassume

his material form adjacent to the victim.

A cancer mage can remain in disease form as long as he

desires, or he can return to his natural form and be done

with the disease form for that day. While in disease form, the

cancer mage does not need to eat, sleep, or drink, and he

does not age. A cancer mage could remain dormant in a

room for a hundred years, then take his material form or

infect a new victim.
