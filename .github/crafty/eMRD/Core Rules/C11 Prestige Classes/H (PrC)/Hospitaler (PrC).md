# Hospitaler (PrC)
## Overview
Hospitalers are a fi ghting force of necessity, sworn to poverty,

obedience, and the defense of those in their care. It is

the duty of knights hospitaler to protect people traveling on

religious pilgrimages. Over the years, this single duty has

expanded to include the construction and administration

of hospitals and refugee facilities.

Most hospitalers are paladins, though rangers, fi ghter/

clerics and even ranger/clerics often join the knights hospitaler

as well.

NPC hospitalers often travel in groups, usually with pilgrims

on their way to or from a site of particular importance

to their faith. Hospitalers may be found running pilgrim

hostels, defending temple hospitals, or standing vigil over

religious relics and sites. They seldom go on quests or adventures

except to rescue endangered pilgrims or to recover

relics or sites from heretics and unbelievers.

Adaptation: Hospitalers do battle against suffering and

pain wherever they fi nd it. In your campaign, large cities

may house masses of beggars who are seen to by itinerant

hospitalers. A small village may also house a hospitaler who

serves as a doctor of sorts to those who need his attention.

An entire force of hospitalers may gather together in order

to fi ght an evil dragon and then remain afterwards to care

for the local townsfolk injured during the battle.

Hit Die: d8.

To qualify to become a hospitaler, a character must fulfi ll all

the following criteria.

Skills: Handle Animal 5 ranks, Ride 5 ranks.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the hospitaler prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Hospitalers gain profi

ciency with all simple and martial weapons, with all types

of armor, and with shields.

Lay on Hands (Su): A hospitaler with a Charisma score

of 12 or higher can heal wounds by touch. Each day she can

heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her hospitaler

level times her Charisma modifi er. A hospitaler may

choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and

she doesn’t have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a

standard action.

If the hospitaler has this ability from another class, her

levels in those classes stack to determine the total number

of hit points of damage she can heal each day.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A hospitaler continues

advancing in divine spellcasting ability as well as learning

the skills of the hospitalers. Thus, when a new hospitaler

level is gained (except for 1st, 5th, and 9th levels), the character

gains new divine spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had gained a level in the a divine

spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the

prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or rebuking undead, greater damage

with the smite evil ability, and so on). If the character had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a

hospitaler, the player must decide to which class to add each

hospitaler level for the purposes of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Bonus Feat: At the indicated levels, a hospitaler may

take a bonus feat. These feats are drawn from the feats designated

as fi ghter bonus feats (in the *Player’s Handbook* and

elsewhere).

*Remove Disease* (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a hospitaler can

use *remove disease* as a spell-like ability once per week. At 7th

level and higher, she can use this ability twice per week.

Code of Conduct: Hospitalers take an oath of poverty,

obedience, and defense of those in their care. This does not

mean that hospitalers live mean, penny-pinching lives. They

share their wealth among themselves and give any excess to

their order. Obedience is not related to character or social

rank, but rather to position assigned within the order, and

often changes with the situation. Regardless of their relative

ranks, all hospitalers defer to the head of a facility while on

the grounds. Hospitalers must be willing to lay down their

lives to protect the pilgrims or hospitaler facilities under

their care, but should not do so recklessly.

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a hospitaler

may continue advancing as a paladin.

EX-HOSPITALERS

A hospitaler who becomes

chaotic, who willfully

commits

a chaotic act,

or who grossly

violates the

hospitaler

code of

conduct

loses all

class features

and spells and may

not progress in levels as

a hospitaler. She regains

her abilities

if she atones for her violations

(see the *atonement*

spell description, page 201 of

the *Player’s Handbook*).

A hospitaler faces a special

restriction in multiclassing. A

hospitaler who gains a level in

a class other than hospitaler or

paladin may never again increase

her hospitaler level, though she

retains all her hospitaler

abilities. The path of the hospitaler, like that of the paladin,

requires a constant heart. Once you have turned off the

path, you may never return.
