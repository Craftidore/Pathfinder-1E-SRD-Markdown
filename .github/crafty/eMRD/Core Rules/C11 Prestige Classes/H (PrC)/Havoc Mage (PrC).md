# Havoc Mage (PrC)
## Overview
Combat magic is usually reserved for spellcasters in the second

rank who are content to lob spells as if artillery from behind the

cover of front-rank combatants. Not so the havoc mage, who shares

as much in common with a fighter as with a wizard. The havoc

mage has learned to toss off spells with such reckless abandon that

he can fight head-to-head with both sword and spell without

incurring the bitter consequences other spellcasters must contend

with. A havoc mage is interested in maximum carnage in the

shortest amount of time, by dint of a quick spell cast where an

enemy least expects it.

A havoc mage must first learn the ways of arcane magic, so

those most likely to take up the sword (to complement the wand)

are sorcerers and wizards. These normally sedate characters are

drawn to the frenzy of battle, during which a flashing sword can be

just as effective in their own hands as a well-timed spell.

NPC havoc mages are more likely than other spellcasters to

be lone adventurers, since they are adept both at arms and

magic. However, the most successful havoc mages are those

who join their talents with those of a balanced group of combatants

and spellcasters.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a havoc mage, a character must fulfill all the

following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal

(Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int),

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the havoc mage.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Havoc mages gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day: At 2nd, 4th, and 5th level, a havoc mage gains

new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane

spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain all the benefits a character of that

class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats, and

so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If

a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before

becoming a havoc mage, he must decide to which class he adds

the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Battlecast (Ex): A havoc mage gains the ability to cast

spells of a certain level or lower while making a weapon attack.

He may take a full-round action to attack and cast a spell. The

spell must be an arcane spell he knows of 2nd level or lower with

a casting time of 1 standard action or less. When using his battlecast

ability, a havoc mage may cast spells requiring somatic components

even if he has no free hands. Using battlecast does not

provoke attacks of opportunity.

At 3rd level and higher, a havoc mage can battlecast a spell

of 4th level or lower. At 5th level, a havoc mage can battlecast

a spell of 8th level or lower.

The battlecast ability does not grant a havoc mage any relief

from the arcane spell failure chance imparted by armor.
