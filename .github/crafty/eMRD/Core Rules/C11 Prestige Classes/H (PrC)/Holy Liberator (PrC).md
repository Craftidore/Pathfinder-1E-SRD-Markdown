# Holy Liberator (PrC)
## Overview
The holy liberator is a holy warrior, a distant cousin of the

paladin, who is dedicated to overthrowing tyranny wherever

it may be found. These champions of freedom and

equality are strong-willed, independent-minded, and virtuous.

They particularly direct their efforts against lawful

evil societies (dictatorships or plutocracies), slaveholders

and slave traders, and powerful, corrupt governments, but

they also recognize the possibility for tyranny even in a

state of anarchy (where strong individuals may impose

their will on people weaker than they).

Members of all classes—with the prominent exception of

monks—are often drawn to the holy liberator prestige class.

Chaotic good fi ghters and rangers are natural holy liberators,

augmenting their already signifi cant combat abilities

with the holy powers of the prestige class. Many clerics are

also drawn to become holy liberators—particularly chaotic

clerics of Pelor and certain clerics of Kord. Many rogues also

adopt the holy liberator class, working with stealth and steel

for the cause of freedom.

NPC holy liberators are usually loners, though they

may organize rebellious forces in a tyrannical nation.

They often have powerful celestial allies, from celestial

animals to ghaele eladrins, assisting their cause, but tend

to work in a loose network rather than a structured or

close association. Just as holy liberators rarely accept

orders from anyone, they are loath to give them, choosing

to form alliances and friendships rather than manipulate

minions or servants.

Adaptation: In your campaign, holy liberators may

wander the planes seeking out slavers to destroy, or they

may be the sponsors of a rebellion against a particularly

harsh government. Holy liberators can act much like guerillas,

training and exhorting the local populace to resist

tyrannical rule.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the holy liberator

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Holy liberators are

profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Spells per Day: A holy liberator has the ability to

cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell,

the holy liberator must have a Wisdom score of

at least 10 + the spell’s level, so a holy liberator

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these

spells. Holy liberator bonus spells are based

on Wisdom, and saving throws against these

spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the holy

liberator’s Wisdom modifi er. When the

holy liberator gets 0 spells of a given level,

such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, he gets

only bonus spells. (A holy liberator without

a bonus spell for that level cannot yet

cast a spell of that level.)

The holy liberator uses the paladin spell

list, with a few changes. The holy liberator’s

spell list does not include any spells

with the law descriptor. The following

spells are added to the holy liberator’s

spell list: 1st—*protection from law*;

2nd—*heroism*; 3rd—*magic circle against*

*law*; 4th—*dispel law, freedom of movement*.

A holy liberator prepares and

casts spells just as a cleric does (though

the liberator cannot spontaneously cast

*cure* or *infl ict* spells).

Aura of Good (Ex): The power of a

holy liberator’s aura of good (see the

*detect good* spell) is equal to his class

level plus his cleric level, if any.

*Detect Evil* (Sp): The holy liberator

can use *detect evil* as a spell-like

ability at will.

Smite Evil (Su): Once

per day, a holy liberator

may attempt to smite evil

with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifi

er (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of

damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level holy liberator

armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage,

plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical

effects that normally

apply. If the holy liberator

accidentally

smites a creature

that is not evil,

the smite has

no effect but

it is still used up

for that day.

At 5th level, the

holy liberator may

smite evil twice per

day, and at 10th level

three times per day.

Remove Fatigue (Su): A holy liberator of 2nd

level or higher can eliminate fatigue in any creature

he touches. Using this ability is a standard

action; the holy liberator may use it a number

of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma

modifi er.

Aura of Resolve (Ex): Beginning at 3rd

level, the holy liberator gains immunity to

all charm and compulsion effects. His mind

is his own, and no other creature can control

his thoughts or actions. Each ally within 10

feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on

saving throws against charm or

compulsion effects. This

ability functions

while the holy

liberator is conscious,

but not if he is unconscious

or dead.

Divine Grace (Su): A

holy liberator of 4th

level or higher applies his Charisma modifi er (if positive) as a bonus on all saving

throws.

*Break Enchantment* (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, a holy

liberator can use *break enchantment* once per week. He can

use this ability twice per week at 8th level.

*Celestial Companion* (Sp): Upon reaching 6th level, a holy

liberator gains the service of a celestial companion (a cat,

eagle, hawk, warhorse, owl, pony, riding dog, or wolf) to

serve him in his struggle against tyranny (see sidebar). The

creature has the celestial template (see page 31 of the *Monster*

*Manual*). This creature may willingly act as a guardian

(such as a hawk), a helper (such as a cat), or a mount (such as

a horse).

Once per day, as a full-round action, a holy liberator may

magically call his companion from the celestial realms in

which it resides. The companion immediately appears

adjacent to the holy liberator and remains for 2 hours per

holy liberator level; it may be dismissed at any time as a

free action. The companion is the same creature each time

it is summoned, though the holy liberator may release a

particular companion from service (if it has grown too

old to join her struggle, for instance). Each time the companion

is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any

damage it may have taken previously. The companion also

appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was

last dismissed (including barding, saddle, and the like for

mounts). Calling the companion is a conjuration (calling)

effect.

Should the holy liberator’s companion die, it immediately

disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was

carrying. The liberator may not call another companion

for thirty days or until he gains a liberator level, whichever

comes fi rst, even if the companion is somehow returned

from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the liberator

takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Treat the companion as a special mount for the purpose of

spells that specifi cally affect a paladin’s special mount (such

as *heal mount*).

CELESTIAL COMPANION

The holy liberator’s celestial companion is superior to a normal animal of its type. It has the celestial template, as described in the

*Monster Manual*. It further gains HD and special abilities based on the holy liberator’s character level (see the table).

**Natural**

**Character Bonus Armor Dex**

**Level HD Adj. Adj. Int Special**

12th or less +2 +1 +1 6 Empathic link, improved evasion, improved speed +10 ft., share

saving throws, share spells

16th–18th +6 +5 +3 8 Blood bond, improved speed +20 ft.

19th–20th +8 +7 +4 9 Spell resistance

See the Paladin’s Mount sidebar in the *Player’s Handbook* for definitions of the terms in this table, except as listed below.

*Dex Adj.:* Add this figure to the companion’s Dexterity score.

*Improved Speed (Ex):* The mount’s speed increases by 10 ft. if its liberator’s character level is 15th or lower. If the liberator’s character

level is 16th or higher, the mount’s speed increases by a total of +20 feet.

*Blood Bond (Ex):* The companion gains a +2 bonus on all attacks, checks, and saves if it witnesses the holy liberator being threatened

or harmed.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* A companion’s spell resistance equals the liberator’s class level +10.

Code of Conduct: Holy liberators must be of chaotic

good alignment and lose all special class abilities if they ever

willingly commit an act of evil. True to their alignment,

holy liberators have no more formalized code of conduct

than that.

EX-PALADIN LIBERATORS

It is not altogether uncommon for paladins to slip away from

the unswerving path of law in their overriding quest for

good and become holy liberators. For the most part, the expaladin

who adopts the holy liberator class does not regain

any of his lost paladin abilities. However, the character’s

paladin levels stack with holy liberator levels for the purpose

of determining caster level for holy liberator spells and

for determining the power of his smite evil ability.

equal to his Charisma bonus (already added above).

link with the eagle and can share spells and saving throws

with it. He can call it from the celestial realms once per day

for up to 12 hours. The eagle can speak to Shallas.

*longsword, gauntlets of ogre power +2, bracers of health +2*.
