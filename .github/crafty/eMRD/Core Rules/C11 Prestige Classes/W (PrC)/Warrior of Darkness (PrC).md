# Warrior of Darkness (PrC)
## Overview
The warrior of darkness, sometimes called the dark knight, is a practitioner of black magic. He studies the dark arts and learns the terrible secrets involved with evil rituals and spells. However, he does not cast spells himself. Instead, he uses his arcane knowledge to make himself a more formidable combatant.

Evil fighters, often those with a few levels of wizard or sorcerer, sometimes become warriors of darkness. Less frequently, warriors of darkness come from the ranks of single-classed wizards or sorcerers, or bards, rangers, and even clerics. Warriors of darkness often keep to themselves, although they sometimes ally themselves with evil sorcerers or wizards.

Other times, they employ small groups of evil humanoids such as orcs, gnolls, and bugbears to aid them and guard their dark sanctums. They dream of power and conquest through violence and bloodshed. A warrior of darkness is not usually subtle, nor is he barbaric. Instead, he is a chilling compromise of physical might and intelligent sophistication.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the warrior of darkness

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A warrior of darkness

is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Black Magic Oil (Su): A warrior of darkness can use his

forbidden arcane arts to create a magic oil that he anoints

himself with. An individual warrior of darkness makes oil

that works only on him, and he can only make one dose of

the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 1st, 4th, 7th,

and 10th level).

Class Level +

Cha Modifier Ability/Effect

2 or lower Dweller in darkness; character gains the Blind-Fight

feat.

3–4 Demonic celerity; character gains the Combat

Reflexes feat.

5–6 Ensorcelled flesh; character’s natural armor bonus

improves by +1.

7–8 Hellpower; character gains +1 inherent bonus to Str,

Con, or Dex.

9 Rapid step; character gains inherent +10 ft. bonus to

speed.

damage against good creatures 3/day.

11 or higher Malign fury; character can take a full attack action in

conjunction with a move or move-equivalent action,

usable 3 rounds per day.

When he attains an appropriate level, the warrior of darkness

creates a new black magic oil and anoints himself with

it. He then chooses from the above list of supernatural abilities

to imbue within himself permanently, picking a choice

available to him based on his class level and Charisma modifier

(the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower

one). A warrior of darkness cannot choose an ability more

than once.

Darkling Weapon (Su): With 3 rounds of preparation

(involving rituals and alchemical substances that cost 50

gp), a warrior of darkness can imbue any weapon with a +1

enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. If the

weapon already has an enhancement bonus, the warrior of

darkness can instead imbue the weapon with any magical

special quality that is the equivalent of a +1 bonus (see

Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide for a list of

weapon qualities). The bonus or special quality only functions

when the weapon is in the hands of the warrior of

darkness, and it lasts 1 hour per warrior of darkness level.

The warrior can imbue only one special quality in a weapon

at a time.

Black Magic Elixir (Su): At 3rd level, a warrior of darkness

can use his knowledge of black magic and alchemy to

create a magical elixir that he then imbibes. An individual

warrior of darkness makes elixir that works only on him,

and he can only make one dose of the elixir each time this

class feature is gained (at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level).

When he creates an elixir, the warrior of darkness

chooses from the following list of supernatural abilities to

imbue within himself permanently, picking a choice available

to him based on his class level and Charisma modifier.

No ability other than violent knowledge may be chosen

more than once.
