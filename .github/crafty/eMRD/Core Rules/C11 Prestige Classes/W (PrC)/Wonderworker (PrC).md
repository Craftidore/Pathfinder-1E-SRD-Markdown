# Wonderworker (PrC)
## Overview
Among spellcasters of all kinds, some are so devoted to the

cause of good that they sacrifice some of their spellcasting ability

in order to grow closer to the ideal of goodness they revere.

These are wonderworkers, practitioners of arcane or divine

magic (or even psionics) whose righteousness and purity sets

them apart from others—even from other good clerics.

Like the sword of righteousness prestige class, the wonderworker

class allows a spellcasting or psionic character to gain

more exalted feats at the cost of a slightly slower spell progression.

Bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, wizards, psions,

and psychic warriors can all adopt this class,

while more martially oriented characters

generally choose the sword of righteousness

class to accomplish the

same goal.

No organization unites wonderworkers,

though they are

often found operating in the

churches of good deities,

good-aligned guilds or colleges,

and other existing organizations

devoted to virtuous causes.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a wonderworker, a

character must fulfill all the following

criteria.

Alignment: Any good.

Base Save Bonus:Will +5.

Feats: One exalted feat, plus either Favored

of the Companions, Knight of Stars, or Servant

of the Heavens.

Spells: Able to cast 3rd-level arcane or

divine spells, or to manifest 3rd-level

psionic powers.

CLASS SKILLS

The wonderworker’s class skills (and the

key ability for each skill) are Concentration

(Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),

Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (nature)

(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter

4 of the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

2nd +1 +0 +0 +3 Bonus exalted feat 2 3

3rd +1 +1 +1 +3 Bonus exalted feat 1 2

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the wonderworker prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:Wonderworkers gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Bonus Exalted Feat: At every level, a wonderworker gets a

bonus exalted feat. These bonus feats must be drawn from

among those identified as exalted feats in Chapter 4: Feats.

Bonus Spells per Day: For each level of wonderworker that

a spellcasting character attains, he gains bonus spells to the

number of spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells

can be added to whatever levels of spells the wonderworker can

currently cast, but no more than one can be added to

the character’s highest current spell

level. Arcane spellcasters (bards, sorcerers,

and wizards) receive fewer

bonus spells than divine spellcasters

(clerics and druids), as shown on

the table above.

For example, a 9th-level cleric who

takes a single level in wonderworker

can give himself one bonus 5th-level spell

(his highest as a 9th-level cleric), and one bonus

spell in one other level, 0 through 4th. A 9thlevel

wizard who takes a level in wonderworker

gains only one bonus spell, which

she can give herself in any level, 0

through 5th.

A psion who adopts the wonderworker

class receives bonus power

points/day equal to one-half of the sum of

his psion level and his wonderworker level. A

psychic warrior/wonderworker receives

bonus power points/day equal to one-third of

the sum of her psychic warrior level and her

wonderworker level. If a wonderworker has

two spellcasting or psionic classes already,

he must give the bonus spell or power

points to a class in which he can cast at least

3rd-level spells or manifest at least 3rd-level

powers. If more than one class meets that

requirement, he must choose which previous

class gains the bonus. He cannot split

bonus spells or power points between

two different spellcasting or psionic

classes. For example, a 5th-level

cleric/5th-level wizard takes one level of

wonderworker. He can either take 2 bonus

cleric spells or 1 bonus wizard spell, but he

cannot take 1 of each.

Once a wonderworker has chosen how to apply his

bonus spells or power points, they cannot be shifted.
