# Wayfarer Guide (PrC)
## Overview
The wayfarer guide focuses on honing her skill at instantaneous

magical transportation. Unlike spellcasters of other

prestigious associations, a wayfarer guide need not devote

years of her life to the art of teleportation nor focus her

attention overmuch on the pursuit of perfection. Still, she

learns secrets of the trade that are available only through

employment with the Wayfarers Union. The Union is, at

its heart, a transportation service that specialty spellcasters

provide for those willing to pay.

Most wayfarer guides are wizards or sorcerers, though

a few clerics with access to the Travel domain have been

known to pursue this class. Such characters typically have a

level or two in bard, ranger, or wizard to meet the Knowledge

requirements more quickly,

Wayfarers Union offi ces are generally found in large cities,

staffed by wayfarer guides who offer a variety of standard

services. Particularly qualifi ed NPC wayfarer guides, called

“danger wayfarers,” are sometimes available to teleport bold

clients into dangerous locales, though the price is commensurately

higher.

Adaptation: This prestige class is quick and to the point.

However, even wayfarers have their disputes. Perhaps in your

campaign no single Wayfarers Union exists. Instead, many

splintered groups each claim particular areas of geography

as theirs, and they bitterly contest the “illegal” transportation

of goods or travelers in their territory by other groups.

Those who can smuggle goods or travelers into areas held

by opposing wayfarers or state-sanctioned wayfarers would

become probable in such a campaign.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To qualify to become a wayfarer guide, a character must fulfi ll

all the following criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, Knowledge (geography)

10 ranks.

Spell: Able to cast *teleport.*

Special: A prospective wayfarer guide must join the

Wayfarers Union (although she can later quit without losing

previously acquired levels).

Class Skills

The wayfarer guide’s class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

(all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), Speak

Language (n/a), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the wayfarer guide

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Wayfarer guides gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 1st and 3rd level, a

wayfarer guide gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which she belonged before adding the prestige

class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a

character of that class would have gained (improved chance

of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If

she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a

wayfarer guide, she must decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Enhanced Capacity (Ex): A wayfarer guide can transport

material more effi ciently. When casting any spell with the

teleportation descriptor that allows other willing creatures

to be brought along, a wayfarer guide can bring along one

additional Medium touched willing creature (carrying gear

or objects up to its maximum load) per class level, subject

to the same restrictions given in the *teleport*

spell description.

For example, a 9th-level wizard/

2nd-level wayfarer guide can

bring up to fi ve other

Medium or smaller

creatures with her

(instead of the normal

limit of three

creatures for an

11th-level caster).

Improved

Range (Ex): A

wayfarer guide

can travel greater

distances when

teleporting. When

the character casts

any spell with

the teleportation

descriptor, the

maximum distance

covered by

the spell increases

by 50%.

For example, a

9th-level wizard/

1st-level wayfarer

guide can teleport

up to 1,500 miles

with a single *teleport* spell (instead of the normal limit of

1,000 miles for a 10th-level caster).

Extra Teleportation: Beginning at 2nd level, a wayfarer

guide gains an extra 5th-level spell slot, which can be used

only for a *teleport* spell.

Enhanced Accuracy (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a

wayfarer guide becomes more skilled at arriving on target.

When casting any spell with the teleportation descriptor

that includes a random chance for determining the actual

destination (such as *teleport*), a wayfarer guide can roll twice

and choose the result she wants.
