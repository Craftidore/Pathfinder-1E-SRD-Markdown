# Warchief (PrC)
## Overview
A warchief leads a primitive, aggressive tribe of humanoids,

especially when they turn to marauding. The warchief calls on

his indomitable presence and terrible visage to spur his followers

to feats of great courage and sacrifice for the tribe. The tribe

member who hangs back learns firsthand that the warchief ’s

displeasure is a terror eclipsing even the hardships of war—

better to die in glory on the battlefield than under the warchief ’s

torturous punishments. Inspired into a killing frenzy, the

warchief and his band sweep the enemies of the tribe before

their onslaught.

Warchiefs are self-made leaders, more often than not reaching

their elevated status by deposing the previous warchief in a bloody

coup. A warchief doesn’t become the sole authority by worrying

about the needs of others, and thus good-aligned leaders are rarely

members of this class. The martial classes—especially fighter,

ranger, and warrior—are most likely to become warchiefs.

NPC warchiefs might be found throughout the savage lands,

leading tribes of brutal humanoids to bloody ends. Luckily for

those in civilized lands, warchiefs most often array their followers

against other warring bands of savages.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the warchief.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Warchiefs gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Tribal Frenzy (Ex): A warchief is able to inspire his followers

to acts of extreme battle frenzy. The warchief may activate this

frenzy as a standard action. He may then maintain it as a free

action. It ends at the conclusion of any turn in which the warchief

does not maintain it.

The frenzy affects any creature that is a member of the

warshief ’s race and tribe, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the

warchief, and that is able to hear the warchief.

The frenzy grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the Strength score

of each affected ally (not including the warchief himself ). At the

start of each of their turns, everyone affected by the Strength boost

takes 1 point of damage for each Hit Die they have. Thus, an orc

warchief can grant +2 Strength to each member of the pack of 1stlevel

orc warriors he commands, but they each take 1 point of damage

per round as long as the Strength boost remains in effect.

Every two levels (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the bonus to Strength

increases by +2.

Ability Boost (Ex): As a warchief gains levels in this prestige

class, his Charisma score increases as noted on Table 1–13: The

Warchief. These increases stack.

Devoted Bodyguards (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, once per

round, whenever a warchief is hit by an attack, he may make a

DC 15 Reflex save to have that attack affect an adjacent tribe

member instead. The attack is treated as though it had hit the

chosen bodyguard instead of the leader, regardless of the bodyguard’s

Armor Class or any other defensive effects. A tribe

member may not serve as a bodyguard if it is dazed, stunned, paralyzed,

or otherwise unable to act.
