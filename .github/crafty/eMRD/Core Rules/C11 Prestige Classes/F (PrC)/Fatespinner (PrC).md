# Fatespinner (PrC)
## Overview
Some people are lucky; others are not. A few make their own

luck. A fatespinner (also called a “mage of many fates”) has

pulled back the curtain of chance, circumstance, and chaos to

glimpse a deeper truth: probability. When one event occurs,

innumerable possible ones do not as the universe blindly

seeks balance. Through his newfound

understanding, the fatespinner satisfi es

that blind seeking—with

prejudice. He can increase

the probability of events in

his favor.

Any arcane spellcaster who

has cursed his bad luck is a

candidate for this prestige

class. Who has not cast a

spell, hoping fervently but

impotently for a particular

outcome, or sadly noted the

astounding luck of an enemy

who resists spell after spell? The

fatespinner seeks to apply some

control over the seeming

vagaries of chance—fortune

for himself, misfortune for his

foes.

NPC fatespinners are often

found in positions of power and

authority, as would be expected

from those able to directly affect

their own destiny. Others continue

to ply the world, honing

their abilities and seeking

their ultimate fortune.

Adaptation: Adapting

this class to other methods of

play might include the idea of

draining luck from NPCs, and using

that drained luck as stored spin. However,

determining the method whereby this luck is

drained that doesn’t merely allow the fatespinner

to always have a method of rejuvenating his spin is tricky.

This effect could potentially be tied to the fi ckle fi nger of

fate ability; if the fatespinner successfully uses this ability,

he gains 1 additional point of spin that he must use within

1 round (he can’t store it). This ability should be usable only

once per day.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become a fatespinner, a character must fulfi ll

all the following criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, Profession (gambler)

5 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast 4th-level arcane spells,

including at least one divination spell of 1st

level or higher.

Class Skills

The fatespinner’s class skills (and

the key ability for each skill) are

Appraise (Int), Concentration

(Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

(arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sleight

of Hand (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are class features

of the fatespinner prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi -

ciency: Fatespinners gain no

profi ciency with any weapon

or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells

Known: At each level

except 5th, a fatespinner

gains new spells per day

(and spells known,

if applicable) as if

he had also gained

a level in a spellcasting

class to which he belonged

before adding the prestige

class level. He does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that class would have gained

(improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus

feat, and so on). If he had more than one spellcasting class

before becoming a fatespinner, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Spin Fate (Ex): A mage of many fates understands that

“chance” is not as random as many believe it to be, and he can

adjust the probability of certain events by applying a force

that fatespinners refer to as “spin.” Each day, a fatespinner

can use a number of points of spin equal to his fatespinner

class level.

As a free action, a fatespinner can use stored spin to boost

the save DC of a spell he casts, adding some or all his spin to

the DC, on a point-for-point basis. For instance, a 5th-level

wizard/3rd-level fatespinner casting *fi reball* could choose to

boost the DC of the spell by 1, 2, or 3 points. Once he uses

up his spin for the day, his ability to tinker with probability

in this fashion is also exhausted for the day.

A fatespinner’s spin is replenished whenever the character

successfully regains his spells for the day (whether through

rest, preparation, or prayer).

Fickle Finger of Fate (Ex): On reaching 2nd level, a

fatespinner gains the ability to affect the luck of others.

Once per day as an immediate action (see page 86), he can

force any other creature—friend or enemy—to reroll a roll

that it has just made. A fatespinner must have line of sight

to the creature to be affected. That creature must abide by

the result of the reroll, whether it’s higher or lower than the

original roll.

Spin Destiny (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a fatespinner

more clearly comprehends the matrix of reality and can use

accumulated spin to adjust other random events. The method

is identical to increasing a spell’s save DC, but the fatespinner

can now add spin to any skill check, attack roll, or saving

throw that he attempts on a point-for-point basis. However,

the spin utilized comes from the same limited reservoir of

karma storage that allows him to adjust the DC of his spells.

He must apply the bonus before making the roll.

Deny Fate (Ex): At 4th level and higher, a fatespinner

has a better chance of beating the odds should he ever be

rendered unconscious and dying. Once per day, on the fi rst

occasion when a fatespinner must make a check to become

stable when dying, the check automatically succeeds. Other

such checks called for later in the same 24-hour period are

made normally.

Resist Fate (Ex): A fatespinner of 4th level and above

embraces his extraordinary good luck. Once per day, he

can reroll one roll that he has just made. He must abide by

the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original

roll.

Seal Fate (Su): A 5th-level fatespinner can meddle in success

and failure, and even life and death, sealing the fate of

a friend or foe. Once per day as a free action, the fatespinner

selects a target creature he can see within 30 feet with Hit

Dice equal to or less than his. The creature receives either

a –10 penalty or a +10 bonus on its next saving throw, as

decided by the fatespinner. If the selected target has more

Hit Dice than the fatespinner, the ability doesn’t work but

the use for the day is not wasted. This effect lasts only for

1 round, so if no spell or other effect is brought to bear on

the target creature during the round, the creature’s fate is

no longer sealed.
