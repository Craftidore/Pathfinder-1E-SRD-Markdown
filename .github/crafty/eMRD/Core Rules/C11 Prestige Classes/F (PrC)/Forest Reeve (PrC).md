# Forest Reeve (PrC)
## Overview
*“Most trees can’t defend themselves. That’s why we do it for them.”*

—Denon, Knight of the Green

Forest reeves are chosen by the Guardians of the Green

to patrol local wilderness areas to check for dangers and

humanoid activities that could be harmful to the land. The

forest reeve’s job is to defend the forest whenever he can,

and to inform the Guardians of the Green when more force

becomes necessary.

BECOMING A FOREST REEVE

Rangers and barbarians are the most likely characters to

take up the mantle of the forest reeve, but members of this

prestige class can come from a wide variety of backgrounds.

A forest reeve is chosen more for his devotion to the wilderness

than for any specific skill he possesses. The Guardians

of the Green want to be certain that anyone they choose

for such a post can be trusted never to shirk his duties to

the forest.

**Entry Requirements**

**Base Attack Bonus:** +5.

**Skills:** Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, Listen 4 ranks, Spot 4

ranks, Survival 6 ranks.

**Feats:** Endurance, Track.

**Special:** Must be chosen as a forest reeve by the leaders of

a band of Guardians of the Green, then serve a six-month

apprenticeship to a Guardian of the Green who has at least

three forest reeve levels. This requirement can be waived

if the would-be forest reeve performs an extraordinary

service for the Guardians of the Green.

**Class Skills (6 + Int modifier per level):** Balance, Climb,

Craft, Handle Animal, Heal, Hide, Intimidate, Jump,

CLASS FEATURES

As a forest reeve, you patrol the forest and defend it from

harm, and the earth itself supports your efforts. You also

serve as an advance scout for the Guardians of the Green and

aid them in battle when necessary.

Earth’s Defender (Su): Once per day as a move action,

you can channel nature’s power through your body and into

any one weapon you wield, making it temporarily magical

for 1 minute/character level you possess. When you are

1st level, this ability grants your weapon a temporary +1

bonus. The value of this bonus increases to +2 when you

attain 3rd level and to +3 when you attain 5th level. The

ability can be used while you wield a magic weapon, but

its effects do not stack with the weapon’s existing bonus

(if any).

Fast Movement (Ex): Your base land speed is 10 feet faster

than the norm for your race. See the barbarian class feature

(*PH* 25). If you have fast movement from another source, the

benefi ts stack.

Nature’s Rejuvenation (Sp): Once per day, you can

channel the rejuvenating power of nature to restore or

invigorate yourself. If you spend 1 full minute in direct

physical contact with a living plant or fertile ground, you

are affected as if by your choice of any one of the following

spells: *bear’s endurance, cure moderate wounds,* or *lesser restoration*

(caster level equals your character level). You can use

this power only on yourself. At 3rd level, you can use this

ability twice per day, and at 5th level, you can use it three

times per day.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you can

move through natural overgrown areas at normal speed

without damage. See the druid class feature (*PH* 36). If you

already have woodland stride, you gain a +10-foot bonus to

your land speed.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you can

move at your normal speed while following tracks. See the

ranger class feature (*PH* 48). If you have swift tracker from

another source, the penalties are lessened by an additional

5 feet.

Camoufl age (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you can use the

Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even while being

observed.

Whispers of the Forest (Su): When you attain 5th

level, the plants, trees, and rocks begin to speak to you,

bringing you news wherever you are. Once per day, these

voices of the forest give you a short answer to any simple

question you pose pertaining to current events in any

wilderness area on your land mass. Questions about distant

lands require 1 minute per mile of distance to answer. At

the DM’s discretion, when the forest deems an issue particularly

important, the whispers bring you news without

your request.

PLAYING A FOREST REEVE

Like all Guardians of the Green, forest reeves vary widely in

attitude. But the one ideal you all share is an undying love

for the earth. More intense, even, than a parent’s love for a

child, this passion brings out a fi erce protectiveness in you.

In fact, you would die to defend your forest home, without

question, should it become necessary.

Combat

Though skilled at all forms of combat, you are particularly

adept at guerrilla warfare—tracking enemies to their lairs,

ambushing them while they sleep, or engaging in other such

surreptitious tactics. Between fast movement and woodland stride, you can usually escape through the forest before your

enemies know what hit them.
