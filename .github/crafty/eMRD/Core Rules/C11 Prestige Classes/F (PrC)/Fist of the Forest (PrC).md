# Fist of the Forest (PrC)
## Overview
*“To be one with the wild, you must become wild yourself. It’s only*

*natural.”*

—Sorag, Warden of the Green

For some among the Guardians of the Green (see page 68),

the pursuit of an animalistic lifestyle is a form of asceticism.

A feral disposition

seems to come naturally

to others. In either case,

the result is a powerful

defender of nature: the fist of the forest.

BECOMING A FIST OF THE FOREST

Though the two classes

seem to have little in

common, the paths of

the monk and the barbarian

often converge

in the fist of the forest.

Monks and other disciplined

characters seek

heightened connections

with nature through a

primal devotion to its

defense. Barbarians and

other wild characters

seem to simply end up

on this path if they are

fated for it.

**Entry Requirements**

**Base Attack Bonus:** +4.

**Skills:** Handle Animal 4

ranks, Survival 4 ranks.

**Feats:** Great Fortitude,

Improved Unarmed

Strike, Power Attack.

**Special:** Must gain approval as a fist of the forest by the

leaders of a band of Guardians of the Green, then adopt

the lifestyle of an animal (see Primal Living, below).

**Hit Die: d10**

**Class Skills (2 + Int modifier per level):** Balance, Climb,

Handle Animal, Intimidate, Jump, Listen, Move Silently,

Sense Motive, Spot, Survival, Swim.

CLASS FEATURES

You are skilled at hunting

and killing with your

bare hands. You defend

the forest by channeling

raw, bestial might through

your own being, using either

disciplined focus or

primal ferocity.

AC Bonus (Ex): While

unarmored, you gain a bonus

to your Armor Class

equal to your Constitution

bonus (if any). See the monk

class feature (*PH* 40).

Fast Movement (Ex):

Your base land speed is

faster than the norm for

your race. See the barbarian

class feature (*PH* 25).

If you already have fast

movement from another

class, the bonuses to your

speed stack.

Feral Trance (Su):

Once per day, you can enter

a feral battle trance. While

you are in this state, the raw

power of the beast fl ows

through you. Your hands

and feet become clawlike

(destroying any shoes or

gloves you are wearing),

and your teeth lengthen and grow pointed. For the duration

of the trance, you gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and a

+2 bonus on damage rolls with your unarmed strikes. You

can also make one bite attack per round at your highest

attack bonus whenever you attack as a full-round action.

The damage for this attack is 1d6 + your Str modifier, regardless

of your size. A feral trance lasts for a number of

rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier. While in a trance,

you cannot perform certain actions, and afterward you are

fatigued. These restrictions are the same as those for the

barbarian’s rage class feature (*PH* 25–26). If you have the

ability to enter a rage, you can do so while in a feral trance,

using your increased Constitution score to determine the

duration of both effects.

At 3rd level, you can use this ability twice per day.

Primal Living (Ex): To maintain your bestial powers,

you must live like a wild animal. You must sleep in natural

environments, never inside buildings, unless forced by circumstances

. Furthermore, you cannot purchase food—you

must obtain it by hunting, gathering, begging, or stealing.

Some fi sts of the forest even give up speech, the use of

fire and tools, and all possessions, but such extremes are

not required. In any month in which you buy food or

voluntarily sleep indoors more than three times, all your

fist of the forest class features cease to function until you

have spent thirty consecutive days living like an animal

once more, or until a fellow Guardian of the Green casts

*atonement* on you.

Unarmed Damage (Ex): Your unarmed attacks deal more

damage than usual. At 1st level, you deal 1d8 points of damage

with each unarmed strike. When you attain 3rd level, this

damage increases to 1d10 points. See the monk class feature

(*PH* 41). If your unarmed attack already deals this amount of

damage, increase the base damage to the next step indicated

on the monk class table.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, you cannot be

caught f lat-footed, and you react to danger before your

senses would normally allow you to do so. See the barbarian

class feature (*PH* 26). If you already have uncanny

dodge from another class, you instead gain improved

uncanny dodge.

Untamed Strike (Su): On attaining 2nd level, you can

channel the untamed power of nature when you attack.

Your unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons; see

the monk’s *ki* strike class feature (*PH* 41). If your unarmed

strikes are already magical, they instead are treated lesser

ghost touch weapons. They deal full damage against incorporeal

creatures 50% of the time and half damage the rest

of the time.

Scent (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the supernatural

ability to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden

foes, and track by sense of smell. This ability otherwise

functions like the extraordinary ability of the same name

(*MM* 314).

PLAYING A FIST OF THE FOREST

Living like an animal gives you a clear understanding of and

sympathy for natural living things, and association with the

Guardians of the Green gives you purpose and direction.

Your personality, however, is your own. Depending on your

character’s background and the band to which you belong,

you can be as erudite or savage, as disciplined or unruly, as

you see fi t.

Combat

Your most powerful attacks are your unarmed strikes, so you

should charge into the thick of battle as quickly as possible.

Save your feral trance ability until the middle of a fi ght, so

that you don’t end up fatigued while your enemies are still

attacking.

Sample Encounter

The PCs come upon Sorag, Hasayla (page 85), and Denon

(page 83) fi ghting a band of gnolls, as described in the Guardians

of the Green section on page 71. Sorag lives so completely

as an animal that she has forsworn all possessions.
