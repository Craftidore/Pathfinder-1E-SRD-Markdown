# Fochlucan Lyrist (PrC)
## Overview
Warrior, thief, spy, poet, woodland champion—the

Fochlucan lyrist is a legendary figure who serves as

the herald and teacher to great kings, the champion of

the common folk, and the keeper of lore long forgotten

elsewhere. Only the best and brightest are invited to

become Fochlucan lyrists, and those who eventually

win the approval of the Fochlucan College’s masters are

remarkable individuals indeed, skilled in swordplay,

magic, and diplomacy.

Those who aspire to join the Fochlucan College face

a long and difficult road. The great bards who lead the

school choose only individuals who have demonstrated

skill at arms and stealth, learning and cleverness, superb

talent with the lute and an ear for the stories of old.

Finally, all applicants must first study the lore of the

druids, learning the ways of growth and the hidden

secrets of nature. Few indeed can stand up to the rigorous

scrutiny of the Fochlucan masters.

Fochlucan lyrists adventure to gain information.

They are spies and rumormongers, ever on the watch

for news of events that may upset the balance they seek

to preserve. A lyrist can serve as a diplomat, messenger,

or assassin, as needed. The Fochlucans strongly believe

in fostering the careers of other adventurers whose

viewpoints align with their own, and many lyrists attach

themselves to adventuring companies specifically for

the purpose of guiding their comrades to oppose the

right enemies and advance the interests of the Fochlucan

College.

Adaptation: This class is a fusion of the druid and

bard base classes. An interesting variation would be to

adapt the class into a fusion of the druid and ranger base

classes.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the Fochlucan

lyrist prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Fochlucan lyrists

gain no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a

Fochlucan lyrist gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level

in any one arcane spellcasting class and any one divine

spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding

the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that class would have gained.

If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class or

divine spellcasting class before becoming a Fochlucan

lyrist, she must decide to which class to add each Fochlucan

lyrist level for the purpose of determining spells per

day, spells known, and overall caster level.

For example, a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level bard/4th-level

druid/3rd-level Fochlucan lyrist can cast arcane spells as

an 8th-level bard and divine spells as a 7th-level druid.

Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A Fochlucan lyrist can

attempt to recall some relevant piece of information about

local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy

places. See the bard class feature, page 28 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.* She adds her Fochlucan lyrist class level to

her bardic knowledge checks, so her bardic knowledge

checks have a bonus equal to her bard level + her Fochlucan

lyrist level + her Int modifi er.

Bardic Music: A Fochlucan lyrist adds her lyrist

level to her bard level to determine the number of times

per day she can use her bardic music, the bardic music

abilities she can employ, and the power of those abilities.

For example, a 2nd-level rogue/5th-level bard/4th-level

druid/3rd-level Fochlucan lyrist can use her bardic music

eight times per day, can use any bardic music ability an

8th-level bard could use (assuming she meets the Perform

skill rank requirements), and is treated as an 8th-level

bard for adjudicating the effects of those abilities (such

as number of targets, save DC, and so forth).

Unbound: A Fochlucan lyrist’s druid oaths are

relaxed, allowing her to wear light metal armor with no

loss of spellcasting, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

A lyrist also suffers no experience point penalty for

multiclassing.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Tyrea deals an extra

1d6 points of damage on any successful

attack against fl at-footed or fl anked

targets, or against a target that has

been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies

to ranged attacks against targets up to

30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all

immune to sneak attacks. Tyrea can

choose to deliver nonlethal damage

with her sneak attack, but only when

using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Animal Companion (Ex): Tyrea

has a dire weasel named Fanger as

an animal companion (see *Monster*

*Manual*, page 65). Its bonus

trick is defend.

Animal Companion Benefi

ts: Tyrea and Fanger enjoy

the link and share spells special

qualities.

*Link (Ex):* Tyrea can handle

Fanger as a free action. She also

gains a +4 circumstance bonus

on all wild empathy checks and

Handle Animal checks made

regarding her dire weasel.

*Share Spells (Ex):* Tyrea can

have any spell she casts on

herself also affect Fanger if the

latter is within 5 feet at the time.

She can also cast a spell with a

target of “You” on her animal

companion.

Bardic Music: Use bardic

music six times per day. See the

bard class feature, page 29 of the

*Player’s Handbook.*

*Countersong (Su):* Use music

or poetics to counter magical

effects that depend on sound.

*Fascinate (Sp):* Use music or

poetics to cause one or more

creatures to become fascinated

with her.

*Inspire Competence (Su):* Use

music or poetics to help an ally

succeed at a task.

*Inspire Courage (Su):* Use music

or poetics to bolster her allies

against fear and improve their

combat abilities.

Evasion (Ex): If Tyrea

is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Refl ex saving throw

for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic

sleep effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is

considered an elf.

Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex): Tyrea gains a +4 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Trackless Step (Ex): Tyrea leaves no trail in natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Trapfi nding (Ex): Tyrea can fi nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search

skill to fi nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10

or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Tyrea can move through

natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain

at her normal speed and without damage or other

impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown

areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion

still affect her.

*Bard Spells Known* (3/4/3 per day; caster level 6th):

masterwork lyre, 27 gp.

FOCHLUCAN BANDORE

In the same vein that most folk consider the Fochlucan College to

be the most famous of the bardic colleges, the most well-known

and most often encountered of all the famed instruments of the

bards is the *Fochlucan bandore.* (This item and the other instruments

of the bards are described in detail in *Complete Arcane.*)

This three-stringed masterwork lute grants a +2 circumstance

bonus on Perform (string instruments) checks and a +1 competence

bonus on bardic music checks for countersong, *fascinate,*

and suggestion. The instrument can be played by anyone to

produce *light* once per day. Any character with at least 2 ranks in

Perform (string instruments) can use the *bandore* to cast *flare,*

*mending,* and *message* each once per day.

Faint transmutation, faint evocation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous

Item, *flare, light, mending, message,* creator must be a bard; Price

1,900 gp; Weight 3 lb.

THE FOCHLUCAN COLLEGE

Perhaps the most famous of the bardic colleges, the Fochlucan

College serves as a beacon of learning and diplomacy in

a dark and restless land. Many have accused the Fochlucan

masters of fomenting intrigues among the nearby kingdoms

and using their famed neutrality to conceal the real extent of

their meddling and manipulation. By advising mighty rulers and

undertaking the tutoring of royal heirs, the Fochlucan bards turn

the fate of kingdoms with nothing more than quiet words and

whispered secrets.

The Fochlucan College itself is located on the shores of the

misty Loch Firrnen, a few miles from the town of Oakenway. The

College is a rambling old stone building that resembles something

between a minor lord’s manor house and a decrepit old

monastery. Green ivy covers its walls, and old lanterns hanging

from its eaves warm its chill, misty nights with golden light.

No more than a handful of its collegians are present at any

given time—the strength of the organization lies in the learning

and skill of its individual members, not in any muster of

warriors. Members are welcome to stay as long as they like but

are expected to contribute to the college’s upkeep. The customary

donation is 50 gp a month (for itinerant members) or 200 gp

a month (for members living on the premises).

A small number of servants keep the College in order and

prepare meals, but there are no guards or soldiers. Instead, its

defense lies primarily in the reputation and influence of its members.

Should trouble come anyway, the College is well defended

by the handful of lyrists or guests who happen to be visiting at

any given time. In case of serious trouble, the Fochlucans turn to

the creatures of the surrounding forest. Through ancient pacts,

the sylvan denizens of Loch Firrnen’s forests are pledged to

defend the bards’ house against attack.

The College is governed by the Yew Circle, a small council

composed of the five most senior Fochlucans currently enrolled

in the order. All five are nominally equal, but if the Circle’s

opinion is divided on any important matter, the Eldest of the

Circle—the Fochlucan who has served the longest in the college—

decides the issue. Currently, the Eldest of Fochlucan is

Yew Master Hurlich Stennarden, a half-elf who has belonged to

the College for better than fifty years. The masters of the Yew

Circle rarely meet, since they are not often at the College at the

same time.

The Fochlucans are affiliated with several other bardic colleges

in neighboring lands, including the College of Mac-Fuirmidh, the

Doss School, and the High College of Anstruth, oldest and most

knowledgeable of the colleges.
