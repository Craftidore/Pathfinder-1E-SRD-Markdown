# Tactical Soldier (PrC)
## Overview
The tactical soldier is the master of teamwork in melee. She has

trained in cooperative battle tactics and knows how to take advantage

of position and timing to make herself and her teammates a

deadly, unified force in battle. No other force compares to a

group of melee-worthy combatants along with a tactical soldier

in the wings, ready to multiply the total deadly effectiveness of

the group by far more than their number alone would indicate.

It takes a special kind of person to

give up the limelight in favor of teamwork.

Those with the necessary

ability to think about the objective

first and their own glory

second make ideal tactical soldiers.

Fighters, paladins, and rangers are

the most common tactical soldiers,

knowing just how to multiply the

strengths and eradicate the weaknesses

of battle-hardened combatants.

NPC tactical soldiers make ideal

cohorts or hirelings. What fighter

wouldn’t want a tactical soldier backing

him up, ready to step in and fight

when the melee begins?

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the tactical soldier prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Tactical soldiers are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of

armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except

tower shields).

Flanker (Ex): A tactical soldier can flank enemies from seemingly

impossible angles. She can designate any adjacent square as

the square from which flanking against an ally is determined

(including the square where she stands, as normal). She may designate

the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time

during her turn. The designated square remains her effective

square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until

she chooses a different square (at the

start of one of her turns). The character

can even choose a square that

is impassable or occupied.

Sidestep (Ex): At 2nd level, a

tactical soldier gains Sidestep (described

later in this chapter) as a bonus

feat. If she already has the feat, she can

choose a different one.

Interpose (Ex): A tactical soldier gains

this ability, usable three times per day, at

3rd level. When an enemy threatens her in

melee and makes a successful attack against

an adjacent ally of hers, the tactical soldier

may take the damage (and other effects) of

the blow as if she had been hit instead.

Defensive Shield (Ex): Starting at 4th

level, whenever a tactical soldier fights defensively,

she provides up to two adjacent allies with

a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class, though their

attack rolls do not take the normal

–4 penalty (but her attack

rolls still do).

Offensive Strike (Ex): Starting at 5th

level, in times of urgency a tactical

soldier can lower all her defenses to

make a very aggressive attack. When

making an offensive strike, the tactical soldier gains

a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.

Until her next turn, however, she is wide open to physical and

magical attacks. All successful attack rolls made against the tactical

soldier are automatic threats, and all saving throws the tactical

soldier makes against spells automatically fail.

Delayed Cleave (Ex): Starting at 7th level, if the last creature a

tactical soldier hit in melee is dropped by someone other than her,

and the tactical soldier still threatens that creature’s square, she may

make a cleave attack as an attack of opportunity. All normal restrictions

on cleave attempts and attacks of opportunity apply.

Unbalancing Blow (Ex): Starting at 8th level, a tactical soldier

can use a full-round action to make a strategic melee attack

against an enemy. If the attack succeeds, in addition to dealing

regular damage, the blow unbalances the target so much that it

provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its

square. This ability works only on creatures up to one size category

larger than the tactical soldier.

Reciprocal Strike (Ex): A 10th-level tactical soldier can make

an attack of opportunity (subject to normal restrictions) against

a foe that successfully attacks an ally of the soldier and deals

damage. She can use this ability three times per day.
