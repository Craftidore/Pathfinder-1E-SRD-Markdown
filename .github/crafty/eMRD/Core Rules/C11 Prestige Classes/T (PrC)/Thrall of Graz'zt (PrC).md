# Thrall of Graz'zt (PrC)
## Overview
“The dark man, the shadow king, the ebony skinned master of all

things that revel in the night, oh master Graz’zt, spare me your

wrath and grant me your favor!”

—Besmal

The thrall of Graz’zt is a sinister, conniving, and thoroughly

evil master of arcane lore and dark secrets. She uses her

charm and guile to learn things that she should never

know—a sort of seductive loremaster who depends on subterfuge,

not study. A loremaster spends her days in a library

learning secrets, but a thrall of Graz’zt steals, seduces, or

tricks them from others.

Wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and bards make excellent

thralls of Graz’zt, although sorcerers are clearly the best of

them all. Graz’zt is the dark man that some sorcerers learn

their initial spells from without even knowing it.

Thralls of Graz’zt often work in cabals. These sinister,

secretive organizations sometimes work alongside rogues or

assassins to manage the criminal underworld of an entire

community or even an entire kingdom. The lust for power

of a thrall of Graz’zt knows no bounds.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Graz’zt

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Thralls of Graz’zt are

proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a thrall of Graz’zt gains 1st level, and every

two levels after that (plus 10th level), the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the

prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit

a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or

item creation feats, hit points

beyond those received from the

prestige class, and so on), except

for an increased effective level

of spellcasting. This essentially

means that she adds the new

level of thrall of Graz’zt to the

level of whatever other spellcasting

class the character has,

then determines spells per day,

spells known, and caster level

accordingly. For example, if

Kalleyis, an 8th-level wizard,

gains a level in thrall of Graz’zt,

she gains new spells as if she

had risen to 9th level in wizard,

but uses the other thrall of

Graz’zt aspects of level progression

such as base attack bonus

and save bonus. If she next

gains a level of wizard, making

her a 9th-level wizard/1st-level

thrall of Graz’zt, she gains spells

as if she had risen to 10th-level

wizard.

If a character had more than

one spellcasting class before

she became a thrall of Graz’zt,

she must decide to which class

she adds the level of thrall of

Graz’zt.

Charm (Sp): A thrall of

Graz’zt can produce an effect

identical to that of a charm person

spell cast by a caster of the thrall

of Graz’zt’s class level.

Spell Betrayal (Su): When casting a damage-dealing

spell at a target or targets denied their Dexterity bonus, a

thrall of Graz’zt of 2nd level or higher can increase the

amount of damage dealt. A 2nd-level thrall, for example,

adds +1d6 points of damage to a spell cast against flatfooted

targets. Graz’zt grants this ability in the hope that

the thrall will convince her enemies that she is their

friend, then betray them with a surprise magical attack.

The damage increase goes up by +1d6

for every two levels beyond 2nd, to

+5d6 at 10th level.

Dark Charisma (Ex):

At 3rd level, a thrall of

Graz’zt can add an

enhancement bonus

on certain Charismabased

skill checks.

The bonus is +1 at

3rd level, +2 at 5th

level, and +3 at 7th

level. The bonus improves

Animal Empathy,

Diplomacy, Bluff,

Gather Information, Handle

Animal, and Perform checks when

dealing with evil creatures.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 4th-level

thrall of Graz’zt can summon a demon

of 5 HD or less once per day. This functions

as a summon monster spell cast by

a 15th-level caster. A 9th-level thrall of

Graz’zt can summon a demon of

10 HD or less once per day.

Spellstrike (Su): If a thrall

of Graz’zt casts a damaging

spell upon a target or targets

threatened in melee

(and thus distracted),

the thrall can

add half of the

spell betrayal

bonus (round

down) to the damage dealt.

Thus, a 6th-level or 7th-level thrall of

Graz’zt deals an additional +1d6 points of damage with a

spell against threatened targets. At 8th level and higher, this

bonus damage increases to +2d6 points.
