# Thrall of Juiblex (PrC)
## Overview
“All hail the dark, whispered master, patron of pestilence, and father

of slime, Juiblex the unspeakable!”

—Duvamil

The thrall of Juiblex is as disgusting an individual as one may

ever encounter. Oozing a horrible slime and surrounded by a

nauseating stench, these thralls have no place in normal

society, although the more powerful ones can disguise their

form to slip among civilized people.

Fighters and barbarians sometimes become thralls of

Juiblex, and clerics who favor the demon prince also take

the prestige class.

A thrall of Juiblex usually operates alone, for no one can

stand to be near it except for undead, oozes, and possibly

cancer mages.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Juiblex

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall of Juiblex is

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Sickening Slime (Ex): A thrall of Juiblex can secrete a

smelly slime that coats its body in a thin layer. Anyone

within 5 feet must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10

+ the thrall’s class level + Constitution bonus) or take a –1

circumstance penalty on attack rolls and skill checks, due

to the outrageous odor of the slime layer.

Corrosive Touch (Ex): Three times per day, a thrall of

Juiblex of 2nd level or higher can secrete a caustic slime

on its hand that deals 2d6 points of damage. Once it is

secreted, the thrall can make an attack to get the corrosive

slime to damage a foe, dealing normal unarmed damage as

well as the damage from the slime. Because of the corrosive

slime, this attack is not considered unarmed and does

not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Summon Ooze (Sp): At 3rd level, a thrall of

Juiblex can summon a patch of green

slime, a gray ooze, an ochre jelly, or a

gelatinous cube as the summon monster

spell with his thrall level as the

caster level.

Contagion (Su): Once per day, a thrall of Juiblex can

spread a disease, as the contagion spell (caster level 10th).

Alter Self (Su): At 4th level, a thrall of Juiblex’s form

becomes somewhat transitory and amorphous. It can

change its appearance and form at will, as the alter self spell

cast by a 4th-level caster.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 5th-level thrall of Juiblex can

summon a demon of 5 HD or less once per day. This functions

as a summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

A 9th-level thrall of Juiblex can summon a demon of 10

HD or less once per day.

Corrosive Spew (Ex): At 6th level, a thrall of Juiblex

can spit a gout of caustic goo in a line 5 feet wide and 30

feet long once per day. The corrosive spew deals 8d6

points of acid damage to anyone in its path, with a Reflex

saving throw (DC 10 + thrall’s class level + thrall’s Con

bonus) for half damage.

Summon Pudding (Sp): At 7th level, a thrall of Juiblex

can summon a black pudding as if it had cast a summon

monster spell with its thrall level as the caster level.

Polymorph Self (Su): An 8th-level thrall of Juiblex’s

form is more amorphous than ever. It can change its

appearance and form at will, as the polymorph self spell cast

by an 8th-level caster.

No Discernible Anatomy (Ex): At 10th level, a thrall

of Juiblex’s form is so amorphous that it no longer need

worry about being affected by critical hits, sneak attacks,

damage from poison, paralysis, or stunning. However,

potions no longer affect the thrall either.
