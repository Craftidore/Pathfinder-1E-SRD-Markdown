# Thrall of Demogorgon (PrC)
## Overview
“The dual-lived, dual-willed prince of the Abyss, master of the mysterious

and king of the deviants, Demogorgon, you are my lord!”

—Qill

The thrall of Demogorgon is a perversion of his race—and a

madman. He seeks out the morbid and the bizarre, and he

thrives on the chaotic nature of mutation and deformity. In

the service of his terrible master, he attempts to spread dissent,

madness, and conflict. He works to topple that which

provides order and pervert that which is true.

Multiclass characters make the best thralls of Demogorgon,

because he appreciates their versatility. A thrall of

Demogorgon usually works alone, and his greatest enemies

are often other thralls of Demogorgon, although he hates all

other demon prince thralls as well. Other enemies include

good-aligned characters and creatures—actually, thralls of

Demogorgon despise everyone.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Demogorgon

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall of Demogorgon

is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with

all types of armor, and with shields.

Bonus Feat or Spells: When a thrall of Demogorgon

attains 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the character gains new

spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige

class, or else he gains a bonus feat of his choice. If the

thrall chooses +1 spellcasting level, he does not gain any

other benefit a character of that class would have gained

(improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic

or item creation feats, hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an

increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that he adds the new level to the level of whatever

other spellcasting class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he

became a thrall of Demogorgon, he must decide to which class

he adds the level for purposes of determining spells per day.

A thrall of Demogorgon is free to choose the bonus feat at

one opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the

decision arises, or vice versa. Characters who are not spellcasters

must choose the bonus feat.

Scaly Flesh (Ex): A 1st-level thrall of Demogorgon gains

dark scaly flesh, which provides a +1 natural armor bonus. At

every three levels beyond 1st (4th, 7th, and 10th), this bonus

increases by +1. The bonus from scaly flesh stacks with that

of natural armor derived from creature type (if the thrall of

Demogorgon is a lizardfolk or troglodyte, for example), but

not from magical sources such as an amulet of natural armor.

Hypnosis (Sp): Once per day, a thrall of Demogorgon can

produce an effect identical to that of the hypnotism spell,

except that it functions as a gaze attack with a range of 30

feet. The Will save DC to resist the effect is 10 + thrall’s class

level + thrall’s Cha modifier.

Touch of Fear (Sp): Three times per day, a thrall of Demogorgon

of 2nd level or higher can use an effect identical to

that of the cause fear spell. The Will save DC to negate the

fear is 10 + class level + Cha modifier.

Reaching Touch (Su): Three times per day, a 3rd-level thrall

of Demogorgon can cause his arms to stretch unnaturally like

tentacles, providing him an extra 5 feet of reach for 1 round.

Dual Actions (Su): Twice per day, a 4th-level thrall of

Demogorgon can take two full rounds’ worth of actions in

the same round.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 5th-level thrall of Demogorgon

can summon a demon of 5 HD or less once per day. This

functions as a summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level

caster. Once per day, a 9th-level thrall of Demogorgon can

summon a demon of 10 HD or less.

Rotting Touch (Sp): Three times per day, a thrall of Demogorgon

can deal 1d6 points of Constitution damage as a

touch attack.

Two Personas (Ex): An 8th-level thrall of Demogorgon

goes a little insane, if he is not already mad. The thrall develops

a multiple personality disorder that has the side effect of

allowing the character to multiclass freely with no experience

point penalties.

Death Touch (Sp): At 8th level, a thrall of Demogorgon can

use an effect identical to that of a slay living spell once per

day. The Fortitude save DC to avoid death is 10 + class level +

Cha modifier.

Demogorgon’s Will (Sp): A 10th-level thrall of Demogorgon

can call upon the power of his master and be granted a limited

wish spell once per day. The use of this ability requires 3

full rounds devoted to entreaties and prayers to Demogorgon

before the limited wish is granted. The thrall must pay

the experience point cost and provide any needed material

components.
