# Tempest (PrC)
## Overview
A tempest is the point of calm within a whirling barrier

of deadly blades. Poets use colorful terms such as

“dancing” to describe the movement of a tempest and

her two blades, but mastery of this fighting style is not

about dancing, nor is it about impressing anyone—least

of all poets. A tempest focuses on learning the secrets of

two-weapon fighting for a single purpose: the destruction

of her enemies.

Typically hardy individualists, tempests rarely learn

their skills through formal training. Instead, they master

their art through constant application of its disciplines

and experimentation on their foes. Similarly, no matter

how famous a tempest becomes, it’s rare for one to take

on students. Their art, they say, is one that can be learned

but never taught.

This prestige class is open to all classes and races.

Though tempests are rare, every humanoid race has

boasted at least a few. Even members of the smaller races

can find the tempest’s path appealing. Elves make nimble,

clever tempests whose Dexterity works to their advantage.

Dwarves are the least likely to become tempests, perhaps

because they favor heavy armor and heavy weapons, but

some do exist.

Adaptation: Elite two-weapon fighters could be

trained in many schools and kingdoms. An interesting

way to incorporate tempests into a campaign world

involves having several groups of tempests specialize in

different pairs of weapons. Elf war leaders might train

to perfect their grace and effectiveness with two short

swords, while an exotic group of human warriors might

prefer a handaxe and a kukri.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a tempest, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the tempest

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Tempests gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Tempest Defense (Ex): When wielding a double

weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons

or unarmed strikes), a tempest gains a +1 bonus to Armor

Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level and +3 at

5th level. The character loses this ability when fighting

in medium or heavy armor.

Ambidexterity (Ex): For a tempest of 2nd level or

higher, her attack penalties for fighting with two weapons

are lessened by 1 (from –4 to –3, or from –2 to –1 if

the off-hand weapon is a light weapon). At 4th level, the

attack penalties are lessened by another 1 (from –3 to –2,

or to +0 if the off-hand weapon is a light weapon). The

character loses this ability when fighting in medium

or heavy armor. See Table 8–10: Two-Weapon Fighting

Penalties, page 160 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Two-Weapon Versatility (Ex): When a tempest of 3rd

level or higher fights with two weapons, she can apply the effects of certain feats from one weapon to the other

weapon as well, as long as those effects can be applied

legally. She can use this ability only with the following

feats: Greater Weapon Focus,

Greater Weapon Specialization,

Improved Critical, Weapon

Focus, and Weapon Specialization.

For example, a tempest who

wields a longsword and a short

sword and who has the Weapon

Focus (longsword) feat can apply

the effect of Weapon Focus to her

short sword as well as to her longsword.

If a tempest already has

the feat with both weapons,

she gains no additional

effect.

Two-Weapon

Spring Attack (Ex):

When a 5th-level tempest

makes a spring

attack, she can attack

once each with

two different weapons

as an attack

action. The character

loses this

ability when

fi ghting in

medium or

heavy armor.
