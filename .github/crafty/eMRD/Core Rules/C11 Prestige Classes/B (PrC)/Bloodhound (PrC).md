# Bloodhound (PrC)
## Overview
A bandit king raids caravans on the road. An ogre pillages

farms to the north. A sorcerer has kidnapped the mayor’s

son and hidden him somewhere in the marsh—and the

soldiers of the king cannot seem to stem the tide. The

terrifi ed citizens have only one choice, and it isn’t cheap.

They call in a bloodhound.

A bloodhound tracks down wrongdoers and brings

them to whatever justice awaits them. Low-level bloodhounds

depend on their keen senses and careful training

to hunt their targets. As they gain experience, their obsessive

determination gives them supernatural abilities that

make them nearly unstoppable.

Though some bloodhounds leave calling cards or even

brands on their targets, most don’t kill their quarry if they

can help it. They prefer instead to subdue their targets

and bring them in. For those of good alignment, this

practice satisfi es some deeply held belief in the cause of

justice. For neutral and evil bloodhounds, it ensures a

steady stream of income from catching the same targets

over and over when they break out of jail.

Rangers and barbarians make the best bloodhounds,

but rogues, bards, druids, and fi ghters can also excel in

this role. Occasionally, a paladin shoulders the mantle,

but never for money. Most bloodhounds are human,

though elves and half-elves sometimes fi nd this lifestyle

satisfying. Some of the best bloodhounds are humanoids

such as gnolls, hobgoblins, and bugbears.

Most NPC bloodhounds work for money (usually a lot

of it), but some accept jobs for justice, revenge, or enjoyment.

When a bloodhound accepts a job, he designates

his target as a mark. Thereafter, he does not abandon the

case until it is fi nished, which occurs when the mark is

apprehended or when either the mark or the bloodhound

dies.

Adaptation: The easiest way to adapt this class to

your own campaign is to tie bloodhounds to one or more

organizations of superlative trackers. The most obvious

choice is the Bloodhounds, an organization described

in Chapter 6 of this book. But you also might introduce

a more localized group of bloodhounds—for example, a

group of rangers and bloodhounds sworn to serve a small

barony far to the north; funds earned by “the Brennmark

Trackers” might be the major income of their tiny homeland.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the bloodhound prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Bloodhounds are

profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with

light armor.

Mark (Ex): A bloodhound can target, or mark, an individual

humanoid or monstrous humanoid foe to better

hunt that enemy. To do so, the bloodhound must focus

on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or

description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption

ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to

start the process again. Once this study is complete, that

target is called a mark.

A bloodhound adds his bloodhound level as an insight

bonus on all Gather Information, Listen, Search, Spot, and

Survival checks made to determine the whereabouts of a

mark. As a bloodhound gains levels, he gains additional

abilities that can be used against a mark.

If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending

an existing one, the latter becomes unmarked, and the

bloodhound loses experience points equal to the amount

he would have earned for defeating that creature. A

bloodhound can choose a mark only once a week.

Initially, a bloodhound can have only one

mark at a time. For every three bloodhound

levels gained beyond 1st, a bloodhound

can have one additional mark, but only

if all the marks are chosen during the

same process (see above). For example,

a 4th-level bloodhound could mark two

bugbears in the same group of prisoners,

or the depictions of a bugbear and

a hobgoblin if both were studied at

the same time. If a bloodhound

gives up on apprehending any of

his marks, all remaining marked

creatures become unmarked as

described above.

Swift Tracker (Ex): A bloodhound

can move at his normal

speed while following tracks. See

the ranger class feature, page 48 of

the *Player’s Handbook*.

Nonlethal Force

(Ex): Starting at 2nd

level, a bloodhound

can use a melee weapon that

deals lethal damage to deal

nonlethal damage instead

without taking the usual

–4 penalty on his attack

roll.

Ready and Waiting (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a

bloodhound is ready for trickery at all times. He can

ready an action against his mark, even outside of the

initiative sequence. If the mark triggers the bloodhound’s

readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes,

the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the

two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound

is capable of carrying out that action). If the bloodhound

is incapable of carrying out the action—for instance, if

he is too far away to strike the mark with a readied melee

attack—the readied action is lost.

Bring ’em Back Alive (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a

bloodhound can turn a potentially killing blow into an

incapacitating one—all the better to bring a mark back

for punishment. At the bloodhound’s option, any melee

attack that would reduce a foe to –2 or fewer hit points

reduces the foe to –1 hit points instead. A bloodhound

must choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing

his foe to –2 or fewer hit points, and before making

any other action (or even continuing a full

attack). A raging bloodhound can’t use this

ability.

Tenacious Pursuit (Ex): At 3rd level

and above, a bloodhound tracking a

mark gains a +4 bonus on Constitution

checks made to resist nonlethal damage

from a forced march (see page 164 of

the *Player’s Handbook*).

In addition, a bloodhound

tracking a mark

can increase his own

speed by 10 feet, up to

a maximum value equal to

the mark’s speed. This bonus

stacks with all other speed

increases. At 6th level, the speed

increase improves to 20 feet, and

it goes up to 30 feet at 9th level.

Hunter’s Dedication (Ex):

Beginning at 4th level, a bloodhound

adds his Constitution bonus

(if any) to Will saves made to resist

the special attacks or spells of his

mark.

Move Like the Wind

(Ex): Starting at 4th level,

a bloodhound can move

stealthily even at a quick

pace. He no longer

takes a –5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving at any

speed up to his normal speed, and he takes only a –10

penalty (instead of a –20 penalty) on Hide and Move Silently

checks when running. (He takes the normal –20

penalty when attacking or charging.)

Crippling Strike (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound

can deliver strikes against his mark with such

precision that each successful attack also deals 2 points of

Strength damage to the mark. A bloodhound can deliver

a crippling strike with a melee attack, or with a ranged

attack from a distance of up to 30 feet. See the rogue class

feature, page 51 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Track the Trackless (Su): Starting at 5th level, a

bloodhound can track a creature moving under the

influence of *pass without trace* or a similar effect, though

he takes a –20 penalty on his Survival checks when

doing so.

See Invisibility (Su): This ability, gained at 6th

level, functions like a *see invisibility* spell, except that

it is constantly in effect and it reveals only invisible

marks.

Shielded Mind (Su): At 6th level, a bloodhound gains

spell resistance against divination spells equal to 15 + his

bloodhound level. This benefit does not stack with other

forms of spell resistance.

Locate Creature (Sp): Once per day, a bloodhound

of 7th level or higher can produce an effect identical to

that of a *locate creature* spell with a caster level equal to

the bloodhound’s character level.

Freedom of Movement (Su): Starting at 8th level,

a bloodhound can act normally regardless of magical

effects that impede movement, as if he were affected

by a *freedom of movement* spell. The effect lasts for a total

time per day of 1 round per point of Wisdom bonus he

possesses (minimum 1 round). The effect occurs automatically

as soon as it is applied, lasts until it runs out or

is no longer needed, and can be used multiple times per

day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). The character’s

caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.

Scent (Ex): At 9th level, a bloodhound gains the scent

ability (see page 314 of the *Monster Manual*).

Find the Path (Sp): A 10th-level bloodhound can use

*find the path* twice per day as the spell. His caster level is

equal to his bloodhound level.

+10, Survival +10 (+12 following tracks); Endurance,

Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Track, Weapon Focus

(longbow).

*Languages:* Common, Orc.

Bring ’em Back Alive (Ex): At Ulfur’s option, any

melee attack that would reduce his foe to –2 or fewer hit

points reduces the foe to –1 hit points instead. He must

choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing

the foe to –2 or fewer hit points, and before making any

other action (or even continuing a full attack).

Half-Orc Traits: For all effects related to race, a halforc

is considered an orc.

Mark (Ex): Ulfur can target, or mark, an individual

humanoid or monstrous humanoid foe, in order to better

hunt that enemy. To do so, he must focus on a foe who is

present and visible, or on the depiction or description of

one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the

attempt and forces him to start the process again. Once

this study is complete, that target is called a mark.

Ulfur gains a +3 insight bonus on all Gather Information,

Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks made to

determine the whereabouts of a mark.

Ulfur can have only one mark at a given time. If he

chooses a new mark before apprehending an existing one,

the latter becomes unmarked, and Ulfur loses experience

points equal to the amount he would have earned for

defeating that creature. Ulfur can choose a mark only

once a week.

Nonlethal Force (Ex): Ulfur can use a melee weapon

that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead

without taking the usual –4 penalty on his attack roll.

Ready and Waiting (Ex): Ulfur can ready an action

against his mark, even outside of the initiative sequence.

If the mark triggers his readied action at any point within

the next 10 minutes, Ulfur can carry out his readied

action as if the two were engaged in combat (as long as he

is capable of carrying out that action). If he is incapable

of carrying out the action—for instance, if he is too far

away to strike the mark with a readied melee attack—the

readied action is lost.

Skirmish (Ex): Ulfur gains a +1 competence bonus to

AC and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks

during any round in which he moves at least 10 feet. The

extra damage applies only to attacks taken during his turn.

This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets

up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to this extra

damage. Ulfur loses this ability when wearing medium or

heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Ulfur can track at normal speed

without taking the usual –5 penalty, or he can track at

double speed at only a –10 penalty.

Tenacious Pursuit (Ex): When tracking a mark, Ulfur

gains a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to resist

nonlethal damage from a forced march.

In addition, when tracking a mark Ulfur can increase

his own speed by 10 feet, up to a maximum value equal

to the mark’s speed. This benefit stacks with all other

speed increases.

Trackless Step (Ex): Ulfur leaves no trail in natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Trapfinding (Ex): Ulfur can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Ulfur retains his Dexterity

bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

*Possessions: +2 leather armor, +1 composite longbow* (+1

Str bonus) with 20 arrows*, +1 short sword*, masterwork

manacles.
