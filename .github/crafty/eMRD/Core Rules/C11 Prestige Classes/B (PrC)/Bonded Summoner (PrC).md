# Bonded Summoner (PrC)
## Overview
He who learns to leash the furies of the Elemental Planes

is known as a bonded summoner. The mightiest manifestation

of those planes, in their various potencies, is the

elemental. And the bonded summoner knows elementals.

He has studied their ways, means, origins, and formation. He

instinctively knows an elemental’s strengths and develops

an unbreakable bond with a powerful elemental companion.

As this bond deepens over time, the bonded summoner’s

kinship with the elemental forces he controls deepens, blurring the line between summoner

and summoned. Eventually, this journey of

discovery leads to his own ability to take on

the form of that which he could formerly

only summon.

The knowledge required to learn

the secrets of the Outer Planes is

arcane in nature, and thus this

prestige class is filled mostly

with sorcerers and wizards—

though anyone else who meets

the requirements may choose

to take the journey of a bonded

summoner.

NPC bonded summoners

are usually loners, though

they may organize with specialists

or fellow bonded summoners

of their element if

threatened. Other NPC bonded

summoners are content to

join their abilities with companies

of adventurers to explore

all the avenues of elementals.

Because a bonded summoner

brings with him a powerful

ally, most groups are happy to

form such an alliance.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a bonded summoner, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

The bonded summoner’s class

skills are Concentration (Con),

Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int),

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features

of the bonded summoner

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Bonded summoners gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day: At every evennumbered

level gained in the bonded

summoner class, the character gains new

spells per day as if he had also gained a level in

an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to

before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain all the benefits

a character of that class would have

gained (metamagic or item creation

feats, and so on), except for

an increased effective level of spellcasting.

If a character had more

than one arcane spellcasting

class before becoming a bonded

summoner, he must decide to

which class he adds the new

level for purposes of determining

spells per day.

Elemental Companion (Ex):

At 1st level, a bonded summoner

picks his element of study: air,

earth, fire, or water. This choice

cannot be changed. The bonded

summoner calls a Medium elemental

of the type chosen, which

replaces his familiar. The elemental

gets abilities according to the

information in the accompanying

sidebar.

At 3rd level, his elemental companion

grows to Large. At 5th level, it grows to

Huge. At 7th level, the companion becomes

a greater elemental, and at 9th level it becomes

an elder elemental.

If the elemental companion dies, the bonded

summoner takes damage equal to the elemental’s

Hit Dice. The bonded summoner also

takes 1d4 points of damage to each ability score. A

new elemental of the same kind as the old one may

be summoned 24 hours later. A bonded summoner

may dismiss his elemental at any time without taking this

damage, but he must still wait 24 hours before summoning

another elemental.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): A bonded summoner gains resistance

5 against the energy type associated with his element of study.

**Element Energy**

Air Electricity

Earth Acid

Fire Fire

Water Cold

At 3rd level, this resistance improves to 10. At 5th level, it improves

to 15. At 7th level, it improves to 20. At 9th level, the character

gains immunity to the energy type in question.

Immunities (Ex): Over time, a bonded summoner slowly

turns into an elemental, gaining an elemental’s immunities along

the way.

At 3rd level, he becomes immune to sleep effects.

At 5th level, he becomes immune to poison.

At 7th level, he becomes immune to paralysis and stunning.

At 10th level, he is no longer subject to critical hits.

Cannot Be Flanked (Ex): At 9th level, a bonded summoner

has become so much like an elemental that he loses the normal

human orientation toward “front” and “back.” Like an elemental,

he can’t be flanked.

Elemental Form (Su): At 10th level, a bonded summoner

gains the ability to turn himself into an elemental and back again

once per day. This elemental is an elder elemental of the bonded

summoner’s element of study. This

ability functions like the *polymorph* spell,

except as noted here. The effect lasts for

10 hours, or until the bonded summoner

changes back. Changing form (to elemental

or back) is a standard action that does not

provoke an attack of opportunity.

Elemental Type: At 10th level, a bonded summoner’s

type changes to elemental, and he gains

the subtype of the appropriate element. He loses any

other elemental subtypes he may have.

BONDED SUMMONER’S ELEMENTAL

COMPANION

A bonded summoner has an elemental companion that starts at Medium

size and grows larger as the bonded summoner’s level increases.

**Arcane**

**Level Special**

Up to 8th Deliver touch spells, devotion, empathic link,

improved evasion, share spells

9th–11th Spell resistance

12th or higher Improved speed

**Elemental Companion Basics:** Use the statistics for an elemental of the

appropriate size as found in the *Monster Manual*, but make the following

changes:

*Arcane Level:* The bonded summoner’s total of levels in the bonded

summoner class and other arcane spellcasting classes.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* A companion can deliver touch spells for

the bonded summoner. If the bonded summoner and the companion

are in contact at the time the bonded summoner casts a touch spell, he

can designate his companion as the “toucher.” The companion can

then deliver the touch spell just as the bonded summoner could. As

usual, if the bonded summoner casts another touch spell before the

touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

*Devotion (Ex):* An elemental companion’s devotion to the bonded

summoner is so complete that it gains a +4 morale bonus on Will

saves against enchantment spells and effects.

*Empathic Link (Su):* The bonded summoner has an empathic link

with his elemental companion out to a distance of 1 mile. The bonded

summoner cannot see through the companion’s eyes, but they can

communicate empathically. Note that even intelligent elementals

see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are

always possible.

Because of this empathic link, the bonded summoner has the

same connection to an item or place that his companion does, just

as a master and his familiar (see the Familiars sidebar, page 52 of

the *Player’s Handbook*).

*Improved Evasion (Ex):* When subjected to an attack that normally

allows a Reflex save for half damage, an elemental companion takes no

damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if

the saving throw fails.

*Share Spells:* At the bonded summoner’s option, he may have any

spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his

elemental companion. The companion must be within 5 feet at the

time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration

other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the companion if the

creature moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the companion

again even if it returns to the bonded summoner before the duration

expires. Additionally, the bonded summoner may cast a spell with

a target of “You” on his companion (as a touch range spell) instead of

on himself. A bonded summoner and his companion can share spells

even if the spells normally do not affect elementals.

*Spell Resistance (Ex):* If the bonded summoner’s arcane spellcaster

level is 9th or higher, an elemental companion gains spell resistance

equal to the bonded summoner’s arcane spellcaster level + 5.

*Improved Speed (Ex):* All of the elemental companion’s speed figures

increase by 10 feet.
