# Beastmaster (PrC)
## Overview
A beastmaster feels more at home among the animals of

nature than fellow sentient beings. Over time, these wanderers

befriend a wide variety of animals, from mighty

dire lions to tiny weasels. Eventually, a beastmaster takes

on aspects of her animal companions, becoming almost

as much animal as humanoid.

Druids and rangers are the most common beastmasters,

thanks to those characters’ natural link with the animal

world. Some barbarians, fi ghters, or scouts also become

beastmasters, particularly those with a strong affi nity for

nature (such as elves or halfl ings). Characters of other

classes rarely pursue this path.

NPC beastmasters are typically loners, relying on their

animal companions for friendship on their travels. Goodaligned

beastmasters might use their powers to right

injustices, even allying themselves with rural villages

for a time. Evil-aligned beastmasters are often openly

hostile to civilization, becoming reclusive xenophobes.

Adaptation: Beastmasters could belong to a widespread

organization of like-minded individuals, each one

dedicated to the bond between humanoid and animal.

Rival factions might arise along alignment lines, or be

divided by the choice of animal companions.

Hit Die: d10.

To qualify to become a beastmaster, a character must

fulfi ll all the following criteria.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the beastmaster

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Beastmasters gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Animal Companion (Ex): A beastmaster gains the

service of a loyal animal companion. See the druid

class feature, pages 35–36 of the *Player’s Handbook*. Treat

the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the

beastmaster’s class level + 3. A beastmaster can select one

of the animals available to a 1st-level druid and then apply

the modifi cations as appropriate for a 4th-level druid’s

animal companion, or she can select a typical version of

one of the animals available to a 4th-level druid.

As a beastmaster gains class levels, her animal companion

gains Hit Dice and other special abilities just as

a druid’s animal companion does. Use the beastmaster’s

class level + 3 to determine the animal companion’s

special abilities.

If a beastmaster already has an animal companion from

another class, her beastmaster class levels stack with

class levels from all other classes that grant an animal

companion. For example, a 5th-level druid/2nd-level

beastmaster would be treated as a 10th-level druid

for the purpose of improving the statistics of her

animal companion (and which alternative

animal companions she could select).

Wild Empathy (Ex): A beastmaster

can improve the attitude

of an animal. See the druid

class feature, page 35 of

the *Player’s Handbook.* If

a beastmaster has wild

empathy from another

class, her levels stack

for determining the

bonus.

Alertness: A beastmaster’s

senses grow keen as she learns some of the tricks of the animal kingdom. Accordingly,

she gains Alertness as a bonus feat at 2nd level.

Speak with Animals (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, a

beastmaster can use *speak with animals* once per day as

the spell cast by a caster of her class level. She can use

this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per

day at 9th level.

Extra Animal Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a

beastmaster gains a second animal companion, chosen

from the list of animal companions available to a 1st-level

druid. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is

equal to the beastmaster’s class level – 3 for the purpose

of improving the animal companion’s statistics (or of

selecting an alternative companion at higher levels).

At 7th level, a beastmaster gains a third animal companion,

chosen from the list of animal companions

available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a

druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster’s class level

– 6 for the purpose of improving the animal companion’s

statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at

higher levels).

At 10th level, a beastmaster gains a fourth animal

companion, chosen from the list of animal companions

available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a

druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster’s class level

– 9 for the purpose of improving the animal companion’s

statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at

higher levels).

Other class levels in classes that offer an animal companion

don’t stack for the purpose of determining the

power of a beastmaster’s additional animal companions,

nor do they allow her to choose additional animal companions

from the alternative lists.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 5th level, a beastmaster

gains low-light vision, allowing her to see twice as far as

a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar

conditions of shadowy illumination. She retains the ability

to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

If she already has low-light vision from another source

(such as her race), her low-light vision improves, allowing

her to see three times as far as a human in conditions of

shadowy illumination.

Scent (Ex): At 8th level, a beastmaster gains the scent

ability (see page 314 of the *Monster Manual*).
