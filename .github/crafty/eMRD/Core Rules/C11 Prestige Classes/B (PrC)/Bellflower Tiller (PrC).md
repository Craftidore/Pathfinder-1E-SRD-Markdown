# Bellflower Tiller (PrC)
## Overview
Perhaps no group has done more to sow the seeds of freedom in devil-haunted Cheliax than the Bellf lower Network, and no agents of that network do or risk more than its dedicated bellf lower tillers. Charged with freeing slaves from the infernal nation’s many plantations and escorting them to the safety of Andoran and Rahadoum, bellf lower tillers are a constant thorn in the side of House Thrune and its diabolical minions. These elite liberators practice their craft all across Cheliax, from the darkened streets of Egorian and Westcrown to the wilds of the Whisperwood. Tillers employ farming euphemisms to mask their activities from unfriendly ears—referring to their secret hideouts as “barns,” the slaves they escort as their “crops,” and the secret paths they take as “rows.” Excessive contact between tillers is discouraged by the Bellf lower Network’s leadership, lest they risk exposing the organization to the authorities. Despite this, tillers often meet in secret to discuss which routes are safest to take, how much to bribe certain officials, and what tactics for organizing groups of slaves work best, and so improve each other’s chances of evading capture. 

Nearly all bellf lower tillers are half ling rogues, though some particularly zealous members are rogue/inquisitors, and savvy hunters among their ranks might be rogue/ rangers. Non-half lings are usually only admitted after proving their allegiance to the anti-slavery movement and their friendliness toward half lings. 

A bellf lower tiller’s duty relies in part on her ability to establish a believable and viable cover identity. Tillers often pose as traveling merchants or tinkerers—occupations that give them the freedom to travel where they need to, when they need to, and provide a solid excuse for their presence on the road should they be confronted by a Chelish patrol. Other tillers join mercenary bands or adventuring groups, using their organizational and survival skills to help their companions in exchange for some extra muscle should a particular slave breakout proceed poorly. 

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features 

The following are class features of the bellf lower tiller prestige class. 

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A bellf lower tiller gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies. 

Bellf lower Crop (Ex): As a standard action, a bellf lower tiller may designate a number of allies up to 3 + her Charisma modifier as part of her bellf lower crop. Members of a bellf lower crop must remain within 30 feet of the bellf lower tiller in order to gain the benefits granted by a bellf lower tiller’s other class abilities, detailed below; if they leave this range, the bellf lower tiller must designate these allies again for them to be included in her crop. At 7th level, this range increases to 60 feet. 

Swift Sower (Ex): A bellf lower tiller’s base land speed is treated as being +10 feet faster when determining her overland travel speed while traveling long distances and while outside of combat. Members of her bellf lower crop may use either the bellf lower tiller’s overland travel speed or their own, whichever is better. At 6th level, the bonus to speed increases to +20 feet. 

Crop Guardian (Ex): At 2nd level, a bellf lower tiller is dedicated to ensuring the safety and success of those she guides. Whenever she uses the aid another action for a member of her bellf lower crop, she grants a +3 bonus instead of the normal +2. 

Scarecrow (Ex): At 2nd level, a bellf lower tiller receives a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made against creatures that threaten members of her bellf lower crop. At 4th level and every two levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 10th level. 

Teamwork Feat: At 2nd level, a bellf lower tiller gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This bonus feat must be selected from those listed as teamwork feats, and the bellf lower tiller must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat. At 6th level and again at 10th, the bellf lower tiller gains an additional bonus teamwork feat. 

Sneak Attack: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every two levels (3rd, 6th, and 9th). If a bellf lower tiller gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. 

Favored Barn (Ex): At 5th level, a bellf lower tiller grows familiar with and develops trusted contacts in a particular community. While inside the limits of this community, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. Any ally designated as part of the bellf lower tiller’s crop receives a bonus on these skills equal to half the tiller’s bonus. A bellf lower tiller traveling through her favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although she may leave a trail if she so desires). 

Provided she isn’t in immediate danger (such as f leeing from pursuers right on her heels), a bellf lower tiller can always find a safe place for her and members of her crop to rest in her chosen community. At such a location, she and her allies are fed, clothed, and provided with basic medical attention (as if attended by a person with a Heal bonus of +10). 

At 7th level, and again at 9th level, the bellf lower tiller may select an additional community in which to receive these bonuses. Each time she selects a new community, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one chosen community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2. 

For the purposes of this ability, a community is considered any settlement consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are considered part of a community.
