# Black Flame Zealot (PrC)
## Overview
The Order of the Black Flame is the hidden

blade of their faith, a secret society

of holy slayers devoted to the

worship of a dark deity of

fi re and destruction.

Trained in unholy

rites, the black fl ame

zealots use stealth,

divine magic,

and the zeal of

fanaticism to

destroy those

who have

given offense

to their god.

Even great

rulers are

not above the

deity’s wrath,

since the Order

is a sanctioned and

respected means for

the wealthy and powerful

to pursue vendettas.

Clerics and particularly

devout rogues or fi ghters most often

become black fl ame zealots. A small

number of the order’s members are

high-ranking clerics who keep an

eye open for fellow devotees who

seem like suitable candidates.

Adaptation: The black fl ame zealot works best with any

nongood patron deity with the Fire domain, such as Pyremius

(see page XX) or Kossuth from the Forgotten Realms.

It’s also relatively straightforward to open the prestige class

to any character with access to the Fire and Destruction (or

Death) domains. This prestige class is part of a secret society,

so you’ll want to fi gure out what the Order of the Black

Flame’s agenda is in your campaign.

Finally, this prestige class is

an example of a profession

similar to that

of an assassin that

doesn’t mandate

its members

be evil

(although

some

certainly

are).

Hit

Die: d6.

zealot, a character must fulfi ll all the

Feats: Exotic Weapon

Profi ciency (kukri), Iron

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the black fl ame zealot

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Black fl ame zealots

gain no profi ciency in any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each even-numbered

black fl ame zealot level, the character gains new spells per

day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained

a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he belonged

before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have

gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character

had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming

a black fl ame zealot, the player must decide to which

class to add each black fl ame zealot level for the purpose of

determining spells per day and spells known.

Death Attack (Ex): As the assassin ability described on

page 180 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide,* except that black

fl ame zealots do not have the option of paralyzing their

targets. If a black fl ame zealot has this class feature from

another class (such as assassin), he may add black fl ame

zealot class levels together with the class levels of such other

classes to calculate the save DC of his death attack.

Zealous Heart (Su): A black fl ame zealot is immune to

fear, magical or otherwise. Unlike a paladin’s aura of courage,

this confers no special benefi ts on his companions.

Poison Use (Ex): At 2nd level, a black fl ame zealot gains

the ability to use poison safely, as the assassin ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): When he reaches 3rd, 6th, and 9th

level, a black fl ame zealot deals additional sneak attack

damage, as the rogue ability. Since the black fl ame zealot

gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as

rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.

*Fateful Stride* (Sp): Once per day at 5th level and higher,

a black fl ame zealot can take a single step and pass through

obstacles or distance as the spell *dimension door*. The zealot’s

caster level is equal to half his character level.

Sacred Flame (Su): Beginning at 6th level, at will, a black

fl ame zealot can command a single melee weapon in his possession

to burn with a black, deadly fi re. The weapon gains

the fl aming ability, dealing 1d6 points of fi re damage per

successful attack in addition to its normal weapon damage.

Once per day, as a free action the black fl ame zealot can

instead bestow the fl aming burst property on a weapon in

his possession for 1 minute.

Unholy Immolation (Su): When a black fl ame zealot

reaches 10th level, any creature killed by his death attack

or sneak attack is immediately and utterly consumed by

unholy fi re. The only way to restore life to a being slain in

this manner is to use *true resurrection*, or a carefully worded

*wish* spell followed by *resurrection*, or *miracle*.
