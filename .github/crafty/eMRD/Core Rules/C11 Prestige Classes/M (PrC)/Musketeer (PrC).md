# Musketeer (PrC)
## Overview
*“For the Moon King! For Rolland!”*

The Moon King in Rolland formed the Royal Order of Musketeers

after he witnessed a firearms demonstration and saw firsthand how

effective these weapons could be. Soon after, he commissioned the

production of 500 muskets from Freeport and founded an elite order

of warriors who would serve as the king’s personal guard. While the

fighting force was designed to employ firearms, they were equally

trained in fencing weapons. Word of their exploits with the sword,

to say nothing of their skill with the eponymous firearms, spread

throughout the Continent until they became regarded as some of

the most effective and dangerous warriors in the known world.

Becoming a Musketeer

Although most musketeers are members of the Royal Order of

Musketeers of Rolland, similar groups have begun to form in most

civilized nations on the Continent and beyond. This said, everyone

agrees that the Royal Order is the best of their kind and thus many

would-be musketeers petition for training with these excellent

soldiers. At first, Rolland was reluctant to share its fighting secrets,

but an advisor proposed that any who would learn the techniques

must vow to protect Rolland in times of need and in many cases

enforced this oath with a *mark of justice* spell.

Requirements

• **Base Attack Bonus:** +6

• **Feats:** Acrobatic, Combat Expertise, Firearms Proficiency,

Flamboyant Display

• **Special:** You must train with the Royal Musketeers of Rolland (or a

nation of Rolland.

**Class Skills:** Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Intimidate, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, and Perception.

**Skill Ranks per Levels:** 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The musketeer prestige class offers a potent suite of abilities designed

to augment a character’s proficiency with firearms. The class grants

a number of bonus feats, many of which provide concrete benefits

to using a firearm in combat, while also heightening the musketeer’s

effectiveness with abilities like perfect shot and critical shot. While

the musketeer is clearly designed for users of ballistic weapons, it also

offers plenty of enhancements for fighting in melee combat, increasing

the character’s speed and mobility, while augmenting the character’s

fighting prowess and ability to withstand damage.

Fast Movement (Ex)

Musketeers specialize in a highly mobile fighting style. At 1st level,

he gains a +10 enhancement bonus to his base land speed. At 5th

level, this bonus increases to +20 feet.

Firearms Drill

Also at 1st level, the musketeer gains Firearms Drill as a bonus

feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites for this feat. If he

already has Firearms Drill, select another feat from those listed

under Bonus Feats.

Firearms Expert (Ex)

By 3rd level, the musketeer has become so well-practiced in the use

of firearms, these weapons are more reliable when he handles them.

Whenever he rolls on **Table 4–2: Firearms Misfire**, the musketeer

gains a bonus equal to one-half his class level to determine what

happens.

Bonus Feats (Ex)

At 3rd level, and every other level thereafter (5th, 7th, and 9th), the

musketeer gains a bonus feat in addition to any feats he would normally

receive. He must meet all the prerequisite for the feat and must select the

feat from any of the following: Crack Shot, Dead-eye Shot, Far Shot,

Improved Initiative, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Shot

on the Run, Spring Attack, Swashbuckling, Two-Weapon Fighting,

Weapon Focus, or Weapon Specialization (firearms).

Perfect Shot (Ex)

By 4th level, the musketeer has become such an adept marksman he can

place his shots in the most vulnerable parts of a foe’s anatomy. Whenever

he successfully hits a target with an attack using a firearm, the musketeer

may add his Dexterity bonus to the weapon damage roll. Targets that are

immune to critical hits are immune to this extra damage.

Overcome Injury (Ex)

Starting at 6th level, the musketeer can shrug off wounds that

would kill a lesser man. Each day, he may convert a total amount

of lethal damage to nonlethal damage equal to his class level times

his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The musketeer doesn’t have to

use this ability all at once; he may divide it up between several uses.

Using overcome injury is a standard action that does not provoke an

attack of opportunity.

Undaunted Courage (Ex)

At 8th level, the musketeer’s dedication and bravery become

exceptional. He gains a +2 insight bonus on all Will saves. In addition,

he becomes immune to fear.

Critical Shot (Ex)

Finally, at 10th level, the musketeer’s accuracy with firearms reaches

legendary status. He automatically confirms all critical hits threatened

when using a firearm.

Using the Musketeer

The musketeer class offers a window into the political tensions on

the Continent while also offering a variety of combat techniques

to highlight firearms in the Freeport setting. Nearly all musketeers

are bound to Rolland and thus when used as NPCs, they make for

excellent assassins, spies, and even shock troops. The *mark of justice*

makes these characters implacable opponents since they cannot betray

the Moon King lest they suffer a weighty curse. As compelling as

this *mark* is to keep musketeers loyal, there are several ways around

the spell, as evidenced by the similar organizations that seem to crop

up all over the Continent.

Adapting the Musketeer

This prestige class relies on two components to work effectively.

One, it assumes you employ the World of Freeport as your campaign

setting. Two, it assumes there are firearms in your setting. The first

component is easy to circumvent. Simply change the name of the

organization and nation, binding these characters to a similar or even

wildly different nation and the class is useable as-is.

The second component is a bit trickier. Firearms make the musketeer,

and removing this component requires not only a name change but also

some moderate revisions to the class features. You can replace firearms

with some other ranged weapon and just change the class name to

something more appropriate. Any bonus feats that deal specifically with

firearms should be changed to benefit the ranged weapon you selected.

For example, if you choose crossbows, simply swap Rapid Reload for

Firearms Drill. Likewise, if you choose longbows, then you might use

Manyshot instead. Perfect shot and critical shot function normally.

Finally, for firearms expert, simply grant the character a +3 competence

bonus on Perception checks. Once you’ve applied all of these changes,

the class can function in just about any campaign setting.
