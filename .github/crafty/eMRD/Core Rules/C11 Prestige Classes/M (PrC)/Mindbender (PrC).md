# Mindbender (PrC)
## Overview
Mindbenders seek to control the thoughts and dreams of

others. From an early age, those destined to walk this path

learn little tricks of manipulation to get their way. Later,

they turn to spellcasting to enhance their already impressive

skills at bluffi ng, intimidating, and otherwise dealing with

people to their own advantage. Magic holds the promise of

complete mental domination, and the mindbender realizes

it spectacularly.

Spellcasters who take this prestige class give up a great

deal of their caster level advancement, but they instead

gain ever-greater abilities to alter and eventually command

the will of others. Anyone who is ready to sacrifi ce magic

for manipulation is a suitable candidate for this prestige

class.

Mindbenders do not get on well with one another, as each

attempts to assert his control over the rest. It is not unknown

for one mindbender to secretly control another—such

is considered the perfect front. Possessing the power to

control others’ minds doesn’t ensure immunity to the same

treatment.

Most NPC mindbenders are neutral or evil in alignment.

Using magic to enslave the will of others is rarely a good act,

especially if the mindbender has no intention of

ever compensating his thrall for

its involuntary service or releasing it in the future. NPC

mindbenders therefore tend to be found in positions where

their enchantment abilities allow them to amass great wealth

and infl uence, ruling small towns or isolated keeps as the

power behind the throne, secret masters who brook no rival

in their domains.

Adaptation: The most straightforward adaptation of this

class is to make it psionic, barring it completely from being

taken by arcanists. In this case, eliminate the spellcasting

requirement, and replace it with “Psionics: Able to manifest

psionic powers, including at least one telepathy power of 3rd

level or higher.” Also, the Spells per Day column on the class

table becomes a Powers per Day column.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the mindbender

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Mindbenders gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each odd-numbered

level, a mindbender gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding

the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (such

as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming

a mindbender, he must decide to which class to add each

level for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Telepathy (Su): A mindbender unlocks one of the most

basic elements of his mental craft at 1st level, gaining the

ability to communicate telepathically with any creature

within 100 feet that has a language.

Skill Boost (Ex): A mindbender is a consummate

student of manipulation, be it magical or mundane.

Beginning at 2nd level, he can add 1/2 his class level as a

competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and

Sense Motive checks.

Push the Weak Mind (Sp): At 2nd level and higher, a

mindbender can infl uence the actions of a living creature

of Large or smaller size once per day. This ability functions

like a *suggestion* spell, except that the range is 100 feet and

the duration is 5 hours plus 1 hour per class level. The mindbender

can communicate the suggested course of action

telepathically if he chooses, which allows him to use the

effect regardless of the target’s language. A successful Will

save (DC 13 + primary spellcasting ability modifi er) negates

the effect. (Primary spellcasting ability is Intelligence for

wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and warlocks, Wisdom for

clerics, and so forth.)

A mindbender can use this ability one additional time per

day per three class levels gained (two times per day at 5th and

three times per day at 8th).

Mindread (Sp): At 3rd level and higher, a mindbender

can read the surface thoughts of a living creature within 100

feet. This is a mind-affecting ability that requires a standard

action to use. The mindbender must be able to see the target;

a successful Will save (DC 12 + primary spellcasting ability

modifi er) negates the effect. Creatures of animal intelligence

(Int 1 or 2) have only simple, instinctual thoughts.

Maintaining the effect requires concentration; the

maximum duration is 10 minutes. The ability can penetrate

barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin

sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. This effect is

the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

A mindbender can use this ability two times per day at 3rd

level and four times per day at 7th level.

Eternal Charm (Sp): At 4th level and higher, a mindbender

can *charm* any single Large or smaller living creature

within 100 feet (as *charm monster*) once per day. A successful

Will save (DC 14 + primary spellcasting ability modifi er)

negates the effect. The duration is permanent; however, a

mindbender can have only one creature so *charmed* at any

given time. If he attempts to use this power on a creature

while he has another so *charmed,* the fi rst *charm* is automatically

broken (regardless of the success of the second

attempt). The effect is also broken if a mindbender or one

of his allies injures the target. *Dispel magic* has no effect on

an *eternal charm,* though *break enchantment* frees the victim

(treat the mindbender’s caster level as 5 + his class level for

this purpose).

At 6th level and higher, a mindbender can have up to

two creatures affected by this power at any given time; if

he attempts to *charm* a third, the previous victim under his

infl uence the longest is freed. At 8th level, he can control

up to three creatures with this ability, and at 10th level up

to four creatures.

Enchantment Spell Power (Ex): At 6th level and higher,

a mindbender casts more powerful enchantment spells: He

adds 2 to his caster level when casting any enchantment spell.

This increase improves to 4 at 10th level.

Dominate (Sp): At 7th level, a mindbender becomes able

to *dominate* any single living Large or smaller creature within

100 feet (as *dominate monster*) once per day. A successful Will

save (DC 19 + primary spellcasting ability modifi er) negates

the effect. The duration is 24 hours.

Thrall (Su): At 10th level, a mindbender’s mental mastery

reaches its pinnacle. He can choose to make the duration of

his *dominate* ability (see above) permanent, but only on one

target at a time. If a mindbender chooses to *dominate* another

creature and make that effect permanent, the previous thrall

is freed from the effect.
