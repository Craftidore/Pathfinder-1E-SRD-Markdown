# Maester (PrC)
## Overview
Maesters are the master crafters of the gnome world,

combining technical and magical expertise to create

incredible marvels. They specialize in the creation

of magic items, bending all their skill and ability

toward the construction of items that are their art

and livelihood.

Maesters are usually wizards, although sorcerers

occasionally take up the class. Some bards also have been

known to become maesters, but typically not until they

have spent a number of years adventuring.

NPC maesters rarely stray from their laboratories,

which makes them excellent patrons for groups of

adventurers. Maesters often need rare minerals, unusual

material components for spells, or other substances for

the magic items they create, and it’s usually too dangerous

to fetch such materials alone. Maesters often hire

bodyguards if they’re undertaking a journey, paying

their guards with magic items they have built. Other

times, they simply send allies on a journey of acquisition,

providing them with as much lore about their mission

as possible.

Adaptation: While gnomes are renowned for their

magical craftsmanship, they don’t have a monopoly on

the trade. This class would be appropriate for a secret

organization of item-creating arcanists who are not necessarily

gnomes. If you change the spell requirement to

divine spells, it’s also a good fi t for clerics of deities who

are known for their peerless magical craftings, such as

Moradin.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a maester, a character must fulfi ll

all the following criteria.

Race: Gnome.

Skills: Craft (any) 8 ranks, Use Magic Device 4

ranks.

Feats: Any two item creation feats.

Spells: Arcane caster level 5th.

CLASS SKILLS

The maester’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Disable Device (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(architecture and engineering) (Int), Spellcraft (Int),

and Use Magic Device (Cha).

**Level Bonus Save Save Save Special Spells per Day/Spells Known**

1st +0 +0 +0 +2 Bonus feat, quick crafting —

4th +2 +1 +1 +4 — +1 level of existing spellcasting class

5th +2 +1 +1 +4 Bonus feat +1 level of existing spellcasting class

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the maester

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Maesters gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Bonus Feats: At 1st and 5th level, a maester receives a

bonus item creation feat. He must meet the prerequisites

for this feat.

Quick Crafting (Ex): A maester can craft magic items

in half the normal time required (one day per 2,000 gp

in the item’s base price; minimum

one day).

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level, a maester gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If he had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a maester, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Identification (Sp): A maester of 3rd level or higher

can determine the magical properties of a magic item

by handling it for 1 minute and making a successful

Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the item’s caster level). The

maester can’t take 10 on this check, nor can he retry the

check (and thus he can’t take 20). This ability otherwise

functions as the *identify* spell.
