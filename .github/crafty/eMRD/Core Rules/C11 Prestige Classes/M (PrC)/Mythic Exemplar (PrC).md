# Mythic Exemplar (PrC)
## Overview
*“Nobody today can match the great heroes of the epic past. But by*

*following closely in their footsteps, perhaps we can come close.”*

—Mikolai Laziros, mythic exemplar

Few are as devoted to history as the Disciples of Legend, and

none among that august group are as committed to their

paragons as the mythic exemplars. True followers—even

worshipers—of the Six from Shadow (see page 65), the mythic

exemplars model their skills, their attitudes, and even their

lives after those fabled heroes.

BECOMING A MYTHIC EXEMPLAR

Because the mythic exemplar prestige class offers a number

of “paths,” each modeled on one of the Six from Shadow, it is

open to a wide variety of entrants. It is best suited to clerics,

fi ghters, marshals, rangers, rogues, and wizards.

**Entry Requirements**

**Skills:** Knowledge (history) 3 ranks, plus any one of

the following: Diplomacy 7 ranks, Intimidate 7 ranks,

Knowledge (arcana) 7 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 7 ranks,

or Move Silently 7 ranks.

**Special:** Any one of the following: base attack bonus +5,

able to cast 3rd-level spells, sneak attack +2d6, or ability to

grant allies a bonus on attack rolls, saves, or checks as an

extraordinary ability.

**Special:** Must be a member of the Disciples of Legend.

**Hit Die: d8**

**Class Skills (4 + Int modifier per level):** Craft, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion),

Listen, Profession, Ride, and Spot.

*Special:* You can also add four class skills from one prior class to your mythic exemplar skill list.

CLASS FEATURES

The class features of the mythic exemplar vary greatly based

on which of the Six from Shadow you choose to follow. You

exchange the more general abilities of your previous class

for specifi c, mystical replacements. Thus, while you might

lack some of the abilities of a character of your former class

at the same level, your dedication to your heroic patron

allows you to surpass the abilities of such a character under

the proper conditions.

Spellcasting: At 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th level, you gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level

in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before

adding the prestige class level. You do not,

however, gain any other benefi t a character of

that class would have gained. If you had more

than one spellcasting class before becoming a

mythic exemplar, you must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of

determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

If your paragon is Imdastri or Ktolemagne,

you gain additional levels of spellcasting

ability through the archetype advancement

class features (see below).

Paragon’s Path: Upon becoming a

mythic exemplar, you must choose

one of the legendary Six from Shadow

upon whom to model your

skills and abilities. Your choices

are the clever Dardallion,

the faithful Imdastri, the

all-knowing Ktolemagne,

the inexorable Orsos, the

noble and inspirational Sir

Reikhardt, and the mighty Sunyartra.

Once made, your choice

cannot be changed.

Save Bonus (Ex): At 1st level, you

gain a +1 bonus on a saving throw

determined by your paragon, as

given on the following table. This

bonus increases by 1 at every oddnumbered

level up to 7th.

**Patron Saving Throw**

Dardallion Reflex

Imdastri Will

Ktolemagne Will

Orsos Fortitude

Reikhardt Will

Sunyartra Fortitude

Paragon’s Gift, Least (Su): At 2nd level, you gain

the fi rst of several supernatural abilities that allow you

to channel the spirit and skills of your paragon. Unless

otherwise noted, each paragon’s gift (least, lesser,

greater, and supreme) requires a swift action to

invoke, lasts for a number of rounds equal

to your mythic exemplar level, is usable

once per day, and has a caster level equal

to your mythic exemplar level.

*Dardallion:* You gain a +5 insight bonus

on Disable Device, Hide, Move Silently,

and Open Lock checks.

*Imdastri:* As an immediate action,

you can reroll one attack roll, save, or

check per day, as if using the granted

power of the Luck domain (*PH* 187).

This effect occurs instantaneously.

*Ktolemagne*: You gain a +5 sacred

bonus on Concentration, Decipher

Script, Knowledge (arcana), and Spellcraft

checks.

*Orsos*: You gain a +20-foot insight

bonus to your base speed.

*Reikhardt:* You can use inspire

courage as a bard of your

mythic exemplar level. If

you already have this ability,

your mythic exemplar

levels stack with levels of the

class that provided it for the purpose

of determining its effects.

*Sunyartra*: The critical threat range

of one weapon you wield increases by

1. This increase stacks with those from

other sources, such as the keen weapon

property or the Improved Critical feat.

Archetype Advancement (Ex): At

3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain a class

feature that builds on those of your paragon.

If your archetype advancement grants bonus feats, you must meet all the normal prerequisites for your

selections, unless otherwise noted.

*Dardallion:* You gain sneak attack. See the rogue class feature

(*PH* 50). You gain another 1d6 points of sneak attack damage

each time you select this feature.

*Imdastri:* You gain +1 level of an existing divine spellcasting

class.

*Ktolemagne:* You gain +1 level of an existing arcane spellcasting

class.

*Orsos:* You gain bonuses against the favored enemies of

Orsos. At each of these levels, you gain a +2 favored enemy

bonus against either aberrations or chaotic outsiders (your

choice). You need not choose the same enemy each time. This

bonus stacks with any favored enemy bonuses you might

already possess.

*Reikhardt:* You gain +1 level of a class-based extraordinary

ability to grant bonuses to allies (such as a marshal’s auras).

*Sunyartra:* You gain a +1 bonus on all opposed Strength

checks (such as those made on bull rushes or trip attacks),

as well as all Strength-based skill checks.

Paragon’s Gift, Lesser (Su): At 4th level, you gain a new

supernatural ability that you can use once per day, according

to your paragon as given on the following table. This ability

follows all the guidelines for least paragon’s gift (above),

unless otherwise noted. If you choose, you can forgo your

daily use of this ability for an extra use of the least gift.

**Paragon Ability**

Dardallion +4 insight bonus to Dexterity

Imdastri +4 insight bonus to Wisdom

Ktolemagne +4 insight bonus to Intelligence

Orsos +4 insight bonus to Constitution

Reikhardt +4 insight bonus to Charisma

Sunyartra +4 insight bonus to Strength

Paragon’s Gift, Greater (Su): At 6th level, you gain a

new supernatural ability that you can use once per day.

This ability follows all the guidelines for least paragon’s

gift (above), unless otherwise noted. If you choose, you can

forgo your daily use of this ability for an extra use of your

least or lesser gift.

*Dardallion:* You can use *blink,* as the spell.

*Imdastri:* As an immediate action, you can invoke temporary

immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities. This immunity

does not extend to effects whose caster level exceeds

your character level by 4 or more.

*Ktolemagne:* You can use *identify,* as the spell, except that

the casting time is 1 minute, and you need no material

component.

*Orsos:* You gain a +4 bonus to your natural armor bonus.

*Reikhardt:* You can use inspire greatness as a bard of your

mythic exemplar level. If you already have this ability, your

mythic exemplar levels stack with levels of the class that

provided it for the purpose of determining its effects.

*Sunyartra:* You can use *haste,* as the spell, on yourself only.

Paragon’s Gift, Supreme (Su): At 8th level, you gain a new

supernatural ability that you can use once per day. This ability

follows all the guidelines for least paragon’s gift (above),

unless otherwise noted. If you choose, you can forgo your

daily use of this ability for an extra use of your least, lesser,

or greater gift.

*Dardallion:* You can use *greater invisibility,* as the spell, on

yourself only.

*Imdastri:* As an immediate action, you can invoke temporary

immunity to necromantic and death effects. This immunity

does not extend to effects whose caster level exceeds your

character level by 4 or more.

*Ktolemagne:* You gain temporary spell resistance equal to

10 + your arcane caster level.

*Orsos:* You can use *air walk,* as the spell, on yourself only.

*Reikhardt:* You can use *dominate person,* as the spell.

*Sunyartra:* You can use *divine power,* as the spell.

Ability Boost (Ex): At 10th level, one of your ability scores

permanently increases by 2, according to your paragon as

given on the following table.

**Paragon Ability Score**

Dardallion Dexterity

Imdastri Wisdom

Ktolemagne Intelligence

Orsos Constitution

Reikhardt Charisma

Sunyartra Strength

Embody Paragon (Su): When you reach 10th level, you

truly embody every physical and spiritual concept that

your paragon stood for. Unless otherwise noted, the ability

you gain is permanent and constant, as long as you remain

conscious. If it is suppressed, you can raise the effect again

as a swift action.

*Dardallion:* You can turn incorporeal (*DMG* 294) for up to

1 minute per day. This duration need not be used all at once

and can be divided into intervals as short as 1 round. Shifting

to or from incorporeality requires a move action.

*Imdastri:* You can “lose” a prepared divine spell in exchange

for a spell of lower level from the Luck, Protection, or Strength

domains, much as a good cleric can spontaneously cast *cure*

spells. You do not gain the domain power or the ability to

prepare these spells as domain spells.

*Ktolemagne:* You can “lose” a prepared arcane spell in

exchange for any divination spell of lower level that is already

in your spellbook.

*Orsos:* You gain a +4 bonus on any saves or rolls made to

resist fatigue and exhaustion. In addition, you are under a

permanent *freedom of movement* effect, unless the spell level

of the impeding effect exceeds your character level.

*Reikhardt:* Select either Fortitude or Will saves. From this

point on, you (and all allies within 60 feet) gain a circumstance

bonus equal to your Charisma modifi er on this saving

throw. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

In addition, for 10 rounds per day, you can grant yourself

and each ally within 60 feet damage reduction 2/—. This

benefi t does not stack with any other damage reduction you

or your allies possess. This ability requires a swift action

to activate.

*Sunyartra:* You can ignore 15 points of damage reduction

(except epic) when attacking foes, and 15 points of hardness

when striking inanimate objects.

PLAYING A MYTHIC EXEMPLAR

You are utterly devoted to following the example set by

your paragon. You travel the world adventuring with your comrades, just like the Six from Shadow did, always honing

your abilities in the hopes that one day you might be half

as skilled as they. Emulating your paragon is not your only

concern—like other adventurers, you have goals to reach,

loved ones to protect, and new lands to explore. But you do

it all in homage to your paragon, and you do it just the way

you believe that hero would have.

You are among the most respected of the Disciples of

Legend, and you see your fellows in the organization as

seekers of the truth who simply haven’t yet matched your

dedication. You might think of the group as your “alma mater”

and spend little time with it.

Combat

Your tactics on the battlefi eld depend largely on your paragon

and prior classes. Consider not only your paragon’s abilities,

but also his or her attitudes. Dardallion was infamous for

constant movement, tumbling past opponents, f lanking

for a few moments, and then shifting to a new foe. Imdastri

did not merely stand back to heal her allies; she stood at the

forefront, casting spells to impede the enemy’s ability to

fi ght. Ktolemagne hurled *fi reballs* with the best of them, but

he preferred to gather intelligence, using his divinations to

pinpoint enemies’ weaknesses and anticipate their tactics,

then chose spells to take advantage of what he had learned.

Orsos seemed unstoppable, wading through ranks of minor

foes and taking what wounds were necessary to reach his

intended target. Reikhardt used his powers to augment his

allies, but he always commanded from the front, wielding

sword and lance. And the mighty Sunyartra allowed her

greataxe and brutish fi gure to lull the enemy into thinking

her dull and foolish, only to cut them down with a combination

of mighty strikes and brilliantly precise tactics.

Remember all this information when designing your own

fi ghting style because it isn’t suffi cient that you merely share

the abilities of your paragon; you should strive to match him

or her in every way.

Advancement

Once you joined the Disciples of Legend, your leaders

swiftly recognized your devotion to one of the Six from

Shadow. So when they offered you the opportunity to emulate

your chosen paragon in new and specific ways, you leapt

at the chance.

You have only just begun your quest to become worthy

of your paragon, and a lifetime of striving still lies ahead of

you. You have no illusions that you will ever be the equal of

your paragon; you hope only to lead a life that echoes that of

your hero, and to have others say that you did honor to your

paragon’s name.

The choices you make after becoming a mythic exemplar

depend, again, on your abilities and your paragon. Select feats

based on a combination of what you feel can most improve

your own abilities, and what brings you closer to your paragon.

If you are a true exemplar, these choices may often be

one and the same.

Resources

While you are indeed the epitome of the Disciples of Legend,

you can count on little more than moral support from them.

The organization is not a rich one, and its limited resources

are devoted to unearthing more of the history of the Six

from Shadow and other mythic heroes. Indeed, it is far more

likely that you might be asked to adventure in support of the

organization than that it can afford to support your endeavors,

except as noted above.
