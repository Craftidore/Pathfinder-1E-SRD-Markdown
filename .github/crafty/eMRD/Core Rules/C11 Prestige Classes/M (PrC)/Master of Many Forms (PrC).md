# Master of Many Forms (PrC)
## Overview
A master of many forms has no shape that she calls her

own. Instead, she occupies whatever body is most expedient

for her at the time. While others base their identities

largely on their external forms, a master of many forms

actually comes closer to her true self through her transformations.

Of necessity, her sense of self is based not

on her outward form, but on her soul, which is truly the

only constant about her. It is the inner strength of that

soul that enables her to take on any shape and remain

herself within.

The path of the master of many forms is ideal for a spellcaster

of any race who has experienced shapechanging

and yearns for more of it. Such a character can be a great

force for either good or ill in the world. An evil master of

many forms in particular poses a terrible threat, for she

can appear anywhere, in any body. The same opponents

may face her again and again, in one shape after another,

never realizing that they are actually facing a single

enemy.

NPC masters of many forms are typically loners, moving between communities of various creatures as suits their whims. They sometimes find work as spies or explorers.

The class description presented here is an updated version of the shifter prestige class that originally appeared in *Masters of the Wild.*

Adaptation: Masters of many forms can be introduced

into a campaign in many ways. They might form an elite

group of spies and scouts, they might be high-ranking

members of a doppelganger-worshiping cult, or they

might be a small group of druids who see beauty and

power in all of nature’s forms, not just animals and

elementals.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the

master of many forms prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Masters

of many forms gain no proficiency with any

weapon or armor.

Shifter’s Speech (Ex): A master

of many forms maintains her ability

to speak normally (including verbal

components of spells) regardless of

the form she takes. Furthermore, she

can communicate with other creatures of the same kind

while in wild shape, as long as such creatures are normally

capable of communicating with each other using natural

methods.

Improved Wild Shape (Su): A master of many forms

knows how to use her wild shape ability to assume a

wider range of forms. At 1st level, she can assume a

humanoid form with wild shape. She later

gains the ability to assume the form of a giant

(at 2nd level), a monstrous humanoid (at 3rd

level), a fey (at 4th level), a vermin (at 5th level),

an aberration (at 6th level), a plant (at 7th level),

an ooze (at 8th level), an elemental (at 9th level),

and a dragon (at 10th level).

The size limit of the shapes she can assume also

increases as she gains levels. At 2nd level, she can

assume the form of a Large creature; at 4th level, a

Tiny creature; at 6th level, a Huge creature; at 8th

level, a Diminutive creature; and at 10th level, a

Gargantuan creature.

A master of many forms also gains one

additional daily use of her wild shape ability

per class level gained.

Fast Wild Shape (Ex): Starting at 3rd

level, a master of many forms can use her wild

shape ability as a move action, rather than as

a standard action.

Extraordinary Wild Shape (Ex): Starting

at 7th level, a master of many forms gains the

extraordinary special qualities of any form she

assumes with wild shape.

Evershifting Form: A 10th-level master

of many forms has reached the pinnacle of

her shapechanging abilities. She

gains the shapechanger subtype

and becomes immune to any

transmutation effect unless she

is willing to accept it.

In addition, she no longer takes ability penalties for

aging and is not subject to magical aging, though any

aging penalties she already may have taken remain in

place. Bonuses still accrue, and a master of many forms

still dies of old age when her time is up.
