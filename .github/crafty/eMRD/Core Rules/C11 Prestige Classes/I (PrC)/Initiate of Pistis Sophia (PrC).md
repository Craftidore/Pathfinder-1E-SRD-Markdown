# Initiate of Pistis Sophia (PrC)
## Overview
Pistis Sophia is the monk of the Celestial Hebdomad, a contemplative,

mystic, and ascetic patron for those who follow similar

spiritual paths. The path of her initiates requires great sacrifices

(in the form of at least three sacred vows), but

brings great rewards of spiritual power.

All initiates of Pistis Sophia

have at least several monk

levels before joining the order

of initiates. Most often, they

are single-classed monks. Occasionally,

characters of other

classes undergo a sort of conversion,

forswearing their reliance on weapons

and armor, multiclassing as

monks, and later adopting the initiate

prestige class. Of the tiny

number of characters who take this

course, most were paladins before

taking on their monastic vows.

Initiates of Pistis Sophia are members of

spiritual communities sharing a common life.

They are not restricted to their monasteries by

any means, and many do adventure to put

their spiritual devotions into concrete

practice. However, when

not actively fighting the forces

of evil, they are more often

found in their monasteries than

in cities or towns.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the Initiate of

Pistis Sophia prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Initiates of

Pistis Sophia gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor. They

suffer the same penalties for

wearing armor that

monks do.

Fist of the Heavens:

A 1st-level initiate

of Pistis Sophia

gains the Fist of the Heavens

feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not have

the prerequisite Wisdom score.

Monk Abilities: An initiate of Pistis Sophia

adds her initiate levels to her monk levels to

determine her AC bonus, her unarmed

strike damage, the penalty she takes

when using a flurry of blows, her

speed, and her ki strike. She does

not gain any other benefits of

advancing monk levels, however.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, an initiate

of Pistis Sophia of 2nd level or

higher can use detect evil, as the spell.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, an initiate of Pistis

Sophia may attempt to smite evil with one normal

unarmed strike. She adds a +4 bonus to her attack

roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class

level. If she accidentally smites a creature that

is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still

used up for that day.

At 5th level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia can use this ability

twice per day, and at 8th level she can use it three times per day.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia

can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to

do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flatfooted.

Electricity Resistance (Ex): As she advances in her celestial

disciplines, an initiate of Pistis Sophia grows to share the natural

immunity to electricity possessed by the archons. She gains

electricity resistance 5 at 4th level, and electricity resistance 10

at 7th level.

Sacred Vow: At 4th level, and again at 7th level and 10th

level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia gains a bonus feat selected from

the following list:

Vow of Abstinence, Vow of Chastity, Vow of Nonviolence,

Vow of Obedience, Vow of Poverty, or Vow of Purity.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level, an initiate of

Pistis Sophia cannot be flanked except by a rogue at least 4 levels

higher than her character level.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, an initiate of Pistis

Sophia takes no damage on a successful saving throw against

attacks that allow a Reflex save for half damage, and she only

takes half damage on a failed save.

Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that

normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a 9th

level initiate of Pistis Sophia takes no damage if she makes a

successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw

fails.

Celestial Transformation (Ex): When she reaches 10th

level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia transcends her mortal origins

and becomes a creature of the heavens. Her type changes to outsider

(native), and she gains damage reduction 10/unholy.
