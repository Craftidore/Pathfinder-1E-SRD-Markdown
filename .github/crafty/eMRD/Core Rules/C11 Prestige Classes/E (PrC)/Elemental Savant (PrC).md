# Elemental Savant (PrC)
## Overview
Elemental savants study the basic building blocks of existence—

air, earth, fi re, and water—learning to harness their

powers. Eventually they transcend their mortal forms and

become elemental beings.

Elemental savants often begin their careers as individuals

intrigued by one or all of the classic elements. Before they ever

take levels in the prestige class, these spellcasters typically

fi nd themselves drawn to spells of a particular energy type.

These spellcasters fi nd satisfaction in the unleashed purity

of the elemental energy forms, and they become elemental

savants to grow closer to the element that becomes their

favorite.

Most elemental savants start out as warmages, wizards, or

sorcerers, although divine spellcasters are not unknown in

the class. A cleric with the Fire, Water, or Sun domain could

also qualify for this prestige class.

NPC elemental savants usually prefer to pursue their

studies in solitude or in the company of other elemental

savants. Sometimes groups of them gather in places where an

element’s majesty and power is on display, such as the fl anks

of a volcano, an island, or a high, windy mountain.

Adaptation: Making a particular element the basis for the

theme of a spellcaster’s repertoire is an idea that could exist

in most any game. For a twist, you might want to consider

elements that go beyond the standard, though this would

require some work on the DM’s part. Other elements might

include: bone, metal, nether, plasma, and wood, to name a

few. Determining the sort of damage each of these elements

does, and how that type of damage interacts with the four

recognized types of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity,

and fi re) is the crux of this design process.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become an elemental savant, a character must

fulfi ll all the following criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Knowledge (the

planes) 4 ranks.

Feat: Energy Substitution (acid, cold, electricity, or fi re).

Spells: Able to cast at least three spells that have one of

the following descriptors in common: acid, cold, electricity,

or fi re. One of the spells must be at least 3rd level.

Special: Must have made peaceful contact with an elemental

or outsider that has an elemental subtype (air, earth, fi re,

or water).

Class Skills

The elemental savant’s class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge

(arcana) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis),

and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the elemental savant

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Elemental savants gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level except 5th

and 10th, an elemental savant gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level

in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding

the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and

so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming an elemental savant, she must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day and spells known.

Elemental Specialty (Ex): The fi rst step toward transcending

mortal form requires an elemental savant to

choose her elemental specialty. Upon entering

the class, she must select an element and

its associated energy type (air = electricity,

earth = acid, fi re = fi re, or water =

cold). This choice must match the

Energy Substitution

feat

that the savant

selected to gain entry

to the prestige class. When

the savant casts a spell that normally

deals energy damage, its

energy descriptor changes to the

savant’s chosen energy type, and

it deals damage of that energy type

instead of its normal energy type.

For example, an elemental savant

choosing to specialize in fi re could still

cast *meld into stone,* and its descriptor would

not change because it does not deal energy

damage. However, if she casts *Melf’s acid arrow,*

the spell would deal fi re damage and have the

fi re descriptor instead of dealing acid damage and

having the acid descriptor.

Resistance to Energy (Ex): As an elemental savant gains

levels in this prestige class, she becomes more resistant to

the type of energy allied with her chosen element. At 1st

level, she gains resistance 5 against this energy type. This

resistance rises to 10 at 4th level and 20 at 7th level.

Immunity to Sleep (Ex): At 2nd level, as an elemental

savant continues to transcend her mortal form, she gains

immunity to sleep effects.

Energy Penetration (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, an

elemental savant further refi nes her ability to wield energy

associated with her chosen element. When she casts a spell

using that type of energy, she gains a +2

competence bonus on caster level

checks (1d20 + caster level) to

overcome a creature’s spell resistance.

At 8th level, this bonus

increases to +4. These bonuses

stack with those granted by the

Spell Penetration and Greater

Spell Penetration feats.

Energy Focus (Ex): From

5th level on, an elemental

savant is better able to

manipulate energy associated

with her chosen

element. The save DC

for any spell with

that energy descriptor

increases by 1.

At 10th level, these

save DCs increase by

1 again (total increase

of 2). These increases

are cumulative with

those granted by the

Spell Focus and Greater

Spell Focus feats.

Darkvision (Ex): At 6th level,

an elemental savant gains darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Immunity to Paralysis and

Poison (Ex): As an elemental savant approaches elemental perfection, she gains immunity to

paralysis and poison at 9th level.

Elemental Perfection: At 10th level, an elemental savant,

through long association with elemental entities and extensive

study of their secrets, completely transcends her mortal

form to become an elemental creature. Her type changes to elemental.

She no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe (though

she must still rest to regain spells). She gains an elemental

creature’s immunity to stunning, and she is no longer subject

to extra damage from critical hits or fl anking. An elemental

savant gains the speed and movement modes, natural attacks,

special attacks, and special qualities of a Medium elemental

of the type appropriate to her elemental specialty, as noted

in the *Monster Manual,* except that the save DC against her

elemental attack form, if any (whirlwind, burn, or vortex) is

20 + her Con modifi er.

Upon achieving this state, an elemental savant’s appearance

undergoes a minor physical change, usually to the skin or

eyes. An earth elemental savant, for example, might acquire

gemlike eyes and hard, pebbly skin. Anyone who shares the

elemental savant’s predilection for study of her chosen plane

immediately recognizes her transcendent nature. She gains

a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-based skill and

ability checks when interacting with creatures that share her

elemental subtype (air, earth, fi re, or water) and with other

elemental savants who have chosen her element.

Unlike a normal elemental, an elemental savant retains a

soul separate from her body. She can be raised from the dead

as normal for a creature of her previous type.

Energy Immunity (Ex): From 10th level on, an elemental

savant gains immunity to the type of energy associated with

her chosen element.
