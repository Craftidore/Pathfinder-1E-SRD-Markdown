# Soul Eater (PrC)
## Overview
Bane of all living creatures, the soul eater is a monstrous

being that feeds on the very essence of life force. Twisted

and evil—even by the standards of

creatures such as beholders, lamias,

and mind flayers—the soul

eater is feared by all creatures that

live. Soul eaters are often confused

with vampires or other undead,

but they are decidedly alive,

making their actions all the more

heinous.

Evil creatures such as the aforementioned

beholders, lamias,

and mind flayers become soul

eaters, as do destrachans, yuan-ti,

trolls, harpies, and medusas.

The occasional giant or dragon

finds the path of the soul eater

too tempting to resist. It is even

possible for good-aligned creatures

such as lammasus and unicorns

to turn evil and become

soul eaters.

Soul eaters always work alone,

although they may have enthralled

or enslaved servants.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a soul eater, a

character must fulfill all the following

criteria.

Type: Any living nonhumanoid

(monstrous humanoid

is acceptable).

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Weapon Focus (claw or other natural

weapon).

Special: Soul eaters are usually created against their will.

Sometimes, the emissary of an evil god or a powerful fiend

approaches a monster on the verge of death. In exchange for

continued life, the creature must feed on souls thereafter.

More rarely, a creature desiring the ability to feed on souls undergoes a forbidden, profane ritual that allows it to

become a soul eater.

CLASS SKILLS

The soul eater’s class skills (and the

key ability for each skill) are Climb

(Str), Concentration (Con), Hide

(Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str),

Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (any) (Wis), Search (Int),

Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim

(Str), and Use Rope (Dex). See Chapter

4 of the Player’s Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the soul eater prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Soul eaters are proficient with no

weapons, armor, or shields.

Energy Drain (Su): A soul eater

gains the ability to drain energy, bestowing

negative levels upon its victims.

Beginning at 1st level, the

touch of a soul eater bestows one

negative level on its target. At 7th

level, the soul eater bestows

two negative levels

with a touch.

S o u l

Strength (Su):

When a 2nd-level soul eater uses its energy drain ability, it

gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 24 hours.

Soul Blast (Su): When a 3rd-level soul eater uses its energy

drain ability, it may project a 100-foot ray of force that deals 1d6

points of damage per soul eater level against one target. The

target is allowed a Reflex saving throw to avoid the damage (DC

10 + soul eater’s class level + soul eater’s Cha bonus). This supernatural

ability can be used once per day, and only on a day when

the soul eater has drained levels.

Soul Enhancement (Su): When a 4th-level soul eater

uses its energy drain ability, it gains a +2 enhancement

bonus on all saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks

for 24 hours. This bonus stacks with any enhancement

bonuses gained to ability scores that apply to saves or

checks.

Soul Endurance (Su): When a 5th-level soul eater uses

its energy drain ability, it gains a +4 enhancement bonus to

Constitution for 24 hours.

Soul Radiance (Su): If a 6th-level soul eater completely

drains a creature of energy, it may adopt the creature’s soul

radiance, taking the victim’s form, appearance, and abilities

(as the shapechange spell) for 24 hours.

Soul Agility (Su): When an 8th-level soul eater uses its

energy drain ability, it gains a +4 enhancement bonus to

Dexterity for 24 hours.

Soul Slave (Su): If a 9th-level soul eater completely

drains a creature of energy, the victim becomes a wight

under the command of the soul eater.

Soul Power (Su): After a 10th-level soul eater has drained

energy, all spell-like and supernatural abilities gain a +2 profane

bonus to their saving throw DC for 24 hours. Further,

any and all spell-like or supernatural abilities the soul eater

possesses may be used twice as often as normal during that

24-hour period. For example, if an aboleth soul eater drains

energy, it may use its enslave power six times per day rather

than three times per day.
