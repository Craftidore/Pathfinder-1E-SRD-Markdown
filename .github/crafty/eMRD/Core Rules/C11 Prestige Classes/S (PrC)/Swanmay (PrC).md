# Swanmay (PrC)
## Overview
Swanmays are members

of a secretive order

sworn to protect wilderness

areas from evil. Their

most distinctive feature is

their ability to adopt the

form of a swan, which

they use primarily for

mobility. The order

accepts only women

who are

committed to the

cause of good and

who already possess

a strong

affinity for the

natural world.

Only druids

and rangers

can become

swanmays. It

is very rare for

even multiclass

characters to join

the swanmay order.

Swanmays often live

in communal lodges near

bodies of water secluded in deep

forests. On the rare occasions when they travel beyond their woods to adventure, it is to oppose an

evil force that threatens the larger wilderness. They are very

secretive, and avoid revealing their true nature even to adventuring

companions.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the swanmay prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Swanmays gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Shifting (Su): The hallmark of the swanmay is the ability to

assume the form of a swan. She can assume this form and return

to her normal form once per day at 1st level. This is identical to

the druid’s wild shape ability, except that the swanmay can only

assume the form of a swan. The swanmay can use this ability

more times per day at 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th level, as noted on

Table 5–19.

Swan: CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8; hp 4; Init +2; Spd 10 ft.,

fly 60 ft. (average); AC 14 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +1 natural), touch 13,

flat-footed 12; Atk +1 melee (1d3–1, 2 slams) and –4 melee

(1d2–1, bite); SQ damage reduction 5/cold iron; AL N; SV Fort

+2, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 8, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.

Skills and Feats: Listen +7, Spot +3; Alertness.

Damage Reduction (Ex): While in swan form, a swanmay gains

damage reduction 5/cold iron.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A swanmay has spell resistance equal

to 12 + her swanmay level.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A swanmay adds her class level to her

druid or ranger level when making a wild empathy check. In

addition, at 4th level she gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy

checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 10th

level.

Spells per Day: Starting at 2nd level, and at each swanmay

level thereafter, the character gains new spells per day as if she

had also gained a level in either druid or ranger, whichever class

she belonged to before adding the prestige class level. She does

not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class

would have gained. If the character was both a druid and a

ranger before becoming a swanmay, she must decide to which

class she adds each swanmay level for the purpose of determining

spells per day.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 2nd level, a swanmay gains a

favored enemy. This works just like the ranger’s favored enemy

ability, and if the swanmay has one or more favored enemies

already, the bonus against one of her favored enemies increases

as if she had just gained another favored enemy from her

ranger class. The swanmay does not choose this favored enemy

herself; rather, each order of swanmays has its own favored

enemy, typically related to a group that frequently threatens

their home region.

Low-Light Vision (Su): At 3rd level, a swanmay gains lowlight

vision.

Charm Person (Sp): At 4th level, a swanmay can use charm

person, as the spell, three times per day. Her caster level is equal

to her swanmay level, and the saving throw DC is equal to 13 +

her Charisma modifier.

Speak With Animals (Sp): At 5th level, a swanmay can use speak

with animals, as the spell, at will. Her caster level is equal to her

swanmay level.

Speak With Plants (Sp): At 6th level, a swanmay can use speak

with plants, as the spell, at will. Her caster level is equal to her

swanmay level.

Charm Monster (Sp): At 7th level, a swanmay can use charm

monster, as the spell, two times per day. Her caster level is equal

to her swanmay level, and the saving throw DC is equal to 15 +

her Charisma modifier.

Fey Transformation (Ex): At 10th level, a swanmay’s type

changes to fey. Additionally, she gains damage reduction

10/cold iron, regardless of whether she is in humanoid form or

swan form.
