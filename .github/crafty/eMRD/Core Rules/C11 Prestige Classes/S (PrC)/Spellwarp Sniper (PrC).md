# Spellwarp Sniper (PrC)
## Overview
*“Oppose me, and I shall show you whole new universes of*

*pain.”*

—Tessa Senchan, master spellwarp sniper

The spellwarp sniper contorts spells, changing area effects

into rays that deliver precise, devastating attacks.

Becomi ng a Sp ellwarp Snip er

Every spellwarp sniper has at least one level of rogue, ninja,

spellthief, or some other class that grants the sneak attack

or sudden strike class feature, which is a prerequisite for

the prestige class. At her heart, however, a spellwarp sniper

is a spellcaster of respectable skill, usually of arcane origin.

Occasionally a divine caster (such as a cleric dedicated to a

deity of destruction) enters this class.

**Entry Requirements**

**Skills:** Concentration 8 ranks, Spellcraft 8 ranks.

**Feat:** Point Blank Shot.

**Spellcasting:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Special:** Sneak attack or sudden strike +1d6.

Class Features

A spellwarp sniper can alter the way certain spells work,

turning them into precision weapons that target vital

locations.

Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per

day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige

class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a

character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than one spellcasting class before becoming a spellwarp

sniper, you must decide to which class to add each level for

the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and

spells known.

Spellwarp (Ex): You can alter the form of certain area

spells into rays as you cast them. As a free action, you can

warp a 1st-level area spell with instantaneous duration and

a range greater than touch. The spell’s level, components,

range, and damage (if any) remain unchanged. However, the

spell’s area entry is replaced by an effect entry of “ray.”

The spell acts in all ways as a ray, and is considered a ray

for the purpose of effects that modify or depend on rays

(such as the other abilities of this prestige class). You must

succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent with

the spell. Even if the original spell allowed a Reflex save to

reduce or negate its effect, the ray does not. However, if the

original spell allowed a Fortitude or Will save to reduce or

negate the spell’s effect, the save still applies.

You must decide to warp the spell as you cast it. You

do not need to prepare it as a warped spell. You can apply

metamagic feats as normal to the spell, as long as they can

affect ray spells.

Each time you advance a level in this class, the maximum

level of spell that you can affect increases by one. For

example, a 3rd-level spellwarp sniper can warp spells of

up to 3rd level.

Sudden Raystrike (Ex): If you can catch an opponent

when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your

ray attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

Whenever the target of one of your ray spells is denied a

Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a

Dexterity bonus of not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of

damage with your ray spell. (If your ray spell doesn’t deal

hit point damage, this extra damage doesn’t apply.) At 4th

level, the extra damage increases to 2d6. If you get a sneak

attack or sudden strike bonus from another source (such

as rogue or ninja levels), the bonuses on damage stack

whenever both abilities would apply to the same target.

This damage applies only to targets within 30 feet.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to your sudden raystrikes.

Precise Shot: At 3rd level, you gain Precise Shot as a

bonus feat. If you already have Precise Shot, you can select

any other feat that has Point Blank Shot as a prerequisite,

as long as you meet the prerequisite for the chosen feat.

Ray Mastery (Ex): At 5th level, you attain unequaled

control over your ray spells. This control manifests in three

ways.

• You can apply the extra damage from the sudden raystrike

ability (as well as any additional sneak attack or sudden

strike damage from other sources) to ray attacks against a

target within 60 feet, instead of 30 feet.

• You can deliver a coup de grace with a ray spell that deals

hit point damage. You must be adjacent to your target to

deliver the coup de grace.

• Once per day, you can empower a single ray spell,

as though with the Empower Spell feat, without

any adjustment to the spell’s level

or casting time. This effect applies

equally to spells that are

already rays and those

you warp into

rays.

Playi ng a Sp ellwarp Snip er

You value precision and control. Not comfortable with

the flashy and clumsy style of most destructive spells, you

have learned to focus them into tight, manageable beams.

This desire for exacting detail colors every aspect of your

life, from your dealings with others to your personal work

ethic. You do not speak in generalizations, preferring specific

facts. Until experience teaches you better, you take

information, people, and events at face value.

Combat

You excel at fighting isolated creatures, focusing your

attention and your precise spellcasting on one target at

a time. When faced with a group of foes, though, you

are less effective. Although you can cast area spells, they

lack your specialized destructive power when not in

ray form. For this reason you should focus on a single

foe in an opposing group, preferably one that seems not

particularly agile.

Advancement

You likely learned your trade from a mentor, also a spellwarp

sniper, whose attention was drawn by your discipline

and focus. You were encouraged by your mentor to join

an organization that befits your morals and beliefs. Some

guilds and other magical organizations

recruit precise, dedicated individuals

who show promise, whether

they run in street gangs or walk

the grandest halls of wizardry.

The best candidate is someone

already devoted to the study of

magic who can then learn the

ways of trickery and stealth;

such individuals are easier to

find than pocket-picking street

urchins with the potential to

wield magic.

Once you become a

spellwarp sniper, you must

maintain your discipline and

focus. Concentration and Spellcraft

remain vital skills for you,

and Hide, Move Silently, and Spot become increasingly

important. Your feat selection should continue to support

your use of ray spells: Good choices include Improved

Precise Shot, and Split Ray and Ranged Spell Specialization

(both from *Complete Arcane*). Weapon Focus (ray) is an

acceptable choice, though since rays require only ranged

touch attacks to hit, the additional accuracy might not be

necessary. Reach Spell (*Complete Divine*) might also be a

good choice, depending on your available array of touch

spells.

Resources

Most spellwarp snipers belong to some kind of organization.

If you do not already, you are likely to endure

continual recruitment offers. When you are attached to

an organization, you can expect to find support both from

the leaders of the group and from those with whom you

actively serve. Such support includes training and any

needed supplies for your studies. Snipers are invaluable

to a team, and you make one of the best. In turn, you are

expected to aid your colleagues within the organization,

typically by joining teams that require fire support.

Sp ellwarp Snip ers in the World

*“We figured we could take ’em. We got the jump on those guards in*

*the square, but then the fire started shootin’ into us. Beams o’ fire*

*like flaming yellow needles. I don’t know where they were coming*

*from, and I didn’t wait around long enough to find out!”*

—Stecky “the Clutch” Rockwater,

Red Knives Gang

Since spellwarp snipers usually belong to organizations,

you can readily introduce one into your campaign through

a group affiliated with the PCs.

Organization

A spellwarp sniper is particularly effective in the role of

ranged support, having greater accuracy than others who

rely on traditional weapons. Assassins’ guilds and thieves’

guilds openly welcome spellwarp snipers. City and royal

guards also actively recruit them. In addition, organizations

that focus on the study of magic recruit spellwarp

snipers

for their surgical precision. The ability to hone devastating

evocations into pinpoint attacks greatly reduces the chance

of accidental damage to the surroundings, especially in

libraries and universities.

Sometimes a spellwarp sniper occupies a different role,

that of executioner. A spellwarped *fireball* ray to the back

of the head is more deadly than a crossbow bolt and sends

a more terrifying message.

NPC Reactions

Popular among allies, respected by rivals, and feared by

enemies, spellwarp snipers elicit a wide range of reactions

from those they meet. Those fighting on the same side as

one are typically friendly, welcoming such a powerful ally.

Spellwarp snipers acknowledge one another as belonging

to an elite group of spellcasters, but they tread carefully

among their own kind. Overall, they are indifferent toward

one another. Those who have suffered at the hands of a

spellwarp sniper offer no quarter and begin as openly

hostile.

Sp ellwarp Snip er Lore

Characters with ranks in the appropriate Knowledge skill

(arcana for arcane casters or religion for divine casters) can

research spellwarp snipers to learn more about them. When

a character succeeds on a skill check, the following lore is

revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: A spellwarp sniper can hit a vital spot with a

spell just as a rogue can with a crossbow bolt, and usually

far more accurately.

DC 15: Spellwarp snipers can manipulate area spells to

make them into precise beams of destructive magic.

DC 20: If you see someone who looks like a spellcaster

watching you intently, take cover. She’s probably looking

for just the right time to blast you with a ray.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specific spellwarp snipers

in your campaign, including a notable individual, the

area in which she operates, and the kinds of activities she

undertakes.

A PC who wishes to enter this prestige class usually seeks

out a mentor. The easiest method is to contact an organization

with which the character is friendly: a thieves’ guild,

the city or royal guard, a temple, or a wizard’s university,

depending on the PC’s affiliations.

Sp ellwarp Snip ers in the Game

Spellwarp snipers can bring great power to bear in a small

space. At lower levels they serve as magical assassins or

sharpshooters, particularly as part of an ambush or group

raid. Higher-level spellwarp snipers make effective leaders,

particularly if they command a number of other spellwarp

snipers. At any level, they are interesting and surprising

spellcasting opponents.

The prestige class appeals to evokers for obvious reasons.

Players who like the role of long-ranged support combatant

or who prefer characters with precision-based attacks

should enjoy the change of pace offered by the spellwarp

sniper.

Adaptation

As a prestige class, the spellwarp sniper is already fairly

generic in the way it interacts with a campaign setting. It

doesn’t require new rules or different sources of power. For

an interesting take on spellwarp snipers, try changing the

types of spells they can warp. Perhaps they can transform

touch spells rather than area spells, or they focus their abilities

only on nondamaging area spells. Depending on the

needs of your campaign, you might change the class’s role

in a group, or create a separate organization of spellwarp

snipers that is not affiliated with another group.

Sample Encounter

A spellwarp sniper might appear wherever the PCs could

encounter an assassin or a mundane sniper. Characters

might stumble onto one intently watching a distant battle,

occasionally casting an unfamiliar ray spell into the fray.

They might also come across one in close quarters, finishing

or preparing for an assassination.

EL 12: Tessa Senchan works for the royal guard, supporting

the front-line combatants. While her comrades cross

swords with the city’s worst, she stays hidden at a distance,

blasting thugs and murderers with her pinpoint-accurate

spells. The PCs might meet Tessa if they accept employment

with the guard and work with her on an operation. If they

walk on the other side of the law, the PCs might become

targets of Tessa’s deadly beams. If they stumble across her

position, or trace her spells back to her, they must deal with

several lower-level guards protecting her.

A party that is uninvolved in the law of the city (whether

upholding it or breaking it) might cross paths with Tessa

while she’s on her way to her next assignment, incurring

neither a friendly nor a hostile response.
