# Skullclan Hunter (PrC)
## Overview
The skullclan hunter is the acclaimed foe of unlife. He champions

life by tracking and eradicating all creatures that mock it

with evil intent. His devotion to his task is such that he spends

moonless nights and weary days tracking undead to their lairs, or

when possible, joining a military band that is likely to come

against a legion of the dead.

A skullclan hunter is most often a rogue who has had a terrible

encounter with a creature of unlife. Because of that encounter,

he comes to realize that using his own skills against living creatures

only serves to create more fodder for unlife to take root, so

he dedicates himself to the eradication of undead. Following

through on this decision, he takes up the cleric class to gain the

ability to turn undead (and perhaps to acquire the needed knowledge

of religion more quickly). Multiclass rogue/clerics are the

characters best suited for this class.

NPC skullclan hunters fill out special positions in companies

that know they will soon be threatened by undead. While a skullclan

hunter’s abilities are still useful in situations other than the

immediate threat of undead action, the character really shines only

when putting the fear of discorporation into sentient undead.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the skullclan hunter

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Skullclan hunters gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Track Undead (Ex): A skullclan hunter gains the ability to

track undead (only) as if using the Track feat. A skullclan hunter

uses his Knowledge (religion) skill modifier instead of his Survival

modifier for the skill checks associated with this feat.

Divine Strike (Ex): Due to his specialized skill, training, and

connection with the forces of light, a skullclan hunter of 2nd

level or higher can make a special attack that is infused with

positive energy. Effectively, this ability allows him to deal extra

damage to undead as though making a sneak attack. Divine

strike damage applies to any sneak attack dice the skullclan

hunter already has, as well as those gained through advancement

in this class.

Immunities (Ex): As he grows in power, a skullclan hunter

develops immunities to special attacks that are common among

undead creatures.

At 3rd level, he gains immunity to all fear-based effects and

spells from undead.

At 4th level, he gains immunity to disease (regardless of the

source).

At 7th level, he gains immunity to paralysis.

At 8th level, he gains immunity to ability drain or damage.

At 10th level, he gains immunity to energy drain.

Sneak Attack: At 3rd level, a skullclan hunter’s sneak attack

damage increases by 1d6. This extra damage stacks with the

sneak attack damage he already deals.

At 6th level, his sneak attack damage increases to 2d6. At 9th

level, it increases to 3d6.

Protection from Evil (Su): Starting at 4th level, a skullclan

hunter benefits from a permanent *protection from evil* effect

upon himself.

Sword of Light (Su): Any weapon (melee or ranged, manufactured

or natural) wielded by a skullclan hunter of 5th level or

higher overcomes the damage reduction of any undead creature.

Sword of Darkness (Su): Any weapon (melee or ranged, manufactured

or natural) wielded by a skullclan hunter of 9th level or

higher counts as a ghost touch weapon, allowing it to hit incorporeal

creatures without the usual 50% miss chance for such attacks.
