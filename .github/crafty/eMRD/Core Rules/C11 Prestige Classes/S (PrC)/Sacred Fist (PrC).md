# Sacred Fist (PrC)
## Overview
Sacred fi sts are independent organizations found within

many temples. Their ascetic members have turned their

divine magic inward, bringing their bodies and wills into

harmony.

Sacred fi sts have forsworn the use of weapons and heavy

armor. They consider their bodies and minds gifts from

their deity, and they believe that not developing those gifts

to their fullest potential is a sin. Spellcasting does not dishonor

them or their deity. Sacred fi sts are strong in faith,

will, and body. Clerics are excellent candidates for sacred

fi sts orders. Paladins may also choose to join them, but are

seldom comfortable surrendering the trappings of their

calling. Fighters, rogues, bards, and even ex-monks may

make good candidates, provided they have enough levels in

a class that grants divine spells. Druids occasionally fi nd the

class’s combat skills useful, but sorcerers and wizards fi nd

little to interest them.

NPC sacred fi sts are as varied as their faiths. In general,

they travel the land individually, lending their skills to

those who need protection or assistance. While a sacred fi st

from a temple of Pelor might humbly assist almost anyone

who asked, one from Erythnul’s faith might help only when

it gains him something. Sacred fi sts from the temple of Kord

tend to be genial brawlers, humble in

victory and gracious in defeat. All

sacred fi sts seek challenges that

allow them to further develop

their fi ghting skills.

Adaptation: This prestige

class is designed to emphasize

a monk who sacrifi ces her

array of supernatural abilities and cast

spells instead. The sacred fi sts (under that

name or another) could be an esoteric order of

monks who combine rigorous self-defense training

with near-constant prayer. And if you connect them to

a specifi c nonlawful deity, the sacred fi sts are a good

way to create an exception to the “monks must be lawful”

rule.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the sacred fi st prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Sacred fi sts gain no

profi ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

AC Bonus (Ex): A sacred fi st is highly trained at dodging

blows, and he has a sixth sense that lets him avoid even

unanticipated attacks. When unencumbered and wearing

light or no armor, a sacred fi st gains a +1 bonus to his AC.

This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and to +3 at 10th.

This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or

when the sacred fi st is fl at-footed. He loses the bonus when

he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor

heavier than light armor, when he carries a shield, or when

he carries a medium or heavy load.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new sacred fi st

level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level

in whatever spellcasting class in which he could cast divine

spells before he added the prestige class. He does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character of that class would

have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking

undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially

means that he adds the level of sacred fi st to the level of

whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then

determines spells per day accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class in

which he could cast divine spells before he became a sacred

fi st, the player must decide which class to assign each level

of sacred fi st for the purpose of determining spells per day

and spells known.

Unarmed Damage (Ex): A sacred fi st’s class levels stack

with his monk levels (if any) for the purpose of determining

his unarmed damage. If a sacred fi st doesn’t have monk

levels prior to becoming a sacred fi st, treat him as a monk of

the same class level as his sacred fi st class level for determining

his unarmed damage.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 3rd level, a sacred fi st gains an

enhancement bonus to his speed, as shown on Table 2–18:

The Sacred Fist. A sacred fi st in medium or heavy armor or

carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

Sacred Flames (Su): At 4th level, a sacred fi st may use a

standard action to invoke sacred fl ames around his hands and

feet. These fl ames add to the sacred fi st’s unarmed damage.

The additional damage is equal to the sacred fi st’s class level

plus his Wisdom modifi er (if any). Half the damage is fi re

damage (round up), and the rest is sacred energy and thus

not subject to effects that reduce fi re damage. The sacred

fl ames last 1 minute and can be invoked once per day. At 8th

level, a sacred fi st can invoke sacred fl ames twice per day.

Blindsense (Su): A 6th-level sacred fi st gains sensitivity

to vibrations, scent, and noise, granting him blindsense out

to 10 feet.

Inner Armor (Ex): At 10th level, a sacred fi st’s inner tranquility

protects him from external threats. He may invoke

a +4 sacred bonus to AC, a +4 sacred bonus on all saves,

and spell resistance 25 for a number of rounds equal to his

Wisdom modifi er. He may use inner armor once per day.

Code of Conduct: A member of a sacred fi st order refuses

to use any weapon. A sacred fi st who knowingly carries or

uses a weapon loses all class spells and features and advances

no farther as a sacred fi st until he atones for his action (see

the *atonement* spell, page 201 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

Like a member of any other class, a sacred fi st may be a

multiclass character, but multiclass sacred fi sts face a special

restriction. A sacred fi st who gains a level in any class other

than sacred fi st may never again raise his sacred fi st level,

though he retains all his sacred fi st abilities. The path of the

sacred fi st requires a constant focus. If a character adopts

this class, he must pursue it to the exclusion of all other

careers. Once he has turned off the path, he may never

return.
