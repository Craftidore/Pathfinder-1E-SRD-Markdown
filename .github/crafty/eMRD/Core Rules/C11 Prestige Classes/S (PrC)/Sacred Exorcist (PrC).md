# Sacred Exorcist (PrC)
## Overview
Through elaborate rites that may include dancing, drumming,

beating a possessed person on the soles of the feet,

liberal use of holy water, or many other means, sacred

exorcists hope to drive away the spiritual forces of evil,

preventing them from causing harm to the bodies and souls

of humanity. Sacred exorcists are serious about their work

and very devoted to their religion. Not all of them are dour

and grim, but most are. Their determination to combat the

forces of evil in the world—along with their special ability

to do so—more than makes up for their lack of humor.

Most sacred exorcists are clerics or paladins who are

specifi cally trained by their church for the work they are

called to do. Most churches select only those who have

shown a clear dedication to the work of opposing evil outsiders,

as well as exemplary faith and devotion. Occasionally,

a wizard qualifi es to fi ll this role in a church that is tolerant toward arcane magic, but members of other classes

rarely become sacred exorcists.

NPC sacred exorcists are usually loners who travel from

city to city in the service of their church. As highly specialized

professionals, their services are frequently in demand,

though few cities would have need for a full-time sacred

exorcist.

Adaptation: As written, the prestige

class mandates the sanction of a church

or order, and it indicates that sacred

exorcists are loners. You could

reverse either of those elements;

sacred exorcists could function

independently of a larger

organization (or even be

castoffs from the larger

church). Maybe teams of

exorcists (with paladin

and arcane spellcaster

backup) patrol the land,

seeking out hidden evil

wherever it may gather.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a

sacred exorcist, a character

must fulfi ll all the

following criteria.

Alignment: Any

good.

Skills: Knowledge (the

planes) 10 ranks, Knowledge

(religion) 7 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast

*dismissal* or *dispel evil.*

Special: Adopting this prestige

class requires the sanction

of a church or order that ordains sacred exorcists.

Only characters judged by their church to be

exemplary in faith and devotion, strong of will and upright

in morality, are made sacred exorcists.

CLASS SKILLS

The sacred exorcist’s class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (the

planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis),

and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the *Player’s Handbook*

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features

of the sacred exorcist prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi -

ciency: Sacred exorcists are

profi cient with all simple

weapons. They do not gain

profi ciency with any type

of armor or with shields,

but usually carry these

profi ciencies from their

previous class.

Spells per Day/

Spells Known: A

sacred exorcist advances

in spellcasting

ability as well as

learning the skills of

exorcism. Thus,

when a new

sacred exorcist

level is gained,

the character gains

new spells per day as

if she had also gained a

level in whatever spellcasting

class she belonged to before she added

the prestige class. She does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character of that

class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, more frequent *remove disease,* and so on).

This means that she adds the level of sacred exorcist to the level of another spellcasting class the character has, then determines

spells per day accordingly.

For example, if Delliva, an 8th-level cleric, gains a level

as a sacred exorcist, she gains new spells as if she had risen

to 9th level as a cleric, but uses the other sacred exorcist

aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and

save bonuses. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her

a 9th-level cleric/1st-level sacred exorcist, she gains spells as

if she had risen to 10th level as a cleric.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class

in which she could cast *dismissal* or *dispel evil* before she

became a sacred exorcist, the player must decide which

class to assign each level of sacred exorcist for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Exorcism (Su): As a full-round action, a sacred exorcist

can force a possessing creature or spirit out of the body it

inhabits. To exorcise a possessing creature, the exorcist

makes a class level check (also adding her Charisma modifi

er, if any), against a DC of 10 + the possessing creature’s

HD + its Charisma modifi er (if any). If the exorcist’s result

equals or exceeds the DC, she succeeds in forcing the possessor

from the body, with the normal results based on its

method of possession. A spirit so exorcised cannot attempt

to possess the same victim for 24 hours.

Turn Undead (Su): Sacred exorcists can turn undead as

clerics do. If a sacred exorcist has this ability from another

class, her class levels stack to determine her effective turning

level.

Resist Possession (Ex): Sacred exorcists of at least

2nd level receive a +4 sacred bonus on their saving throws

against *magic jar* spells or similar abilities (including a

ghost’s malevolence ability), and a +2 sacred bonus on

dispel checks made to dispel such effects. They also get a

+2 sacred bonus on their saving throws against all charm

and compulsion spells and effects cast by evil outsiders or

undead.

*Detect Evil* (Sp): At will, a sacred exorcist of at least 2nd

level can use *detect evil* as a spell-like ability.

Chosen Foe (Ex): At 3rd level, a sacred exorcist designates

either undead or evil outsiders as her chosen foe.

Extensive study and special training in the proper techniques

for combating this foe gives the sacred exorcist a

+1 competence bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Listen, Sense

Motive, and Spot checks against the chosen foe, as well as a

+1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome any spell resistance

of the chosen foe. At 6th level the bonus increases to

+2, and at 9th level it increases to +3.

*Dispel Evil* (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, a sacred exorcist

can use *dispel evil* as a spell-like ability once per week. At 7th

level, she can use this ability twice per week. At 10th level,

she can use it three times per week.

Consecrated Presence (Su): At 5th level and higher, a

sacred exorcist is surrounded by an aura of positive energy

that extends 20 feet from her presence. This aura duplicates

the effects of a *consecrate* spell, but it moves with the sacred

exorcist. If the sacred exorcist enters an area affected by a

*desecrate* spell, both effects are negated while the sacred exorcist

remains in the area. If the sacred exorcist is the target of

a *desecrate* spell, her aura is suppressed for the duration of the

*desecrate* spell.

*Holy Aura* (Sp): A sacred exorcist of 8th level or higher can

use *holy aura* once per day as a spell-like ability.
