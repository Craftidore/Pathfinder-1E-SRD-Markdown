# Shadowbane Inquisitor (PrC)
## Overview
Clad in bone-white armor and wreathed in righteous

conviction, shadowbane inquisitors battle incessantly

against evil in whatever form it takes. Every shadowbane

inquisitor belongs to a fellowship of religious knights

called the Order of Illumination (see page 179). The

order advocates merciless aggression against evil, and

its members train to detect and destroy evil creatures

and individuals. Filled with fervor, an inquisitor knows

only one solution to an infestation of evil: the sword.

The purifying flame and the clean cut of a holy blade

are his tools.

Along with their comrades (as members of the order

refer to one another) the shadowbane stalkers, inquisitors

find and confront evil wherever it hides. Unlike

shadowbane stalkers, however, inquisitors emphasize

purging evil rather than finding it. Their relentless zeal

and their overwhelming belief in their own righteousness

allow shadowbane inquisitors to root out evil cleanly,

even if it costs the lives of a few good creatures, without

the moral doubt that other knights might feel. The Order

of Illumination expounds that it is better to sacrifice a

village that hides a powerful demon than it is to risk

letting the demon escape or the evil spread. Although

inquisitors remain devoted to the cause of good, this

conviction allows them to use their abilities against

enemies regardless of their alignment.

Inquisitors must watch shadowbane stalkers carefully

to make sure they do not slip into darkness—stalkers

are willing to use subterfuge to find evil where it hides,

and subtlety and stealth are tools of evil. This situation

occasionally puts the two branches of the Order of

Illumination at odds, but the order as a whole remains

zealously dedicated to good.

Almost all shadowbane inquisitors were once paladins

who took a few levels of rogue to better understand

and combat the subtle forces of evil. This unusual class

combination gives the inquisitor a remarkable ability to

resist the manipulations of evil creatures and confront

them without fear. Some cleric/rogues become inquisitors,

sacrificing their study of divine magic in order to

perfect their combat abilities.

Adaptation: Shadowbane inquisitors can easily be

added to a campaign as part of a less extreme organization

by portraying them as good-aligned detectives with solid

combat abilities and distinctive special powers. Although

most martial characters have difficulty participating in

detective work or social encounters, the inquisitors shine

in both areas. On the other hand, simply removing the

alignment requirement from the class and renaming it to

fit a neutral or evil order of knights makes the inquisitor

into a much more overt entry class for the blackguard

prestige class.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the shadowbane

inquisitor prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Shadowbane

inquisitors are proficient with all simple and martial

weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (except

tower shields).

Absolute Conviction (Ex): Should a shadowbane

inquisitor’s alignment ever change from lawful good

for any reason, he may not take additional levels in this

prestige class, but he does not lose any class abilities from

levels already attained.

Pierce Shadows (Su): A shadowbane inquisitor can

spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to

shed a holy radiance. This light brightly illuminates an

area in a radius of 20 feet plus 5 feet per class level of the

inquisitor. The light is centered on the inquisitor and

sheds no shadowy illumination beyond its border. This

radiance lasts for 10 minutes per inquisitor class level.

Sacred Stealth (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a shadowbane

inquisitor can channel some of his divine spell

power to become stealthier. To do this, he must lose a prepared divine spell from memory (or give up a potential

spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). He

gains a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks

for a number of minutes equal to his Charisma bonus (if

any) plus the level of spell given up in this manner.

At 7th level, the bonus increases to +8.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate

Actions, page 137).

Smite (Su): Once per day, a shadowbane inquisitor of

2nd level or higher can attempt to smite a creature that he

judges to be corrupt with one normal melee attack. He adds

his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an

extra 1 point of damage per inquisitor class level. Unlike

with a paladin’s smite evil ability, an inquisitor relies only

on his own judgment when determining what creatures to

use this ability against. How an inquisitor uses this ability

exemplifies his outlook on the world. The more suspicious

and uncompromising an inquisitor is, the more likely he

is to feel that a creature should be struck down.

An inquisitor can use this ability twice per day at 6th

level and three times per day at 10th level.

Improved Sunder: At 3rd level, a shadowbane

becomes accomplished at shattering the weapons of his

foes and tainted magic items. He gains the Improved

Sunder feat as a bonus feat.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, a shadowbane

inquisitor deals an extra 1d6 points of damage

when flanking an opponent or any time the target would

be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies

to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It

increases to 2d6 points at 7th level and 3d6 points at 10th

level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook.* If a shadowbane inquisitor gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the

bonuses on damage stack.

Merciless Purity (Su): Beginning at 5th level, a

shadowbane inquisitor benefits when his enemies

perish. Upon the death of a creature that the inquisitor

has designated as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus

on his Fortitude and Reflex saves for the next 24 hours.

An inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt in his

eyes by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a

melee attack against the creature. The inquisitor need

not kill the creature himself. An inquisitor can benefit

from this ability only once per day; subsequent deaths

of creatures that he has designated as corrupt grant no

special benefit.

Righteous Fervor (Su): When an inquisitor of 8th

level or higher designates a creature as corrupt, he gains

a +1 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls against

that creature for the rest of the encounter. The inquisitor

designates a creature as corrupt by using his smite ability

(see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature.

This bonus does not apply to the smite attempt itself, only

to subsequent attacks against the same creature made in

that encounter.

Burning Light (Su): At 9th level and higher, an

inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn

undead ability to deal damage to creatures around him.

To do this, he must already have his pierce shadows ability

active. All creatures within the illuminated area (except

for the inquisitor) take 4d6 points of damage. This damage

results directly from divine power and is not subject to

being reduced by energy resistance. Using this ability

requires a standard action.

Multiclassing Note: A paladin can multiclass as a

shadowbane inquisitor without losing his ability to take

additional levels of paladin. In addition, he can multiclass

freely between the paladin and rogue classes and may

even gain additional rogue levels. He must still remain

lawful good in order to retain his paladin abilities and

take paladin levels.

FALLEN INQUISITORS

Like paladins, shadowbane inquisitors occasionally fall

into darkness and evil. The light of self-righteousness

burns strongly within an inquisitor, and he never faces

the self-doubt or moral dilemmas that heroes of less

conviction must deal with. It is this overwhelming

confidence in his own ability to define what is right and

wrong, however, that sometimes leads an inquisitor into

darkness. The path of the inquisitor is long and dangerous,

and those who complete it are among the most

powerful and persistent opponents of evil. But those who fall, having known the heights of purity, become

evil beyond reckoning.

Convinced of their own moral purity, fallen inquisitors

pursue their vile agenda without ever feeling doubt, and

they are often charismatic enough to draw others into

their wicked plans. Should an inquisitor who also has

paladin levels ever gain levels in the blackguard class,

his shadowbane inquisitor levels stack with his paladin

levels when determining the number of extra abilities

that the blackguard gains for having paladin levels. For

example, if a 5th-level paladin/1st-level rogue/5th-level

shadowbane inquisitor takes a level of blackguard, he

gains extra blackguard class abilities as if he were a fallen

paladin of 10th level.

Smite (Su): Kalva can attempt to smite a creature he

judges to be corrupt with one normal melee attack. He

adds 2 to his attack roll and deals an extra 2 points of

damage.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, Kalva can attempt to

smite evil with one normal melee attack. He adds 2 to

his attack roll and deals an extra 4 points of damage.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Kalva deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Kalva

can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Absolute Conviction (Ex): Kalva does not lose any

shadowbane inquisitor class abilities if he changes

alignment.

Aura of Courage (Su): Immune to fear, and each ally

within 10 feet gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws

against fear effects.

Detect Evil *(*Sp): Kalva can use *detect evil* at will. See

the spell, page 218 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Divine Health (Ex): Immunity to disease.

Evasion (Ex): If Kalva is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Pierce Shadows (Su): Kalva can spend one of his daily

uses of his turn undead ability to brightly illuminate

an area with a 30-foot radius centered on himself. This

radiance lasts for 20 minutes.

Sacred Stealth (Su): Kalva can lose a prepared divine

spell from memory to gain a +4 sacred bonus on Hide

and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal

to 2 plus the level of spell given up in this manner.

Trapfinding (Ex): Kalva can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

*Paladin Spell Prepared* (caster level 2nd): 1st—*bless*

*weapon.*

*Possessions: +2 full plate, +1 greatsword, cloak of resistance*

*+1, scroll of bless weapon, 2 scrolls of iron silence*†*, scroll of lesser*
