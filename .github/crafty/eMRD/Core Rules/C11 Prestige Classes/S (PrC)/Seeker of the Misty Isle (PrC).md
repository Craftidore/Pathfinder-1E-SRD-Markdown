# Seeker of the Misty Isle (PrC)
## Overview
Millennia ago, a well-placed arrow from Corellon Larethian

put out one of Gruumsh’s eye. But Gruumsh and Kurtulmak

conspired to have their revenge on the deity of the elves.

Using potent magic (and sacrifi cing thousands of orcs,

kobolds, and captive elves), Gruumsh and Kurtulmak managed

to whisk away one of the world’s most beautiful elven

communities: the Misty Isle. Neither Corellon Larethian’s

personal power nor the combined prowess of the elven

nation’s diviners was able to glean so much as a hint about

where Gruumsh and Kurtulmak have hidden the Misty

Isle—only that the elves there yet survive, though they are

trapped and cannot contact their brethren.

Thus an elite order of elves was born: the seekers of the

Misty Isle. Ever since the Misty Isle was stolen away, the

seekers have walked the length and breadth of the land,

hunting patiently for the lost elves. Even among the longlived

elves, a dozen generations of seekers have lived and

died without discovering more than a few scattered clues as

to the Misty Isle’s location. Yet still they search, and to give

one’s life to the seekers’ cause is one of the noblest sacrifi ces

an elf can make.

Joining the seekers is an arduous process, for the order

admits only those likely to survive long travels in hostile

lands. And because looking for the Misty Isle is a lifelong

quest, the ranks of the seekers are fi lled with those who no

longer “fi t in” among the elves: the heartbroken, the grieving,

and the exiled. Many have at least some training as a

ranger or druid, because the forbidding wilderness where a

seeker wanders provides entry trials of its own. Multiclass

barbarian druids and cleric/rangers also fi nd the pursuit

rewarding.

NPC seekers of the Misty Isle can be found nearly

anywhere, because Gruumsh and Kurtulmak could have

hidden a portal to the Misty Isle anywhere from a city sewer

to a lonely mountain cave to the depths of the Abyss itself.

Seekers don’t often stay in one place for long, but they’ll join

any quest that even hints at progress in the search for the

Misty Isle.

Adaptation: This prestige class is both race- and deityspecifi

c, but you can fi le off the serial numbers and use it

for any group of elite wanderers. The fl avor of the class is

a romanticized version of the French Foreign Legion—a

group composed of people who want to start their lives

over, far from everything they know.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the seeker of the

Misty Isle prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Seekers

of the Misty Isle are profi cient with all martial

weapons and with all light and medium

armor.

Extra Domain: A seeker of the Misty Isle

gains the granted power and spell

access of the Travel domain at 1st

level and the Magic domain at

7th level. For an explanation of how

nonclerics receive domain spells, see the

Extra Domains section at the beginning

of this Chapter.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When

a new seeker of the Misty Isle level is

gained, the character gains new spells

per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if she had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class in which she

could cast 2nd-level divine spells

before she added the prestige class.

She does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that

class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, wild

shape ability, and so

on). This essentially

means that she adds

the level of seeker of

the Misty Isle to

the level of whatever

other spellcasting class

the character has, then

determines spells per day accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting

class in which she could cast 2nd-level divine

spells before she became a seeker of the Misty Isle, the

player must decide which class to assign each level of seeker

of the Misty Isle for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Swiftfooted (Ex): At 4th level, the seeker can ignore the

normal –5 penalty for accelerated movement when she uses

the following skills: Balance, Climb, Hide, Move Silently,

and Survival (for following tracks). Her penalty for accelerated

tumbling is reduced from –10 to –5.

Corellon’s Perception (Ex): A 5th-level seeker of the

Misty Isles has sight and hearing far beyond a normal

elf’s, and she has attuned her senses to repetitively sweep

her immediate area. She gains a +5 racial bonus on Listen,

Search, and Spot checks. Furthermore, she can attempt to

spot or hear something she failed to notice previously once

per round per skill as a free action (such attempts are ordinarily

move actions).

Surefooted (Ex): As a side effect of

the seeker of the Misty Isle’s keen

senses, she is always searching

the terrain around

her. Accordingly, she has

a preternatural sense of

minute details in

the landscape

she can use to her

advantage. She can ignore

DC modifi ers on Balance,

Move Silently, and Tumble

checks derived from the

surface or terrain.

*Find the Path* (Sp): A 6thlevel

seeker can use *fi nd the*

*path* on herself once per day

as a spell-like ability. Her caster

level is equal to her class level.

*Arcane Sight* (Su): Three times per

day, a 9th-level seeker of the Misty Isle’s eyes

glow blue, enabling her to use *arcane sight*, as the

spell from a caster of the seeker’s highest divine

caster level.

*Discern Location* (Sp): A 10th-level seeker can

use *discern location* once per week as a spell-like

ability. Her caster level is equal to her class level.
