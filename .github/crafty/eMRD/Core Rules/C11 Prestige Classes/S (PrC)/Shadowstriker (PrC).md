# Shadowstriker (PrC)
## Overview
*“Horrible cults, terrible demons, and the shambling remains of*

*creatures long dead—I have seen them all, and my bright blade*

*has given me the strength to do what is right. Though the shadows*

*may blind you, they can also open your eyes to the realization that*

*our plight is dire—more so than we might at fi rst admit.”*

—Peadrin, shadowstriker of Pelor

The elite group known as the shadowstrikers is the military

arm of Pelor’s Shadow Guard. Its members make little

attempt to hide their presence because they prefer to stand

as constant reminders to the minions of evil and decay that

divine consequences await their vile actions.

BECOMING A SHADOWSTRIKER

Shadowstrikers come from all walks of life. Most are drawn

from the clerics and paladins who

serve in the ranks of either Heironeous

or Pelor, though any

member of either church with

strong faith and a needed skill—

regardless of vocation—is welcome

to apply.

CLASS FEATURES

You are a weapon of Pelor given humanoid

form. As a shadowstriker, you have

learned to channel your faith into a

well-honed weapon and become especially

profi cient at dealing with

undead creatures.

Badge of Office (Ex): Upon your induction

into the shadowstrikers, you were

given a special holy symbol combining

the symbols of Heironeous and Pelor. This

item is crafted from gold, inlaid with platinum

lightning motifs, and encrusted with

sunstones. In areas where the Church of

Heironeous or the Church of Pelor holds

political power, this badge allows you access

to prohibited areas and gives you the right to

detain and question suspects in the pursuit of

your deity’s will.

Luminous Weapon (Su): You

can imbue your melee weapon

with the power of the Shining

One. When you do so, your

weapon glows as if affected

by a *light* spell and gains a bonus

equal to twice your shadowstriker

level on damage rolls against evil and/or

undead creatures. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifi er

(minimum once), and the effect lasts for 10 rounds.

Smite Evil (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you can smite evil

once per day (see the paladin class feature, *PH* 44). Smite evil

attempts/day attained from multiple sources stack.

Sun’s Blessing (Su): When you reach 2nd level, you can

cause your weapon to fl are with the fi res of the sun. As long

as the sun’s blessing remains upon your luminous weapon,

it deals an extra 1d6 points of fi re damage. Additionally, the

blinding light spilling from the weapon counts as a *daylight*

spell for the duration of the effect. The sun’s blessing can be

used once per day, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds

equal to your shadowstriker level. You can gain an additional

use per day of this ability for each daily turn attempt, smite

evil attempt, or spell slot (if you are a spontaneous caster)

that you sacrifi ce.

Surge of Piety (Su): When you attain 3rd level as

a shadowstriker, your touch becomes infused with

positive energy. Any undead creature that touches

you (by hitting you in melee or for any other reason)

is shaken for 1 round or until it is no longer

in physical contact with you—even if

it normally can’t be affected by this

condition. Once per day as a fullround

action, you can channel

this energy into a single burst

of positive energy, which manifests

as a fl ash of bright, warm

sunlight. In addition to functioning

as a *consecrate* spell, this

wave of energy deals 1d8 points

of positive energy damage to

every undead creature within

30 feet (no save). You can

increase the damage this

effect deals by 1d8 points

(maximum +5d8) for each

daily turn attempt, smite

evil attempt, or spell slot (if

you are a spontaneous caster)

that you sacrifi ce.

PLAYING A SHADOWSTRIKER

As a shadowstriker, you are one

of Pelor’s elite soldiers. You and

your fellows enjoy an *esprit de*

*corps* that the religious orders rarely exhibit, due in part to the fact that shadowstriker

cells are composed primarily of laypersons brought together

by their common faith in your two patron deities. The

forces of evil cannot long stand before such a zealous and

devoted group—indeed, When you are with the other

members of your cell, you are unstoppable and capable of

accomplishing any goal. Even when you are alone, you are

a force to be reckoned with, and you don’t mind letting

others know it.

Combat

When engaging enemies in combat, your best option is your

luminous weapon ability, which increases the damage you

deal. At 2nd level, you can pair this ability with sun’s blessing,

which adds a signifi cant amount of fi re damage to your

attacks. If you use these two abilities in conjunction with

smite evil, you can easily lay fi endish foes low with a few

well-placed blows. Since your damage-enhancing abilities

are usable only in hand-to-hand combat, however, you must

be prepared to close for melee with your enemies.

Sample Encounter

A shadowstriker makes an excellent ally for good-aligned

player characters, as well as a tenacious enemy for evil ones.

His loyalty is fi rst to the churches of Pelor and Heironeous,

and second to the members of his shadowstriker cell, but he

is happy to lend aid to anyone in need.

EL 12: Peadrin is a tall, handsome human male in his late

twenties. Orphaned at an early age, he grew up in a churchsponsored

orphanage and has been a devoted servant of Pelor

ever since. Peadrin’s outstanding performance as a paladin

in the martial order of Pelor soon earned him an invitation

to join the shadowstrikers, and he has served there with

distinction ever since. Presently, he leads a small cell of

shadowstrikers (consisting of a fi ghter 4/shadowstriker 2, a

rogue 6/shadowstriker 1, and a sorcerer 8/shadowstriker 1)

in raids against evil strongholds.
