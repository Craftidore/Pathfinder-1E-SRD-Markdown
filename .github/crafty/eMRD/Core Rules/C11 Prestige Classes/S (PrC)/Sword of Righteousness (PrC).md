# Sword of Righteousness (PrC)
## Overview
The call of exalted deeds does not exclude the path of the warrior.

Though few in number, warriors of every stripe devote

themselves to good, choosing a higher calling than their fellows.

Even among paladins, some pursue a commitment to

righteousness and purity that exceeds the norm, truly exalting

them above their peers. These men and women are called

swords of righteousness.

The sword of righteousness prestige class is simply a way for

a martially oriented character—typically a paladin, fighter,

ranger, barbarian, monk, or even rogue—to gain more exalted

feats at the cost of a slightly slower progression in his or her

basic class. It is not intended as a lifelong career path, just a sidetrack

allowing such a character to focus for a short while on the

trappings of righteousness. Spellcasting characters (bards, clerics,

druids, sorcerers, and wizards) tend toward the wonderworker

prestige class to accomplish the same goal.

No organization binds swords of righteousness together,

though they are often found operating in the churches of good

deities, good-aligned knightly orders, and other existing organizations

dedicated to virtuous causes.

Hit Die: d8.
