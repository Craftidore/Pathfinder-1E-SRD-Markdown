# Sublime Chord (PrC)
## Overview
Music is not just a pleasant sound; it is also the expression

of mathematical relationships fraught with signifi cance. A

member of the sublime chord prestige class sees music, even

the powerful music of a skilled bard, as nothing more than

a stepping-stone to true universal insight into the legendary

song of creation heard at the dawn of time. Music and

magic are actually one and the same, and an astute student

who unravels the riddles of meter and pitch simultaneously

reveals hidden secrets of great power.

All sublime chords must have some foundation in the

bard’s art, since bardic music is the first step in mastering

the power of the First Song. However, music is only

one tool for understanding the infinite; a sublime chord

must also study mathematics and the precise movements

of the stars and planets in which the music of the spheres

is evident. In exchange for abandoning her continuing

study of bardic music, a sublime chord instead masters a

number of spells far more powerful than most bards can

ever use. While most sublime chords receive the majority

of their training as bards, a small number of sorcerers and

wizards are drawn to this class, enticed by the notion of an

ultimate truth linking the power of song and the power

of magic.

Sublime chords are often drawn to colleges, universities,

and other gatherings of learned folk. In some places, such

as the Starry Lyceum in the city of Osterhaven, they gather

in small circles of musical scholars. The Starry Lyceum is

dedicated to the pursuit and preservation of knowledge,

and its members are known for their efforts to recover

lost secrets and prevent the fading of ancient songs and

star-taught wisdom. Ostensibly neutral in the affairs of

the world, the sublime chords of the Lyceum make their

learning and lore available to all who seek it—a policy that

often runs counter to those who would seek to govern or

dominate other people by fostering ignorance.

NPC sublime chords are encountered in much the same

variety of adventures and roles in which one fi nds NPC

bards. They blur the line between bard and wizard, and are

often mistaken for mages who wield mysterious song-based

magic. As scholars without peer, NPC sublime chords are

especially interested in recovering lost lore and exploring

arcane mysteries, and they often join adventuring parties

with similar interests.

Adaptation: The Starry Lyceum can serve as the focal

point for the inclusion of this prestige class. However, this

organization is more than a group; it is really a way of life.

Its members are scholars, bards, and mages in search of

fundamental truth and dedicated to the preservation of

knowledge. In your campaign, you can easily substitute

any similar college for the Starry Lyceum. For example,

in the FORGOTTEN REALMS® setting, the scribes of Candlekeep

or the Vault of Sages in Silverymoon would serve

quite well in place of the Lyceum for any sublime chord

characters.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the sublime chord

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Sublime chords gain

no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

As with bard spells, the somatic components for a sublime

chord’s spells do not incur an arcane spell failure chance as

normal for arcane spells if the sublime chord is wearing light

armor.

Spells per Day: A sublime chord has the ability to cast a

small number of arcane spells, all of 4th level or higher. To

cast a sublime chord spell, a character must have a Charisma

score of at least 10 + the spell’s level, so if she has a Charisma

of 13 or lower, she cannot cast any sublime chord spells.

Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the

sublime chord’s Cha modifi er. A sublime chord can choose

spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or the bard spell

list; if a spell appears on both lists at different levels, she

uses the bard version of the spell. A sublime chord’s caster

level for both her sublime chord spells and the spells she

gains from other arcane spellcasting classes is determined

by adding her sublime chord level to her level in another

arcane spellcasting class. If she had more than one arcane

spellcasting class before becoming a sublime chord, she must

choose to which class to add her sublime chord levels for the

purpose of determining her sublime chord spellcaster level.

A sublime chord prepares and casts spells just as a sorcerer

does, including the ability to replace a known sublime chord

spell with a new spell at every even-numbered class level

beginning at 4th.

Bardic Knowledge: A sublime chord continues to collect

the odd bits of lore and knowledge that bards acquire.

She can add her sublime chord class level to her bardic

knowledge checks, so her bardic knowledge checks have

a bonus equal to her bard level + her sublime chord level +

her Int modifi er.

Bardic Music: A sublime chord expands her repertoire of

bardic music to encompass new songs or poetics of strange

and wondrous power. These effects function just as the bardic

music effects described in the *Player’s Handbook.* Each use of

a sublime chord song expends one daily use of the character’s

bardic music ability.

A sublime chord adds one-half her class level (rounded

down) to her bard level to determine her number of daily

uses of bardic music.

*Song of Arcane Power (Su):* A sublime chord of 2nd level or

higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill learns how

to use her bardic music to assist her spellcasting. As a move

action, she can prepare to cast a spell by giving voice to the

song of power. The next spell she casts gains a bonus to its

caster level based on the result of the sublime chord’s Perform

check:

**Perform Check Result Caster Level Increase**

9 or lower +0

10 to 19 +1

20 to 29 +2

30 or higher +4

The spell to be enhanced by the song of arcane power must

be cast by the end of the sublime chord’s next turn, or else

the song fades with no effect (other than consuming a bardic

music use).

*Song of Timelessness (Su):* A sublime chord of 6th level or

higher with 16 or more ranks in a Perform skill knows the

song of timelessness. As a standard action, she can envelop

a single creature within 60 feet in a fi eld of timelessness,

provided she has line of effect to the target (see page 176 of

the *Player’s Handbook*). The subject is entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + sublime chord level + Cha modifi er) to negate the

effect.

If the subject fails its save, it is frozen in a shimmering

aura of timelessness and can take no actions. However, no

force can affect it—weapons cannot reach it, spells that

target it automatically fail, and if the ground it is standing

on is somehow taken away, it would not even begin to fall.

A sublime chord can keep her target frozen in time for as

long as she maintains the power by continuing to perform,

up to a maximum of 1 minute per level.

When she stops performing, the

subject immediately returns to

normal. As far as the creature

is concerned, no time seems

to have passed.

*Song of Cosmic Fire (Su):* A

10th-level sublime chord

with 20 or more ranks in

a Perform skill learns

the song of cosmic

fi re. Using this ability

costs a sublime

chord two of her

daily uses of bardic

music. The song of

cosmic fi re creates a

20-foot-radius spread

of fire anywhere

within 100 feet of

the sublime chord

(provided she has

line of effect to the

fi re’s point of origin).

Creatures in the area

take damage equal

to the sublime chord’s

Perform check result.

All affected creatures

are entitled to a Refl ex

save (DC 10 + sublime

chord level + Cha modifi

er) for half damage.
