# Stormlord (PrC)
## Overview
Most stormlords are clerics, druids, or cleric/sorcerers,

although other class combinations, particularly those

including fi ghter or even barbarian, are not unknown.

Wizards have their own means of destroying things, and

bards rarely can generate enough force with their spells to

be considered worthy by the Destroyer.

Stormlords often live as brigands, indulging their personal

desires for wealth, food, luxury items, and wanton

behavior as they crave random, spectacular acts of violence.

They often pose as lunatics, in order to spread the word of

Talos, and otherwise adopt disguises in order to scout out

rich prizes to strike at.

Adaptation: If you do not have the god Talos in your

game then this prestige class works well with any god of

storms, obviously, but it’s also

appropriate for nature deities

or clerics and druids that venerate

nature or weather in the

abstract without worshiping a

specifi c deity.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the stormlord prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Stormlords gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each stormlord level,

the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a divine

spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any

other benefi t a character of that class would have gained

(improved chance of turning or destroying undead, additional

favored enemies, and so on). If the character had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a

stormlord, the player must decide to which class to add each

stormlord level for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Enhanced Javelins: Any javelin thrown by a stormlord

counts as a +1 magic weapon. This bonus increases at 6th

level to +2 and at 10th level to +3.

Resistance to Electricity (Ex): As a stormlord gains

levels in this prestige class, he becomes increasingly resistant

to electrical energy, gaining resistance to electricity

in the amount given on the table. At 9th level, a stormlord

gains immunity to electricity.

Shock Weapon (Su): Any spear or javelin used by

a stormlord of 2nd level or higher is treated as a shock

weapon (dealing an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage).

The weapon loses this ability 1 round after leaving the hand

of the stormlord.

Storm Walk (Ex) : Beginning at 3rd level, a stormlord

(and his mount, if any) can walk or ride through storms (natural

or magical) at his regular movement rate, completely

unaffected by high winds (including *gust of wind*), pounding

precipitation or waves, objects driven by the wind (which

always seem to miss him), great claps of thunder, natural

bolts of lightning, or any other natural symptom of Talos’s

fury.

Thundering Weapon (Su) : For a stormlord of 5th level

or higher, any spear or javelin he uses is treated as a thundering

weapon (see page 225 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*). The

weapon loses this ability 1 round after leaving the hand of

the stormlord. This effect stacks with that of the stormlord’s

shock weapon ability.

*Storm Ride* (Sp) : At 6th level, a stormlord gains the ability

to fl y during any storm as if using the *fl y* spell. Adverse

wind conditions do not affect him; for example, even hurricane-

force winds cannot knock him down or blow him

away when fl ying.

Shocking Burst Weapon (Su) : For a stormlord of 8th

level or higher, any spear or javelin he uses is treated as a

shocking burst weapon. The weapon loses this ability 1

round after leaving the hand of the stormlord. This effect

stacks with that of the stormlord’s thundering weapon

ability.

*Storm of Elemental Fury* (Sp) : At 10th level, a stormlord

can summon a storm of great magnitude and power. Once

per day, a stormlord can use *storm of elemental fury* as if he

were a 17th-level cleric.
