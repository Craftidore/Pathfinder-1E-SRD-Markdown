# Squire of Legend (PrC)
## Overview
*“Behind every legend stand the folks who had to do the real*

*work.”*

—Ezria Birrinsdottir,

squire to Mikolai Laziros

Not everyone who reveres the Six from Shadow (see page 65)

desires to shape her entire life around her chosen paragon.

Some wish only for a slight taste of their hero’s abilities,

others simply recognize that no champion can stand alone.

The Six from Shadow could not have defeated Tharizdun’s

cult without the efforts of the thousands who fell beside

them. It is this philosophy that the squire of legend embraces.

Whether she seeks to stand behind heroes such as the mythic

exemplars, propping them up and aiding them in their quests,

or simply to honor her favored paragon without following in

his footsteps, she is a hero in her own right, skilled beyond

her humble title.

BECOMING A SQUIRE OF LEGEND

Like the mythic exemplar, the squire of legend devotes

herself to a single path based on a chosen patron, but

her abilities are much less rigidly defined by that path.

Thus, a broader array of characters can benefit from this

prestige class.

**Entry Requirements**

**Skills:** Knowledge (history) 3 ranks and any one of

the following: Diplomacy 7 ranks, Intimidate 7 ranks,

Knowledge (arcana) 7 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 7 ranks,

or Move Silently 7 ranks.

**Special:** Must be a member of the Disciples of Legend.

**Hit Die: d8**

**Class Skills (6 + Int modifier per level):** Appraise, Bluff, Climb, Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Gather

Information, Handle Animal, Heal, Jump, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion), Listen,

Perform, Ride, Search, Sense Motive, Spot, Swim.

CLASS FEATURES

Your class features vary according to your paragon, but are all

oriented toward aiding and bolstering your allies. You know

that when a hero falls, when a knight is unhorsed, or when

a champion surrenders to despair, it is up to his squire to set

him right. Thus, your allies know they can always count on

you when the day is darkest.

Spellcasting: At 2nd and 3rd level, you gain new spells

per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige

class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a

character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than one spellcasting class before becoming a squire of

legend, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Paragon’s Path: Upon becoming a squire of legend, you

must choose one of the legendary Six from Shadow after

whom to model your skills and abilities. Once made, your

choice cannot be changed.

Save Bonus (Ex): At 1st level, you gain a +1 bonus on a

saving throw determined by your paragon, as given on the

following table. This bonus increases to +2 when you attain

3rd level.

**Patron Saving Throw**

Dardallion Reflex

Imdastri Will

Ktolemagne Will

Orsos Fortitude

Reikhardt Will

Sunyartra Fortitude

Squire’s Burden, Least (Su): You gain the fi rst of several

supernatural abilities that let you use the skills of your

chosen paragon to aid others. Unless otherwise noted, each

paragon’s gift (least, lesser, and greater) requires a swift action

to invoke, lasts for a number of rounds equal to twice your

squire of legend level, is usable once per day, and has a caster

level equal to three times your squire of legend level. When

the description of a squire’s burden ability specifi es an ally,

it means only an ally; you cannot use the effect on yourself

unless so stated.

*Dardallion:* You can grant yourself and one ally fl anking

bonuses against a foe that both of you threaten, even if you

are not properly positioned to fl ank. The bonus persists as

long as you both threaten that enemy.

*Imdastri:* You can use *sanctuary,* as the spell.

*Ktolemagne*: You can use *comprehend languages*, as the

spell.

*Orsos*: You can use *speak with animals*, as the spell.

*Reikhardt*: You can grant one ally within 30 feet the ability

to take an immediate action of a specifi ed type out of turn.

If you invoke this ability as a swift action, the ally can take

a 5-foot step. If you invoke it as a move action, she can take

a move action. If you invoke it as a standard action, she can

take a standard action.

*Sunyartra*: As an immediate action, you can negate a single

critical hit against one ally within 30 feet. The ally still takes

normal damage from the hit.

Squire’s Burden, Lesser (Su): At 2nd level, you gain a

new supernatural ability that you can use once per day. This

ability follows all the guidelines for least squire’s burden

(above), unless otherwise noted. If you choose, you can forgo

your daily use of this ability for an extra use of your least

squire’s burden.

*Dardallion:* As an immediate action, you can grant one ally

within 30 feet the opportunity to reroll a saving throw, skill

check, or ability check.

*Imdastri:* You can use *shield other*, as the spell. The effect

lasts for a number of rounds equal to three times your squire

of legend level.

*Ktolemagne:* You can use *see invisibility*, as the spell. The

effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to three times your

squire of legend level.

*Orsos:* You can use *lesser restoration*, as the spell.

*Reikhardt:* You can grant an ally within 30 feet a second use

of an extraordinary or supernatural ability normally usable

only once per day. If you gain a second daily use of this ability,

you cannot use it twice in one day on the same ally.

*Sunyartra:* You can use *true strike*, as the spell, but only on

a single ally within 30 feet.

Faithful Companion (Ex): At 3rd level, you learn to place

yourself between an ally and harm. If you and an ally within

5 feet are both subject to an area spell or effect that allows

a Refl ex save for partial damage, you can grant your ally a bonus on her saving throw by taking a penalty of equivalent

magnitude on your own. The value of the bonus and penalty

can be any amount up to the value of your base Refl ex saving

throw. You must decide to invoke this ability

before either you or your ally has attempted

the saving throw.

Squire’s Burden, Greater (Su):

At 3rd level, you gain a new supernatural

ability you can use

once per day. It follows all the

guidelines for least squire’s

burden, above. If you choose,

you can forgo your daily use

of this ability for an extra

use of the least or lesser

squire’s burden.

*Dardallion:* You can

grant one ally within 30

feet the ability to move

through threatened areas

without provoking

attacks of opportunity

for 2 rounds. Other actions,

such as casting in

a threatened area, still

provoke attacks of opportunity

as normal.

*Imdastri:* You can

grant one ally within

30 feet immunity to one

of the following effects

for a number of rounds

equal to three times your

squire of legend level:

disease, exhaustion/

fatigue, mind-affecting

spells and abilities, negative

levels, or poison. You

choose the effect when you

activate this ability.

*Ktolemagne:* As a swift action, you

can take over concentrating to maintain an ally’s spell

or spell-like ability, allowing her to take other actions.

Once you have assumed control of an effect, you cannot

give it back.

*Orsos:* You can grant one ally within 30 feet energy resistance

10 to an energy type of your choice for a number of

rounds equal to three times your squire of legend level.

*Reikhardt:* When an ally within 30 feet of you uses an

extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural ability that affects

all allies within a given number of feet, you can use an

immediate action to extend its range and duration

by 50%.

*Sunyartra:* As an immediate action,

you can grant one ally within 30 feet the

opportunity to reroll an attack roll or

critical hit confi rmation roll.

PLAYING A SQUIRE OF LEGEND

You follow in the footsteps

of a legend, but you embrace

your legendary hero’s inf

luence to a lesser degree

than some others do. You

don’t honor your hero any

less than your comrades

do—you simply choose

not to devote your entire

life to following that person’s

example. You are

more firmly devoted to

the notion that a true

hero aids her comrades

rather than seeking glory

for herself. Whether you

accompany a Disciple of

Legend or simply team up

with an ally for adventuring,

your primary concern

is to ensure that your heroic

comrade survives to complete

the task at hand. You

are content with a smaller

share of fame and glory; it

is enough to know that your

comrade could not have succeeded

without you.

The Disciples of Legend accord you respect, but not to

the same degree as they do the mythic exemplars. They

honor the assistance you provide and your commitment

to the precepts of the Six from Shadow, but even they—like

so many others—tend to give more credit to the f lashier

heroes and underestimate the contributions of those

who stand behind. So far this attitude has not disturbed you unduly, since you have been content with your own

contributions, but someday you might become one of those

few squires who have quit the organization in disgust.

Combat

Becoming a squire of legend does not fundamentally change

what you are. The benefi ts you can gain from this prestige

class are somewhat limited because of its short progression,

so your combat tactics depend largely on your levels in other

classes. Thus, if you’re a heavy fi ghter, you should still stand

in the front line, and if you’re a wizard, you should still cast

from the rear.

Even so, however, you realize perhaps better than most

that adventuring and combat are group activities. Your

class abilities are designed to aid your comrades, bolstering

them in battle, granting them new or improved tactical

options, or simply helping them survive. Thus, you must

stay close to your allies so that your gifts are available on

a moment’s notice.

Advancement

You are slightly less fanatical about the Six from Shadow than

those who strive to become mythic exemplars. You respect

them well enough, but you prefer to follow their example in

a general sense, rather than specifi cally. You have also come

to realize that while those worthies are the best known of

all the brave souls who fought the Mad God’s cult, their victory

would have been impossible without the assistance of

the hundreds of unnamed and unremembered heroes who

died beside them.

Though you are still a member of the Disciples of Legend,

you sometimes choose to go off on your own and offer your

assistance to other allies. You do not chase glory; rather, you

seek out situations in which your talents can do the most

good. The Disciples of Legend offer you additional training

and access to written records of the Six from Shadow, but

given your limited advancement possibilities within the

organization, these benefi ts might not be enough to entice

you to stay for the rest of your career.

Resources

The Disciples of Legend have few resources to offer beyond

a research library and moral support. When it comes to

monetary or magical acquisitions, you’re on your own.

Mikolai Laziros (see page 89) and his squire, Ezria Birrinsdottir,

She must decide to invoke this ability before either has

rolled the save.

**Grant Ally Energy Resistance (Su)** Once per day, as a swift

action, Birrinsdottir can grant one ally within 30 feet

resistance 10 against a chosen energy type for 9 rounds.

NPC SQUIRES OF LEGEND

NPC squires of legend probably seem like a dream come true

to PCs playing under DMs who allow the Leadership feat. But

be careful about allowing a mythic exemplar PC to “acquire” an

NPC squire permanently. In general, the Disciples of Legend

encourage squires to work with mythic exemplars, but they are

more likely to assign an NPC squire on a mission-by-mission

basis only. That way, the PC doesn’t get a squire of legend

permanently for the cost of one feat.
