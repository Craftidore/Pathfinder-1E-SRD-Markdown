# Shadowspy (PrC)
## Overview
*“Perhaps you see it as a curse that I must deny myself the light of the*

*Shining One so that his enemies might be exposed and destroyed.*

*But it is my honor and duty to make such a sacrifi ce, and in truth,*

*I see the gifts of the Shining One as proof that I am still within his*

*sight, despite the shadows that cling to me.”*

—Saera, Shadow Knight of Pelor

Shadowspies are the covert arm of Pelor’s Shadow Guard (see

page 75). Members of this subsect work individually or in

small groups to locate hidden sources of evil. Although they

often lead double lives, masquerading as normal folk who

are simply trying to get by, shadowspies never forget their

duty to their deity, to their church, and to the multitude of

innocents who unknowingly depend on them.

BECOMING A SHADOWSPY

Only priests and paladins of Pelor with the proper skills and

demeanor are permitted to join the shadowspies. The vast

majority of shadowspies are drawn from the shadowstrikers

(page 108), though it is not unheard of for ordinary priests of

Pelor to be inducted as shadowspies. Clerics or paladins with

levels in bard, monk, ranger, or rogue are ideal candidates

because they have the stealthy skills to use the shadows as a

tool against the forces of darkness.

CLASS FEATURES

The abilities you gain as a shadowspy of Pelor allow you to

seek out sources of wickedness that are all too often hidden

from view. You gain the ability to blend into the throngs

around you, create shadows to mask your presence by

manipulating light, make your thoughts impossible to read,

and force even the most corrupt persons to speak the truth

in your presence.

Spellcasting: At each even-numbered level, you gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the

prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a

shadowspy, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Aura of Anonymity (Su): You leave few impressions upon

those you meet, and even fewer upon those unexceptional

souls you pass in the street. When you are walking in a crowd

of ten or more individuals, you gain a divine bonus equal to

your shadowspy level on Disguise and Hide checks.

Radiance of Pelor (Su): Pelor has granted you the power

to enhance sources of light so that they shine as brightly as

the sun. As a swift action, you can augment any or all light

sources within 60 feet (including torches, lamps, lanterns,

and campfi res, as well as objects that are the target of a *light*

spell and magic weapons that glow). The range of any light

source so affected doubles, and the effect lasts a number of

hours equal to your shadowspy level, or until the light source

is extinguished, whichever occurs fi rst. This ability can be

used a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifi

er (minimum once).

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level and every 3rd level thereafter,

you can select a bonus feat for which you meet the prerequisites

from the following list: Acrobatic, Alertness, Athletic,

Combat Casting, Deceitful, Extra Turning, Improved Turning,

Investigator, Good Devotion (see page 58), Persuasive,

Stealthy.

Immunity to Blindness (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you

cannot be blinded by magical effects, spells, or bright light.

Physical barriers to sight, such as blindfolds and solid objects,

still prevent you from seeing. Additionally, any wounds that

cause the destruction of your eyes still blind you.

Veil of Pelor (Sp): When you attain 3rd level, your motives

and morality become almost impossible to determine. As an

immediate action, you can use *undetectable alignment*, as the

spell (caster level equals your character level). This ability

is usable at will.

Personal Eclipse (Su): Beginning at 4th level, you can

manipulate the direction and intensity of light. By redirecting

and dimming ambient illumination, you can cast shadows

around your body to better conceal your presence. Doing

so grants you a circumstance bonus equal to one-half your

shadowspy level on Hide checks. This ability can be used at

will but is effective only in areas where light is present.

Truth of the Light (Sp): When you attain 6th level,

creatures in your company fi nd it diffi cult to tell deliberate

untruths. At will, you can use *zone of truth*, as the spell (caster

level equals your character level). You can use this ability a

number of times per day equal to your shadowspy level.

Blinding Light (Su): At 7th level, you learn to blind nearby

foes with a brief but intense fl ash of light. Twice per day, you

can project a beam of light from your palm in a cone-shaped

burst with a range of 15 feet. Any creature in the area that

fails a Refl ex save (DC 10 + shadowspy level + Wis modifi er)

is blinded for 1d6 rounds. Sightless creatures are not affected

by this ability.

Sun’s Revelation (Su): At 8th level, you become adept

at detecting untruths spoken in your presence. At will,

you can use *discern lies*, as the spell (caster level equals your

character level).

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): Beginning at 9th level, you

can use the Hide skill even while being observed, as long

as you are in a sunlit location. See the ranger class feature

(*PH* 48).

Vision of Pelor (Su): At 10th level, you can see through

even the most potent illusions. Three times per day, you can

use *true seeing* at will, as the spell (caster level equals your

character level).

PLAYING A SHADOWSPY

Unlike shadowstrikers, you are understated and subdued,

and you often work alone. Though you felt a bit lonely on

your missions at fi rst, you came to realize that Pelor watches over you constantly, whether or not the shadows mask you

from mortal sight.

To succeed as a shadowspy, you must be entirely self-reliant.

Unlike the shadowstrikers, you have no cell to fall back on for

support, and you can’t call upon the church for aid unless the

circumstances are particularly dire. The self-reliance you have

gained out of necessity might make you seem smug to others,

but you prefer quiet confi dence to vociferous bombast.

Combat

Fighting toe-to-toe is for shadowstrikers. You rarely enter

combat unless it is on your own terms. Like so many of

your enemies, you depend on the shadows to hide your

movements and provide you with ample opportunities for

ambush and evasion. Your assigned tasks rarely involve

direct confrontation, though you are more than capable of

defending yourself as long as the confl ict is not protracted.

You prefer, however, to strike quickly and from hiding,

then slip away before your enemies can retaliate. Given the

opportunity, you like to prepare an exit corridor by seeding it

with snares, traps, and bolt holes from which you can launch

ambushes. Doing so allows you to send groups of enemies

scrambling in the wrong direction while you double back

to make your escape.

Sample Encounter

Shadowspies are seldom seen unless they wish to be. Typically,

they work alone or in pairs to investigate reports of evil acts in

the cities and towns where temples of Pelor and Heironeous

are located. Accomplished shadowspies travel far and wide

in the name of Pelor, often infi ltrating enemy nations for the

purpose of divining the intentions of their leaders.

EL 14: Saera is a young half-elf who began her life as a petty

thief and con artist. Some years later, a wandering cleric of

Pelor showed her the error of her ways, and she joined the

priesthood. Her roguish skills were not lost on the church

elders, and she was eventually inducted into a shadowstriker

cell. But although she found that work fulfi lling, Saera was a

perpetual loner, and she yearned to work on her own terms.

Noting her skill and determination, her superiors soon

recruited her as a shadowspy.
