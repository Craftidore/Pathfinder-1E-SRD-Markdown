# Ghost-Faced Killer (PrC)
## Overview
From out of nothing the specter of death appears, an

armored shadow with a brilliant blade held high. In a

fl ash the katana falls, severing life from limb in a bloody

arc. All around, screams of terror and shouts of fear

erupt, as quaking hands draw blades to fi ght the masked

murderer. His target dead, the ghost-faced killer walks

calmly away as swords and fi sts pass harmlessly through

his nearly transparent body.

Long ago, a persecuted clan of dangerous warriors

sought a way to take revenge against their oppressors.

Through sorcery, the spellcasters of the clan beseeched

dark spirits to reveal a way that their clan might survive

the coming strife and take revenge on the emperor

who sought to crush them. The clan members struck a

dark bargain, and the demon-spirits they had contacted

provided the clan with a means to the bloody ends they

desired. Donning terrifying masks to hide their identities,

warriors of the clan crept into the imperial palace, and

through the evil power of the pact they had made, passed

invisibly and intangibly into the imperial household and murdered the entire imperial family, plunging the country

into bloody civil war once again. No one ever discovered

the clan’s honorless actions, and to this day, no one knows

what clan the ghost-faced killers came from.

Today ghostfaced

killers act

as assassins and

spies for hire, a

mercenary clan

that hides behind

a guise of open

and honorable conduct.

When on a

mission, they wear

porcelain demonmasks

of ghostly white

to hide their identities

and as a symbol of the

pact their clan made

with the demon-spirits.

Through training

and discipline, ghost-faced

killers learn the deadliest and

most terrifying ways to attack foes,

and through their mystic connection

with spirits, ghost-faced

killers learn to turn invisible,

walk through walls, and even see

with the eyes of the spirits themselves.

Most ghost-faced killers begin

their careers as rangers

or rogues, though ninjas are

also common. Fighters are only

slightly less common. Few monks,

barbarians, or members of spellcasting

classes choose to become

ghost-faced killers, but such characters

are not unknown.

NPC ghost-faced killers are

members of the Ghost-Faced

Killer clan of ninjas. This clan

disguises itself as a normal samurai clan,

loyal to the empire but unworthy of notice. Most of the

time a ghost-faced killer simply pursues his responsibilities

to the clan and the emperor, but when called by

money or the clan daimyo the ghost-faced killer dons the

mask that means death for his enemies.

Adaptation: Although the ghost-faced killers are

described as a clan of samurai and ninjas, the class can

easily lose these aspects of its flavor and become a group

of assassins. When introduced as a force for good, the

ghost-faced killer prestige class could be used to represent

a clan of investigators or spies serving a good-aligned

nation or faction.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following

are features of the

ghost-faced killer

prestige class.

Weapon and

Armor Proficiency:

Ghost-faced killers are proficient with all simple and

martial weapons, and with light armor.

Ghost Step (Su): A ghost-faced killer can become

invisible for 1 round once per day. Using this ability is a

swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions,

page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A

ghost-faced killer can use this ability one additional time per day for every three class levels gained above 1st (2/day

at 4th level, 3/day at 7th level, and 4/day at 10th level).

At 6th level, a ghost-faced killer can become ethereal

when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible.

Sudden Strike (Ex): If a ghost-faced killer of 2nd level

or higher can catch an opponent when she is unable to

defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike

a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ghost-faced

killer’s target is denied her Dexterity bonus to Armor

Class (if any) against his attack, the ghost-faced killer

deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with his attack. The

bonus damage increases by 1d6 every three levels (+2d6 at

5th level, +3d6 at 8th level). This ability otherwise works

like the ninja ability described on page 8.

Frightful Attack (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a ghostfaced

killer can panic onlookers and even frighten his

victim to death by making a sudden strike attack. Once

per day, a ghost-faced killer can designate a melee sudden

strike attack as a frightful attack. The ghost-faced killer

must use his Power Attack feat on the attack and must

take a penalty of at least –1 to his attack roll. If the attack

deals damage to the target, the victim must make a Will

save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer’s class level + ghost-faced

killer’s Cha modifier). If the victim succeeds, she is

shaken for 1 round per class level of the ghost-faced killer;

if she fails, she instantly dies of fear. Creatures immune

to mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with Hit

Dice that exceed the ghost-faced killer’s character level

are immune to this frightful attack.

In addition, all creatures within 30 feet who see the

frightful attack (not including the victim, the ghost-faced

killer, or the ghost-faced killer’s allies) become panicked

(if their Hit Dice are less than the ghost-faced killer’s

class level + his Cha modifier) or shaken (if their Hit

Dice equal or exceed the ghost-faced killer’s class level

+ Cha modifier) for 1 round per class level of the ghostfaced

killer. A successful Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced

killer’s class level + ghost-faced killer’s Cha modifier +

damage bonus from Power Attack on the frightful attack)

negates this effect.

A ghost-faced killer can use this ability one additional

time per day for every three levels gained above 3rd (2/day

at 6th level, 3/day at 9th level).

Ghost Sight (Su): Starting at 7th level, a ghost-faced

killer can see ethereal and invisible creatures and objects

as easily as he sees material creatures and objects.

Frightful Cleave (Su): If a 10th-level ghost-faced

killer slays a foe with his frightful attack (either from

the damage dealt or because of a failed save against its

fear effect), he gets an immediate extra melee attack

against another target within reach. If the new target

is flat-footed, this extra attack is also a frightful attack,

though it doesn’t count against the ghost-faced killer’s

daily limit of frightful attacks. This ability otherwise

functions exactly as the Cleave feat (see page 92 of the

*Player’s Handbook*.)

SAMPLE GHOST-FACED KILLER

tracks), Tumble +11; DodgeB, Improved InitiativeB,

Iron WillB, Mobility, Power AttackB, Spring Attack,

Weapon Focus (greatsword), Weapon Specialization

(greatsword).

*Language:* Common.

Evasion (Ex): If Qeng Yi is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Frightful Attack (Su): Once per day, Qeng Yi can

designate a melee sudden strike attack as a frightful

attack. He must use his Power Attack feat and take an

attack roll penalty of at least –1. If the attack deals damage

to the target, the victim must make a DC 12 Will save.

If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 3 rounds; if she

fails, she instantly dies of fear. Creatures immune to

mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with 10 Hit

Dice or more are immune to Qeng Yi’s frightful attack.

All other creatures within 30 feet who see the frightful

attack (not including Qeng Yi or his allies) become

panicked (if of 1 Hit Die or less) or shaken (if of 2 Hit

Dice or more) for 3 rounds (Will negates, DC 12 + damage

bonus from Power Attack).

Ghost Step (Su): Qeng Yi can become invisible for 1

round once per day. This is a swift action that does not

provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and

Immediate Actions, page 137).

Sneak Attack (Ex): Qeng Yi deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Qeng

Yi can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Sudden Strike (Ex): Qeng Yi deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against a target that

has been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This

extra damage stacks with extra damage from a sneak

attack, so Qeng Yi deals an extra 2d6 points of damage

against flat-footed foes, but only an extra 1d6 points of

damage against flanked foes. See page 8 for details.

Trapfinding (Ex): Qeng Yi can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.

*Possessions: +2 studded leather, +1 greatsword,* masterwork

composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), 20 arrows, 10 silver

arrows, *gauntlets of ogre power, cloak of resistance +1,* 2 *potions*

*of invisibility.*
