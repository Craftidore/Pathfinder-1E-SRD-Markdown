# Geometer (PrC)
## Overview
Runes, glyphs, sigils, and symbols hold great magical power.

The geometer is the master of written magic and spells

inscribed within a perfectly rendered diagram. While other

spellcasters must record their spells in pages upon pages

of cryptic formulae, the geometer knows that every spell

has a perfect geometrical design, a fi gure whose angles and

intersections hint at the secrets hidden in the structure of

the multiverse.

Geometers are almost always wizards. Many specialize

in the school of abjuration, since spells of arcane geometry

are often among the most potent magical defenses available.

Sorcerers and bards do not prepare spells, and therefore rarely

qualify for the class. In any event, they lack the meticulous

and studious inclination to perform magic by scribing

painstaking diagrams.

NPCs who take up the geometer class frequently hold

meetings in which numerous members of the profession can

expound on their latest projects and inform others of their

new theories concerning the nature of geometry.

Adaptation: While this prestige class describes a geometer

independent of any location, an interesting idea in any

campaign that contains a geometer would be the inclusion

of a location where a powerful glyph is permanently

inscribed in a cliff face or at a mountain’s base (or apex). This

special glyph, perhaps called the Perfect Geometry, would

be important to geometers who learn of it, granting them

some additional spell knowledge or versatility with their

spells (perhaps, once the Perfect Geometry is visited and

traced by a geometer, that geometer learns to cast one more

glyph-related spell per day).

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To qualify to become a geometer, a character must fulfi ll all

the following criteria.

Skills: Decipher Script 9 ranks, Disable Device 4 ranks,

Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, Search 4 ranks.

Feat: Scribe Scroll.

Spells: Able to prepare and cast 3rd-level arcane spells.

Class Skills

The geometer’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int),

Disable Device (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually)

(Int), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the geometer prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Geometers gain no

profi ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a geometer

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as

if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to

which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He

does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that

class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes

gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting

class before becoming a geometer, he must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Glyph of Warding: A geometer

adds *glyph of warding* to his spellbook

as a 3rd-level arcane spell.

He can prepare and cast the

spell just like any other spell

he knows.

Spellglyph (Su): A spellglyph

is an arcane diagram that

substitutes for a specifi c spell’s

verbal and material components

(if any). When a geometer casts

a prepared spell in conjunction

with a spellglyph scribed for that

spell, he can cast the spell as if it were

affected by the Silent Spell feat. The spellglyph

replaces any material components

(other than a focus) normally required

by the spell.

A geometer chooses at the time of

casting whether to use a spellglyph. An

expended spellglyph disappears, just like

any other material component.

Spellglyphs are normally scribed on

parchment, much like scrolls. Preparing a

spellglyph requires 1 hour and the use of rare

inks costing 25 gp per spell level. If the

spell normally requires an expensive

material component (with a value of

more than 1 gp), exotic inks and treatments

of equal cost must be used in the

preparation of the spellglyph.

Book of Geometry (Ex): At 2nd level and

higher, a geometer uses a unique system for

recording the details of a spell that drastically

reduces the expense of maintaining spellbooks. Every

spell he learns from now on requires only a single page in

his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to scribe a spell into a

spellbook and materials costing 100 gp per page.

A geometer’s spellbook is diffi cult for nongeometers to

decipher and use. The Spellcraft DC to decipher or prepare

spells from a geometer’s spellbook is increased by 5 for

nongeometers (see page 178 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

Sigilsight (Ex): A geometer of 3rd level or higher can

use a Search check to find magic traps based on runes,

glyphs, sigils, symbols, and other writings as a rogue

can. He gains a bonus equal to his caster level on all

Search checks to find traps of this sort. A geometer who

merely comes within 10 feet of a magic rune, glyph, sigil,

or symbol, or the threshold of danger for such a device,

is entitled to make a Search check as if he were actively

searching for a magic trap.

Pass Sigil (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a geometer can

temporarily negate magical wards based on written symbols,

sigils, runes, or glyphs. As a standard action, a geometer can

attempt to pass such a sigil. He must succeed on a level check

(DC 6 + the sigil creator’s caster level). If successful, he can

suppress the effects of the device for as long as he maintains

concentration (which might make it possible for others

to pass the sigil safely, too). A geometer must be able to

see the device to be passed.

Powerful Spellglyph (Ex): When a 5th-level

geometer prepares a spellglyph for a spell, he

knows how to strengthen the spell beyond its

normal effects. His caster level is treated as 1

higher for any spell he casts with the use of a

spellglyph.

Greater Glyph of Warding: A 5th-level geometer

adds *greater glyph of warding* to his spellbook as a

6th-level arcane spell. He can prepare and

cast the spell just like any other spell

he knows.

searching for magic traps), Spellcraft +17, Spot +3; Combat

*Languages:* Auran, Aquan, Common, Draconic, Elven,

Giant, Goblin.

Contingency: Filas has an active *contingency* spell. If he

is attacked in melee, a *mirror image* spell activates, creating

1d4+3 images.

Powerful Spellglyph (Ex): The caster level of any spells

Filas casts using spellglyphs increases by 1.

Book of Geometry (Ex): Every spell Filas learns requires

only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to

write a spell into a spellbook and materials costing 100 gp

per page.

In addition, the Spellcraft DC for a nongeometer to decipher

or prepare spells from Filas’s spellbook is increased by

5 (see page 178 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep

effects. A half-elf is considered an elf for all effects related to

race.

Pass Sigil (Su): Filas can temporarily negate magical

wards based on written symbols, sigils, runes, or glyphs. As

a standard action, he can make a level check (DC 6 + the sigil

creator’s caster level). If successful, he can suppress the effects

of the device for as long as he maintains concentration. Filas

must be able to see the device to be passed.

Sigilsight (Ex): Filas can use a Search check to fi nd magic

traps based on runes, glyphs, sigils, symbols, and other writings

as a rogue can. He gains a +11 bonus on Search checks to

fi nd traps of this sort. A geometer who merely comes within 10

feet of a magic rune, glyph, sigil, or symbol, or the threshold

of danger for such a device, is entitled to make a Search check

as if he were actively searching for a magic trap.

Spellglyph (Su): Filas can cast spells using spellglyphs.

Such spells have a special material component (the spellglyph)

that substitutes for the spell’s verbal and other material

components. When Filas casts a spell using a spellglyph, the

spell is treated as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat.

*Wizard Spells Prepared* (caster level 11th; prohibited schools
