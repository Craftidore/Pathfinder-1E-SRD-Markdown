# Geomancer (PrC)
## Overview
The cleric reaches out to a higher power. The wizard trusts

only in eldritch tomes. The druid looks to nature for her

spells. To the geomancer, however, all magic is the same.

Geomancy is the art of channeling magical energy from

many sources through the land itself. A geomancer may

research like a wizard, pray like a cleric, or sing like a bard,

but he casts spells as only a geomancer can. In the area he

calls home (be it high on a mountain, deep in a forest, or

even beneath an ocean) he weaves ley lines—powerful

connections to the land itself. The spells he casts through

these connections with the earth are refl ections of his own

strength of will. As the geomancer progresses, however, the

effort of gathering magic through the earth takes a physical

toll on him, making him more and more like the land and

its creatures.

Only characters with more than one spellcasting class

can become geomancers. The most popular combinations

are druid/sorcerer and druid/wizard. Clerics with arcane

spellcasting ability can also qualify; those with access to

the Plant or Animal domain are the most likely to consider

this path. A bard or a ranger who picks up a second, more

focused spellcasting class can also adopt this lifestyle.

Adaptation: This prestige class is easy to customize

by making the spellcasting requirements more specifi c if

you’re looking for particular combinations. And a good way

to incorporate the fl avor of your world into this class is to

create drift choices that mimic the creatures prevalent in

your campaign.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS SKILLS

The geomancer’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (any) (Int),

Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge

(arcana) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge

(nature) (Int), Scry (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and

Swim (Str). See Chapter 4 of the *Player’s Handbook* for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each

Level: 4 + Int modifi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are

class features of the geomancer

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Geomancers gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known:

At each geomancer level, the character

gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also

gained a level in a spellcasting class to

which he belonged before adding the

prestige class. He does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character

of that class would have gained

(additional wild shape options,

metamagic or item creation feats,

or the like). Since the character

had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a

geomancer, the player must

decide to which class to add each

geomancer level for determining

spells per day and spells known.

Spell Versatility: At 1st level, the

geomancer learns to blend divine

and arcane magic. He still

acquires and prepares his spells

in the normal manner for his

individual spellcasting classes.

When he casts them, however,

he can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of

his classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any

spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell versatility

score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast any of

his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with no chance

of arcane spell failure from armor. (The druidic prohibition

against metal armor still applies to druid/geomancers, however,

since this stricture

stems from a spiritual

oath rather than a practical

limitation.) The geomancer

may use his Wisdom

modifi er to set the save

DC for arcane spells, or

his Charisma or Intelligence

modifi er (whichever

he would normally use for

arcane spells) to set the save DC

for divine spells. If a spell requires

either an arcane material component

or a divine focus, he may use either. A

cleric/geomancer who also has levels of

wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously

convert any prepared arcane or

divine spell (except a domain spell) of

an appropriate level into a *cure* or *infl ict*

spell of equal or lower level, though he

must be capable of casting the latter as

a cleric.

Drift: The character slowly becomes

closer to nature. At each geomancer

level, choose a drift from the appropriate

stage (see Drift, below).

Ley Lines: At 2nd level, the geomancer

learns to create magical connections

with a specifi c type of terrain. Choose one

of the following terrain types: aquatic, desert,

forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that

terrain, the geomancer’s effective caster

level for all spells increases by +1. At 6th

level and again at 10th level, the character

may either choose a new terrain in which

to receive the benefi t (at +1), or increase his effective caster level in a previously chosen terrain by an

additional +1.

Drift

Drift is a gradual devolution into some other natural form.

Those who experience this phenomenon gain attributes of

animals and plants as time goes by. Geomancers experience

drift at every level. As a variant rule, high-level druids who

spend all their lives away from civilization may also experience

drift at the Dungeon Master’s discretion—perhaps

once every ten years.

Drift is divided into stages. You must choose one drift

from stage 1 the fi rst time you experience the phenomenon.

Your second drift must also be from stage 1. Thereafter, you

may choose from a higher stage only after you have acquired

at least two drifts from the previous stage. For example, a

stage 4 drift may be chosen only after you have at least two

stage 1 drifts, two stage 2 drifts, and two stage 3 drifts. You

may, however, choose drifts from stages below your maximum

whenever you wish. For example, you if you have two

stage 1 drifts, you may choose a third stage 1 rather than a

stage 2, if desired.

Stage 1 drifts have no game effect. Each drift of stage

2 and beyond grants a permanent extraordinary ability.

Natural attacks allow for Strength bonuses on damage rolls,

except in the case of poison and acid. The damage values

given for natural attacks are for Medium creatures. To adjust

for Small or Large creatures, use the following table.

**Natural Weapon Damage by Size**

**Small Medium Large**

1d2 1d3 1d4

1d3 1d4 1d6

1d4 1d6 1d8

progressive damage, such as that from wounding or

*decomposition* (see Chapter 7), affects you is halved.

Your eyes become as sharp as a rat’s. (You gain low-light

vision.)

Your skin adapts like that of an octopus. (You can change

color to blend with your surroundings, gaining a +4

attack for 1d6 points of damage.)

Thorns grow on your body. (Your unarmed attacks do

piercing damage, and those striking you with natural

weapons take 1d3 points of piercing damage per

successful hit.)

You can constrict like a snake. (You deal 1d3 points of

damage with a successful grapple check against a

creature of your size category or smaller.)

You can trip like a wolf. (If you hit with a natural attack,

you can attempt to trip your target as a free action; see

the Wolf entry, page 283 of the *Monster Manual*.)

You can rage similar to a wolverine. (If you take damage,

you rage as a 1st-level barbarian—see Barbarian entry, page 25 of the *Player’s Handbook*—or gain +1

effective level of any class you have that grants rage as

a class feature, but only for determining the benefi ts

of rage.)

attach to an opponent with a successful bite and

infl ict 1d3 points of damage per round until unattached.

However, you lose your Dexterity bonus to

AC while attached.)

You can fi re an ink cloud as a squid does. (In water, you

can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet on a side

once per minute as a free action; this provides total

concealment and those within the cloud suffer the

effects of total darkness.)

Your nose becomes as sensitive as a hound’s. You gain

scent out to a range of 30-ft. Scent is described on

page 314 of the *Monster Manual*.

Stage 5

You grow a unicorn horn. (You gain a +4 bonus on Fortitude

saves against poison and a gore attack for 1d8

a standard action.)

You are as graceful as a pixie. (You gain a +2 bonus on

Refl ex saves.)

You gain the tremorsense of an earthworm. (You can

sense anything in contact with the ground within

30 feet of you.)

Your canine teeth exude poison. (If you hit with a bite

+ 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifi

er) against poison. Initial damage is 1d2 points of

take a charge action to move ten times your normal

level is 14th in forests.

Scent (Ex): Rendala can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Spell Versatility 8: When Rendela casts spells, he can

mix or match spellcasting parameters from cleric and wizard

to gain the maximum possible advantage for any spell. If a
