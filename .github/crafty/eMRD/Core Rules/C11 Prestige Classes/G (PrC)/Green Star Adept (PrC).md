# Green Star Adept (PrC)
## Overview
Once each generation, the comet Alhazarde—the legendary

Green Star—visits the night skies, a portent of great and

terrible events. Beneath its emerald light, kings rise or fall,

weird monsters and magical plagues appear to scour the

land, and strange and ancient secrets are revealed. Glorious

and sinister auroras glimmer in the dusk for weeks on end,

and from time to time shooting stars of burning emerald fall

from the sky. These fallen stars are the only known source

of starmetal, a rare and precious ore infused with mighty

magical power.

A Green Star adept is the master of the strange and

powerful magic derived from Alhazarde’s glittering green

starmetal. He travels the land, searching for more of the

comet’s fallen substance and mastering its eldritch power.

Turning his back on the traditional studies of the sorcerer or

wizard, he slowly transforms into a living statue of starmetal,

gaining immortality and invulnerability at the cost of his

own fl esh. At each appearance of the comet, only a handful

of adepts can complete the rites necessary to achieve this

transformation.

Sorcerers and wizards are most capable of understanding

the strange arcana of the mystic comet. Of the two, wizards

are more likely to master the astrological calculations and

meticulous observations required to divine the secrets of

the Green Star. Some Green Star adepts, however, come from

entirely different origins, having picked up the necessary

arcane knowledge along the way. Such rare individuals might

be learned monks or warlocks, sinister rogue/sorcerers, or

any other character diligent enough to learn the secrets of

the comet Alhazarde.

All Green Star adepts are bitter rivals, since all who follow

the path are in constant competition for the rare and precious

starmetal required for the transformation. NPC Green Star

adepts never work with each other, often going to great

lengths to keep other adepts from learning about news of

starmetal fi nds.

Adaptation: It would be easy to postulate that the base

material from which the prestige class derives its name is

some other substance, even without changing the abilities

derived from the material in any way. Thus, a practitioner of

this prestige class could instead take his powers from quartz,

jade, sapphire, iron, black iron, steel, or some other substance

known for (among other things) solidity.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Features

All the following are class features of

the Green Star adept prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency:

Green Star adepts gain profi ciency

with simple weapons. They gain no

profi ciency with armor or shields.

Spells per Day/Spells Known:

At every even-numbered level, a

Green Star adept gains new spells

per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if he had also gained a

level in an arcane spellcasting class

to which he belonged before adding the

prestige class level. He does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character of that

class would have gained (such as the bonus

feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before

becoming a Green Star adept, he must decide to which class

to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Damage Reduction (Ex): The starmetal infusion reinforces

the fl esh of a Green Star adept, making him resistant

to physical blows. He gains damage reduction

1/adamantine. Each level thereafter, his damage

reduction improves by 1, until by 10th level, he

has damage reduction 10/adamantine.

Improved Caster Level (Ex): A Green Star adept

adds his class level to his caster level in another arcane

spellcasting class to determine his effective spellcaster

level. If the character had more than one arcane

spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star

adept, the player must decide to which class

to add each adept level for this purpose.

For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level

Green Star adept’s caster level would be

9th, due to this ability, but he would

only have access to 4th-level spells

(5th-level wizard plus two arcane

spellcasting class levels from being

a 4th-level Green Star adept).

Starmetal Dependency (Ex):

A Green Star adept must consume

more starmetal to continue his transformation.

When he gains a level in this

class beyond 1st, he does not gain any of

the class features for that level until he

performs a special ritual that requires 24

hours, 1 pound of starmetal, and other

arcane reagents and materials costing 1,000

gp. A Green Star adept’s base attack bonus,

saving throws, skills, and feats or ability

score increases are not dependent on this

ritual—he fails to gain the special class

abilities only until he completes the ritual.

See page 141 for a description of starmetal as

a new special material.

Starmetal Rigor (Ex): At 1st level, a Green Star adept’s

process of transformation has already begun. His fl esh

takes on a faint emerald hue, and it becomes denser and

stronger as the starmetal infusion takes hold. A 1st-level

adept’s Strength score increases by 1, but his Dexterity score

drops by 1 (to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus

also improves by 1.

When an adept reaches 4th level, his Strength and his

natural armor bonus improve by an additional 1 point.

At 7th level, an adept’s Strength increases by 2 more, for

a total increase of +4, while his Dexterity is reduced by 1

(to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus improves by

another 2 points, for a total bonus of +4.

At 10th level, an adept’s Strength score increases by

2 more points (total increase of +6) and his Dexterity is

reduced by 1 (total reduction of –3, to a minimum of 3).

His natural armor bonus improves by another 2 points, for

a total bonus of +6.

Natural Attack (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a Green

Star adept has fl esh so dense that his unarmed strikes deal

substantial damage. He gains a slam attack that deals bludgeoning

damage equal to a club sized for the character (1d4

for Small adepts, 1d6 for Medium adepts, or 1d8 for Large

adepts), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifi er.

Unnatural Metabolism (Ex): When an adept reaches

2nd level, his starmetal infusion begins to radically alter his

metabolism. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, and necromancy effects.

At 5th level, a Green Star adept’s bonus on saving throws

against the attack forms listed above increases to +4. At 8th

level, the save bonus increases to +6.

Fortifi cation (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a Green

Star adept has resistance to attacks that affect other living

creatures. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on

the character, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or

sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled

normally.

When an adept reaches 6th level, this ability improves,

increasing the chance of negating a critical hit or sneak attack

to 50%. At 9th level, a Green Star adept has a 75% chance to

negate a critical hit or sneak attack.

Otherworldly Vision (Ex): At 4th level, a Green Star

adept gains darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Null Metabolism (Ex): When a Green Star adept reaches

7th level, his transformation approaches completion. He no

longer needs to breathe, eat, or sleep. He has immunity to

inhaled poisons, drowning, suffocation, and sleep effects

(although he still must rest 8 hours in order to regain spells).

In addition, an adept of 7th level or higher is no longer

subject to fatigue or exhaustion and ignores the effects of

these conditions.

Emerald Perfection (Ex): At 10th level, a Green Star

adept completes his transformation. He resembles a perfectly

sculpted statue of himself, forged from green starmetal. His

type changes to construct, which brings about the following

alterations to his basic nature:

—An adept loses his Constitution score and any hit point

adjustment for Constitution. However, he gains bonus hit

points based on his size: +10 hit points for Small, +20 hit

points for Medium, or +30 hit points for Large.

—Unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept has no

special immunity to mind-affecting effects. He is essentially

a human mind in a magically animated body.

—He gains immunity to poison, paralysis, stunning,

disease, extra damage from sneak attacks, death effects, and

necromancy effects.

—He no longer heals damage on his own, and receives

no benefi t from spells or effects that heal living creatures.

However, he can repair himself by means of *repair damage*

spells (see page 120) or his rapid repair ability (see below).

—He is no longer subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain.

—He gains immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects, or is harmless.

—He is no longer at risk of death from massive damage,

but he is immediately destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

However, unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept can

be returned from the dead by any means that would have

worked on him before his fi nal transformation.

—He no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and

cannot be magically aged. He cannot die of old age and might

exist in this form for eons.

Rapid Repair (Ex): A 10th-level Green Star adept repairs

1 point of damage per hour of rest, as long he has at least 1

hit point. Rapid repair does not allow a Green Star adept to

regrow or reattach lost body parts.
