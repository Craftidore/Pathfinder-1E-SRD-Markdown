# Prophet of Erthaol (PrC)
## Overview
The prophet of Erathaol is a seer and visionary, a medium of the

heavenly will, pronouncing judgment on corruption and evil in

the world, speaking words of comfort to the oppressed and

downtrodden, and announcing the work of the archons in the

world. She channels celestial spirits and allows them to use her

body for their purposes on the Material Plane. Insofar as these

celestials have knowledge of future events, the prophet may

speak authoritatively about events to come, but her primary

focus is on changing the present world into a better world for

the future, a place where law and good might reign supreme.

Most prophets of Erathaol are clerics, either servants of a

lawful good deity such as Heironeous or Moradin or proponents

of lawful good ideals without particular attention to a specific

deity. However, the gift of prophecy is notoriously

indiscriminate, and members of all spellcasting classes occasionally

find themselves speaking on behalf of the heavens.

Prophets of Erathaol are not the oracles that people consult

when they want to know whether to launch a business enterprise,

start a war, or win someone’s favor—too often prophets

give answers that people don’t really want to hear. Lawful good

kings do sometimes take on prophets as advisors, but even the

most well-intentioned ruler has a hard time following a true

prophet’s advice all the time. Most prophets, with no one seeking

out their words, make themselves a nuisance in palaces, in

marketplaces, or on city streets, proclaiming celestial judgment

to whoever listens.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the prophet of

Erathaol prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Prophets of Erathaol gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Ecstasy (Su): Once per day per class

level, a prophet of Erathaol can enter an

ecstatic state, allowing a celestial to seize

control of her mind

and speech. This is

sort of a lesser version

of channeling

celestials (as

described in Chapter

2), in which the

prophet simply becomes

helpless for 1

round while a celestial

speaks through her. What

the celestial says (and who

it is) is entirely up to the DM,

though it is always at least tangentially

relevant to whatever matter is

at hand. As a rule of thumb, this ability

can have one of the following effects:

• any Knowledge check (with a bonus

equal to the prophet’s character

level +5)

• a bardic knowledge check

(with a bonus equal to the

prophet’s character level +5)

• a divination spell

• a detect evil spell

• an enthrall spell (the prophet can continue speaking on her

own after the 1 round of ecstasy, continuing the effect)

• a good hope spell

• an atonement spell

• like a phylactery of faithfulness, allowing the prophet to identify

evil creatures and avoid evil acts

• if the prophet sacrifices 500 XP, a commune spell

Unfortunately, at the instant a prophet of Erathaol cedes control

of her mind and invites a celestial to take it, she is vulnerable

to possession by less beneficent spirits. If a fiend or ghost

capable of possession is

in ethereal form, within

30 feet of the prophet,

and not flat-footed when

a prophet enters her

ecstasy, the creature can attempt

to possess her immediately.

The prophet takes a –2

penalty on her Will save to resist

the possession, and if she fails she

is not aware of the creature’s presence

in her body. The creature prevents

a celestial from entering, and

might pretend to be the celestial, speaking as

the prophet’s companions expect. If the creature

chooses not to make its presence known in this

way, it seems as though the ecstasy simply fails.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd

level, and at each level thereafter, a prophet

of Erathaol gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had

also gained a level in a spellcasting class

she belonged to before adding the prestige

class. She does not, however, gain

any other benefit a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of

turning or destroying undead, metamagic

or item creation feats, and so on),

except for an increased effective level of

spellcasting. If a character had more

than one spellcasting class before

becoming a prophet of Erathaol, she

must decide to which class she

adds each prophet level for

the purpose of determining

spells per day.
