# Nightsong Enforcer (PrC)
## Overview
Throughout the city, even the vilest assassin does not

command more respect than the nightsong enforcers.

They could be anywhere—they could strike at any time.

You cannot escape their uncanny senses. And worst of

all, they often work in elite teams.

The enforcers of the Nightsong Guild (see page 177)

focus on the stealth-centered combat training that

rogues usually learn; they forgo some of the sleight of

hand or fast-talking aspects of being a thief. However,

nightsong enforcers are not mere thugs. They are deadly

opponents who strike from hidden positions and move

silently behind their foes. When in battle, their goal

is to eliminate their enemies, not to fight. Thus, they

strike quickly from the shadows. They do not worry

about honor or fighting fair, scoffing at such ideals as

childish.

Rogues most often become nightsong enforcers,

although bards, fighters, and urban rangers are also

known to undertake the class. On occasion a wizard or

sorcerer will endure the intensive training required to

join the enforcers’ ranks.

When working with others, a nightsong enforcer is the

linchpin. She is the very picture of fidelity when it comes

to supporting teammates on a mission. It is common for

an enforcer to lead a team composed of not only other

enforcers, but fighters, spellcasters, or rogues.

Adaptation: Although described here as associated with

the Nightsong Guild, the nightsong enforcer prestige class

could have many different uses in a campaign. Enforcers

could represent the members of an elite criminal organization,

a well-funded private security force, or a highly

trained branch of a nation’s military. Emphasizing their

training and group tactics can greatly shape an encounter

or a character based around this prestige class.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the nightsong

enforcer prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Nightsong enforcers

are not proficient with any weapon. They are proficient

with light armor but not with shields.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A nightsong enforcer deals an

extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent

or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity

bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only

if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at

4th level, 3d6 points at 7th level, and 4d6 points at 10th

level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*. If a nightsong enforcer gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the

bonuses on damage stack.

Teamwork (Ex): Nightsong enforcers are trained

to keep a close eye on teammates on a joint mission. A

nightsong enforcer gains a +20 circumstance bonus on

Listen and Spot checks to hear and see allies.

At 9th level, a nightsong enforcer’s senses are honed

so finely that she is aware of the location and status (as

with the *status* spell) of all allies within 100 feet, even if

they are not within sight.

Agility Training (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a nightsong

enforcer reduces the armor check penalty imposed

on her by light armor by 2 (to a minimum of 0).

Skill Teamwork (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a

nightsong enforcer can use her training to improve the

skill of those around her. All allies within 30 feet of the

nightsong enforcer gain a +2 competence bonus on Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Listen, Move Silently,

and Spot checks. Allies must be able to see the nightsong

enforcer to gain this bonus.

At 7th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Flanking Teamwork (Ex): When a nightsong enforcer

of 5th level or higher flanks an opponent, the enforcer

and all other allies who threaten the same opponent gain

a +1 circumstance bonus on their attack rolls (in addition

to the normal flanking bonus, if it applies).

Opportunist (Ex): Once per round, a nightsong

enforcer of 6th level or higher can make an attack of

opportunity against an opponent who has just been

injured in melee by another character. See the rogue

class feature, page 51 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If a nightsong enforcer

of 8th level or higher is exposed to any effect that

normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw and half damage if the saving throw

fails.

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet

away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra
