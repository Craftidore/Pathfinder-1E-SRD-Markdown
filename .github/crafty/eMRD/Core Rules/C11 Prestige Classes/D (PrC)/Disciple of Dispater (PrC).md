# Disciple of Dispater (PrC)
## Overview
“Locked in an iron fortress within an iron city in the festering iron

pit of Dis, Lord Dispater is master of all he surveys!”

—Ustyhrin-ja

The disciple of Dispater is a warlike general of evil. He is

defensive-minded and eager to have others fight for him.

When he must fight, he does so on his terms and on his

chosen battleground. Disciples of Dispater verge on paranoia

and are thus distrustful of everyone. They have mystical

power over iron that allows them to grant themselves

even greater abilities in battle.

Fighters, rangers, and rogues become disciples of Dispater,

and clerics affiliated with the archdevil also adopt the

class. They are mighty soldiers, dealing terrible damage with

their iron swords or axes.

Disciples of Dispater have few true allies, although they frequently

employ mercenaries and other underlings. All disciples

of Dispater have some sort of headquarters that they

make as defensible as they can. High-level disciples of the

archdevil command great fortresses and their own armies.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Dispater

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Dispater

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Device Lore (Ex): A disciple of Dispater can find traps

made mostly of metal just as a rogue can. Furthermore, he

gains a +2 competency bonus on Disable Device checks

against devices made mostly of metal.

Iron Hews (Su): Once per day per point of Constitution

bonus, a 2nd-level disciple of Dispater may add a +3 divine

bonus on damage from attacks made that round.

Rusting Grasp (Sp): Once per day, a 3rd-level disciple of

Dispater can produce an effect identical to that of the rusting

grasp spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Iron Power (Ex): When using an iron or steel weapon, a

4th-level disciple of Dispater gains a +1 insight bonus on

attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, his threat range is

doubled as if he were using a keen weapon. At 8th level, the

insight bonus improves to +2, and the threat range triples.

This ability does not stack with the keen weapon quality, but

it does stack with the Improved Critical feat.

Summon Erinyes (Sp): A 5th-level disciple of Dispater can

summon 1 erinyes once per day. This functions as a summon

monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster. A 9th-level disciple

of Dispater can summon 1d4 erinyes once per day.

Greater Iron Hews (Su): Once per day per point of

Constitution bonus, a 6th-level disciple of Dispater may add

a +6 divine bonus on damage from attacks made that round.

While this bonus does not stack with the iron hews ability,

the abilities are separate: A disciple of Dispater with a

Constitution bonus of +3 can use each ability three times

per day.

Ironskin (Sp): Once per day, a 7th-level disciple of Dispater

can produce an effect identical to that of the stoneskin

spell cast by a 15th-level caster upon himself only.

Iron Body (Sp): Once per day, a 10th-level disciple of Dispater

can produce an effect identical to that of an iron body

spell cast by an 18th-level caster.
