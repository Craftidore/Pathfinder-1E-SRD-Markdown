# Divine Oracle (PrC)
## Overview
Some people call them mad, and certainly some divine

oracles are driven insane by the visions they see. Some

people doubt their words; indeed, some divine oracles are

destined never to be believed. Wherever the deities are

known to speak to mortals, some mortals hear their voices

with a unique clarity and gain insight into the past, the present,

and the future by virtue of their unusual status. Divine

oracles are such mortals, blessed—or cursed—by visions

from their deities.

All divine oracles are spellcasters, and most were clerics

or druids before adopting the divine oracle prestige class.

Whatever their other classes, all divine oracles share a

particular devotion to the Divination school of magic,

having mastered all available means to catch glimpses of

the future.

NPC divine oracles often live in out-of-the-way places,

though usually close enough to civilization

that people with pressing questions about

the future can seek them out to have their

questions answered. They frequently

inhabit sacred shrines or ancient temples

and rarely take an active part in

world affairs.

Adaptation:

The divine oracle is

designed to work

well with both

arcane and divine

spellcasters; the idea

behind the class is that

you’re getting divine guidance

that manifests itself in a

number of ways. But it doesn’t

have to be that way. By adjusting

the requirements, you could push the

class in an arcane or divine direction. It’s

also easy to add a requirement that

limits it to worshipers of a deity of

time, fate, or divination.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a

divine oracle, a character

must fulfi ll the

following criteria.

Skill: Knowledge

(religion) 8 ranks.

Feat: Skill Focus

(Knowledge \[religion]).

Spells: Able to cast at

least 2 divination spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The divine oracle’s class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See

Chapter 4 of the *Player’s Handbook* for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of

the divine oracle prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Divine oracles gain no weapon or armor

profi ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A divine

oracle continues advancing in spellcasting

ability as well as gaining the abilities of her

new class. Thus, when a new divine oracle level

is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained

a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to

before she added the prestige class. She does not, however,

gain any other benefi t a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This

essentially means that she adds the level of divine

oracle to the level of whatever other spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day

accordingly. For example, if Cassandra, a 10th-level

cleric, gains a level as a divine oracle, she gains new

spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a cleric, but

uses the other divine oracle aspects of level progression

such as base attack bonus and save bonuses. If she

next gains a level as a cleric, making her an 11th-level

cleric/1st-level divine oracle, she gains spells as if she

had risen to 12th level as a cleric.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class

before she became a divine oracle, the player must

decide which class to assign each level of divine oracle

for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Oracle Domain: Upon adopting the divine oracle class,

the character gains access to the Oracle domain, described

in Chapter 7: Domains and Spells. The character gains the

granted power associated with the domain (+2 caster level

for divination spells), and can choose the spells in that

domain as her daily domain spells.

Scry Bonus (Su): A divine oracle adds a +1 sacred bonus

to the save DC of all her divination (scrying) spells.

Prescient Sense (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, if a divine

oracle makes a successful Refl ex saving throw against an

attack that normally infl icts half damage on a successful

save (such as a red dragon’s fi ery breath or a fi reball spell),

she instead takes no damage, since her prescience allowed

her to get out of the way faster. This form of evasion works

no matter what armor the divine oracle wears, unlike the

evasion ability used by monks and rogues.

Trap Sense (Ex): At 2nd level, the divine oracle gains an

intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving

her a +1 bonus on Refl ex saves made to avoid traps and a +1

dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. This increases

to +2 at level 5 and +3 at level 8.

Divination Enhancement (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level,

a divine oracle may roll twice and take the better result

when using divination spells such as *augury* or *divination*.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a divine

oracle gains the ability to react to danger before her senses

would normally allow her to do so. The divine oracle retains

her Dexterity modifi er to AC (if any) regardless of being

caught fl at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She

still loses her Dexterity modifi er to AC if immobilized.)

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level and

higher, the divine oracle can no longer be fl anked, since she

can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as

she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues

the ability to use fl ank attacks to sneak attack the divine

oracle. The exception to this defense is when an attacker has

at least 4 more rogue levels than the target has divine oracle

levels.

If a character already has levels of a class that could

gain uncanny dodge, the levels from the classes that grant

uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a

rogue must be to fl ank the character.

Immune to Surprise (Ex): At 10th level, the divine

oracle’s sensitivity to danger is so great that she is never

surprised. She can always take a standard action during

a surprise round, unless she is physically restrained from

doing so. If there is no surprise round then this ability

doesn’t help.
