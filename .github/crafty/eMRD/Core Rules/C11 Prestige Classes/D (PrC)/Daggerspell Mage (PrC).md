# Daggerspell Mage (PrC)
## Overview
In a reclusive monastery in the heart of an ancient

forest, a varied group of druids and arcane spellcasters

train together. The adherents of this monastery work

to perfect a unique fighting and spellcasting style that

relies on wielding a pair of daggers at all times. Some of

these students—known as daggerspell mages—blend

the fighting style with arcane magic.

Daggerspell mages see the quick movements of their

deadly daggers as an attendant part of their spellcasting.

These sometimes reclusive figures remain spellcasters

first and melee combatants second. Daggerspell mages,

like their colleagues the daggerspell shapers, seek truth

and justice, but they define such concepts in the heat of

the moment. Daggerspell mages do not see morality as

an absolute, and their ideals are guided by their sense of

what is right and fair.

Daggerspell mages are closely related to the daggerspell

shapers, the other half of the organization known as the

Daggerspell Guardians (see page 167). Both preserve the

work of good folk and balance the concerns of civilized

communities against the sanctity of nature, but where

a shaper is quiet and calculating, a daggerspell mage is

wild and impulsive. The two halves of the organization

work together amicably, but they have decidedly different

approaches to most problems.

Almost every daggerspell mage begins his career as a

wizard or sorcerer, taking a level or two of rogue after a

few successful adventures. Drawn to the exotic fighting

style and balanced ideas of the Daggerspell Guardians,

these individuals enjoy the enigmatic reputation and

unorthodox techniques of the guild. Although members

of the guild are primarily spellcasters, some follow more

complicated multiclass pathways that include fighter or

paladin levels. These characters follow all precepts of the

guild, but they are more likely to defend truth with the

sharp points of their daggers than with the arcane power

of their spells.

Adaptation: Although daggerspell shapers and

daggerspell mages are related through their common

organization, they need not be used together in every campaign. The mages, well suited for wizard/rogues of

any alignment, could become a deadly group of daggerand

spell-wielding cultists.

Furthermore, in a campaign that includes psionics,

the daggerspell mage makes an excellent class for psion/

rogues. Simply change the arcane spellcasting requirement

and progression to a similar psionic manifester

level requirement and progression, and the daggerspell

psion, the third branch of the Daggerspell Guardians, is

ready for your campaign.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the daggerspell

mage prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Daggerspell mages

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Daggercast (Ex): Daggerspell mages seamlessly blend

the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting

abilities. A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic

and material components even when holding a dagger in

each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than

a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell

with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in

this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally.

In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch

spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or

a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).

Invocation of the Knife (Su): Beginning at 2nd level,

daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection

between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers

that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an

arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of

the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage

rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not

apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This

power does not affect a creature’s ability to resist the

affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.

Using this ability does not require an action; its use is

part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only

spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified

by this ability.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level,

a daggerspell mage gains new spells per day at each level

(and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a

level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged

before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however,

gain any other benefit a character of that class would have

gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a daggerspell mage, he must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell

mage deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when

flanking an opponent or at any time when the target

would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage

applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30

feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points

at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the

*Player’s Handbook.* If a daggerspell mage gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the

bonuses on damage stack.

Double Daggercast (Ex): As a daggerspell mage advances

in level, the connection between his spellcasting

abilities and his two-dagger fighting style strengthens.

At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for

one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his

hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch

spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers

leaves the daggerspell mage’s hands, the spell immediately

discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown

by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).

Arcane Infusion (Su): At 7th level and higher, a

daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his

daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy

damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared

arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell

slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell

mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and

an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability

is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for

a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed.

Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don’t

stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the

dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that

attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates.

Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate

Actions, page 137).

Arcane Throw (Ex): At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell

mage can imbue arcane spell power into his

thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with

a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack.

If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the

creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended

target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next

turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page

225 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*) and retains the spell

just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.

Daggerspell Flurry (Ex): A 10th-level daggerspell

mage can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks.

When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken

one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing

this has no effect on the spell’s effective level. A daggerspell

mage must make at least one melee attack in any

round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make

an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if

a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an

attack roll, he can still make the spell’s attack).

A daggerspell mage can use this ability a number of times

per day equal to his Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).

Arcane Infusion (Su): Vadamar can infuse arcane

spellpower into his daggers, temporarily allowing them

to deal extra energy damage. To use this ability, Vadamar

must lose a prepared arcane spell from memory. He

chooses one dagger that he is holding and a specific

energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability is

activated, and the chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for

a number of rounds equal to the spell level lost. Multiple

uses of this ability on the same dagger don’t stack, even if

different energy types are chosen. If the dagger is thrown,

the energy damage applies to that attack, but then the

effect immediately dissipates. Using this ability is a swift

action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Daggercast (Ex): Vadamar can cast a spell with somatic

and material components even when holding a dagger

in each hand. If he holds anything other than a dagger,

he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with

somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this

way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally.

In addition, Vadamar can deliver a touch spell with a

dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal

melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).

Double Daggercast (Ex): Vadamar can hold the charge

of one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in

his hands. He must designate which dagger holds each

touch spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these

daggers leaves Vadamar’s hands, the spell immediately

discharges harmlessly.

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic sleep effects.

An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or

concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it

as if he were actively looking for it.

Evasion (Ex): If Vadamar is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Familiar: Vadamar’s familiar is a toad named Berkich.

The familiar uses the better of its own and Vadamar’s base

save bonuses. The creature’s abilities and characteristics

are summarized below.

Familiar Benefits: Vadamar gains special benefits

from having a familiar. Berkich grants him +3 hit points

(included in Vadamar’s statistics). Berkich and Vadamar

enjoy the empathic link and share spells special qualities.

*Alertness (Ex):* Berkich grants its master Alertness as

long as it is within 5 feet.

*Empathic Link (Su):* Vadamar can communicate telepathically

with his familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile.

The master has the same connection to an item or a place

that the familiar does.

*Share Spells (Su):* Vadamar can have any spell he casts on

himself also affect Berkich if the latter is within 5 feet at

the time. He can also cast a spell a target of “You” on his

familiar.

Invocation of the Knife (Su): Whenever Vadamar

casts an arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn

half of the damage that the spell deals into magic slashing

damage rather than energy damage. Energy resistance

does not apply to the magic slashing damage caused by an

affected spell, but damage reduction might. This power

does not affect the target’s ability to resist the affected

spell with a saving throw or spell resistance. Using this

ability does not require an action; its use is part of the

action required to cast the affected spell. Only spells of

instantaneous duration can be modified by this ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Vadamar deals an extra 3d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet

away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Vadamar can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with

his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed

for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapfinding (Ex): Vadamar can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.
