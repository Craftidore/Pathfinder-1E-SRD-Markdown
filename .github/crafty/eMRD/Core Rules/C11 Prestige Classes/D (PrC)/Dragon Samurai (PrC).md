# Dragon Samurai (PrC)
## Overview
Dragon samurai are dedicated warriors, members of

a special, self-selected class who revere dragonkind

and emulate dragons’ ferocious martial abilities

to the point of taking on some draconic

traits. Unlike noble samurai, who are born to

their role and into a system of allegiance,

dragon samurai are made, not born. Sometimes,

orthodox samurai fall out of the

system and find their way into a dragon clan

(see below), but more often, those previously unfettered

with allegiance swear fealty

to a chosen dragon clan. It is then

that they begin their training in

the arts of draconic warfare and discipline.

Each dragon samurai is bound to a single dragon clan, of

which there are ten. Five good dragon clans are each devoted

to a kind of metallic dragon, and five evil dragon clans are

each devoted to a kind of chromatic dragon.

Dragon samurai adhere to their own unique *bushido* (a

samurai’s code of honor). However, they swear loyalty and

obedience to a clan, not to a lord. If a dragon samurai remains

true to her *bushido*, in time the fires of the dragon awaken

within her.

Martial classes of all types can apply for membership in

dragon clans. Basically, anyone with an abiding interest in or

reverence for dragons may eventually qualify for clan membership.

If the dragon’s roar is as a song to one’s ears, she should consider

becoming a dragon samurai.

NPC dragon samurai are solid, stalwart warriors of their clans.

They advance the clan’s secret agendas, which can be as simple as

a quick commission or as grand as an all-consuming crusade.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the dragon samurai prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Dragon samurai gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Dragon Breath (Su): A dragon samurai can use a breath weapon

once per day as a standard action. The type of breath weapon

depends on the color of the dragon samurai’s clan, as noted below.

The breath weapon deals 1d8 points of damage per class level.

The Reflex save DC for the breath weapon is 10 + the dragon

samurai’s class level + the dragon samurai’s Con modifier.

If a dragon samurai already has a breath weapon of the same type,

the damage stacks. For example, if a half-dragon character has a

breath weapon dealing 6d8 points of damage once per day, and

gains a breath weapon of the same type that deals 2d8 points of

damage for being a 2nd-level dragon samurai, her damage increases

to 8d8. She still gets to use her breath weapon only once per day.

**Color Energy Breath Weapon\***

Black acid 60-ft. line of acid

Blue electricity 60-ft. line of lightning

Green acid 30-ft. cone of corrosive (acid) gas

Red fire 30-ft. cone of fire

White cold 30-ft. cone of cold

Brass fire 60-ft. line of fire

Bronze electricity 60-ft. line of lightning

Copper acid 60-ft. line of acid

Gold fire 30-ft. cone of fire

Silver cold 30-ft. cone of cold

\*Breath weapon sizes given here are for Medium creatures. For creatures

of other sizes, see the Dragon Breath Weapons table on page

69 of the *Monster Manual*.

Resistance to Energy (Su): A dragon samurai gains resistance

5 against attacks involving the same energy type as the

character’s breath weapon (for example, acid for a green dragon

samurai). At 5th level, the resistance improves to 10. At 7th level

it improves to 15, and at 10th level it becomes 20.

Dragon Friend (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a dragon samurai

gets a +4 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-based checks

when dealing with dragons of his clan’s color.

Immune to Dragon Fear (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a dragon

samurai is immune to fear effects from a dragon of her clan’s color.

Elemental Weapon (Su): Starting at 4th level, a dragon samurai

can endow a melee weapon with elemental energy while she

wields it in battle. This energy is of the same type as her breath

weapon. Causing a weapon or weapons to gain this feature is a

free action. At 4th level, the melee weapon deals an extra 1d6

points of energy damage, and this extra damage increases to 2d6

at 9th level. This extra damage does stack with any energy damage

the weapon may already deal.

Dragon Ride (Ex): Starting at 6th level, a dragon samurai gets

a +4 bonus on all Ride checks while riding a dragon.

Blind-Fight: At 8th level, a dragon samurai gains Blind-Fight

as a bonus feat. If the character already has the feat, she can

choose a different one.
