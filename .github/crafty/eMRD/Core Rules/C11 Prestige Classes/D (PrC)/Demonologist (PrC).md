# Demonologist (PrC)
## Overview
A demonologist is a mortal who has devoted his life to the

study of demons. He is practiced in dealing with them,

fighting them, and using them for his own gain. He even

gains some demon abilities due to his studies and devotion

to the fiends of the Abyss. Demonologists are always evil,

although they might not think of themselves as such. No

character can get so close to the mind of utter corruption

and come away unchanged.

Most demonologists were once wizards or sorcerers,

although bards who delve into evil lore also frequently meet

the requirements of the class.

Demonologists see themselves as researchers and keepers

of lore that most people cannot handle. Thus, they often

sequester themselves away in libraries of dark knowledge.

They attempt to deal with demons on an equal footing—an

extremely dangerous undertaking—and rarely interact

with mortals. When demonologists see the need, they

emerge from their studies and use their dark powers to take

or do what they want; then they return to their books and

summoning circles. PCs might come into conflict with a

demonologist who is after some rare bit of lore or a magic

item that they possess. Or the characters might need the

help of a demonologist if they are planning to fight demons

and need aid or information.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the demonologist prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Demonologists are proficient with no

weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: Beginning at 1st level, a

demonologist gains the ability to cast

a small number of arcane spells. To cast

a spell, the demonologist must have a

Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell’s

level, so a demonologist with a Charisma

of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Demonologist bonus spells are based

on Charisma, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 +

spell level + Charisma modifier. The demonologist’s

spell list appears below; a demonologist has access

to any spell on the list and need not prepare those spells

ahead of time, just like a sorcerer. A demonologist casts

spells just as a sorcerer does.

Charm Demon (Sp): A 1st-level demonologist can attempt

to charm a chaotic evil outsider, as described in the charm

person spell, once per day. The demon does not get to use its

spell resistance, though it can make a saving throw as

normal (DC 11 + demonologist’s Cha modifier).

Quasit Familiar (Ex): A 2nd-level demonologist gains a

quasit as a familiar, whether he wants it or not. If the demonologist

already has a familiar, the quasit devours it and takes

its place, but the character suffers no experience point loss.

The quasit is treated as a normal familiar, using the class

level of the demonologist as the master’s level (see the

Familiars section in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook for

familiar abilities).

Summoning Mastery (Su): When a demonologist

of 3rd level or higher casts a summon monster spell, it is

treated as the equivalent

spell of two levels higher

for purposes of summoning

chaotic evil creatures.

For example, a demonologist

refers to the summon

monster IV list for chaotic

evil outsiders when casting

summon monster II. At 6th level, the

demonologist refers to the summoning

list three levels

higher than the one for the

summon monster spell he is

casting. At 9th level, the

demonologist refers to the list

four levels higher.

Resistances (Su): A demonologist

who reaches 4th

level gains acid resistance 10,

cold resistance 10, fire resistance

10, and electricity resistance

20.

Poison Immunity (Ex): A 5thlevel

demonologist is immune to

poison.

Hold Demon (Sp): A 7th-level

demonologist can attempt to hold a

chaotic evil outsider, as described in

the hold person spell, once per day. The

demon does not get to use its spell

resistance, though it can make a

saving throw as normal (DC 12 +

demonologist’s Cha modifier).

Telepathy (Su): An 8th-level

demonologist can communicate telepathically

with any creature within

100 feet that has a language, just as a

tanar’ri can.

Dominate Demon (Sp): A 10th-level demonologist

can attempt to dominate a chaotic evil outsider, as described

in the dominate person spell, once per day. The demon does

not get its spell resistance, but it can make a saving throw as

normal (DC 15 + demonologist’s Cha modifier).

Demonologist Spell List

Demonologists choose their spells from the following list.

1st Level: bane, demonflesh, doom, protection from evil, protection

from good, spores of the vrock, summon monster I, unnerving

gaze.

2nd Level: bestow curse, dance of ruin. demoncall, magic circle

against evil, magic circle against good, protection from elements,
