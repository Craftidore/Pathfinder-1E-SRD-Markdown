# Dread Pirate (PrC)
## Overview
Thugs and cutthroats in every port lay claim to the title

“pirate,” but actually making a fortune through piracy is

no easy task. A dread pirate, however, has mastered every

aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network of contacts

tells him when a particularly valuable cargo is shipping

out. After a flawless ambush at sea, he swings aboard

the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand. Once he and

his shipmates have overpowered the prize vessel’s crew,

they liberate the cargo and make their escape. Later, the

dread pirate meets representatives from the black market

in an isolated cove and sells his newly acquired cargo for

a handsome profit.

Some dread pirates accomplish their goals through fear,

killing indiscriminately and ruling their ships at rapierpoint.

Others minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious

sort of chivalry, perhaps realizing that the captain and

crew of a prize ship are more likely to surrender if they

believe they will live to see port again. Now and then a

dread pirate takes his chivalric streak a step farther and

preys only on the ships of enemy nations—or even solely

on other pirates.

A dread pirate’s lifestyle is ideal for most rogues,

because the job requires a number of skills that other

classes don’t have the time or inclination to learn. However,

the class also attracts some spellcasters, who can

use magic to conceal their ships or incapacitate a prize

vessel’s crew.

Adaptation: The dread pirate prestige class can be used

to represent any powerful individual with great nautical

skill. A famous admiral and a ruthless but honest privateer

might not differ in abilities, but they will certainly

differ in outlook and demeanor.

Hit Die: d8.

To qualify to become a dread pirate, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Swim 4 ranks, Use Rope 4 ranks.

Feats: Quick Draw, Weapon Finesse.

Special: The character must own a ship worth at least

10,000 gp. The method of acquisition—purchase, force

of arms, or skullduggery—makes no difference, as long

as he can freely operate it on the high seas.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the dread pirate

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Dread pirates are

proficient with all simple weapons, with light martial

weapons, and with the rapier. Dread pirates are proficient

with light armor but not with shields.

Seamanship (Ex): A dread pirate adds his class level as

an insight bonus on all Profession (sailor) checks. Allies

within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight

bonus equal to half this number on their Profession

(sailor) checks.

Two-Weapon Fighting: A dread pirate wearing light

or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting

feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the

feat.

Fearsome Reputation (Ex): By the time he attains

2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on

the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to

cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding

undue bloodshed, honoring flags of truce, and the like)

or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire

treatment of prisoners).

An honorable dread pirate gains a +2 circumstance

bonus on Diplomacy checks, while a dishonorable one

gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks.

This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at 10th

level. In addition, a dread pirate gains other abilities at

higher levels based on his chosen reputation.

A dread pirate’s actual activities or alignment need

not match his reputation. However, a radical shift away

from his reputation might negate or even reverse that

reputation at the DM’s option. Also, a dread pirate in

disguise does not gain any effect granted by his reputation

(including the special abilities described below that

depend on the dread pirate’s reputation).

Rally the Crew (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, an honorable

dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to

great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration

grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack

rolls and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally

must be able to see or hear the dread pirate. The effect

requires a free action to activate and lasts for 1 minute

per class level, even if the dread

pirate moves out of range or

loses consciousness. This is a

mind-affecting ability.

At 7th level, a dread pirate

can use this ability twice

per day, and the bonus increases

to +2.

If a dread pirate has

the inspire courage

bardic music

ability, he can add

the morale bonus

gained from that

ability to the morale

bonus gained from

this ability to determine

the total morale

bonus granted. For

example, an 8th-level

bard/3rd-level dread

pirate would provide

a +3 morale bonus on

attack rolls and weapon

damage rolls.

Sneak Attack (Ex):

Beginning at 3rd level,

a dishonorable dread

pirate deals an extra

1d6 points of damage

when fl anking an opponent or at any time when the target

would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage

applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30

feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the *Player’s*

*Handbook*. The amount of extra damage dealt increases

to 2d6 at 7th level. If a dishonorable dread pirate gets a

sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels

of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.

Acrobatic Charge (Ex): A dread pirate of 4th level or

higher can charge over diffi cult terrain that normally

slows movement or through the squares occupied by

allies blocking his path. This ability enables him to charge

across a cluttered ship’s deck, leap down from a higher

deck, or swing between two adjacent ships to get to his

target. Depending on the circumstances, he might still

need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble,

or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over

the terrain.

Steady Stance (Ex): At 4th level and higher,

a dread pirate remains stable on his feet when

others have diffi culty standing. He

is not considered fl at-footed while

balancing or climbing, and he

adds his class level as a bonus

on Balance or Climb checks to

remain balancing or climbing

when he takes damage.

Luck of the Wind (Ex):

Once per day, an honorable dread

pirate of 5th level or higher can

reroll any failed attack roll, skill

check, ability check, or saving throw.

He must take the result of the

reroll, even if it’s worse than the

original roll.

Scourge of the Seas (Ex): Starting

at 5th level, a dishonorable dread

pirate can instill fear into his enemies.

When the character uses Intimidate

to demoralize foes, the attempt

affects all enemies

within 30 feet who can see

and hear him, and the effect lasts

for a number of rounds equal to

his Charisma modifi er (minimum 1

round). Multiple uses of this ability

don’t stack. This is a mind-affecting

ability.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 8th

level, a dread pirate becomes

supremely confi dent of his mobility.

He has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump,

and Tumble to the extent that he can take 10 with them

even under stress.

Fight to the Death (Ex): At 9th level and higher, an

honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies to carry

on against tremendous odds. Each ally affected by the

dread pirate’s rally the crew ability (see above) also gains

temporary hit points equal to 10 + the dread pirate’s Cha

bonus (minimum 10), gains a dodge bonus to Armor

Class equal to the dread pirate’s Cha bonus (minimum

+1), and is treated as having the Diehard feat even if he

doesn’t meet the prerequisites. These effects are lost if

the dread pirate loses consciousness.

Motivate the Scum (Ex): Once per day, a dishonorable

dread pirate of 9th level or higher can motivate his allies by killing a helpless individual. All allies of the dread

pirate who see the act gain a +2 morale bonus on damage

rolls. This effect lasts for 24 hours.

Most dishonorable dread pirates don’t care whether the

victim is a prisoner or one of their own crew. In fact, if

the slain individual is one of the dread pirate’s crew, the

morale bonus on damage rolls improves to +4, but the

allies also take a –2 penalty on Will saves for the duration

of the effect.

Pirate King (Ex): A 10th-level dread pirate’s exploits

have become so legendary that great numbers of able

sailors are willing to sign on as his crew for no compensation

other than a share of the booty. Treat this ability

as the equivalent of the Leadership feat, except that only

followers (and no cohorts) are gained.

THE PIRATE CODE

Most pirate codes share a number of elements regarding the proper “etiquette” of piracy. Here are a few ideas that might be appropriate for your dread pirate’s personal code:

• Everyone shall obey all orders.

• Everyone shall have a vote in major decisions. (This point is not necessarily limited to honorable dread pirates.)

• Everyone shall have a share of captured food and drink.

• Booty will be shared out as follows: one share to each among the crew; one and one-half shares each to the first mate, master carpenter, and boatswain; and two shares to the captain. (Some honorable captains might accept a smaller share, but they will take no fewer than one and one-half shares.)

• Anyone not keeping his weapons clean and fit for an engagement shall be cut off from his share, and suffer other punishment as the captain deems fit.

• Anyone who strikes another among the crew shall receive forty lashes across his back.

• Anyone who attempts to desert or keep any secret from the company shall be marooned with one bottle of water and one weapon.

• Anyone who steals from a crewmate shall be marooned or run through. (The latter consequence is more appropriate for dishonorable dread pirates.)
