# Disciple of Baalzebul (PrC)
## Overview
“Lord of the Flies! Lord of the Lies! Baalzebul, with your sly skill,

your dark power—you are the master of my soul!”

—Israkahn the Liar

The disciple of Baalzebul is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. She is

more likely to kill a paladin while he sleeps than face him in

direct combat. She uses deceit and trickery to get what she

wants, betraying even her family or closest friends to

achieve her goals. Her abilities make her an astute prevaricator

and a sneaky backstabber, but she can wield her lord’s

powerful influence with everything from devils to flies if

she needs to.

Rogues, assassins, bards, and sometimes rangers become

disciples of Baalzebul. Clerics of evil also adopt the class

occasionally, if they are particularly taken with Baalzebul.

Disciples of Baalzebul rarely have allies. They use and

manipulate others but eventually betray them.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Baalzebul

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Baalzebul

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all

light armors, but no shields.

Tongue of the Devil (Ex): A disciple of

Baalzebul can speak with eloquence and

believability, even when telling boldfaced

lies, by using her cunning as

well as her charm. When making

Bluff checks, a disciple of Baalzebul

adds her Intelligence modifier as

well as her Charisma modifier to

determine her check result.

Sneak Attack: If a disciple of

Baalzebul of 2nd level or higher

can catch an opponent when

he is unable to defend himself

effectively from her

attack, she can strike a

vital spot for extra

damage. Basically, any

time the disciple’s

target would be denied

his Dexterity bonus to

AC (whether he actually

has a Dexterity bonus or

not), the disciple’s attack

deals +1d6 points of

damage. This extra

damage increases by

+1d6 points every

third level afterward

(+2d6 at 5th level,

+3d6 at 8th level).

Should the disciple score a critical hit with a sneak attack,

this extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a disciple of Baalzebul

can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead

of normal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals

normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack,

not even with the usual –4 penalty, because she must make

optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the

sneak attack.

A disciple of Baalzebul can only sneak attack

a living creatures with a discernible

anatomy—undead, constructs,

oozes, plants, and incorporeal

creatures lack vital areas to

attack. Additionally, any

creature immune to critical

hits is similarly immune

to sneak attacks.

Also, the disciple of

Baalzebul must be able

to see the target well

enough to pick out a vital

spot and must be able to

reach a vital spot. The disciple

cannot sneak attack

while striking at a creature

with concealment

or by striking the limbs

of a creature whose vitals

are beyond reach.

If a disciple of Baalzebul

gets a sneak attack bonus

from another source (such as

rogue levels), the bonuses to

damage stack.

Suggestion (Sp): Once

per day, a 3rd-level disciple

of Baalzebul can

produce an effect identical

to that of a suggestion

spell. The DC to resist the disciple’s entreaties is 10 + disciple’s

class level + disciple’s Cha bonus.

Summon Osyluth (Sp): A 4th-level disciple of Baalzebul

can summon 1 osyluth once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Insect Plague (Sp): Once per day, a 6th-level disciple of

Baalzebul can produce an effect identical to that of a insect

plague spell cast by a 15th-level spellcaster. The insects summoned

are always biting flies.

Beguiling Nature (Sp): Every other day, a 7th-level disciple

of Baalzebul can produce an effect identical to the mass

charm spell, with a Will save DC of 10 + disciple’s class level

+ disciple’s Cha bonus.

Summon Cornugon (Sp): A 9th-level disciple of Baalzebul

can summon 1 cornugon once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

King of Lies (Ex): A 10th-level disciple of Baalzebul

gains a +4 inherent bonus to Charisma.
