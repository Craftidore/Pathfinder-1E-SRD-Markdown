# Defender of Sealtiel (PrC)
## Overview
Sealtiel is the celestial paragon who serves as patron of

defenders—those who protect the weak from the depredations

of the strong, fight off the forces of evil when they assault the

good, and defend the ideals of goodness and truth

from evil deception and lies. His mortal

champions are the defenders of Sealtiel,

a knightly order sworn to uphold those

ideals. While the fists of Raziel take the

fight against evil onto evil’s home ground,

the defenders of Sealtiel remain at home,

guarding against evil’s counterassault.

Most defenders of Sealtiel are paladins,

fighters, and rangers. Occasionally clerics or

monks (often multiclass cleric/fighters or the

like) adopt the class as well, and even more

rarely, fighter/rogues take up Sealtiel’s

cause. Arcane spellcasters rarely

find the class appealing.

The wandering life of an adventurer does

not easily suit most defenders of Sealtiel,

who prefer to stay in civilized regions to

protect people. Sometimes, however, a

defender of Sealtiel takes on the role of

a bodyguard for an important or holy

person, and travels with that person

wherever necessity leads. Player

character defenders could easily fall

into that category, or feature

prominently in a campaign

that revolved around the

defense of a city or citadel.

NPC defenders are usually

found in sedentary roles such as

these.

Hit Die: d12.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the defender of Sealtiel

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:Defenders of Sealtiel gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Defensive Stance (Ex): When he needs to, a defender of

Sealtiel can become a stalwart bastion of defense. In this defensive

stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability,

but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He

gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance

bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.

The increase in Constitution increases the defender

of Sealtiel’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these

hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance

when the Constitution score drops back 4 points.

These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary

hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a

defender cannot use skills or abilities that would

require him to shift his position, such as

Move Silently or Jump. A defensive

stance lasts for a number of rounds equal

to 3 + the character’s (newly improved)

Constitution modifier. A defender may

end his defensive stance voluntarily

prior to this limit. At the end of the

defensive stance, the defender is

winded and takes a –2 penalty to

Strength for the duration of that

encounter. A defender can only

use his defensive stance a certain

number of times per day as determined

by his level. Using the defensive

stance takes no time itself, but a

defender can only do so during his

action. (A defender can’t, for example,

use the stance when struck down by an

arrow in order to get the extra hit points

from the increased Constitution.)

Shield of Faith (Sp): A defender of

Sealtiel can use shield of faith, as the

spell, three times per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.

Magic Circle (Su): A defender of

Sealtiel who is 2nd level or higher is constantly

surrounded by an effect that

duplicates the magic circle against evil spell

as cast by a cleric of his defender level.

Shield Other (Sp): A 2nd-level defender of Sealtiel

can use shield other, as the spell, once per day. His effective caster

level is his defender level.

Blood of the Martyr (Sp): A 4th-level defender of Sealtiel can

use blood of the martyr\*, as the spell, once per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.

Protective Aura (Sp): A 6th-level defender of Sealtiel can use

protective aura, as the spell, once per day. The effect overlaps

(does not stack with) his constant magic circle against evil. His

effective caster level is his defender level.

At 10th level, a defender can use this ability three times per

day.

Glory of the Martyr (Sp): An 8th-level defender of Sealtiel can

use glory of the martyr\*, as the spell, once per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.
