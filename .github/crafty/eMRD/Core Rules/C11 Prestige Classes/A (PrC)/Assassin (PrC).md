# Assassin (PrC)
## Overview
A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional

detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage,

bounty hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is

an artisan, and his medium is death. Trained in a variety

of killing techniques, assassins are among the most feared

classes.

While nearly any class is capable of becoming an

assassin, rogues suit the part more than any other, from

both an ability viewpoint and an ideological one. Though

they make excellent allies during combat, assassins excel

in more clandestine situations, and the best assassins are

the ones the victims never knew existed.

Role: Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing

companions as liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin’s

missions put him in the company of adventurers for

long stretches at a time, but few people are comfortable

trusting a professional assassin to watch their backs in

a fight, and are more likely to let the emotionless killer

scout ahead or help prepare ambushes.

Alignment: Due to its necessary selfishness and

callous indifference toward taking lives, the assassin

class attracts those with evil alignments more than any

others. Because the profession requires a degree of selfdiscipline,

chaotic characters are ill suited to becoming

these shadowy killers. Neutral characters sometimes

become assassins, frequently thinking of themselves as

simple professionals performing a job, yet the nature

of their duties inevitably pushes them toward an evil

alignment.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become an assassin, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Disguise 2 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks.

Special: The character must kill someone for no other

reason than to become an assassin.

Class Skills

The assassin’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy

(Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist

(Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis),

Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex),

Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

Skill Ranks at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the assassin

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Assassins are proficient

with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type),

dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and

short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but

not with shields.

Sneak Attack: This is exactly like the rogue ability of

the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6

every other level (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). If an assassin

gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses

on damage stack.

Death Attack (Ex): If an assassin studies his victim for 3

rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon

that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the

additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the

target (assassin’s choice). Studying the victim is a standard

action. The death attack fails if the target detects the

assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although

the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied

his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class or is f lanked). If the

victim of such a death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

the assassin’s class level + the assassin’s Int modifier) against

the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the

paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable

to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin.

If the victim’s saving throw succeeds, the attack is

just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has

completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the

death attack within the next 3 rounds.

If a death attack is attempted and fails (the

victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not

launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing

the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before

he can attempt another death attack.

Poison Use: Assassins are trained in the use of

poison and cannot accidentally poison themselves

when applying poison to a blade (see Poison, page 557).

Save Bonus against Poison: At 2nd level, the assassin

gains a +1 saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus

increase by +1 every two levels.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, an assassin cannot

be caught f lat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He

still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An

assassin with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus

to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action

against him.

If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a

different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny

dodge instead.

Hidden Weapons (Ex): At 4th level, an assassin becomes

a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his

assassin level to all Sleight of Hand skill checks made to

prevent others from noticing them.

True Death (Su): Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by

an assassin’s death attack becomes more difficult to bring

back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a

creature back from the dead using raise dead or similar

magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to

15 + the assassin’s level or the spell fails and the material

component is wasted. Casting remove curse the round

before attempting to bring the creature back from the

dead negates this chance. The DC of the remove curse is 10

+ the assassin’s level.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level and higher,

an assassin can no longer be f lanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the assassin by

f lanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more

rogue levels than the target has assassin levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another

class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge

stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to

f lank the character.

Quiet Death (Ex): At 6th level, whenever an assassin

kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise

round, he can also make a Stealth check, opposed by

Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them

from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those

nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a

few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): At 8th level, an assassin can use

the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as he is

within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide

himself from view in the open without having anything

to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his

own shadow.

Swift Death (Ex): At 9th level, once per day, an assassin

can make a death attack against a foe without studying the

foe beforehand. He must still sneak attack his foe using a

melee weapon that deals damage.

Angel of Death (Su): At 10th level, the assassin becomes

a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes

a successful death attack, he can cause the target’s body to

crumble to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection

(although true resurrection works as normal). The assassin

must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made.

If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against

the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect.

GM Note

*House Rule:* It is suggested that this prestige class be renamed to something else as there is already a base class (several actually) that are called assassin. Keeping the prestige class allows more flexible character creation and play and also permits regional variation (ie., the assassins of Greyhawk City might be very different from those of Ket.
