# Void Disciple (PrC)
## Overview
Of all the elemental forces that make up the universe, the

most powerful and the most diffi cult to control is the one

that lies between and joins the others: void. Void disciples

understand that everything in the world contains *all* the

basic elements, held together by the least tangible essence.

Void is like the silence between notes of music, giving

rhythm and shape to the whole. To those who understand

the relationship of void to all other things, and who have

the innate ability to personally perceive that relationship,

distance and form become inconsequential.

Void disciples begin their training as spellcasters, and

they continue to gain spellcasting ability as they rise in

level. They are generally students of a particular school or

adherents to particular faith or philosophy.

Like other spellcasters, NPC void disciples play the role

of wise elders or keepers of religious teachings and legends.

Those who have mastered the path of void are charged with

the task of listening across the world’s underlying stream of

void for the births of those who have an innate affi nity for

void, and supervising the training of these individuals as

they mature.

Adaptation: The void disciple prestige class represents a

wise master if not an outright hermit, so it’s a good choice

for more solitary characters. Any group of void disciples is

likely to be far-fl ung—and given their ability to scry on one

another, distance poses less of an organizational problem

than it otherwise would.

Hit Die: d6.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the void disciple.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Void disciples gain no

weapon or armor profi ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A void disciple continues

her magical training while mastering the powers of

void. At 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th level,

the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if she had also gained one level in a previous

spellcasting class. She does not, however, gain any other

benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item

creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one

spellcasting class in which she could cast 3rd-level spells

before becoming a void disciple, the player must decide to

which class to add each void disciple level for the purpose of

determining spells per day and spells known.

Sense Void (Su): The fi rst technique taught to the void

disciple is the ability to reach out with the mind and sense

the world around, exploring the unseen layer of reality

most people rarely experience. The void disciple’s consciousness

actually departs her body and extends into the

world, allowing her to use her normal senses (sight, hearing,

touch, taste, smell) to perceive whatever area, person,

or thing she directs her attention to. The void disciple must

make a Spellcraft check, with the DC determined by distance,

not familiarity.

**Distance DC**

Line of sight 5

Up to 1 mile (same village) 10

Up to 10 miles (same province) 15

Up to 100 miles (same clan’s territory) 20

Up to 1,000 miles (another clan’s territory) 25

A void disciple cannot sense across planar boundaries.

Thus, a void disciple standing on one side of a *gate* could not

extend her senses through it.

With every four levels a void disciple attains beyond

1st, she gains the ability to perceive deeper levels of reality.

At 5th level, a void disciple can use *detect magic*

and *detect evil* at will. At 9th level, she can use *discern*

*lies* and read emotional states, gaining a +10

bonus on Sense Motive checks. At 13th level, she

can *detect thoughts* at will.

A void disciple can use this ability once per

day at 1st level. With every two

levels she attains beyond 1st, she

can use the ability an additional

time per day (twice at 3rd level,

three times at 5th, and so on).

Moment of Clarity (Su):

A void disciple of 4th level

or higher can grant an

ally the temporary

ability to perform

any skill

or feat (with

the exception

of ancestor

feats). The

void disciple

must use a

s t a n d a r d

a c t ion to

touch the

target. The

target gains

either one feat

or a number

of ranks in one skill equal to his relevant

ability modifi er for that skill. For example, a

character with Dexterity 14 could gain 2 ranks in Ride, for a

total skill modifi er of +4. The effect lasts for 1 round per level

of the void disciple. The void disciple can use this supernatural

ability twice per day at 4th level, plus an additional

use for every four additional levels she attains.

Altering the Course (Su): Once per day, a void disciple

of 7th level or higher can add a +20 bonus on any single

attack roll, skill check, or ability check she makes. She

cannot transfer this bonus to another character by any

means. This supernatural ability requires no action, and

lasts only the duration of the single check.

Void Release (Su): Three times per day, a void disciple of

10th level or higher can touch an ally, allowing that character

to use his highest ability score modifi er in place of any

one lower modifi er (target’s choice) for a number of rounds

equal to half the void disciple’s level. For example, a severely

wounded fi ghter could use his high Strength modifi er in

place of his low Dexterity modifi er for a few rounds, increasing

his Armor Class, Refl ex save bonus, and ranged attack

bonus (as well as Dexteritybased

skills).

Void Suppression

(Su): Once

per day, a void

disciple of 12th

level or higher

can make a melee

touch attack to

force the target

to use his lowest

ability score modifi

er in place of any one

higher modifi er (void disciple’s

choice) for 5 rounds.

For example, a void disciple

could force an ogre to

use his low Intelligence

modifi er in

place of his high

Strength modifi

er, severely weakening

the brute’s

physical blows.

Void Strike

(Su) : Once

per day, a 13thlevel

void disc

iple can

make a melee

touch attack to

bestow 1d4 negative

levels on the target. The

void disciple gains 5 temporary

hit points for each negative level she

bestows. If the target has at least as many negative levels

as Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature a

–1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill

checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining

the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special

abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or

spell slot from his highest available level. Negative levels

stack. Assuming the target survives, he regains lost levels

after 13 hours pass. This ability relies on the void disciple’s

mastery of void, not negative energy, so it cannot be used

to benefi t undead.
