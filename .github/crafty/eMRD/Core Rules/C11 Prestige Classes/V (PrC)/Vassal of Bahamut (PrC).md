# Vassal of Bahamut (PrC)
## Overview
Most of Bahamut’s emissaries and champions are dutiful and

mighty metallic dragons. Occasionally, however, Bahamut

finds a nondraconic champion whose reverence of good

dragons is unshakable, and whose hatred of evil dragons rivals

that of the purest gold dragons—a force of good so strong

that Bahamut feels moved to offer this champion a place

in his court.

A vassal of Bahamut is a devout, nondraconic

champion in the service of the Dragon King. Vassals

of Bahamut are most often

paladins, although fighters,

rangers, and barbarians can

become vassals as well. The

road to becoming a

Vassal of Bahamut often

begins with the character

undertaking a quest for a goodaligned

dragon, and

then assisting good dragons over a

period of time. If the champion worships

Bahamut and proves himself

worthy by defeating a red dragon in

combat, Bahamut sends his avatar or

some other emissary to offer her the

opportunity to become a vassal. If the

character declines, Bahamut takes no

offense, allowing plenty of time for

the character to reconsider.

Vassals of Bahamut

often work with

other exalted characters,

particularly

groups who frequently

oppose evil

dragons and other

servants of Tiamat,

the evil dragon

queen. A vassal of Bahamut even deigns to cooperate with neutral

characters on missions against evil dragons, although he

might belittle them for their lack of convictions. The only time

a vassal of Bahamut works with evil characters is if he is infiltrating

their group and trying to bring down an evil dragon or

one of Tiamat’s agents.

Because vassals of Bahamut are few in number and widespread,

it is highly unlikely that two vassals of Bahamut ever

meet face-to-face.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class

features of the vassal of

Bahamut prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A champion of Bahamut

is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of

armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Imperious Aura (Ex): Good dragons are naturally well-disposed

toward a vassal of Bahamut, while evil dragons are cowed

by his presence. The vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus equal to

his class level on all Charisma-based skill checks made against

dragons and dragon-type creatures (such as wyverns).

Platinum Armor: A vassal of Bahamut is granted the ability

to create platinum scale mail. The vassal starts with scales from

a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon and works them for 2 days

per character level. During this time, the vassal must not

engage in any other activities other than eating and sleeping.

At the end of this period, the red dragon scales transform into

glistening platinum scales. The finished masterwork

suit of armor weighs 25 pounds and confers a

+8 armor bonus. Its other properties are as

a masterwork chain shirt (+4 max Dex

bonus, –1 armor check penalty, 20%

arcane spell failure chance, no speed

reduction).

Only the vassal of Bahamut may

wear the platinum armor, which

instantly corrodes and turns to

powder if donned by another

creature. The vassal can replace a

lost suit using scales from a slain

juvenile (or older) red dragon, as

noted above, but can craft no more

than one such suit at a time.

The vassal’s platinum armor may

be enhanced using standard item creation

feats.

Dragon Senses (Ex): Starting at

2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut can see

four times as well as a human in low-light

conditions and twice as well as a human in normal light. He

also gains darkvision out to 120 feet.

Shared Trove: At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, a vassal of Bahamut

receives a modest lump sum reward for his loyal service. The

reward magically appears before the vassal—a mound of platinum

coins delivered straight from Bahamut’s celestial treasure

vault.

The number of platinum pieces equals 100 × the vassal of

Bahamut’s character level. The vassal may spend the money

more or less as he sees fit, provided the expenditure serves a

good or righteous cause. If the money is spent frivolously or

unwisely, Bahamut sends a loyal representative (usually a gold

dragon in an alternate form) to demand repayment. Spending

the money to improve one’s personal equipment is neither frivolous

nor unwise.

Spells: Beginning at 2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut gains the

ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the

vassal must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s level,

so a vassal with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Vassal of Bahamut bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and

saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level +

the vassal’s Wisdom bonus. When the vassal gets 0 spells of a

given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 2nd-level vassal of

Bahamut), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to

based on his Wisdom score for that spell.

The vassal of Bahamut’s spell list appears below. A vassal of

Bahamut prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Bonus Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 6th and 9th level, a

vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus feat. This feat must be drawn

from the following list, and the vassal must meet all the prerequisites

for the feat: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Reflexes,

Exalted Smite\*, Gift of Faith\*, Gift of Grace\*, Great Cleave,

Great Fortitude, Hands of a Healer\*, Holy Radiance\*, Improved

Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Iron Will,

Lightning Reflexes, Negotiator, Nemesis\*, Nimbus

of Light\*, Persuasive, Power Attack,

Righteous Wrath\*, Sanctify Weapon\*,

Weapon Focus.

\*New feat described in Chapter 4

of this book.

Dragonwrack (Su): Evil dragons

that strike a vassal of

Bahamut or are struck by him

suffer grievous wounds. At 4th

level, a vassal of Bahamut deals

+2d6 points of damage with

each successful melee attack

made against an evil creature of

the dragon type. Furthermore,

any such creature that strikes the

vassal with a natural weapon or

melee weapon takes 1d6 points of

damage. In both cases, half of the extra

damage is permanent hit point drain.

A dragon that survives a battle against a

vassal of Bahamut often bears terrible scars from

the permanent drain of hit points. Only a wish or miracle

spell can restore hit points drained permanently by a vassal’s

dragonwrack ability.

At 7th level, the vassal deals +3d6 points of damage to evil

dragons, and a dragon that strikes the vassal takes 1d6 points of

damage. Again, in both cases, half of this damage is permanent

drain. At 10th level, the damage increases to +4d6 points and

2d6 points, respectively.

VASSAL OF BAHAMUT SPELL LIST

Vassals of Bahamut choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: bless, bless weapon, divine favor, endure elements,

lantern light\*, protection against evil, shield of faith.

self, resist energy, shield other, undetectable alignment.

3rd Level: discern lies, magic circle against evil, protection from

energy, refreshment\*, searing light.
