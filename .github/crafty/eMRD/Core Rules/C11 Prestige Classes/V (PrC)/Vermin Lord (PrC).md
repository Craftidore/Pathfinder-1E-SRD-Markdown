# Vermin Lord (PrC)
## Overview
The skittering of multiple legs across the floor, the droning

of wings—these phenomena mark the passing of a vermin

lord. This unthinkable entity prefers the caress of the crawling

legs of an insect or the fluttering wings of a fly more

than the touch of another person. The vermin lord offers

itself as a host for all manner of parasitic organisms and

insects that feed on it body. It not only allows the infestation,

it revels in it.

Clerics and druids comprise the majority of the vermin

lord ranks; some cleric/rogues are present as well. Many

monstrous vermin lords, such as drider clerics, exist.

Humanoid vermin lords work with monsters such as

driders, phase spiders, and other creatures associated with

vermin. Otherwise, they operate alone, for most other

humanoids will have nothing to do with them.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a vermin lord, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Hide 3 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, Move

Silently 3 ranks.

Feats: Verminfriend.

Special:Must be able to cast the giant vermin spell.

Special: The vermin lord must be ordained by an intelligent

evil creature with a physical resemblance to vermin—

a drider, chasme, gelugon, aranea, bebilith, phase spider, evil

formian, or similar creature. The ordaining creature must be

intelligent enough to communicate with the vermin lordto-

be. Of course, such a creature will demand service or payment

in return.

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con),

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the vermin lord prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

A vermin lord is proficient

with no weapons, armor, or

shields.

Spells: When a vermin lord attains

1st level and every two levels

after that (plus 10th level), the character

gains new spells per day as if he

had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class he belonged to

before he added the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of

controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic

or item creation feats, hit points

beyond those received from the prestige

class, and so on), except for an increased effective

level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that he adds the new level of vermin

lord to the level of whatever other spellcasting

class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster level

accordingly. For example, if Silican, an 8th-level

wizard, gains a level in vermin lord, he gains new spells as if

he had risen to 9th level in wizard, but uses the other

vermin lord aspects of level progression such as attack

bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard,

making him a 9th-level wizard/1st-level vermin lord, he

gains spells as if he had risen to 10th-level wizard.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

he became a vermin lord, he must decide to which class he

adds the level of vermin lord.

Chitin (Ex): A vermin lord gains a +1 natural armor

bonus to Armor Class from the chitinous plates that begin

to grow on his flesh. Every three levels beyond 1st, this

bonus increases by +1.

Vermin Servant: A vermin lord

gains a servant in the form of a

vermin of up to 1 HD. This servant

is treated as a familiar; its

intelligence increases, and it is

considered a magical beast (see

the Familiars section in Chapter

3 of the Player ’s Handbook). The

vermin servant is in addition to

any familiar the character may

already have.

A vermin lord gains additional

vermin servants at higher levels.

At 5th level, the vermin servant

gained can be of up to 4 HD. At

9th level, the vermin servant

may be of up to 16 HD.

Blood Drain (Su): A 2ndlevel

vermin lord can grow insectoid

mandibles at will. He can use

these mandibles to make a bite

attack that deals 1 point of damage.

Furthermore, the vermin lord can

attempt to start a grapple, provoking

no attack of opportunity. If successful,

the mandibles automatically deal 2d6

points of damage each round as they

suck blood from the victim. The blood

drain ability only works on living creatures.

Spider Hand (Sp): Once per day, a 3rd-level

vermin lord can produce an effect identical to

that of a spider hand spell cast at his effective caster level.

Swarm Armor (Su): Each day, a 4th-level vermin lord

automatically summons a swarm of insects, spiders, or scorpions

that cover his flesh when he regains his spells. These

insects absorb up to 10 points of damage from any damaging

attack (weapons or spells). The insects die off when they absorb such attacks, and a total of up to 5 points per vermin

lord level can be absorbed per day. Thus, a 7th-level vermin

lord’s swarm armor can absorb up to 35 points of damage,

although no more than 10 points from any one attack.

If a vermin lord is already wearing

armor, the swarm armor has no

effect.

Wings of the Vermin (Su):

A vermin lord of 5th level or

higher can sprout massive,

buzzing insectoid wings from

his back once per day. With

these wings, he can fly at his

normal land speed with average

maneuverability for 1

hour. The vermin lord can

carry his normal carrying

capacity, and greater burdens

affect his speed as they would

affect his land speed. It is

impossible to move silently

with these wings.

Spider Legs (Sp): Once per

day, a 6th-level vermin lord

can produce an effect identical

to that of a spider legs spell cast

at his effective caster level.

Spew Vermin (Sp): Once per

day, a 7th-level vermin lord is

able to spray out a swarm of vermin

from his mouth, as a breath weapon

in a 30-foot cone. Anyone in this

area takes 1d6 points of damage

per vermin lord level, with a

successful Reflex save reducing

the damage by half (DC

10 + vermin lord’s class level

+ vermin lord’s Con bonus). The vermin then

remain as if a summon swarm spell had been cast at the

vermin lord’s class level. The vermin are under the command

of the vermin lord.

Poison (Ex): In a vermin lord of 8th level or higher, the

mandibles gained from the blood drain ability now carry a

natural venom that deals 1 point of Strength damage with

each successful bite attack and 1 point of Strength damage 1

minute later. The Fortitude save DC to resist the poison is 10

+ vermin lord’s class level + vermin lord’s Con modifier.

Hivemind (Su): A 10th-level vermin lord can form the

impetus to create a hivemind (see Hivemind in Chapter 2).

The hivemind must include the vermin lord, although he

counts as only a single individual and his Intelligence and

Charisma scores are unaffected. However, he controls the

hivemind, gains the insight bonuses, and can take advantage

of the spellcasting abilities of the hivemind if enough individuals

are present. The vermin lord’s vermin servant can

also join the hivemind if the vermin lord wishes.
