# Vigilante (PrC)
## Overview
Some vigilantes have suffered personally at the hands of

criminals and are bent on revenge. Others have lost loved

ones to knives in the alleyway. Still others are atoning

for the time they spent on the wrong side of the law. But

they all have one thing in common: a burning desire to

solve crimes and bring criminals to justice.

The vigilante combines magical and mundane investigative

techniques to assess a crime scene. He is adept at

learning “the word on the street” about a crime, analyzing

clues, and identifying likely suspects. Once on the

trail, he relentlessly tails, apprehends, and interrogates

a suspect until the truth comes out. Many vigilantes

work for the local ruler or the city guard; others are

independent detectives-for-hire. Some even take to the

streets by night to stop crimes in progress—or to keep

would-be criminals from striking in the fi rst place.

A bard or rogue can quickly pick up the variety of

skills a vigilante needs. Rangers fi nd the class appealing

because it allows them to engage in urban hunts with

criminals as their prey, but they must typically multiclass

as bards or rogues to qualify. Some would-be vigilantes

add one or more levels of fi ghter or paladin to aid their

combat prowess.

An NPC vigilante might turn up just in time to save

the player characters from becoming crime victims

themselves. However, if they break the law on a vigilante’s

home turf, they may fi nd themselves under his unwelcome

scrutiny.

Adaptation: Although members of this class usually

work alone, that need not be the case in every campaign.

Any highly trained group of professional adventurers,

bounty hunters, or even assassins could include members

of the vigilante class, especially if you remove the alignment

restriction.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the vigilante

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Vigilantes are

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, plus the

net. They are not proficient with any type of armor or

shields.

Detect Evil (Sp): A vigilante can use *detect evil* at will.

See the spell, page 218 of the *Player’s Handbook.*

Spells per Day: A vigilante has the ability to cast a

small number of arcane spells. To cast a vigilante spell,

a vigilante must have a Charisma score of at least 10 +

the spell’s level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he

cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma,

and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + the vigilante’s Cha modifier. When a

vigilante gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance,

1st-level spells at 1st level), he gains only the bonus spells

he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for

that spell level. The vigilante spell list appears below. A

vigilante casts spells just as a bard does.

A vigilante’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A

vigilante begins play knowing two 1st-level spells of his

choice. At most new vigilante levels, he gains one or more

new spells known as indicated on Table 2–25: Vigilante

Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells

a vigilante knows is not affected by his Charisma score.)

Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered

level after that, a vigilante can choose to learn a new spell

in place of one he already knows. This works identically

to the bard’s ability to learn new spells in the place of old

ones (see page 28 of the *Player’s Handbook*).

A vigilante’s spell list includes all spells from the bard

spell list that belong to the following schools: abjuration,

divination, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.

The spell list below includes all spells from the *Player’s*

*Handbook* and this book that qualify. (Treat 0-level bard

spells as 1st-level vigilante spells.)

Streetwise (Ex): A vigilante knows how to survive in

dangerous urban areas. He gains a +2 competence bonus

on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks.

At 7th level, this bonus improves to +4.

Smite the Guilty (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a vigilante

can attempt to smite someone whom he has personally

witnessed committing a crime in his home city. He can

use this ability once per day. He adds his Charisma bonus

(if any) to his melee attack roll and deals an extra 1 point

of damage per vigilante level.

The smite attack must occur within three days of the

crime; otherwise, the benefits of this ability no longer

apply. A vigilante can use this ability multiple times

against the same miscreant and in response to the

same incident, so long as all such uses occur within the

time limit. Should a vigilante mistakenly try to punish

someone who is not guilty of the crime witnessed, the

benefits do not apply, but the attempt still counts against

the number allowed per day.

A vigilante can use this ability twice per day at 6th

level and three times per day at 10th level.

Quick Search (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a vigilante

can search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5

feet on a side as a move action, rather than as a full-round

action.

Speak with Dead (Sp): Starting at 4th level, a vigilante

can use *speak with dead* once per day. His caster level

equals his class level.

Quick Hide (Ex): At 5th level and higher, a vigilante

can use Bluff to create a diversion to hide as a move

action, rather than as a standard action. He gains a +4

bonus on Bluff checks made for this purpose.

Dimensional Anchor (Sp): Starting at 8th level, a

vigilante can use *dimensional anchor* once per day. His

caster level equals his class level.

Mettle (Ex): Starting at 9th level, a vigilante’s grim

determination allows him to shrug off magical effects

that would otherwise harm him. If a vigilante makes a

successful Will or Fortitude saving throw that would

normally reduce the spell’s effect (such as any spell

with a saving throw entry of Will partial or Fortitude

half ), he instead negates the effect. An unconcsious

or sleeping vigilante does not gain the benefit of

mettle.

Detect Evil *(*Sp): Beasley can use *detect evil* at will. See

the spell, page 218 of the *Player’s Handbook*.

Evasion (Ex): If Beasley is exposed to any effect that

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Quick Hide (Ex): Beasley can use Bluff to create a

diversion to hide as a move action, rather than as a standard

action. He gains a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made

for this purpose.

Quick Search (Ex): Beasley can search a 5-foot-by-5-

foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side as a move

action, rather than as a standard action.

Smite the Guilty (Su): Once per day, Beasley can

attempt to smite someone whom he has personally witnessed committing a crime in his home city. He adds

2 to his melee attack roll and deals an extra 5 points of

damage.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beasley deals an extra 2d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet

away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Beasley can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his

sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for

that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Speak with Dead (Sp): Beasley can use *speak with dead*

once per day as a 5th-level caster.

Trapfinding (Ex): Beasley can find, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search

skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create

it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by

10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without

triggering or disarming it.
