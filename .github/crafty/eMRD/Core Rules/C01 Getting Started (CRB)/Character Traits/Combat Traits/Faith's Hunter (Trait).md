# Faith's Hunter (Trait)
## Overview
**Faith’s Hunter:** Divine powers smile upon you each time you grievously wound a favored enemy. When you confirm a critical hit against a favored enemy, you may extend the duration of any divine spell affecting you by 1 round. The benefits from multiple critical hits stack. Divine spells with an instantaneous duration can’t be extended in this manner.
