# Dedicated Defender (Trait)
## Overview
**Dedicated Defender**: When a companion is down, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and on checks made to overcome spell resistance while you are adjacent to a dying or disabled ally, animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or mount. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 52
