# Black Powder Bravado (Trait)
## Overview
**Black Powder Bravado:** You are particularly successful when using deeds. Once per day, when you perform a deed that requires an attack roll and you miss with that roll, you can reroll it. You must take the second result even if it is worse. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 51
