# Startling Report (Trait)
## Overview
**Startling Report:** Through either perfect timing or the determination of your action, the sound of your firearm going off sets your enemies on edge. When you shoot a firearm, you gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks for 1 round against those who heard the shot.
