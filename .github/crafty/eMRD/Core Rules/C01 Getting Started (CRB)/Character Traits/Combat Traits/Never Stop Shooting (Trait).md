# Never Stop Shooting (Trait)
## Overview
**Never Stop Shooting:** Even when the chips are down, you keep on shooting. If your hit point total drops to 0 or lower but you are not dead, you may act as if [[Disabled|disabled]] rather than [[Dying|dying]] (as if you possessed the [[Diehard (Feat)|Diehard]] feat). However, you can use your actions only to draw a firearm, reload a firearm, or attack with a firearm. If you have the [[Diehard (Feat)|Diehard]] feat, this trait also allows you to substitute your Wisdom score for your Constitution score for the purpose of determining the negative hit point total at which you die.
