# Demon Slayer (Trait)
## Overview
**Demon Slayer (Mendev Crusaders):** By studying a demonic opponent, you can sense and target its weak spots. You can attempt a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) check to find a demon’s weak spot. (DC 10 + the demon’s CR). If you succeed, you gain a +3 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against that demon until the end of the battle. This effect only works on demons.
