# Attached (Drawback)
## Overview
**Attached:** You have a strong emotional attachment to a person or object that you're terrified of losing. The GM chooses the object of your attachment. Whenever the object of your attachment is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, you take a —1 penalty on Will saves and a —2 penalty on saves against fear effects. If the person or object to which you're attached is ever lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for the Doubt drawback.
