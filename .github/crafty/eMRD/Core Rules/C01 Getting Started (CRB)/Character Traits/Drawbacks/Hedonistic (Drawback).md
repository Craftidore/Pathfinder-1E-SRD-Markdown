# Hedonistic (Drawback)
## Overview
**Hedonistic:** You are a creature of pleasure and comfort. Whenever you spend a day without gaining reward or treasure (at least 10 or more gold pieces) or spending an hour on entertainment or pleasure, attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save at the end of that day. If you fail, you begin the next day [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. This fatigue lasts 4 hours, or until you receive a reward or sufficient entertainment or pleasure.
