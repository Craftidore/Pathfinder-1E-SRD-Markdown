# Family Ties (Drawback)
## Overview
**Family Ties:** Your family is extremely important to you, and you feel disheartened when you can't do what they ask. When a family member makes a request of you, you must fulfill that request or take a â€”2 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks until you either do what was requested or succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw, which you can attempt once per day at the start of each day. You can't take this drawback if you have no family. If you ever lose your family or lose contact with your family, exchange this drawback for the [[Doubt (Drawback)|Doubt]] drawback.
