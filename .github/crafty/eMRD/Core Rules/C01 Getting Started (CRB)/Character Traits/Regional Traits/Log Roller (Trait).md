# Log Roller (Trait)
## Overview
**Log Roller (Forest):** The time you spent leaping between slippery logs as they whirled down the river to market taught you how to keep your footing. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks and a +1 trait bonus to your CMB when attempting to resist trip attacks.
