# River Rat (Trait)
## Overview
**River Rat (Marsh or River):** You learned to swim right after you learned to walk. When you were a youth, a gang of river pirates put you to work swimming in nighttime rivers and canals with a dagger between your teeth so you could sever the anchor ropes of merchant vessels. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls with a dagger and a +1 trait bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] is always a class skill for you.
