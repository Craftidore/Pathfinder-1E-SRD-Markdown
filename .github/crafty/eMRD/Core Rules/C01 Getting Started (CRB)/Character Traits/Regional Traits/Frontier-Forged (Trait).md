# Frontier-Forged (Trait)
## Overview
**Frontier-Forged (Any Frontier Area):** A hard life on the edge of civilization has made you resourceful but has also given you a streak of self-preservation bordering on paranoia. You receive a +1 trait bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +1 bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks made to get along in the wild.
