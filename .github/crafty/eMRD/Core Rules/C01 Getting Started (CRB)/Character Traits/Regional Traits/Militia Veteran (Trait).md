# Militia Veteran (Trait)
## Overview
**Militia Veteran (Any Town or Village):** Your first job was serving in a civilian militia in your hometown. The skills you learned through daily drilling and protecting your fellow townsfolk gave you special insight into military life. Select one of the following skills: [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (soldier), [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]], or [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]]. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.
