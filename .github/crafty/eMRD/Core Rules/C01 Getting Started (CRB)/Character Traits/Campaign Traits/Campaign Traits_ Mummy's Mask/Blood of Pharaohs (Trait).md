# Blood of Pharaohs (Trait)
## Overview
**Blood of Pharaohs:** Long ago, one of your ancestors ruled over the lands of Osirion. Although you are many generations removed and the line of descent is hard to prove, his or her blood still runs in your veins. Perhaps you may f ind some proof of your lineage in the tombs of Watiâ€™s necropolis. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nobility) checks and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you may choose Ancient Osiriani as one of your bonus languages.
