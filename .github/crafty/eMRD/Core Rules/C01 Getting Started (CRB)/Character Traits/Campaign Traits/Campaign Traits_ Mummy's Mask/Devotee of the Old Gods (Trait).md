# Devotee of the Old Gods (Trait)
## Overview
**Devotee of the Old Gods**: Osirion has a history stretching back over 8,000 years, and the deities worshiped today in modern Osirion are not the same ones revered in Ancient Osirion’s heyday—deities with names like [[Anubis (Deity)|Anubis]], Osiris, Ra, and Set, among others. Your family never lost the faith of your ancestors, however, and your devotion to one of the deities of Ancient Osirion has helped keep the memory of Osirion’s past alive—a past that still lingers on in the untouched necropolis of Wati. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks, and one of those skills is always a class skill for you. In addition, your faith in the old gods of Osirion grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divine magic. For more information on the deities of Ancient Osirion, see *Pathfinder Adventure Path #80: Empty Graves*.
