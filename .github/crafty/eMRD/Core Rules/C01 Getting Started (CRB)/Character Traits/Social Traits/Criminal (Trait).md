# Criminal (Trait)
## Overview
**Criminal:** You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. Select one of the following skills: [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], or [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]]. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.
