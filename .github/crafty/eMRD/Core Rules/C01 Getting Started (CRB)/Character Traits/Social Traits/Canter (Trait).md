# Canter (Trait)
## Overview
**Canter:** You grew up among thieves and scoundrels, and their unusual speech patterns and turns of phrase donâ€™t faze you in the slightest. Anyone who attempts to use [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] to deliver a secret message to you gains a +5 bonus on her [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] check. When you attempt to intercept a secret message using [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]], you gain a +5 trait bonus on the attempt.
