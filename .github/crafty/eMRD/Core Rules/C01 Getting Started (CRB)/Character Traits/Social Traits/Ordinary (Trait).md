# Ordinary (Trait)
## Overview
**Ordinary**: The only thing extraordinary about your appearance is its ordinariness. You carry yourself in an understated way, and many people who see your face soon forget it. You gain a +4 trait bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks whenever you attempt to hide in a crowd. 

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 61
