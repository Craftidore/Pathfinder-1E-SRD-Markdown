# Windfall (Trait)
## Overview
You receive a mysterious windfall upon attaining your majority and taking up a profession as an adventurer. Your starting money increases by 900 gp. (This trait may not be retrained.)

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

Many might think this trait is over-powered, but closer examination reveals that it's primary boon: +900 starting gold, is canceled out by 3rd level during normal adventuring. The trait's primary purpose, like Rich Parents and Chosen Child is to provide the starting character with either a wand of a 1st level spell, such as *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* or to allow for the purchase of a masterwork weapon.

Since both Rich Parents and Chosen Child are social traits neither stacks with each other or with Windfall.
