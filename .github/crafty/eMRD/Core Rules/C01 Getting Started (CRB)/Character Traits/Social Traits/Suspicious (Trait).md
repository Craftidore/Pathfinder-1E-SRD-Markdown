# Suspicious (Trait)
## Overview
**Suspicious**: You discovered at an early age that someone you trusted, perhaps an older sibling or a parent, had lied to you, and lied often, about something you had taken for granted, leaving you quick to question the claims of others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks, and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] is always a class skill for you.
