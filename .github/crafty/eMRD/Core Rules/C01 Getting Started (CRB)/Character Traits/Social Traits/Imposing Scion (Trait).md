# Imposing Scion (Trait)
## Overview
**Imposing Scion**: The reputation of your bloodline grants you a degree of fearful respect. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks. If your bloodline is keyed to a specific creature type, your trait bonus increases to +2 when interacting with creatures of that type.
