# Knowing the Enemy (Trait)
## Overview
**Knowing the Enemy**: You know a good deal about your most dire enemies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill corresponding to your first favored enemy choice, and that [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill is always a class skill for you.
