# Friend in Every Town (Trait)
## Overview
**Friend in Every Town**: You have no problem making friends and learning information from them wherever you go. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) checks and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
