# Natural-Born Leader (Trait)
## Overview
**Natural-Born Leader**: Youâ€™ve always found yourself in positions where others look up to you as a leader, and you can distinctly remember an event from your early childhood where you led several other children to accomplish a goal that each of you individually could not. All cohorts, followers, or summoned creatures under your leadership gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves to avoid mind-affecting effects. If you ever take the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] score.
