# Bastard (Trait)
## Overview
**Bastard**: You were born out of wedlock. You have always been an outsider in society, and in your own family. This perspective has sharpened your insight. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks, and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] is always a class skill for you.
