# Suspicious (Trait)
## Overview
**Suspicious**

You are naturally suspicious of everyone and everything. While this trait makes you hard to fool, it makes others slightly less likely to agree with you or find you threatening.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** This trait might express itself as comic levels of paranoia, or it might make the character quietly cautious about others.
