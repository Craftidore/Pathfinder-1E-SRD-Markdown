# Saddleborn (Trait)
## Overview
**Saddleborn**

You are a natural in the saddle, but you have little patience for handling animals when not riding them.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait rarely bother to consider animals as good for anything other than mounts, but they are extremely confident about their riding abilities.
