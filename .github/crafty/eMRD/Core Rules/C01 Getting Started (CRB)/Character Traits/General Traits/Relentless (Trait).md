# Relentless (Trait)
## Overview
**Relentless**

You don't know the meaning of the word "tired." You go all out until you simply can't continue.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Constitution checks and similar checks made to continue tiring activities (see the [[Endurance (Domain)|Endurance]] feat for a mention of all the checks and saves to which this benefit applies).

**Drawback:** Any effect or condition that would normally cause you to become fmgued instead causes you to become [[Exhausted|exhausted]].

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait may see others as soft or weak, especially anyone who complains about being tired or [[Fatigued|fatigued]]. They might openly scoff at others' weaknesses or might quietly encourage them to "tough it out."
