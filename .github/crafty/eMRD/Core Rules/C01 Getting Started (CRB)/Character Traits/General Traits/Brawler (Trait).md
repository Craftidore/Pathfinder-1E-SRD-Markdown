# Brawler (Trait)
## Overview
**Brawler**

You naturally move close to your opponents when fighting, instinctively grabbing and punching rather than striking with weapons.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on unarmed attack rolls and grapple checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on all other attack rolls. Special: The bonus from this trait doesn't apply to natural weapons. A character with the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat can't select this trait (if a character with this trait later gains that feat, he loses the trait).

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait often disdain the use of weapons entirely, and some eventually learn more refined martial arts based on their instinctive :fighting techniques. Many brawlers might not even be consciously aware that they fight differently from other characters; they simply know that the best way to take someone out of a fight is to grab him or punch him in the face.
