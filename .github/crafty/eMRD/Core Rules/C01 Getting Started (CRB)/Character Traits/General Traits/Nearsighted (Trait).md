# Nearsighted (Trait)
## Overview
**Nearsighted**

You have difficulty focusing on distant objects, but your eye for detail is more keen than normal

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Search) checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be sensitive about it, or they might simply be oblivious to its presence, having never known any different way of experiencing the world.
