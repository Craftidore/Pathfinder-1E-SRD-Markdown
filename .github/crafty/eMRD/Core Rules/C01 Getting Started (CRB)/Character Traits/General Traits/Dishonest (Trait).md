# Dishonest (Trait)
## Overview
**Dishonest**

You are naturally deceitful and insincere with others. You have a talent for lying, but have difficulty convincing others when you do speak truthfully.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -2 penalty on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be portrayed as crafty liars, or lying might simply be second nature to them, making actually telling the truth a difficult chore.
