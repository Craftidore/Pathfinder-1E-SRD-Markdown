# Easygoing (Trait)
## Overview
**Easygoing**

You are naturally friendly. Others feel comfortable around you, but this trait also makes it more difficult for you to be pushy or suspicious.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Gather Information checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be more easily manipulated in interactions with NPCs, or they might simply prefer n.ot to argue and instead use their natural talent to learn more about the world around them.
