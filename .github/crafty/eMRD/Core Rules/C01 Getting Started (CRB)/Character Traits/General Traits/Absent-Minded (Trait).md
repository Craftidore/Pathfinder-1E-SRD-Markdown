# Absent-Minded (Trait)
## Overview
**Absent-Minded**

You are fascinated by knowledge and learnilig and are capable of pursuing complex trains of thought quite quickly. However, your preoccupation with such thoughts makes you a little less aware of your surroundings.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on Knowledge checks (although this does not let you use a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill untrained).

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot checks and Listen) checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might flit from idea to idea, trailing off in mid-sentence or mumbling their way through complex ideas. Conversely, characters with this trait might be extremely articulate but still allow their thoughts to move faster than the pace of a conversation.
