# Skinny (Trait)
## Overview
**Skinny**

You are very slender for your race.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -2 penalty on Strength checks to avoid being bull rushed or overrun.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Skinny characters tend to be pushed around by tougher types, so those with this trait might be shy, or they might be very defensive when faced with such situations.
