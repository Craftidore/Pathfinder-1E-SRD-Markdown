# Hard of Hearing (Trait)
## Overview
**Hard of Hearing**

You have a slight hearing impairment, and to compensate, you have become more in tune with your other senses.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Spot) checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -2 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (v3.5 Listen) checks.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait might be sensitive about it, or they might simply be oblivious to its presence, having never known any different way of experiencing the world.
