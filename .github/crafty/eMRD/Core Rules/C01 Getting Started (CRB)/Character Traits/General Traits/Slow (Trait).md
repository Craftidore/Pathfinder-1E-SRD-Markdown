# Slow (Trait)
## Overview
**Slow**

You are slow, but sturdier than average members of your race.

**Benefit:** Add +1 to your hit points gained at each level

**Drawback:** Your base land speed is halved (round down to the nearest 5-foot interval).

**Special:** You must have a base land speed of at least 20 feet to select this trait

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait tend to be relatively immobile in combat .They typically prefer to wear strong armor (or other protective devices), since it's hard for them to flee a fight.
