# Aggressive (Trait)
## Overview
**Aggressive**

You are quick to initiate combat, and you tend to press the attack once battle is joined. Your enthusiasm makes you a dangerous foe, but you sometimes leave yourself open to blows that a more cautious warrior vvould avoid.

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.

**Drawback:** You take a -1 penalty to Armor Class.

**Roleplaying Ideas:** Characters with this trait are often hotheaded and quick to anger, or simply think that the best defense is a quick offense.
