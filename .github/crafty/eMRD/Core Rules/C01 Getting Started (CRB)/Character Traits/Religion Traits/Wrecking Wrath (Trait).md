# Wrecking Wrath (Trait)
## Overview
**Wrecking Wrath ([[Rovagug]]):** Your ferocity is devastating, sometimes even to your own weapons. Once per day, after successful hitting a foe with a melee weapon, you can add your Strength modifier to the damage roll a second time (your Strength Modifier is not doubled if you are using a two-handed weapon). Doing so has a 25% chance of giving your weapon the broken condition.
