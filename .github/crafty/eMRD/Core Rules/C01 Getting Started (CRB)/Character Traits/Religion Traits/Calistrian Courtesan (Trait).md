# Calistrian Courtesan (Trait)
## Overview
**Calistrian Courtesan ([[Calistria]]):** You worked in one of [[Calistria]]'s temples as a sacred courtesan, and you know how to flatter, please, and (most of all) listen. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to gather information, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
