# Divine Warrior (Trait)
## Overview
**Divine Warrior (Iomedae):** From an early age, you were trained by a militaristic order of clerics. You are devoted to the teachings of Iomedae and to spreading those teachings by force. Whenever you cast a divine spell that affects any melee weapons, choose one of those weapons; it gains a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls for the duration of the spell.
