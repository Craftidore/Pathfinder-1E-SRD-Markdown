# Patient Optimist (Trait)
## Overview
**Patient Optimist ([[Erastil]]):** You know that all things pass in time, and are used to having to repeat arguments multiple times to convince stubborn believers. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks to influence hostile or unfriendly creatures, and if you fail at such an attempt, you may retry it once.
