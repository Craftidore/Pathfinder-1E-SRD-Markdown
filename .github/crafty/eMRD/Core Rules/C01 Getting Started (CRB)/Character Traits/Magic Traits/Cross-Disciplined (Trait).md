# Cross-Disciplined (Trait)
## Overview
**Cross-Disciplined:** Your dabbling has granted you greater insight into the proper casting of certain spells. Once per day, you may cast a spell you have prepared that appears on both the magus and wizard spell lists as if your caster level were 1 level higher.
