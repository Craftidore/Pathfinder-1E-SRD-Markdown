# Focused Burn (Trait)
## Overview
**Focused Burn:** You know the secret of making punishing fire bombs. Any bombs you have that deal fire damage deal 1 additional point of fire damage on a direct hit per 2d6 of fire damage normally dealt (minimum 1 point). This additional damage does not apply to the bomb's splash damage.
