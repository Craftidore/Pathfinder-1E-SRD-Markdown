# Alchemical Intuition (Trait)
## Overview
**Alchemical Intuition:** You are often struck with epiphanies about alchemical processes and substances. Once per day as a free action, you may gain a trait bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0) on a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) check you make. You can apply this bonus after you roll the check, possibly turning a failure into a success.
