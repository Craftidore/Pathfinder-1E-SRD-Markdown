# Knowledgeable Caster (Trait)
## Overview
**Knowledgeable Caster:** Once per day when you cast a divination spell, you can cast that spell as if your caster level were 1 level higher in the appropriate class. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on any [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks associated with your sorcerer bloodline, if any.
