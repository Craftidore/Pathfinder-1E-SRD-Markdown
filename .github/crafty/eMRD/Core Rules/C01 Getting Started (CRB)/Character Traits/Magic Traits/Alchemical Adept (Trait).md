# Alchemical Adept (Trait)
## Overview
**Alchemical Adept:** You are skilled in creating alchemical items. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) checks made to craft alchemical items. Furthermore, when you fail a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) check by 5 or more but don't roll a natural 1, you don't ruin any raw materials or have to pay that cost again.
