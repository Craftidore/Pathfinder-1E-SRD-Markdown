# Pragmatic Activator (Trait)
## Overview
**Pragmatic Activator:** While some figure out how to use magical devices with stubborn resolve, your approach is more pragmatic. You may use your Intelligence modifier when making [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] checks instead of your Charisma modifier.

**Source:** Ultimate Campaign, pg. 58
