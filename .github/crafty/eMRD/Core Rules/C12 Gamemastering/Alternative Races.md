# Alternative Races
## Overview
Only more experienced GMs should consider allowing players to play anything other than the races presented in Chapter 2 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*, but if you want to start experimenting, the following races from the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary are good choices for races that are close in power to those listed in Chapter 2 of the *Pathfinder Core Rulebook*.

- [[Aasimar]]
- Goblin
- Hobgoblin
- Kobold
- Merfolk
- Mite
- Orc
- Tengu
- Tiefling

The following races are somewhat more powerful, due to the fact that they possess racial Hit Dice, exceptional ability score modifiers, natural attacks, or other unusual abilities. These races are intended as monstrous foes, not as PC races, and if you allow players to play one of these creatures, you should allow characters who pick from the list above or from the seven core races to start play at 2nd level.

- Boggard
- Bugbear
- Dark Creeper
- Drow
- Duergar
- Gnoll
- Lizardfolk
- Morlock
- Svirfneblin

**GM Note**

Unlike D&D (v3.5), there is no ECL adjustment in Pathfinder; consequently, GMs must balance the various races (when starting at 1st level) by allowing the more common (ie., less powerful races) to start at higher levels.

When doing so, it is STRONGLY recommended that experience points (XP) be used for level advancement rather than advancement as the AP calls which is becoming more and more common. Failure to do so cheats those players who have chosen to play a less 'powerful' characer.
