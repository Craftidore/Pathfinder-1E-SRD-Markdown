# Broadening Your Game
## Overview
Affiliations add another level to the D&D experience. They pull the focus back a step, broadening it from the adventure–loot–sell cycle that makes up some player characters’ activities. With affiliations, the community comes to the fore. Conspiracies, kingmaking, war, piracy, famine, revolution, business, plague, or the founding of an empire take center stage for a time. When the tarrasque appears, an entire kingdom mobilizes (while the neighboring kingdom promises aid but sends assassins, hoping to advance on a weakened foe after planting season). When a new prophet preaches in the West and gathers followers, repercussions ripple through churches far and wide, tithes decrease, and the old rites are threatened. When kingdoms clash and food is scarce, when churches excommunicate the best among them and beatify the worst, when comets blaze forth the deaths of princes and revolution grips the land in a paroxysm of metamorphosis—that is when affiliations come to the fore to play out their grand drama.

This is not to disparage an individual’s focus. Indeed, affiliations highlight individuals in the same way that a background serves to define the figure of a portrait. You need not be interested in world-spanning politics to find value in affiliations. Has your character ever recovered the poison sack from a monstrous scorpion, or a kuo-toa’s idol of Blibdoolpoolp, or yet another masterwork sword from a bandit chief? Affiliations give you a ready place to liquidate such treasures. Has your character ever been drained by a shadow, ridden by a night hag, or victimized by an ethereal filcher? Hire an affiliation member to restore your strength, exorcise your demons, or track down the planar pickpocket while you concentrate on your main quest. Advancing in your affiliation can be almost as important to your character’s development as attaining new levels.

Affiliations also allow your character to do things that she otherwise would not be able to do. Ever wanted to open your own tavern? Start your own smithy or weapon shop? Preach to a congregation of thousands? Clear Stirge Ridge, raise a curtain wall and a donjon, and assume the responsibility of nobility? Affiliations allow you to do this and more.

**THE TWO CATEGORIES OF AFFILIATIONS**

Like-minded individuals might gather in an affiliation for any number of reasons, but at the fundamental level there are two basic categories of affiliations: social and racial.

**Social Affiliations**

A social affiliation is formed when individuals with a common interest come together to promote or protect that cause. It’s that common interest, rather than any physical or professional similarity (such as race or class), that binds the members.

The most energetic or accomplished people among the membership have the best chance of rising to a high rank within the group. Conversely, members who fail to advance the cause can see their status drop drastically—sometimes so drastically that they are forced to leave the affiliation.

**Racial Affiliations**

As the name implies, a racial affiliation is only open to individuals of the race in question. It’s conceivable that, in the context of a given campaign, a human might perform an amazing deed that causes a group of dwarves to offer him a place in their affiliation, but such occurrences should be exceedingly rare.

Racial affiliations differ from social affiliations in a number of ways. It’s usually easier for a member of a racial affiliation to maintain his status even if he fails in an endeavor, because racial affiliations don’t typically penalize their members in such cases. Also, members of racial affiliations usually gain some tangible (that is, game-related) benefit from their membership at a lower level of status than is the case in social affiliations.

**WHY JOIN AN AFFILIATION?**

Affiliations can be viewed as another type of treasure. The coffer of rubies might have fallen into the acid swamp and melted, but the Brotherhood of [[Bahamut]] holds you in high esteem for slaying the young black dragon. Your standing in the Brotherhood goes up, and next time, instead of tithing a church to grow back your shield arm or emptying your gem pouch to book passage on a shady captain’s barkentine, the Brothers will cast *[[Regenerate (Spell)|regenerate]]* or *[[Wind Walk (Spell)|wind walk]]* for you, free of charge. In this way, an affiliation serves you, the same way that your sword, your spellbook, and your gold benefit you.

You can also consider affiliations as an additional class feature. The [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] (Gather Information) feat provides a bonus on Gather Information checks, but so too does sufficient status in an affiliation of thieves. Join an affiliation of sages to gain bonuses on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks. As you increase in status, you gain more affiliation benefits and greater personal power (as well as face greater risks and enemies). 

Your affiliation brings rich potential to role-playing. The group can create many opportunities, including adding foils for your PC, rivals vying for your rank, and steadfast allies that can provide aid or request it of you. Affiliations also help drive your character’s motivations; when considering your character’s background, you should understand how his affiliations fit in.

From the Dungeon Master’s point of view, affiliations can be used to spur adventures, to lend the world verisimilitude, to introduce NPCs, to act as treasure and reward, and even to explain the occasional *deus ex machina* (even the best campaigns can benefit from such a device from time to time!). You should work with your DM to determine what affiliations are available to your character. Perhaps your Dungeon Master will allow you to create your own affiliation and join it (or found it). You should also discuss possible NPC and enemy affiliations in the campaign. Affiliations with goals inimical to your own can serve as challenges that highlight your character and his allies—the Sun Fane of Pelor is opposed to the Reviled of Laogzed, while the King’s Navy scours the seas through storm and swell to harry the *Thunder Sail Argosy* pirate fleet. 

Also, while the affairs of some affiliations might be fixed in the campaign world firmament, unchanging outside of DM fiat, others can be more dynamic. Evolving affiliations add another dimension to your game. Using the materials presented later in this chapter, you and your DM can make your affiliations change as the world does, even in response to your character’s actions.

No matter how you interact with affiliations, keep in mind that the goal is to have fun. Whether your thieves guild is a static fixture whose future is unquestionably secure, or whether it is a ragtag band of merry companions constantly on the run from the city watch and in danger of extermination or gaol, you should enjoy affiliations as you wish.

**MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES**

You have a separate affiliation score for each affiliation, but need only track those important to you. Your affiliation score defines your status in that group. Rising in status can earn benefits such as an offer of membership, a monthly flow of gold and emeralds, or research time at a wizard college.

You can’t get ahead in an affiliation without devoting some of your character’s time and effort to the cause. You might have to bring treasure to dragons, behead rival chieftains, break your half ling comrades out of jail, or perform any number of other types of activities. Your affiliation will be willing to meet you halfway, but you’ve got to help the group out if you want the rewards.

Multiple Affiliations: You can be associated with multiple affiliations at one time. However, each subsequent affiliation is harder to maintain. The first affiliation that you have (your primary affiliation) imposes a –10 penalty on all other affiliation scores. Subsequent affiliations oppose an additional –5 penalty to each affiliation that you gain afterward. In other words, you can have one affiliation score with no penalty, a second at –10, a third at –15, a fourth at –20, and so on. High-level characters are usually able to maintain one or two affiliations of note but only minor associations with other organizations.

Some affiliations might not be compatible, and the DM has final say on such issues. For example, in a campaign where the human kingdom of Althar wars with the elven realm of Gaelian, the DM might rule that no character with an affiliation to the Knights of Althar can also have an affiliation with the Greenfold Rangers of Gaelian.

**Multiple Affiliation Benefits:** If you have multiple affiliations, you can only gain the benefits of one affiliation at a time. If you have a high enough affiliation score to gain benefits from more than one affiliation, choose which set of affiliation benefits affect you at the beginning of each day. You gain all the benefits for which you qualify from the chosen affiliation.

**FEATURES OF AFFILIATIONS**

Your affiliation has many features, some primarily of use in roleplaying and background. These aspects include such basic information as the affiliation’s name and its background, goals, and dreams. Most affiliations have a symbol that enables members to identify one another. An affiliation’s description might include information about high-ranking members and how the group feels about members joining or leaving its ranks, as well as facts about the group’s significant enemies or allies. If an affiliation has a secret that relates to the group’s basic nature or how it operates, that information is provided.

Some of an affiliation’s features come into play when you join it or advance in it. Still others can be used to affect your campaign world. The following features are common to all affiliations.

**Type:** An affiliation can be of one of the following ten types: business, cabal, college, druid circle, fighting company, government, spy ring, temple, thieves’ guild, or tribe. An affiliation’s type limits the kinds of executive powers wielded by its leaders, and whether it is better at fighting, spying, or negotiation. In the example affiliation descriptions that follow, a racial affiliation is identified by the word “racial” in parentheses after its type. All other example affiliations are social.

**Scale:** An affiliation’s scale is a measure of its scope of infl uence. As affiliations grow in size and power, they increase the scale of their activities. The Bulette Rampant Mercenary Company could be as inconsequential as a cadre of men-at-arms with a rotting ballista or as mighty as an army for hire with half a dozen battalions and fl ying dragon support. An affiliation’s scale can be from 1 to 20 and is also defined by a descriptive term that indicates the extent of its influence. Scale directly affects an affiliation’s capital and its ability to project power. Table 7–1, on page 184.

**Affiliation Score Criteria:** Base requirements for membership, if any, are given here. An affiliation might have race, nationality, alignment, class, or some other baseline membership criteria. The table in this portion of an affiliation description lists a number of factors and how they impact your affiliation score in that group.

**Titles, Benefits, and Duties:** A title is a designation of rank within the affiliation’s hierarchy. Characters with an affiliation score of 3 or lower are usually not considered members. In social affiliations, members with affiliation scores from 4 to 10 are generally looked upon as probationary members. A character with an affiliation score of 30 or higher attains the most prestigious title.

Lower-rank benefits carry over to higher ranks, but normal stacking rules apply.

Even if you have founded your own affiliation (as opposed to positing the existence of one that you can join as a recruit), you still must increase your affiliation score normally before you can gain the benefits (and take on the duties) of a titled member of your affiliation. This represents the fact that you can’t simply say, “I am founding an affiliation,” and by virtue of that declaration become entitled to send an assassin after the duke or bring a plague to the eastern river tribes. Rather, you must establish your affiliation as a force in the world by satisfying affiliation score criteria, proving by virtue of your deeds that your affiliation is a force to be reckoned with and a player on the political stage.

**Executive Powers:** Executive powers are wielded by the affiliation’s leadership, generally those members with an affiliation score of at least 30. If a PC achieves a higher affiliation score than a leader NPC, the NPC might quietly step aside in favor of the newcomer. Many affiliations, however, force the two contenders to duel or to match wits in some fashion.

Unless otherwise noted, an affiliation’s leadership can use one executive power per month.

Details about executive powers are given starting on page 186.

**MAKING AFFILIATIONS DYNAMIC**

*The noon air cooled, and a shadow drifted across the bright silver coins stacked in Tabark’s scales. The moneychanger looked up from his table in the bazaar and saw the clouds darkening. Large black raindrops began to fall. When the first blue lizard thudded onto his table, upsetting the scales and sending the silver coins tinkling into the air, Tabark realized this was no summer squall. “The Reviled!” he screamed. “Laogzed’s priests plague us!” He ran for the Sun Fane as the lizard deluge began in earnest, reptiles plummeting through awnings and crashing into fruit stands, each lizard’s body wrapped with crackling lightning and frigid from its recent altitude.*

When you play with affiliations, a new avenue for conflict resolution and storytelling opens. Plagues, the births of kingdoms, wars, naval blockades, arcane research breakthroughs, trade embargoes, and other factors become part of your campaign in new ways. Your character need no longer do everything from winning the Battle of Stirge Ridge to lifting the curse on the southern farmlands to negotiating peace with the Frost Cavern quaggoths. You and your DM can rely on your affiliation to accomplish some of these tasks while you spend the bulk of your time focusing on your PC’s main quest.

Have you ever wondered who will watch your character’s family, castle, or subjects when he is off adventuring? If your PC is part of the Bulette Rampant mercenary company, you can simply have a detachment from your battalion watch over your loved ones. If your DM determines that the Valx Nine-Eyes criminal syndicate strikes at your family while you are adventuring underground, you can resolve the attempt by playing out the details (in the absence of your character) or, more simply, by using opposed violence checks for your mercenary company and the brute squad sent by the beholder. (Violence checks are described below.)

Have you ever picked up a powerful magic item, say a *+2 thundering dire flail*, that no one in the party could use? Campaign credulity is stretched by simply selling it to an anonymous buyer who just happens to have 36,500 gp ready to spend. Instead, you donate it to your affiliation and increase its capital—it is reasonable to assume that a sizable affiliation includes a member who knows (or now wants desperately to learn) how to use a dire flail.

Have you ever heard yourself utter the lines that famously fill a DM’s heart with annoyance, frustration, and uncertainty? Namely, “Can I buy magic items?” When you use affiliations, businesses and colleges have the trade executive power, which allows some wondrous items to come up for sale in the campaign—if a character has the right connections.

The following rules help guide a dynamic approach to affiliations.

**Capital:** An affiliation starts play with capital equal to its scale. Capital represents different types of assets for different affiliation types. A fighting company has its capital invested in soldiers, armor, weapons, and transport, while a cabal has its capital invested in wondrous items, spellbooks, bound demon servants, and political secrets.

In wartime and in months of hardship, your affiliation’s capital might go down; in peacetime when trade prospers, your affiliation’s capital might go up. An affiliation’s minimum capital is 0; its maximum capital is twice its scale. If your affiliation does nothing for two consecutive months, normal daily processes increase its capital by 1. A good way to increase your affiliation’s capital is to donate treasure. For every 1,000 gp × your affiliation’s scale that you donate each month, its capital increases by 1. Thus, you must donate 5,000 gp during the course of a month to increase a scale 5 affiliation’s capital by 1. For an affiliation that has a scale greater than 10, you must donate treasure in the amount of 10,000 gp × the scale to increase capital in this way. Such organizations have increased their scope to such an extent that they need not only gold, but vast tracts of real estate, arcane secrets, favors of the emperor, the name of the duke’s bastard son, and other nonmonetary items to increase their stature and power.

An affiliation whose capital falls to –1 is disbanded and cannot be refounded for a period of 1d4 months.

An affiliation whose capital remains at its maximum for a number of consecutive months equal to twice its scale improves one category in scale. For example, if a scale 4 business maintains a capital of 8 for eight consecutive months, it becomes a scale 5 business.

**Violence Check:** When an affiliation attempts to do something using bullyboys, bludgeons, or battles, a violence check (1d20 + violence bonus) is made. Fighting companies, governments, and tribes have violence bonuses equal to 1/2 their scale. All other types of affiliations have violence bonuses equal to 1/4 their scale.

**Espionage Check:** An affiliation’s attempts to sneak around, gather information, and infiltrate opponents are all summed up using espionage checks (1d20 + espionage bonus). Cabals, spy rings, and thieves guilds have espionage bonuses equal to 1/2 their scale. All other types of affiliations have espionage bonuses equal to 1/4 their scale.

**Negotiation Check:** Convincing arguments, delicate engagements, and subtle (perhaps even magical) manipulation are the province of an affiliation’s negotiation checks (1d20 + negotiation bonus). Businesses, colleges, druid circles, and temples have negotiation bonuses equal to 1/2 their scale. All other types of affiliations have negotiation bonuses equal to 1/4 their scale.
