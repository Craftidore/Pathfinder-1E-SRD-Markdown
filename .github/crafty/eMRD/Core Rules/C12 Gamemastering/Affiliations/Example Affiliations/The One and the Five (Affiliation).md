THE ONE AND THE FIVE

Symbol: The symbol of the One and the Five is six black,

hooded fi gures on a violet starburst fi eld.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: A secret ring of six

wizards and sorcerers is at the heart of this cabal. Arcane

casters vexed by a lack of resources fi nd this group’s support

exceptionally useful for purchasing spellbooks, researching

new spells, and perfecting metamagic techniques.

Enemies and Allies: The cabal has strained relations with

most other organizations. Its secretive core, the six wizards

and sorcerers known as the titular One and the Five, frustrate

the attempts of spy rings and thieves guilds to penetrate and

gather information, while their subsidization of spell books,

research, and material components irks arcane colleges and

many business guilds.

Members: Most of the members are human, but the One

and the Five welcome all to their cabal, and in addition to

half-orcs, dwarves, and gnomes, two centaurs and one gynosphinx

are known to be associated with the affi liation.

No one knows what happens if you try to leave the One

and the Five. For some reason, no one ever has—or at least,

no one is talking about it.

Secrets: Once you reach an affi liation score of 30, you

must defeat one of the current One and Five in a mortal spell

duel. After killing your opponent, you are inducted into the

heart of the cabal, where you learn that the order is devoted

to Vecna, and that the One represents his Eye, and the Five

represent the fi ngers of his severed hand.

You need not worry about converting to worship of Vecna

at this point—when you fi rst attained an affi liation score of

25 or higher and the subtle wooings of the inner cabal did not

persuade you to convert to the service of the Maimed Lord,

EL 14 assault squads of summoned monsters and golems are

sent to kill you before you learn the cabal’s secret.

Type: Cabal.

Scale: 10 (regional/march).
