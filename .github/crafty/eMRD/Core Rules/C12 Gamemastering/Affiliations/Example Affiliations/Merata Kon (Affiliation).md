MERATA KON

Symbol: There is no symbol for the Merata Kon as a whole.

Most travelers recognize a Merata clan by its krenshar-hide

tents and the smoke puffs that rise on the horizon when a

Merata scout or companion band signals.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Merata Kon is a

network of barbarian clans, sweeping nomadically from the

coastal plains to the high scrub forest, living off wandering

herds, seasonal vegetation, and ransomed travelers. Some

tribes of the Merata Kon allow themselves to be hired as

mercenaries, making raids on borderland baileys, but many

would-be patrons shy away from these tribes because both

its savagery and geographical uncertainty make it somewhat

unreliable. Nonetheless, the people of the Kon are a powerful

force due to their numbers and ferocity.

In the spring of each year, all the Merata clans gather in

one place for an Althing, where horses are traded, daughters

are wed, and alliances are fi xed. Occasionally, in times of

need, a Chief of Chiefs is selected, but most years there is no

higher authority than the chiefs of the individual clans.

Enemies and Allies: The clans are constantly in a state

of tension with the civilized city-states and kingdoms whose

frontier lands and territories they drift over seasonally,

ignoring political borders like rain or wind or any other

force of nature.

Members: The tribe consists mostly of half-orcs, humans,

and disaffected half-elves who fi nd much in common with the

natural and alienated lifestyle of the tribe. There are known

to be Merata clerics, but there are virtually no arcane casters

outside of a few skald bard/barbarians.

The varied Merata clans have no political argument against

former members, but most clan chiefs take desertion personally.

In most cases, a Merata who leaves his clan is disowned

and shunned forevermore.

Type: Tribe.

Scale: 13 (multiregional/kingdom and vassal states).
