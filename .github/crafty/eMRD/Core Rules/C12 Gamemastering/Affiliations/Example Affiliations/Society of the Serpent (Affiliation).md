The Society of the Serpent exists for the acquisition and safekeeping of magical knowledge; they are particularly interested in ancient and lost cultures such as the Suloise, the Baklunish Empire, and the City of the Gods. They hope to establish themselves as a secret power across the Flanaess, manipulating it for its own good.

History

Although new members are told that the Society was founded in the Suel Empire around 1500 SD, it was actually founded a little over 1,200 years ago by the half-Suloise, half-Flan archmage Krritarius. While exploring the Flanaess, he came across the symbol of Keraptis in the Rakers. Krritarius researched the serpent motif and decided to use it as the symbol of his society.

Even in those days, the Society of the Serpent was a group that transcended nation and race, establishing a neutral place where Suloise, Baklunish, and Flan could meet and exchange knowledge. After the Twin Cataclysms the Society went underground, fearing the reaction of the common people to the ill that magic had wrought. There they have remained.

Recognition

Members of the Society of the Serpent often intertwine stylized snakes with their own personal sigils, symbols, or initials, which helps members recognize one another. Nonmembers who use the stylized snake motif in an attempt to masquerade as members of the Society often turn up dead.

Headquarters

The Society of the Serpent is based in a cloud citadel floating through the skies above the Oerth. They also have several secret libraries and laboratories throughout the Flanaess, some of them in the Sea of Dust and the Bright Desert.

Their former headquarters, the Tower of Art, was destroyed in the Rain of Colorless Fire. They have vowed to never allow their accumulated knowledge and lore to be trapped in one place ever again.

Relationships

The Society of the Serpent has a rivalry with the Azure Masks, both groups often competing over the same secrets and lore. The Society has on various occasions entered into alliances with the Crescent League and the Telless ve Turu Decada for reasons of their own, although they have no formal ties to those organizations. As of late 591 CY, it knows nothing of the mage-hating Fratern Milblinnis, but will surely turn all its energies into destroying them as soon as it does.

Raw text from Dragon

The sole purpose of the Society of the

Serpent is the acquisition and safekeeping

of magical knowledge, particularly

that of ancient and lost cultures such as

the Suloise, Baklunish Empire, Blackmoor,

or even older, forgotten civilizations.

To this end, the society seeks

magical items, especially looking for

those that are unique or of great power

(such as artifacts), and those spells and

formulae that have been lost to the general

populace of Wizards for centuries.

The society is also a place where mages

of all kinds can associate safely, regardless

of race, creed, or alignment.

The ultimate goal of the society is

to establish itself as a secret power

across the Flanaess, a power that can

manipulate the world for its own good.

It seeks to protect the ignorant or

unwise from uncontrolled power while

simultaneously making power available

to the Society at large. Members go

to almost any lengths to keep the society

secret and protect the magical information

it collects, sometimes even

confiscating powerful items from those

they deem unworthy.

**History.** New members are told that the

Society of the Serpent was originally

founded in the Suel Empire around 1500

Suloise Dating, some 4,600 years ago.

The organization held great power

among the Suloise and established itself,

once the Baklunish and Suloise met, as a

neutral place where any mages could

gather. It is recorded that the society

spread to the Flanaess centuries before

even Suel migrations were common.

In truth, the society is not as old as it

claims. It was actually founded a little

over 1,200 years ago by the half-Suloise,

half-Flan archrnage Krritarius, a Mage

of the empire who traveled extensively

in the Flanaess. In his travels, he stumbled

upon the symbol of Keraptis (in the

Rakers) and was intrigued by it. When

he created the Society of the Serpent in

4840 so after returning to the Suel

Empire, he researched the serpent motif

and used it as a symbol of the society.

Later, it was claimed that Keraptis (and

even later Acererak) had been members

of the society. What, if any, actual connection

there was between Keraptis and

Acererak remains unknown.

The Rain of Colorless Fire that

destroyed the Suel Empire might have

rung a death knoll for the Society. Its

main headquarters were destroyed

along with the rest of the Imperium;

however, though the Society faltered

and was sorely hurt, it did not fall.

Those few members in the east kept up

the work of the organization, rebuilding

after the devastation and recovering as

best they could. Most of their knowledge,

however, was lost.

With the fall of the Suel Empire and

the chaos that followed, the common

folks' view of magic changed. Though

great Mages had ruled in the Empire,

they had also brought down ruin on the

people. Magic was as much feared as

revered in the aftermath of the destruction,

and surviving members of the

Society saw this and were afraid. The

organization completely withdrew from

the common man, hiding both its

power and its deep well of information.

It remains hidden to this day.

**Mfmbfrs.** A mage of any alignment

may join the Society of the Serpent.

Membership is by invitation only, which

usually comes after a Wizard has recovered

some powerful magical item, spell,

or knowledge that has been long lost.

Some mages who develop new and

powerful spells are also asked to join the

society, but this is rare. The organization

has many ears; even if the potential

member does not advertise his new

knowledge, the Society hears of it.

Membership is voluntary, though those

who hoard knowledge or don't preserve

it correctly are not looked upon kindly.

The Society does not consider good

or evil as a motivating force, remaining

neutral in its belief that knowledge is all

important and should be available to

everyone-at least everyone who's a

member. It gives mages a place to meet

regardless of alignment, acting as a neutral

ground where discussions and

debates on the nature of magic can take

place. No.members are allowed to combat

each other in any of the holds of the

\~ .. \~!'ot\~ Society or for twenty-four hours after

leaving the sanctity of such a place.

(According to the Society, mages

should be above fighting anyway.)

Lawful Good members are rare, as

few can overlook the evil deeds of

\~!!\~\~\~ another without doing something

about it. Likewise, Chaotic Evil mages

are seldom members, as they are unpredictable

and untrustworthy.

Members are required to make any

new or lost magic they find available to

the Society. They might also be assigned

the job of "recovering" magic or even

lost technology from the "wrong people."

Any powerful magic the society

considers misused by its owner might

be "confiscated" in such a way.

**Advanta9ts.** The Society has several

secret libraries and laboratories set up

across the Flanaess, some in the most

unlikely locations. These are usually

large and may be used by any member

who knows of their existence. The Society

also has access to many ancient texts

and maps showing the location of

dozens of abandoned (former member)

Wizard's laboratories and strongholds,

some of them in the Sea of Dust or Dry

Steppes. The Society also knows the

supposed locations of several artifacts.

Tttis information is occasionally made

available to certain members. However,

different cells and strongholds all have

different information (a result of trying

to keep from losing everything again

should one stronghold fall, such as the

Tower of Art during the Rain of Colorless

Fire). Most strongholds, if they

don't have the information, can guide

their members to the cell in which the

. information can be found.

Any stronghold of the Society has a

10-40% chance (rolled randomly or

determined by the DM) of having the

information a PC requests. The sage

rules from the *DUNGEON MASTER® Guide*

or *Sages and Specialists* should be

consulted to determine whether the

information is present with the following

modifications: in the Society,

frequency of such learned scholars is

double that of Table 61 of the *DMG*

(and even if such a sage is unavailable,

those at the stronghold have an equal

chance of knowing where one can be

found), and the time required by such a

sage is halved. If the DM determines

that the information is available but

that no sage of the appropriate type is

present, the PC can conduct his own

research, although research time is

tripled. While holds of the Society

always have quarters for visiting members,

companions are not allowed to

enter the place. Society sages charge

standard fees for locating information.

The Society also serves as a place

where magical spells can be researched

or preserved. Having survived for over

1,200 years, the organization has access

to many common spells (all those in the

*Player's Handbook* and *Tome of Magic,* as

well as many from the *Wizard's Spell*

*Compendium),* arcane formulae for the

making of potions and magical items,

and even texts with individual or unique

spells found nowhere else. This magic is

dispensed on a need-to-know basis and

usually requires the mage requesting the

information to give a spell or magical

item of equal value to the Society.

Any mage who joins the society can

learn the Spellcraft proficiency without

cost (following a six-week training session)

after joining the society. If the

mage already has that skill, he may

choose a special one-time free nonweapon

proficiency from the list of

**Disadvantages.** The society is considered evil by commoners. Since the reported reappearance of Keraptis in 576 CY and the unearthing of part of Acererak's horrible tomb, some little information about the Society has come to light. Those common folk who have heard stories about the organization react negatively to members, who incur a +3 penalty to their reaction check when dealing with someone they suspect is connected to the unknown organization.

Members of the Society are also expected to hand over any new magical items or spells they locate as soon as possible, at least long enough for the organization to copy or carefully examine the find. If the nearest cell is some distance, this could be a problem for the mage involved. Disregarding this rule or hoarding unique magic is severely punished by the society, usually by stripping the offender of all of his spellbooks and magical items, once the errant mage is tracked down.

**Recognition.** Members of the Society are allowed to encircle and add stylized entwining snakes to their own personal symbol or first initial. This serves as proof of membership in the or:ganization, and many members keep some form of this symbol on their person, usually in the form of an amulet or ring that can double as a wax seal. Individuals who use the symbol without admission into the Society invariably disappear or die mysteriously (and sometimes horribly).

**Headquarters.** Though the Society has hidden cells, libraries, and laboratories across the Flanaess, its main base is in a cloud through citadel floating the skies of Oerth, never in the same place twice. The organization lost much in the Rain of Colorless Fire and refuses to risk being trapped in one place ever again. Less than one hundred years after the destruction, several dozen wizards pooled their powers to create a castle not unlike those used by cloud giants. The place was set adrift, though its navigation is strictly controlled, and it now goes wherever the Archmage of the Snake wishes, usually staying over unclaimed lands, mountains, or oceans. It is most commonly encountered over disorganized lands (such as former Geoff or Sterich) or far out to sea. Only rarely are PC members of the society allowed to enter, see, or even hear of the Cloud Citadel.

**Interaction With Other Societies.** The Society of the Serpent has little association with other secret societies. The group knows of the Azure Masks, and the Society'S fear that the Masks have similar goals has made the two rivals. The Society has no formal ties with the Crescent League or the Keepers, but it has worked with both for its own reasons. The Society does not yet know of the Fratem Milblinnis (as of late 591 CY) but if (or more accurately when) it does, it would surely tum all of its power to destroying that group.
