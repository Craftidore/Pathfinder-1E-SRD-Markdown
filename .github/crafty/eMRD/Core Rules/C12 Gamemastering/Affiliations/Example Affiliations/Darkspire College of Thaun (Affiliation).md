OF THAUN

Symbol: The college’s symbol is three black

stalactites, one larger than the other two, on a

gold fi eld.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The

Dark spire College’s campus is built into the

sides of three enormous hanging stalactites

tapering down from the vaulted ceiling of

a colossal underground cavern. Piercer, the

largest stalactite, extends more than 300 feet

down from the ceiling and has a base with a

radius of 150 feet. It houses laboratories and

libraries for each school of arcane magic, a

concert hall, thirteen summoning chambers,

two gymnasiums, the Desmodu Dormitory,

and lecture halls. Each of the Fangs, the other

two stalactites, is roughly two-thirds the size

of the Piercer. They contain classrooms, studies,

artists’ cupolae, and practice rooms. The

northernmost Fang also features the Sunless

Rose tavern and a warehouse. The warehouse

stores goods in transit to and from the surface

and other underground communities, and it

sells surplus and goods gone unclaimed when

a caravan doesn’t return. The warehouse has a

25% chance to have any given *Player’s Handbook*

item in stock and available at 150% of the price.

The Piercer and the Fangs are connected by a

network of rope bridges.

Faculty and students attend Darkspire to

increase their arcane knowledge, and that is

the stated goal of the organization.

Enemies and Allies: The students, faculty,

and administration maintain friendly

relationships with most of the other peaceful

residents of Thaun (the underground cavern

that hosts the college’s spires on a small part

of its roof ). These peaceful residents include

svirfneblin, deep dwarves, two nomadic

tribes of myconids, and a small community

of exiled drow.

The college is harassed by most drow, by an

aboleth that lives in Thaun Lake, and by Cherruk,

a derro warlord who claims ownership of

the caverns immediately above Thaun.

Members: The College holds no grudge

against those who leave its faculty. Indeed,

given the college’s location, it counts on losing

at least one faculty member per year to

beasts, slavers, or an accidental fall from a

rope bridge.

Type: College.

Scale: 5 (city).

Affiliation Score Criteria: Joining the

Darkspire College is as simple as enrolling;

however, to become a faculty member requires

long study and arcane puissance.
