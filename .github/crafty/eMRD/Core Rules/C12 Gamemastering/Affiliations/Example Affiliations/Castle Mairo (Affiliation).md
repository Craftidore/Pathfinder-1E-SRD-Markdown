CASTLE MAIRO

Symbol: The symbol of Castle Mairo is the battered

breastplate of Herridek I. In more intricate heraldic designs,

the broken fl int hammers of troglodytes can be seen lying

below the shield.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Three centuries and

one day after the Third Troglodytic Ruin razed the original

Fort Mairo to the ground, Castle Mairo was raised in its place.

Regdar had defeated Iathra, Pharaoh of the Reviled, and the

oases on the edges of the desert were once again safe. Before

leaving, Regdar helped his brother, Herridek II, to found a

small keep on the border of the dunes.

Life in the oasis can be harsh when the sandstorms roll

through, but the presence of copper, platinum, and mithral

in the surrounding hills and even the bubbling oasis itself

provides ample reason for the castle’s continued existence.

Members: Herridek II rules the castle wisely, and he

recruits all manner of citizens to his nascent barony: men-atarms,

certainly, but also wizards, bards, rangers, and skilled

rogues. The castle is especially desperate for divine casters

and healers.

Herridek II is a benefi cent monarch and allows individuals

to enter and leave his domain at their leisure. In times

of crisis—if a new pharaoh were to rise in the lands of the

Reviled, for instance—all those nearby are drawn inside the

castle walls and expected to aid in its defense.

Type: Government.

Scale: 9 (regional/barony).

Once you attain the rank of Knight Baronet, you are

often makes forays into the desert for weeks or months at a

time, harassing the Reviled and making sure that they are

not a threat to the Castle and its mines.
