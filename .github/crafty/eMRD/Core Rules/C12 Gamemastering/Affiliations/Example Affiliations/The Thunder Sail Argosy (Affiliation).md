THE THUNDER SAIL ARGOSY

Symbol: The symbol of the Argosy is emblazoned on the

sails of all three brigantines: a gold lightning bolt on sable.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The gentle heaving of

the deck underfoot slows, then stops. The gulls overhead quiet,

and the only sound is the rhythmic lapping of the suddenly

becalmed salt sea at the hull. A peal of thunder cracks over the

horizon, and clouds come scudding across the sky only a few

knots slower than the bolt-on-sable Thunder Sails.

Captain Jonas Jakes commands an outlaw fl eet of three

brigantines: the *Rain Hawk,* the *Red Lightning,* and the fl agship

*Maelstrom Aria.* Few of the current pirates in his fl eet were

with him when he started, and those few who have been in his

quarters wonder about the strange crystal sphere kept there.

Slightly larger than the glass buoys used by fi sherfolk, the

sphere contains a swirling turquoise mist, and it rests clutched

near the captain’s bedstand in a preserved and upended harpy’s

talon. During battle, Captain Jakes hauls the crystal sphere and

harpy-leg monopod onto the aft deck, where he sits on a closed

locker, hunches over the sphere, and strokes it possessively

while barking orders to his mates and crew. He appears quite

mad, but the Thunder Sail Argosy has survived, and the crew

doesn’t care whether that is due to cunning or luck as long

as the gold is good and the grog is thick.

Members: Most members of the Argosy are fi ghter/rogues

or swashbucklers, and many take levels in duelist. A few

important offi cers are sorcerers or druids, and they function

as artillery and environmental control. Finally, like every

sailing ship, each Thunder Sail vessel has at least one bard, to

sing shanties in time with the hauling of ropes and alleviate

the thirsty, languorous days between plunderings.

The Argosy is not concerned about those who leave its

ranks—and in fact it frequently asks men to leave the

crew (often at the end of a plank after they have crossed

the captain).

Secrets: When you rise to a captaincy, Captain Jakes

informs you of the Thunder Sail Argosy’s hidden power and

purpose. Once a prominent plantation owner in a southern

kingdom, Jonas Jakes saw his daughter, a powerful druid

who helped him tend his crops, polymorphed into a green

mist by a chaotic, mad archmage who rode his horse through

town one day and casually sowed destruction in his wake. By some arcane accident, Jonas’s daughter Ellyrese retained her

intelligence and spellcasting ability. Jonas keeps her in the

crystal sphere on the harpy-leg monopod in his quarters, and

now she uses her druid magic to cast spells for him to turn

the tide of a battle or to speed the Argosy on its way. Jonas

is desperately searching for an island with a white alabaster

cliff dwelling containing “no more than one eye, no less than

fi ve mouths,” which a seer once told him would be the key

to restoring his daughter.

Type: Fighting company.

Scale: 5 (city).
