RESTENFORD GUILD OF INSURERS,

SOLICITORS, AND BEGGARS

Symbol: The symbol of the guild is a hand placing a gold

piece into a beggar’s uplifted cup.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: The Guild of Insurers,

Solicitors, and Beggars exists for the aggrandizement

of its members. This legitimate businessman’s guild is

run by Eyeless Errol, a sightless dwarf who spends much

of his time on a chair in the guildhouse listening to his

subordinates report. Eyeless Errol dresses neatly, always

matching the color of kerchief that winds around his eyeless

sockets to the color of his pants, and he smiles with

distant awareness.

Enemies and Allies: This affi liation enjoys comfortable

relations with the Restenford Assassins Guild and the worker

guilds of the city (including the Sewerworkers and the Chimney

Sweeps), walking a fi ne line between respectability and

ruthless underworld effi ciency.

Members: Most members are rogues, fighters, or arcane

casters, with a few priests of Olidammara rounding out

the roster.

The guild is highly vengeful. An EL 12 hit squad (typically

two 8th-level fi ghters and two 8th-level rogues) is dispatched

to squelch any member who attempts to leave the guild

without Errol’s express permission.

Secrets: Behind the façade of an honest businessman and

a dandifi ed hands-off owner, Eyeless Errol runs his guild

according to best practices, using double-entry accounting

and double-team extortion, and he is very hands-on despite

being eyes-off. Some whisper that he is, in fact, not blind at

all, but is simply a polymorphed dragon with blindsense;

others claim he is a mindspy doppelganger who sees through

the eyes of his victims, watching himself as he attacks. No

one ever really expects to unseat Eyeless Errol, but many

aspire to become the Insurance Boss, the Chief Solicitor, or

the Beggarmaster.

After becoming Insurance Boss, Chief Solicitor, or Beggarmaster,

you must deal with regular assassination attempts.

Either an ambitious underling or Eyeless Errol himself,

wary of your own ambition, attempts to rub you out. If you

succeed on a DC 30 Gather Information check, you learn

of the plot and do not have to face an assassination attempt

that month. If you fail to uncover the plot, you must either

succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save, with failure indicating

you have been assassinated, or play out the attack with your

DM’s help (the assassin typically has a CR of your level

minus 3).

Type: Thieves guild.

Scale: 6 (city).

Affiliation Score Criteria: To join, you must be a

probationary footpad for some months, while the guild

surveys your work. If you are sufficiently skilled, the guild

invites you to run its gauntlet, a maze of mechanical and

magic traps (and, according to some, an otyugh assassin

retained by the guild to challenge overconfident wouldbe

initiates).
