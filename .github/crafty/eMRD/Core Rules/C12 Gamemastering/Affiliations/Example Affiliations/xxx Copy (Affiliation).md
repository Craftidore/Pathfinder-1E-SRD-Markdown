Zelkarune's Horns

Symbol: A dragon skull pierced by a spear makes up the symbol of this operation. Members of the guild typically have this symbol tattooed on their arm or back while others paint it on their shield.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: Made up of barbarians, gladiators, and other skilled warriors, Zelkarune’s Horns is a popular organization. Based around Sasserine Arena in the Champion’s 

District, this group manages and organizes all of its events. In addition, the group also funds numerous hunts and expeditions to gather new creatures for the arena or simply as trophies for the walls of the adjoining hall. Due in large part to its reputation, this group is also the largest mercenary company in all of Sasserine. Members are often hired by noble houses, wealthy individuals, and even other affiliation to take on dangerous tasks.

Members of Zelkarune’s Horns pride themselves in their combat prowess, and spend a great deal of time practicing and sparring with one another. When out on a hunt, members are always on the lookout for some formidable beast to match up against and prove their skill. While many of the bouts and gladiatorial matches hosted by the group are to generate revenue, Zasker Grankus (NG male human barbarian 6/fighter 2), the group’s leader honestly enjoys entertaining the people of Sasserine. Zasker, commonly known as the “reformed barbarian,” is a charismatic and able leader. He spends most of his days talking to members about current problems and scheduling upcoming events.

Enemies and Allies: While no other organization considers Zelkarune’s Horns it enemy, many of the other more polite groups treat its members with disdain.

Members: Zelkarune’s Horns is open to members of any class, although barbarians, fighters, and rangers make up the bulk of the membership. A number of clerics of Kord, monks, and even a few arcane spellcasters can also be found on the roster.

Type: Fighting Company.

Scale: 6 (city).

Affiliation Score Criteria: To join Zelkarune’s Horns you must pay a initiation fee of 10 gp and fight one match in the arena (nonlethal, of course). Members of nonmartial classes might find that this affiliation has little to offer them.
