DRAGON ISLAND

Symbol: The symbol of Dragon Island is a

purple rampant dragon. The elder dragons chose

purple as a compromise; it doesn’t correspond

to any true dragon’s real color and thus

represents dragonkind as a whole.

Background, Goals, and Dreams:

A few miles off a remote stretch

of coastland is Dragon Island,

where humans soar over skies on

draconic steeds. In this insular

society, dragons and humans live

in concert, with dragons supplying

ancient wisdom and humans providing

industry and vitality.

Dragon Island can appear anywhere

you like in your campaign world, and you

can give it a more evocative name if you wish.

The nature of the dragons it houses (metallic or chromatic)

is deliberately undefi ned. Depending on the dictates of your

campaign, Dragon Island could be a bastion of hope or the

nexus of a gathering evil.

Members: Affi liation members are human characters who

grew up on Dragon Island, learning magic under the wing

(literally) of draconic masters and even riding loyal dragons

as steeds.

Type: Government (racial).

Scale: 12 (multiregional/kingdom).

Affi liation Score Criteria: Only humans qualify for this

affi liation because Dragon Island is an insular place with no

elves, dwarves or other humanoids. Most grew up here, but

you could also establish an affi liation with Dragon Island if

you spend years here as an adult.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Character level +1/2 PC’s level

Speak Draconic +2

Sorcerer +2

10 or more ranks in Ride +1

Donate 20,000 gp in treasure to the hoard

of a Dragon Island dragon +1

Titles, Benefi ts, and Duties: You’ll

learn from your draconic teachers, but

the most thrilling reward of affi liation

with Dragon Island is the chance to

take wing with a friendly dragon as

your fl ying steed. Doing so isn’t easy;

raising your affi liation score on Dragon

Island is diffi cult.

There are many more humans than

dragons on Dragon

Island, and the

dragons often

have better

things to do than fl y around with humans on their backs. Those who

become dragonspeakers imbibe a ritual draught containing

dragon blood; this liquid lengthens the human life span

and makes the dragons more likely to regard you as a suitable

rider. But only the best dragonspeakers are offered the

ritual that turns them into dragonriders, who are able to

command a dragon for as long as it takes a moon to wax and

then wane into nothingness. The greatest heroes of Dragon

Island mystically bond with their mounts, creating an ongoing

relationship between willing steed and rider.
