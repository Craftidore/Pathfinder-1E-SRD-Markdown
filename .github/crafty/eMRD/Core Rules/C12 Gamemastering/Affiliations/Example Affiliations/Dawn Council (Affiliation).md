Symbol: A red spire rising from an island.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: After emerging from the despotic rule of the Sea Princes. the citizens of Sasserine were reticent to return to the traditional rule under a solitary lord-mayor. Instead, rule of the city fell to seven long-standing noble families, each representing one ofthe city’s seven districts. The driving goal of the Dawn Council is to see Sasserine return to its glorious roots as a port of call for exotic trade and exploration.

Enemies and Allies: Sasserine has no shortage of enemies. The surrounding swamps are rife with bullywug tribes and other savage humanoids that constantly vex the outlying plantations and farms that support the city. The scarlet Brotherhood is a traditional enemy of the city as well, yet as of late has been making pretenses of allegiances and truces. The pirates of the Crimson Fleet are another thorn in the Dawn Council’s side, and attacks by their ships on merchants and other ships bound for the city seem to be on the rise. The churches of the city are strong supporters of the Dawn Council, assisting with coin and divine might when needed.

Members: The seven noble families that comprise the Dawn Council in clude the Lidus, the Taskerhills, the Aribanis, the Dracktuses, the Knowlerns, the Islarans, and the Lorchesters, yet in truth this affiliation comprises all of the minor nobles, sages, scribes, clerks, and others who help in the daily business of administration of the city. The Sasserine city watch is controlled by the Dawn Council, and the city’s churches have much invested in this group as well. Beyond Sasserine’s walls, agents of the Dawn Council function as ambassadors, emissaries, missionaries, or even spies.

Secrets: Not all of the noble families of Sasserine have the best interests of the city at heart. In particular, the Draktus family seems uninterested in representing its district of Shadowshore at council meetings. Emil Draktus all but stole his position on the Council from the previous title holder, and the other members are often ill at ease in his presence. Whispers that Emil has made secret allegiances with the Scarlet Brotherhood have begun to circulate.
