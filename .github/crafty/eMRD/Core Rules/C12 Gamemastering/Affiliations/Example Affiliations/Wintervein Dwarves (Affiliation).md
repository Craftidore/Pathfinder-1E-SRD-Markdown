WINTERVEIN DWARVES

Symbol: The Wintervein symbol is a triangular mountain

rent with cracks or veins.

Background, Goals, and Dreams: A collection of clans, the

Wintervein Dwarves are a cross between a nomadic tribe and

a crusading army, continually on the move against the goblinoids,

aberrations, and other horrors of the deepest caverns.

The Winterveins delve deeper into the earth than most other

dwarves, seeking out new caverns and transforming them into habitable communities. Winterveins typically secure a cavern

complex deep underground, build a fortress-city there, then

push deeper underground until they fi nd a hospitable spot

for their next city. They’re the dwarves on their race’s most

important frontier: the one that extends below the feet of all

other dwarves.

Type: Fighting company (racial).

Scale: 11 (multiregional/duchy).

Affiliation Score Criteria: The Winterveins function

like a “super-clan,” so every blood member is a dwarf. The

group has a number of nondwarf allies, but only dwarves

can earn affi liation.

The Winterveins often send clan members on scouting

or raiding missions, either in the company of their clan

comrades or with allies of other races (such as an adventuring

party). But the deeds that earn the most respect among the

Winterveins aren’t the assaults on goblin forts or mind fl ayer

strongholds—they’re the successful defense of dwarven communities

on the underground frontier when they are beset

by invading drow, vengeful duergar, or other opponents.

**Criterion Affi liation Score Modifi er**

Character level +1/2 PC’s level

Cleric, fi ghter, or paladin +1

Dwarven defender prestige class +2

Per successful mission +2

Per defense of besieged dwarf citadel +4

Titles, Benefi ts, and Duties: The Wintervein dwarves

are masters of both alchemy and genealogy, and they can

create “ancestral infusions” that give the imbiber a measure

of the fortitude and strength of their famous forebears. Those

infusions are the mechanism that

delivers your affi liation benefi ts.

When you reach a leadership position among the Winterveins,

you are the leader of a large extended family (with all

the politics that entails), and you’re the general of a dwarf

army on the march. Over the course of a single council

meeting, you might declare a crusade against a mind fl ayer

city, hire adventurers to fi nd the lost Hammer of Resounding

Rings, and placate a dwarf elder who is having a hard time

fi nding wives for his sons.
