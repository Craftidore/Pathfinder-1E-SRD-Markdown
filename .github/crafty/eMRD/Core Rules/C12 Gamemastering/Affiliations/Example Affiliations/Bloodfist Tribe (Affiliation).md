# Bloodfist Tribe (Affiliation)
## Overview
**Symbol:**  The members of the Bloodfist Tribe emblazon their shields and tents with a red upraised fist, and many dye their sword-arm gauntlets red as well.

**Background, Goals, and Dreams:**  For centuries, the Bloodfist Tribe has wandered the wilderness of the north, following great herds of elk and bison. Half-orc youths who are outcasts from human or orc communities often find their way north and join the tribe, leaving their old lives behind.

While it’s comforting to be among other half-orcs, life among the Bloodfists isn’t easy. The tribe often makes war against rival tribes of full-blooded orcs and fends off reprisals from the human communities it sometimes raids for food and supplies. Like hunter-gatherers everywhere, the Bloodfists risk starvation whenever hunting goes poorly or game is scarce. In hard times, the Bloodfist Tribe shrinks from the attrition of war, starvation, and younger members head south to seek an easier life.

The Bloodfist Tribe leaders’ primary concern is where next to march. Sometimes they make war on the orcs and giants of the northern mountains, sometimes they raid the human lands to the south, and sometimes they are content to follow the elk herds as they migrate. Leaders also spend a lot of time mediating disputes within the tribe. It’s no easy task to be the arbiter in a dispute when either aggrieved party can fly into a bloodthirsty rage at a moment’s notice.

**Type:**  Tribe (racial).

**Scale:** 6 (city).

**Affilation Score Criteria:** Only half-orcs are eligible to join the tribe. The Bloodfists have made war against orcs and humans too much to ever fully trust those not of mixed blood.


| **Criteria** | **Affiliation** <br>**Score** <br>**Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Character level | +1/2 PC’s level |
| Barbarian or shaman | +2 |
| Druid or ranger | +1 |
| Track feat | +1 |
| Assist tribe in major battle | +1 |
| Bring word of bountiful land (wilderness with plentiful game, frontier with poorly guarded villages) | +1 |
| Bring head of enemy chief to Bloodfist chieftain | +2 |

**Titles, Benefits, and Duties:** The greatest reward of affiliation with the Bloodfist Tribe is simply becoming part of a welcoming community with a shared heritage—something all too rare for half-orcs. But there’s an additional benefit: the Blood Lodge, where worthy half-orcs test their resistance to pain and the strength of their blood.

When the chieftain deems a Bloodfist member worthy, he directs the shamans to build an earthen lodge. The shamans then use flint knives to cause painful wounds to the half-orc the tribe is honoring. Then the bleeding half-orc is enclosed in the Blood Lodge and suffers pain and waking nightmares for a day and a night.

When the lodge door opens, however, the ritual has served its purpose: The tribe member emerges tougher and more cunning than before.


| **Affiliation**<br>**Score** | **Title: Benefits and Duties** |
|---|---|
| 3 or lower | Not affiliated or junior member with no benefits. |
| 4–10 | **Bloodfist Tribe Member:** +4 racial bonus on Survival checks. |
| 11–15 | **Lodge of the Bear:** +2 circumstance bonus on attempts to influence the attitude of Bloodfist half-orcs. If you are a barbarian, your rage lasts for an extra round. |
| 16–22 | **Lodge of the Dire Wolf:** +2 inherent bonus to your Charisma or Intelligence score, +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves, and +4 circumstance bonus on attempts to influence the attitude of Bloodfist half-orcs. |
| 23–29 | **Lodge of the Thunder Eagle:** +8 racial bonus on Survival checks, +2 inherent bonus to whichever ability score you didn’t raise while at the Lodge of the Dire Wolf rank, and +8 circumstance bonus on attempts to influence the attitude of Bloodfist half-orcs. |
| 30 or higher | **Lodge of the White Wyrm:** Cold resistance 10. When you emerge from the lodge, the tribe offers you a +2 weapon as a gift. |

**Executive Powers:** Plunder, raid, terrorize.
