# The Arcane Order
## Overview
**THE ARCANE ORDER**

A well-established college of wizardry, the Arcane Order is based in the ancient stronghold of Mathghamhna, a castlelike collection of towers and vaults carved from the flanks of a long-dead volcano. Students and masters alike engage in deep arcane studies, sharing with each other many of their own special insights into rare bits of arcana or spellcraft.

**Joining the Order:** Any sorcerer or wizard is welcome to join the Arcane Order. A prospective member must usually agree to cast several spells under the observation of two or more of the Order’s regents so that they can evaluate his talents. Novices (1st or 2nd level) are invited to take up residence at Mathghamhna to begin a formal education in the arts of magic. More experienced spellcasters (generally 5th level or higher) might be offered the opportunity to serve as instructors to the novices or as arcane researchers or lorekeepers at Mathghamhna. Spellcasters who are not yet qualified to be instructors, and qualified spellcasters who choose not to take on these duties, can join the order anyway. They have few obligations to the order, but receive little benefit from membership other than the right to make use of Mathghamhna’s guest quarters and peruse the order’s libraries at their convenience.

The dues are a modest 30 gp per month. In addition, students at Mathghamhna pay 200 gp per month in tuition for the instruction they receive.

**Player Benefits:** The [[Mage of the Arcane Order (PrC)|mage of the Arcane Order]] prestige class is available only to sorcerers and wizards who join the Arcane Order. 

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Members of the Arcane Order are scholars first and foremost. Indulge your curiosity and, when confronted by a difficult problem, consider whether an answer might be found with a bit of diligent research or experimentation, rather than open combat and brute force. Even more so than your spells, your brain is your most powerful weapon—don’t be reluctant to use it.

**Typical Member:** Most of the Arcane Order’s members are itinerant mages, sometimes known as associates. They do not reside at Mathghamhna, instead spending most of their time engaged in their own researches and interests. Associates usually visit the organization’s headquarters twice a year to pay their dues, consult with colleagues who remain at the college year-round, or make use of the order’s excellent libraries.

Members who choose to stay at Mathghamhna are generally known as collegians or scholars. The collegians are those mages whose primary responsibilities involve the instruction of the novices. Collegians often take long sabbaticals to pursue their own researches, but in general, they are expected to remain at Mathghamhna for several months at a time to provide a reasonable course of instruction. In exchange for their time and trouble in teaching less capable mages, collegians are paid a stipend of 30 gp per caster level per month.

Scholars are Mathghamhna’s resident researchers and lorekeepers. Unlike the collegians, they have no formal duties, but they receive no stipend either. The chief benefit they enjoy for their membership is a safe and secure home in the company of other brilliant mages who can often assist with their work.

The leaders of the order are known as regents. A regent is always an arcanist of at least 10th level. Currently, the regents include the Master Collegian (head of the college and overseer of the students), the Master Librarian, the Master of the Spellpool, the Master Diviner, and the Master Warder (responsible for Mathghamhna’s security and the conditions of the grounds). The head of the order is the Chancellor, a wizard named Japheth whose own researches concern an ancient, universal magical grammar known as Aleph or the Language Primeval.

**Prestige Classes:** The majority of Arcane Order mages eventually take levels in the [[Mage of the Arcane Order (PrC)|mage of the Arcane Order]] prestige class, if for no other reason than to gain access to the order’s potent Spellpool. In addition, many members pursue the path of the [[Loremaster (PrC)|loremaster]], reflecting the scholarly inclination of the organization. Members who are powerful enough often aspire to become archmages. It’s not unusual for a high-level member of the Arcane Order to have a couple of levels in two or three of these prestige classes, acquiring a smattering of abilities from each.
