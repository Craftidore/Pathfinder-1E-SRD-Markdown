# Seekers of the Song
## Overview
**SEEKERS OF THE SONG**

With music the world was made, and by using music the Seekers of the Song shape it further. While many members of this order of bards eventually take levels in the [[Seeker of the Song (PrC)|seeker of the song]] prestige class, most seekers are simply like-minded bards and performers who gather regularly to exchange tales, fragments of lore, and new musical works. Beneath this surface camaraderie, though, all members of the order believe in the powerful magic of the primal music, and many make it their life’s work to explore this music and master its power. Although most people are familiar with the magic within a bard’s song, the music of the seekers goes far beyond the regular power of bardic music, blending sound and power into one compelling truth.

Though some individual seekers have gone to extreme lengths in pursuit of the music’s power (ultimately turning it to evil ends), the order as a whole is more focused on trying to understand the source of this primal power, learning what it has to teach about the creation of the world and the nature of magic itself.

Few in number compared to more mainstream guilds, the membership of the Seekers of the Song still tends to be powerful. Because their goals are generally seen as little threat to law and order, seekers are generally able to operate outside the social and cultural mainstream; only occasionally will a seeker use the power of her music to assume a position of leadership within a community, adventuring party, or military force. On such occasions, the order as a whole tends to hold itself at arm’s length from the individual’s goals and actions, quickly disavowing any connection to disreputable or suspect behavior (but just as quick to seek assistance and resources from an individual seeker who attains any measure of glory and fame).

**Joining the Seekers:** The Seekers of the Song have few rules, few requirements for membership, and only the loosest of organizational structure. Joining the order is essentially a matter of a character finding other seekers and making known his desire to explore and embrace the primal music. The seekers maintain large libraries of lore and bardic magic in major cities, and though admission requires membership, another seeker’s willingness to vouch for a hopeful’s interest in the primal music is generally enough to grant it.

**Player Benefits:** Upon joining the seekers, a character first and foremost gains a forum in which to further explore the primal music and gain access to resources and training. The order’s libraries are open to all seekers willing to observe its requirements for peaceful use, and characters gain a +4 bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] and bardic knowledge checks for which they spend at least a day at the library in study and research.

Characters in the order can hail from any number of backgrounds; their ranks include many high-level NPCs often willing to provide advice and knowledge to other seekers. Though conflicts within the membership aren’t unheard of, NPC seekers tend to be friendly toward other members, and while not generally quick to provide one another with aid against physical threats, a member can usually find a seeker spellcaster willing to cast spells at a 2–5% discount below standard prices (see page 107 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** The seekers’ neverending pursuit of the knowledge of the primal music means that many of them have motivations beyond those of the rest of an adventuring group. In general, a seeker never allows this underlying need to wholly define her personality, but at the same time, her quest for the primal music provides a foundation on which other activities are built. A seeker might search out performers of renown during the group’s downtime, for example, or more fully explore the rumors related to the quest to add to the order’s collection of lore.

**Typical Guildsman:** While each seeker of the song knows that the primal music is a part of his life forevermore, each embraces it in his own way. To some, the primal music is the promise of everlasting peace, a gift to be shared and spread with an almost religious fervor. To others, primal music is a road to absolute power, allowing those skilled in its use to control what they desire and destroy what they despise. For the majority of seekers, though, the primal music is simply the foundation on which the moral and mundane concerns of their lives are built. While the beauty and the need of the music are carried always within them, their commitment to it remains first and foremost personal.

**Prestige Classes:** Almost every seeker of the song aims to take levels in the [[Seeker of the Song (PrC)|seeker of the song]] prestige class, though not all will attain that goal. Those most passionate about seeking the primal music generally focus on the bard’s path as they advance in power, but just as many seekers leave themselves free to pursue other goals as they develop their ability to produce and manipulate the primal music. Though uncommon, many of the most powerful and accomplished seekers have levels in other bardlike prestige classes such as the stormsinger (from *Frostburn*) and the war chanter (from *Complete Warrior*).

Most members of the [[Seeker of the Song (PrC)|seeker of the song]] prestige class belong to the order, but many evil bards with levels in the prestige class eschew the order to pursue the primal music exclusively for their own ends.

**Lore of the Seekers:** Seekers spread and believe in many different tales regarding the origin of the primal music. The one that has the most boisterous adherents (and sees the most rancorous debate) posits that some three thousand years past, an angelic being named Karoninwaithe brought the sounds of the primal music to Haeldriss Fey, an elf bard of great skill who devoted the rest of his days to spreading the primal music and seeking to more fully understand its power. Other sages (and even some seekers as well) claim that Karoninwaithe was actually a fiend in disguise, and that the music that the seekers touch is actually a form of infernal power. Those who espouse this theory believe in the captivating nature of the music, and they point out how creatures once controlled by a powerful seeker are often driven to seek further exposure to the primal music.

**A Seeker Campaign:** A campaign that includes the primal music as a major theme or focus offers many possibilities. The primal music can be seen as an underlying power that all characters are exposed to and will seek more of as the campaign progresses, or it might be one of many paths to power, possibly aligning with or competing against existing arcane and divine orders. Variations on the idea of primal music as a source of magical power might include establishing that primal music is the machination of a powerful evil creature or deity (possibly tying into or expanding on the opposing views surrounding the Karoninwaithe legend).
