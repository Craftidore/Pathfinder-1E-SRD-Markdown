# Appendix 1: Special Abilities
## Overview
The following appendices contain rules on special abilities and conditions, as well as a recommended reading for those seeking further inspiration.

**Appendix 1: Special abilities**

The following special abilities include rules commonly used by a number of creatures, spells, and traps.

**Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):** Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that suppress or negate magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.

**[[S3.1R-S - Universal Monster Rules R-S (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Spell-Like Abilities]] (Sp):** Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*). Spell-like abilities can be dispelled and counterspelled as normal.

**Supernatural Abilities (Su):** Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See Table 16–1 for a summary of the types of special abilities.

**Table 16–1: Special Ability Types**


| | **Extraordinary** | **Spell-Like** | **Supernatural** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dispel | No | Yes | No |
| Spell resistance | No | Yes | No |
| Antimagic field | No | Yes | Yes |
| Attack of opportunity | No | Yes | No |

*Dispel*: Can *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* and similar spells dispel the effects of abilities of that type?

*Spell Resistance:* Does spell resistance protect a creature from these abilities?

*Antimagic Field:* Does an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* or similar magic suppress the ability?

*Attack of Opportunity:* Does using the ability provoke attacks of opportunity the way that casting a spell does?

## Ability Score Bonuses
**Ability Score Bonuses**

Some spells and abilities increase your ability scores. Ability score increases with a duration of 1 day or less give only temporary bonuses. For every two points of increase to a single ability, apply a +1 bonus to the skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability.

**Strength:** Temporary increases to your Strength score give you a bonus on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The bonus also applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and to your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Dexterity:** Temporary increases to your Dexterity score give you a bonus on Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and Ref lex saving throws. The bonus also applies to your Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Constitution:** Temporary increases to your Constitution score give you a bonus on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this bonus and add that amount to your current and total hit points. When the bonus ends, remove this total from your current and total hit points.

**Intelligence:** Temporary increases to your Intelligence score give you a bonus on Intelligence-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.

**Wisdom:** Temporary increases to your Wisdom score give you a bonus on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom.

**Charisma:** Temporary increases to your Charisma score give you a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Charisma and the DC to resist your channeled energy.

**Permanent Bonuses:** Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

## Ability Score Damage, Penalty, and Drain
**Ability Score Damage, Penalty, and Drain**

[[Diseases]], [[Poisons|poisons]], [[S04 - Spells|spells]], and other abilities can all deal damage directly to your ability scores. This damage does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.

For every 2 points of damage you take to a single ability, apply a –1 penalty to skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability. If the amount of ability damage you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall unconscious until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your Constitution score. If the damage to your Constitution is equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you die. Unless otherwise noted, damage to your ability scores is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that has been damaged. Ability damage can be healed through the use of spells, such as *lesser restoration*.

Some spells and abilities cause you to take an ability penalty for a limited amount of time. While in effect, these penalties function just like ability damage, but they cannot cause you to fall unconscious or die. In essence, penalties cannot decrease your ability score to less than 1.

**Strength:** Damage to your Strength score causes you to take penalties on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The penalty also applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Dexterity:** Damage to your Dexterity score causes you to take penalties on Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and Ref lex saving throws. The penalty also applies to your Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Constitution:** Damage to your Constitution score causes you to take penalties on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total hit points. Lost hit points are restored when the damage to your Constitution is healed.

**Intelligence:** Damage to your Intelligence score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.

**Wisdom:** Damage to your Wisdom score causes you to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom.

**Charisma:** Damage to your Charisma score causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off Charisma and the DC to resist your channeled energy.

**Ability Drain:** Ability drain actually reduces the relevant ability score. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to lose skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. Ability drain can be healed through the use of spells such as *restoration*.
