# P02 - Ability Score Damage, Penalty, and Drain
## Overview
**Ability Score Damage, Penalty, and Drain**

[[Diseases]], [[Poisons|poisons]], spells, and other abilities can all deal damage directly to your ability scores. This damage does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.

For every 2 points of damage you take to a single ability, apply a â€“1 penalty to skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability. If the amount of [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|ability damage]] you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]] until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your Constitution score. If the damage to your Constitution is equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you die. Unless otherwise noted, damage to your ability scores is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that has been damaged. [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Ability damage]] can be healed through the use of spells, such as *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]*.

Some spells and abilities cause you to take an ability penalty for a limited amount of time. While in effect, these penalties function just like [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|ability damage]], but they cannot cause you to fall [[Unconscious|unconscious]] or die. In essence, penalties cannot decrease your ability score to less than 1.

**Strength:** Damage to your Strength score causes you to take penalties on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The penalty also applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Dexterity:** Damage to your Dexterity score causes you to take penalties on Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and Ref lex saving throws. The penalty also applies to your Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your Combat Maneuver Defense.

**Constitution:** Damage to your Constitution score causes you to take penalties on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total hit points. Lost hit points are restored when the damage to your Constitution is healed.

**Intelligence:** Damage to your Intelligence score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.

**Wisdom:** Damage to your Wisdom score causes you to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom.

**Charisma:** Damage to your Charisma score causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off Charisma and the DC to resist your channeled energy.

**[[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Ability Drain]]:** [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Ability drain]] actually reduces the relevant ability score. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to lose skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Ability drain]] can be healed through the use of spells such as *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]*.
