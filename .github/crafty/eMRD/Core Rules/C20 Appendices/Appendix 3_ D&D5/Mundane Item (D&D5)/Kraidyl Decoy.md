# Kraidyl Decoy
## Overview
**Price**: 88 gp

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

## Description
This simple piece of soggy [[Fantafungus|fantafungus]] or dead wood is carefully crafted so it fits easily over a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]’s head but allows it a small range of vision. While in standing water that could grant it the benefits of being in a lightly obscured area, a creature can use a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] decoy to hide in plain sight with their face just barely above the water, granting the wearer the benefits of being treated as though the creature were in a heavily obscured area. In order to get the benefits of a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] decoy, a wearer that cannot stand in the water must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against DC 20 to swim sufficiently smoothly to not arouse undue suspicion and gain the item’s benefits.
