# Mating Vencegran
## Overview
**Price**: 2000 gp (pair)

**Weight**: 1/2 lb.

## Description
This small, carapaced organic growth is easily mistaken for a simple rock (a Wisdom (Perception) check against DC 15 is required to notice otherwise) but on its underside are thousands of small, harmless tendrils that can perfectly emulate any sound. It is actually one part of an alien creature that is eventually meant to bond with its mate (when bonded, they can only be removed with a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC 25 or a Strength check against DC 20). If allowed to do so, it produces spores over a period of 8 days that grow 1d4+1 more vencegran before dying. After 8 weeks, any natal vencegran have fully matured and begin seeking a mate of their own. Vencegran have no sex and any two can be made to mate(leaving them within 10 feet of one another for 10 minutes does this), but they only ever attempt to mate with one other vencegran at a time. The strange alien physiology of a pair of mating vencegran allow them, and their users, to speak with one another over vast distances (up to 1,000 feet). Activating or deactivating a mating vencegran is a free action, but the creature requires one hand to be operated correctly.
