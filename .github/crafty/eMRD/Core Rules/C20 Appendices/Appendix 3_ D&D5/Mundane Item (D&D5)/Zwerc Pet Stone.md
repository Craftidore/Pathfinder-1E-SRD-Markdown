**Price**: —

**Weight**: 1/2 lbs.

## Description
Some [[Zwerc|zwerc]] take the “defender of the earth” aspect one step further than just learning the [[Zwerc]] Knight feat and adopt a pet rock. They carry around this rock, convinced that failing at their task is letting down their pet rock. This conviction enhances the [[Zwerc]] Knight feat and enhances the duration of its benefits by 1 round per activation. [[Zwerc]] pet rocks can be any rock, but a [[Zwerc|zwerc]] needs to carry one rock around, talking to it and becoming accustomed to its weight and feel for at least one week to gain benefits. Other than that, loss of a pet rock just means that a [[Zwerc|zwerc]] has to choose a new rock and “get used to it” once again.
