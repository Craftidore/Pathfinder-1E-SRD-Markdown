**Price**: 50 gp

**Weight**: 2 lbs.

## Description
Cheerful and full of mirth, the [[Dødelig|dødelig]] enjoy bringing some music to their fights. Unfortunately, not everyone seems to agree and thus, this invention was born. The bandolier features a selection of semi- elastic straps that are tautly attached to an instrument as well as to up to two light melee weapons. The [[Dødelig|dødelig]] make perfect use of their skeletal nature and wire these straps through their ribcages to properly set them up—only [[Dødelig|dødelig]] can use a [[Dødelig|dødelig]] instrument bandolier. As a reaction to an enemy moving or attacking, a [[Dødelig|dødelig]] wearing these straps can let go of her instrument, making it flip to her bandolier, sheathing it, as well as drawing up to two weapons. Similarly, a [[Dødelig|dødelig]] may let go of the weapons and thus draw her instrument. Pulling the straps of the harness properly taut requires 1 minute of uninterrupted preparation. A bandolier can be used 10 times before its straps need to be drawn taut again. Using a bandolier to draw or sheathe weapons or instruments does not provoke opportunity attacks. The straps have a damage threshold of 2, 10 hit points each, and a bandolier that loses one strap is considered to be broken. A bandolier that loses two straps is destroyed.
