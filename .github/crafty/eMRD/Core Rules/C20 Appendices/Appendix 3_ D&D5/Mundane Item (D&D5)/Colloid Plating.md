**Price**: 200 gp per plate

**Weight**: 2 lbs. per plate

## Description
The [[Colliatur|colliatur]] have learned to specially treat certain components of colloid-absorbed material to generate reflective plates that can be applied to any shield or armor. A [[Colliatur|colliatur]] can attune the inherent harmonics of his crystalline proportions to resonate with one item that has colloid plating by wearing an item for 24 hours. A [[Colliatur|colliatur]] can only be attuned to colloid plating on one item at a given time and this does not count as being attuned to a magical armor. A light armor can hold one colloid plate. A medium armor can hold two colloid plates. A heavy armor can hold up to three colloid plates. For each such plate added and attuned, the plating allows a [[Colliatur|colliatur]] to use the crystal refraction racial feature an additional time per day. The added weight of these plates, however, does impose disadvantage on Stealth. Additionally, a wearer of a colloid plated armor needs to have a minimum Strength score of 11 to wear an armor with one colloid plating, a minimum of Strength 13 to wear an armor with two colloid plates and a minimum Strength of 16 to wear an armor with three colloid plates attached. Shields can hold up to 2 colloid plates and require a minimum Strength of 11 to wield with one plating attached, 13 to wield one with two plates attached.
