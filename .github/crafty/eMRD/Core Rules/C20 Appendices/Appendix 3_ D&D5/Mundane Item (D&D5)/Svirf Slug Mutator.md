**Price**: 20 gp

**Weight**: 1 lb.

## Description
This mixture of powders and alchemical ingredients can be massaged into a svirf slug to cause it to grow stalks that can integrate weaponry and allow the svirf slugs to perform melee attacks. (See [[Svirf Riding Slug|svirf riding slug]] for details). A second application reverts the process and frees the weapon from the stalk, allowing [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] to change weapons of the slugs via multiple applications of the svirf slug mutator.
