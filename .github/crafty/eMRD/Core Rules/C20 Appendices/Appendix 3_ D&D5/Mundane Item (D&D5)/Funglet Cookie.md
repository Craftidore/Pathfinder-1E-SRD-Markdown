**Price**: 50 gp

**Weight**: 1/2 lbs.

## Description
These grey, but often lavishly “frosted” cakes usually sport designs of fluorescent mushrooms, underworld-bumblebees and similar happy motifs. They look positively delicious and are just that... to [[Funglets|funglets]]. Made of pressed and baked guano, algae, mushrooms and decaying materials, no other creature can stomach them. Any creature without a sense of smell (the only ones liable to fall for this) tricked into eating one immediately vomits and gains the poisoned condition for 1d4 rounds. [[Funglets]] eating such a cookie, however, feel energized and gain advantage to Dexterity-based saving throws and checks for 1d4 minutes. Eating a [[Funglets|funglet]] cookie does not provide any proper nutrients, though—instead, the [[Funglets|funglet]] becomes very hungry after its duration has elapsed. Failure to eat twice as much during the next long or short rest results in the [[Funglets|funglet]] incurring a level of exhaustion until consuming a proper meal. This cannot increase the exhaustion level beyond 5. A [[Funglets|funglet]] can only benefit from one [[Funglets|funglet]] cookie, before requiring a long rest and proper food to once again gain any benefits from consuming one.
