# Sponged Undercoral
## Overview
**Price**: 160 gp

**Weight**: 1 lb.

## Description
This strange, mutely colored, porous rock can be cut and affixed to any surface. Whenever a creature with an odor approaches within 30 feet of a sponged undercoral, the coral exudes an odor of its own. This odor is easily detected by creatures with *Keen Smell* but is otherwise not noticeable. After being exposed to the skin of a creature, a sponge undercoral registers their scent and no longer exudes an odor when they approach. After being affixed to a surface, sponged undercoral remains there until destroyed. It has a 16 hit points and is 4 inches thick. Sponged undercoral works normally [[Underwater|underwater]].
