# Anchoring Bolt
## Overview
**Price**: 50 gp

**Weight**: 1/2 lb.

## Description
The heads of these odd crossbow bolts are fitted with many different pieces of stone and an extremely sharp, hard adamantine bit the size of an infantâ€™s fingernail. [[Dvergr]] use this unique ammunition to bring down ceilings and start tumbling ambushes of stone. They find purchase when fired upon any surface, able to bear up to 600 pounds (so long as an attached rope remains intact). Anchor bolts embedded into a surface may be used as impromptu pitons. Anchoring bolts cannot be re-used.
