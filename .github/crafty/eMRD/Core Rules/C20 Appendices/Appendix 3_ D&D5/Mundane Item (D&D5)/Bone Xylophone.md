# Bone Xylophone
## Overview
**Price**: 600 gp

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

## Description
This instrument has two metal stands that fold out and two leather straps to wear around the shoulders. A descending series of bones lay parallel to one another, each emitting a different, eerie sound when struck. Bone xylophones are made from the bones of destroyed [[Dødelig|dødelig]], and every musical note from one of these unique musical instruments resonates with the primal magic of their race. A [[Dødelig|dødelig]] proficient with using these xylophones adds +2 to his proficiency bonus to make ability checks with this instrument.
