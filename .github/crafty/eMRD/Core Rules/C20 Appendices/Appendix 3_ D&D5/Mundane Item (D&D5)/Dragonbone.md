# Dragonbone
## Overview
**Price**: +600 gp

**Weight**: 20 lbs.

## Description
Venerated by the [[Draaki|draaki]] tribes, items made from the bones of the powerful beasts they once enslaved have lasted the ages and are carried by their elders with pride and distinction. Some are said to know of hidden graveyards where ancient stores of the valuable material were kept by the Progenitors, but the appearance of a new dragonbone in a [[Draaki|draaki]] settlement is a rare, celebrated occurrence. By selecting only choice bones, a weaponsmith can produce one simple or martial weapon for a creature two sizes smaller than the dragon, two simple or martial weapons for creatures three sizes smaller than the dragon, or four simple or martial weapons for creatures four sizes smaller than the dragon. A weaponsmith may produce twice that amount of weapons with the light property, half that amount of weapons with the heavy property. In each case, enough bone is available to produce at least a single light or medium weapon per difference in size category, provided that the dragon is Medium or larger.

Dragonbone weapons that deal slashing or piercing damage deal 1 additional point of damage of their type on a successful hit (this damage multiplies on a critical hit). If the dragonbone comes from a dragon that had immunity or resistance to an energy type, the wielder may spend 1 Hit Die from his available Hit Dice to regain hit points upon resting to temporarily rekindle the power of the dragonbone. If he does, the dragonbone weapon’s damage type changes to the energy associated with the dragon from which it was carved. Because dragonbone weapons aren’t made of metal, druids can use them without penalty.

Dragonbone weapons cost three times as much as much as metal weapons of that type, plus the cost above, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary weapons of that type. Dragonbone has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and a damage threshold of 15. The bone of a dragon is typically between 1 inch and 2 inches thick. Dragons usually do not take kindly to their bones being made into weaponry.
