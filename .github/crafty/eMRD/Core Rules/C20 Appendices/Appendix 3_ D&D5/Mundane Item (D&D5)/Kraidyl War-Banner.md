# Kraidyl War-Banner
## Overview
**Price**: 180 gp

**Weight**: 14 lbs.

## Description
This is little more than a sturdy pole (typically made from [[Fantafungus|fantafungi]] or bone) with a large cross at its top that bears the grisly remains of a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]’s fallen foes. When correctly fashioned, however, the arrangement of these barbaric trophies becomes disturbing to look upon, granting its bearer proficiency with Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against non-[[Dødelig|dødelig]] and non-[[Dvergr|dvergr]] underworld dwellers. [[Dødelig]] are simply too carefree and [[Dvergr|dvergr]] too stoic. The haft of a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] war-banner can be made into a spear, but attacks with it suffer from disadvantage. Crafting a properly fear-inducing [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] war-banner requires a DC 18 Intelligence (Religion) check.
