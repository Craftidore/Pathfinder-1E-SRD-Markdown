# Moss Net
## Overview
**Price**: 30 gp

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

## Description
These tiny items seem to be little more than a compressed ball of green mass.

Made from highly compacted moss and treated with mysterious substances known only to the [[Ahooling|ahooling]] (and [[Ahool|ahool]]), when thrown against an object a moss net instantly expands to completely cover a 5 ft square or any Medium or smaller target occupying it.

A moss net operates exactly as a net does normally with a few key differences. A creature struck by a moss net also suffers from all the penalties a prone creature does, with the singular exception that once they are free of the moss net, no action is required to stand. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 20, 20 hit points and a damage threshold of 5. Dealing 5 points of slashing damage to the net destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section. Additionally, a moss net is extremely susceptible to flameâ€”even a single point of fire damage exceeding the damage threshold completely destroys it.

A moss net that hits an area covers it entirely in vegetation, making it into difficult terrain until it is cleared or burned away.
