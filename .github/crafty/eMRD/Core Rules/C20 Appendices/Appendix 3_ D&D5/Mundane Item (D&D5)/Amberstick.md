# Amberstick
## Overview
**Price**: 300 gp

**Weight**: 1/2 lb.

## Description
The [[Dvergr|dvergr]] originally learned how to make ambersticks from a [[Zwerc|zwerc]] enclave, but it seemed to be wiped away from existence not long afterward. The process required to craft these dangerous objects dries and treats ore from the Amber Roads, depriving it of its innate magic. At the end of the undertaking, what is left is an a highly unstable substance that becomes extremely volatile when lit.

As an action, you can light and throw this stick up to 60 ft. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the amberstick as an improvised weapon. Ambersticks explode at the end of the turn they are lit, erupting into a 20-ft. -radius sphere from the point the stick occupies at the end of your turn. Each creature in that radius must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) or take 2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.
