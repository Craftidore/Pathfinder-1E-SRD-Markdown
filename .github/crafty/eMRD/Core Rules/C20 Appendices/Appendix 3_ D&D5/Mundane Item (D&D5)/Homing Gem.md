# Homing Gem
## Overview
**Price**: 1200 gp

**Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

## Description
To the untrained eye, this beautiful multi-faceted jewel is a prize, perfectly cut and easily worth 2,000 gold or more. The gem is a falsehood, howeverâ€”a Wisdom (Perception) check against DC 25 reveals that complex technological devices within it send a strong signal attuned to be picked up by a device similar to a [[Magic Detector|magic detector]]. A homing detector is effective to a range of up to 10 miles, costs 600 gp (included above), and has a damage threshold of 3, and 20 hit points. Homing detectors can remain active indefinitely, granting advantage to Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track the location of the homing gem it is attuned to. Reattuning a homing detector to a new homing gem takes 8 hours of direct contact between the two objects.

Only svirf scientists can craft magic detectors; doing so requires the expenditure of 2 science dice as part of the crafting process.
