# Underslick
## Overview
**Price**: 30 gp

**Weight**: —

## Description
The sightless men are extremely sensitive, their hearing far surpassing that of normal mortals. The very sound of combat, swords swinging or whips striking, pains their finely tuned hearing and can sometimes be an impediment. To ease the stress of battle, the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] create underslick, coating their weapons in the sticky tar, making their blades and missiles sail through the air without making a sound. Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice weapons treated with underslick are made at disadvantage. A weapon coated in underslick remains so for 4 hours or until subjected to fire.
