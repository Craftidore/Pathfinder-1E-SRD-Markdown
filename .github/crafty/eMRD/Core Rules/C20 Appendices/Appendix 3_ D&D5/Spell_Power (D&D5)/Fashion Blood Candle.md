**Duration**: 1 minute per level or hit die of the creature used

## Effects
1 minute per level or hit die of the creature used You fashion a *[[Blood Candle|blood candle]]* from the corpse of a deceased creature to fulfill your due to the forces of Hel (see **Toll of Souls** in the [[Gitwerc]] Traits section). Until you have fulfilled your due each level, you do not gain any benefits from doing so—you are only doing the bidding of the forces of Hel, after all. However, once you have condemned a number of souls equal to your level to Hel, the dark forces reward you for providing more than what’s required. Any additional soul condemned to hell allows you to gain the immediate benefits of a short rest upon the *[[Blood Candle|blood candle]]* burning down, while also granting you 1/2 the creature’s hit dice (rounded down, minimum 1) as bonus hit dice to spend. You can receive this benefit only once in any 24-hour period.
