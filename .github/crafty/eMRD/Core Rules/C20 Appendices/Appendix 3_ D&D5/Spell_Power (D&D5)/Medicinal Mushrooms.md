# Medicinal Mushrooms
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Funglets|funglet]] druids, clerics and rangers.***

**Level**: 1st
#Spell-Level/1st

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (mushrooms)

**Duration**: 1 day

## Effects
You make 2d4 ounces of freshly picked fungus caps magical. You (as well as any other druid) can immediately discern which mushrooms are affected. Each transmuted mushroom provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. Eating 1 ounce of these caps reduces the level of exhaustion by 1. However, these caps are also hallucinogenic: If a creature willingly eats more than one ounce of these caps in a given day, the creature is haunted by psychedelic hallucinations. The hallucinating creature suffers disadvantage to all Strength and Dexterity saving throws and skill checks and automatically fails all Wisdom saving throws.
