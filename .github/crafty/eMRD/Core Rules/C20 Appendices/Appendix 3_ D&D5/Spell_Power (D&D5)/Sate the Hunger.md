#Spell-School/Necromancy

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you reduce a creature with your bite to 0 hit points.

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Effects
This spell can only be cast as you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or less with your bite. The creature that took damage as part of this spell’s casting immediately dies as the bones in your jaws distend and disjoint, and in one gloriously bloody moment, you swallow the dead creature whole with a sickening crunch. You gain a pool of profane points equal to the creature’s challenge, which you can spend in the following ways as part of making a melee attack:

***Blessing of the Dark.*** You can expend 1 profane point to change the damage your bite inflicts to necrotic damage for 1 round.

***Protected from the Light.*** You can expend 2 profane points to lose your radiant vulnerability for the duration of this spell.

***Unmatched Savagery.*** You can expend 3 profane points when you roll your bite’s damage dice to reroll them and use either total.

Any unused profane points that remain at the end of the spell are lost. A given [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] can only benefit once from this spell in any given 24-hour period.
