# Mushroom Mount
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Funglets|funglet]] druids and clerics.***

**Level**: 4th
#Spell-Level/4th

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (mushroom)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.

## Effects
You enchant a benign, unintelligent mushroom of large size or smaller; the fungus uproots itself and attaches to you. Wrapping rhizomorphs envelop your legs and you move as one. Your fused form has a speed of 20 feet, moving along in a violent hop (typically in small 5 foot high jumps—beware the ceiling!) and thus ignore difficult terrain. While fused to a mushroom mount you are immune to the prone condition and you do not provoke opportunity attacks (and may not make them either). Whenever any creature makes a melee attack against you, the mushroom mount, as a reaction, expels a forceful cloud of spores that momentarily muddle all of your assailant’s senses, making any extra attacks the target can perform against you beyond the first suffer from disadvantage.
