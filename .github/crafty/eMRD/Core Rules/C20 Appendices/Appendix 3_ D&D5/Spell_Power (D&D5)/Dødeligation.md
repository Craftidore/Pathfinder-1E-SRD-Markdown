# Dødeligation
## Overview

**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Duration**: 1 hour or until dispelled

## Effects
As part of the casting of this spell, you join the bodies of yourself and two other undead creatures (either [[Dødelig|dødelig]], Small skeletons or Medium skeletons). Your size increases to Large, granting you advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, 3d10 temporary hit points, and your melee attacks deal an extra 1d8 damage of the type your attack usually inflicts. The other two creatures formed into your body have heads that poke out on either side from you and if capable of speech, may speak freely, but can take no other actions. If you are dropped to 0 hit points or less, the spell immediately ends and the two other creatures appear beside you, completely unharmed.

***At higher levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may join with six other creatures to increase your size to Huge. You gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, 6d10 temporary hit points, and your melee attacks have 10-foot reach and deal an extra 2d8 damage.
