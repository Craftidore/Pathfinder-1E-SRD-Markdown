## Effects
Part of the casting of this spell requires cooking up a stew and baking rolls (preferably vvor-stew with balak blood rolls). [[Dweorg]] often prepare their stew on special occasions to celebrate new allies or welcome home traveling kin. One spell can affect up to 16 ounces of stew.

[[Dweorg]] stew has an amazing medicinal effect, though it does not last long after being prepared – it has to be consumed within 2 minutes after the spell has been cast. A creature that consumes four ounces or more of *[[Dweorg|dweorg]]** stew* (a process that takes 10 rounds) gains the benefits of a short rest. A character eating *[[Dweorg|dweorg]]** stew* may immediately spend one or more Hit Dice and if he does, he gains two free, additional Hit Dice to spend, which are bestowed by the stew’s healing enhancing properties. These additional Hit Dice must be spent immediately upon finishing eating the stew or they are lost.
