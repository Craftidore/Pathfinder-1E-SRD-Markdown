# Amber Shortcut
## Overview
***The following spell is available for all [[Zwerc]] spellcasters.***

**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Conjuration
#Spell-School/Conjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a topaz)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

## Effects
As part of casting this spell, you and any creatures touching you walk directly into and through a stone wall, as you temporarily pass through up to 500 feet of stone with a passage of the Amber Roads, instantaneously reappearing on the other side of the stone on the closest vertical surface, provided there is one. If there is no eligible vertical surface, you instead reappear on a non-vertical surface. If there is no place where you could reappear, the Amber Road violently expels you and all passengers at the point where you cast the spell, dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you and all creatures touching you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may pass an additional 500 feet or rock per level, but also increase the damage you take, should you be violently expelled by +1d6.
