# Amber Road Disjunction
## Overview
***The following spell is available to*** ***[[Zwerc|zwerc]]****** druids, warlocks, and wizards.***

**Level**: 5th
#Spell-Level/5th

**School**: Conjuration
#Spell-School/Conjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of amber)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Effects
You teleport a part of the Amber Road into the material realm and around a creature or object. Objects immediately take 4d8 bludgeoning damage, as the amber encasing starts crushing them. Creatures targeted must make a Strength saving throw. The creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one. Succeeding at this initial save also immediately ends the spell. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is encased in amber and immediately begins suffocating. Creatures encased in amber may use their action to try to burst free by succeeding a Strength saving throw. Allied creatures can try to break the amber casing by attacking from the outside. The amber encasing has 40 hit points and has resistance to radiant, piercing and slashing damage, immunity to necrotic and poison damage and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th. Additionally, the amber encasingâ€™s hit points increase by +10 per spell slot level above 5th.
