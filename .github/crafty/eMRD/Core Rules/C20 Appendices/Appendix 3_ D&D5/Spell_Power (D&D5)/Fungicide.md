# Fungicide
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Funglets|funglet]] druids and clerics.***

**Level**: 6th
#Spell-Level/6th

**School**: Conjuration
#Spell-School/Conjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (2 ft. of fungal liana)

**Duration**: Permanent

## Effects
You designate a point within range and huge-sized mushrooms sprout from the ground in a 30-foot radius and attempt to consume any nearby sentient creatures. For the duration, these fungi turn the ground into difficult terrain. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the grasping fungi until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the fungi takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the fungi can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
