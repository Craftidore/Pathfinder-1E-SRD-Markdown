# Crystal Expulsion
## Overview
***The following spell is recommended for sorcerers, warlocks and wizards only.***

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

**School**: Evocation
#Spell-School/Evocation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

## Effects
You open your palms and from them a spray of dazzling, iridescent crystals spring forth. All creatures in range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the crystals meld through the targets, dealing 6d4 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save. Creatures are never killed by this spell, only knocked unconscious.
