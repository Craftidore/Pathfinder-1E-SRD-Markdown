You speak the words of power, point at a target and from your hands, a massive, fungal forest springs forth, coating any floor, wall and similar surface within half a mile, instantly generating a new fungal forest. Scrolls and elixirs containing this extremely powerful spell are highly coveted throughout the Underworld for their ability to instantly create an ecosystem; [[Dweorg|dweorg]] legends tell of battles won with the aid of this surprise terrain and civilizations built on the back of a *mushroom apotheosis*. The entire area becomes filled with mushrooms of every variety (at least two instances of each type). Roll on the table below (a number of times equal to your level) to determine which types dominate the spread of mushrooms created by this spell.
