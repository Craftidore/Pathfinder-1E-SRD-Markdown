## Requirements and Restrictions
You choose one of your race’s ancestral enemies, either the [[Colliatur|colliatur]] or the [[Draaki|draaki]]. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra +1d6 damage to the chosen race whenever you hit a member of it with a weapon attack. Additionally, this spell attunes you to the habits of your race’s foes, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made against the chosen race.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you apply the benefits of the spell to both [[Draaki|draaki]] and [[Colliatur|colliatur]]—you do not need to select one race. When you cast this spell using a 5th level or higher spell slot, you can maintain your concentration on this spell up to 24 hours.
