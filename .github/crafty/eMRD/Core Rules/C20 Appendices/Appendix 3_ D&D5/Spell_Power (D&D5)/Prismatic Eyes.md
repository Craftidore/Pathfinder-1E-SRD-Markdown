# Prismatic Eyes
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] spellcasters at the GM’s discretion.***

**Level**: 4th
#Spell-Level/4th

**School**: Illusion
#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (crystalline shards)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

## Effects
Your eyes take on a scintillating, diverse sheen of prismatic energy, shooting forth a prismatic blast at a target in range. Make a ranged spell attack against one target within range. If you manage to hit the target, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to see through the illusory nature of this spell. On a success, the spell ends harmlessly; on a failure, roll 1d8 to determine the illusory prismatic color that hits the target and resolve the effects accordingly. If an effect of *prismatic eyes* duplicates a spell, said spell is treated as though it was a 4th level spell or cast via a 4th level spell slot, regardless of its usual level.
