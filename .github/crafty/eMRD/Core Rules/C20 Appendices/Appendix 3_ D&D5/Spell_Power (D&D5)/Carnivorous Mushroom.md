# Carnivorous Mushroom
## Overview
***The following spell is available to*** ***[[Funglets|funglet]]****** druids and clerics.***

**Level**: 5th
#Spell-Level/5th

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (drops of blood from two different types of creatures)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute.

## Effects
When cast on an intelligent mushroom, [[Funglets|funglet]] (or one under the effects of the *[[Mushroom Mount|mushroom mount]]* spell) the targets grow teeth and a carnivorous appetite; they gain a bite attack (1d6 for medium, 1d10 for large and 2d6 for huge) with a bonus to hit equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). On a successful hit the mushrooms impose the grappled condition on their victims; when one of these mushrooms maintains a grapple for more than one round, they deliver a nasty toxin. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell-save DC. On a failure, it takes 4d10 poison damage, or half as much on a successful save.

The mushrooms have a Strength (Athletics) check equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) for purposes of contesting the grapple.
