# Umbral Step
## Overview
***The following spell is available exclusively to [[Drow|drow]] spellcasters devoted to Naraneus.***

**Level**: 5th
#Spell-Level/5th

**School**: Conjuration
#Spell-School/Conjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you or an adjacent ally is disengaging from a hostile creature

**Range**: 500 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (atrophied plant)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You or a creature touched by you gains the ability to pass through a shadow (including your own) and appear from another shadow within range of the spell. Stepping into a shadow is treated as disengaging and thus does not provoke an opportunity attack, though emerging from a shadow can provoke an opportunity attack. You can only cast this spell if you have a shadow.
