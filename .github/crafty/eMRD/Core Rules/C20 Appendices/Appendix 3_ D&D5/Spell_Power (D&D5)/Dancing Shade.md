## Effects
As you cast this spell, you animate your shadow, which shields you from harm. This shadowy shield can absorb up to your current hit points before disappearing. This protection extends to physical attacks as well as spells and effects that deal radiant and lightning damage. Since this is a shield in front of you and not temporary hit points, attacks absorbed thus do not prompt concentration-checks from you. If the spell is dismissed before its maximum number of hit points is expended, you suffer from no ill effects. However, if the shadow absorbs the maximum amount of hit points possible, it dissipates, leaving you without a shadow for a number of days equal to your level. You can only cast this spell if you have a shadow.
