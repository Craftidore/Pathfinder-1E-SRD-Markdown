## Effects
You touch a willing creature and shrink them, hiding them inside of a gem. Only gems of a value equal to the creature’s hit dice x 100 gp are able to contain them, but inside of these jewels they have luxurious comfort and enough air to be sustained for as long as the spell’s duration. A creature benefiting from *gem sanctuary* can end the effect at any time. The gem is consumed upon the end of the spell’s duration.
