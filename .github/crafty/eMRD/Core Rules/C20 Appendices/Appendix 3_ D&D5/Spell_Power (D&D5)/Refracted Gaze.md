# Refracted Gaze
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] spellcasters at the GM's discretion.***

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

**School**: Illusion
#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V,S,M (a broken mirror)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Effects
Choose a creature within range. You cause the target’s sight-based vision to become completely unreliable, causing multiple refractions to disjoint their perception if the target fails a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, 1d4 refractions are created. At the start of the creature’s turn, they may attempt to act against the refraction they believe to be correct, rolling randomly to see whether the selected refraction is real or a figment. When the correct refraction is chosen, the creature may act normally. When the incorrect refraction is chosen, they travel in a random direction and perform the actions they would have attempted (making attack rolls at empty squares, running into walls, and so on). A creature may close its eyes to negate all of the effects of *refracted gaze* (effectively becoming blind for the duration), though opening its eyes at any time before the spell ends causes any remaining refractions to reappear.

***At higher levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional refractions per spell slot beyond 2nd, up to a total of +6 refractions when using a spell slot of 5th level.
