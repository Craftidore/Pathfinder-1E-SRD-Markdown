## Effects
You and all other subjects gather together in a circle and meld minds, pooling your collective memories in a matrix of light that exchanges information at the speed of light. You may make a number of Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma-checks equal to the total number of subjects (minimum 2). You automatically benefit from the help action on these checks and are proficient in any skills a participant is proficient in. You also use the highest Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma modifier of the participants for these checks. There lies danger in this melding of minds—for each check you fail, you take 4d6 psychic damage, as your mind has trouble reconciling the massive influx of information and redistributing it among the participants. [[Colliatur]] are uniquely suited for this type of information sharing—for each [[Colliatur|colliatur]] participating in this ritual beyond the first, reduce the psychic damage incurred on a failure by 1d6.
