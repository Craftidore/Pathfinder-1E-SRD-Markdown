**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of stones)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Effects
You create a 20-foot-radius animated spherical cloud of earth and rocks, originating from an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The space of origin must feature rocks or earth or the spell fails. The cloud lasts for the spell’s duration and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your hand (or other appendage). The cloud is considered to be an object that has AC 16 and hit points equal to 1/2 your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 16 (+3) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The cloud doesn’t fill its space and can move through all creatures smaller than itself since it is partially immaterial. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the cloud up to 30 feet and cause one of the following effects.

***Barrier Cloud.*** The cloud forms a barrier between you and a creature you choose until you give it a different command. The cloud moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can move through the cloud unimpeded if its Strength score is equal to or greater than that of the cloud. If the target’s Strength score is less than that of the cloud, it treats the cloud as difficult terrain.

***Churning Cloud.*** You can command the cloud to expend its magic, enhancing the potency of the exploding earth class feature and ending the spell. Creatures within the cloud it suffer disadvantage to their saving throws against exploding earth until the end of your next turn.

***Propelling Cloud.*** You can command the cloud to expend its magic, enhancing the range of the exploding earth class feature. You can affect creatures flying up to 15 feet above the cloud with exploding earth until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher (or learn this as a 4thlevel or higher secret of the stone), you may use the churning cloud and propelling cloud functions of the spell each an additional time per spell slot above 3rd before the spell’s magic dissipates from the exertion.
