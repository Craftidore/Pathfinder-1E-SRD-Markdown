#Spell-School/Conjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a chunk of tungsten)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You cast the target of this spell into a set of shadow shackles, as you command your magic-infused shadow to confine the target, molding it into one shackle per arm and leg. The creature affected must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, your shadow anchors the target to the spot, preventing any movementâ€”the target has effectively a Speed of 0 ft., but is not restrained. On a successful save, the spell ends. Additionally, for as long as even a single one of the shadowy chains remains, the target must make a Constitution saving throw each round. On a failed save, the target receives 3d6 cold damage. *Shadow shackles* have an AC of 18, a damage threshold of 10 and 20 hit points. The spell remains in effect until you cease to concentrate or until the *shadow shackles* are destroyed, whereupon your shadow crawls back to you to reassemble. This reassembly takes 5 rounds, during which you have no functional shadow. You can only cast this spell if you have a shadow.
