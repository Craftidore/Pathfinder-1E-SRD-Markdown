#Spell-School/Illusion

## Effects
You create a small sphere of shadow-essence that you can hurl as a ranged spell attack at one target. The sphere causes the creature hit to see distracting movement out of the corner of their eye. On a hit, the first attack against the target gains advantage. At the end of each of the targetâ€™s turns, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.
