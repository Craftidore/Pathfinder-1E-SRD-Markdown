## Description
This slim, crystalline object is extremely small, perhaps the size and shape of a fingernail. When implanted in the body of a creature, requiring a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check, they are able to communicate with anyone bearing a crystalline implant keyed to the same frequency. This effect functions exactly like *telepathic bond*, save that it is permanent and operates inside of an *antimagic field* (although under these conditions, its range is reduced to 30 feet).

Furthermore, creatures may cast cure spells and spells from the divination school with a range of touch through the telepathic bond generated by crystalline implants.

Keying a crystalline implant to a frequency requires attunement and an Intelligence (Arcana) check against DC 15.
