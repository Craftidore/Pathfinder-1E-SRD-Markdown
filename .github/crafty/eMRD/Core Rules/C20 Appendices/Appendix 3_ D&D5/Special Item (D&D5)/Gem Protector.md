# Gem Protector
## Overview

**Group**: Wondrous Items

**Rarity**: Rare

## Description
There’s absolutely nothing remarkable about this small piece of wood and you wonder why on Aventyr anyone would wear something so obviously unfashionable. All of the gems and jewels in the possession of a creature wearing a *gem protector* appear to be unremarkable (if quite beautiful) stones of little value. As soon as a gem is no longer in the creature’s possession it is revealed to be a jewel, but otherwise only physical interaction and a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw breaks the illusion.
