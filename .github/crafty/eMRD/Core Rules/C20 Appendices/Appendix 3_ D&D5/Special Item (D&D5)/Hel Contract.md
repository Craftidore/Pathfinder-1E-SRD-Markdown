This long, flowing scroll make a curious, scraping noise as it drags along the ground. A [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this whip-like contract. When you attack a creature with this contract and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 fire damage. You are empowered, as you siphon off a fraction of the targetâ€™s soul and gain 10 temporary hit points.
