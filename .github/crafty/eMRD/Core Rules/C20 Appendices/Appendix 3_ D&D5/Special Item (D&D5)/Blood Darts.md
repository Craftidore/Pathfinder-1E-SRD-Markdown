## Description
These obscenely dangerous slivers of obsidian are hazardous to handle for non-[[Ahooling|ahoolings]] (they take 1 point of slashing damage for each round it is held) but far more deadly to targets struck by them. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these darts. Additionally, when you strike an opponent with these darts, he has to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). If the subject fails its save, the dart extracts knowledge from their blood. An [[Ahooling|ahooling]] can lick the blood from the dart and reliably answer 1d4 of the following questions:

- Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known.)
- What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role.)
- How was your blood last shed before being hit by the blood dart? (Brief outline of the events that caused its wound, to the best of the victimâ€™s knowledge.)
- When was your blood last shed before being hit by the *blood dart*?

*Blood darts* usually come in sets of 10. They can be reused.
