# Alien Antennae
## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: Wondrous Items

**Rarity**: Common

## Description
These simple (and remarkably pliable) bands are made from the antennae of a dead [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], but may be worn around either the head or neck. A creature wearing *alien antennae* can join in the *telepathic bond* effect of the [[Alien Communication]] feat, even if there already are the maximum amount of people involved. Provided that they have enough hair (a few strands no less than 5 inches long) or some other kind of thin tendril on their body (weapon cords, strings for clothing and the like) to act as their antennae for its use. *Alien antennae* always come in pairs.
