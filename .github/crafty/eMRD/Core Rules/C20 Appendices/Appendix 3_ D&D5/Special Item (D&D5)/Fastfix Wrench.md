**Rarity**: Very rare
#Special-Item-Rarity/Very-rare

**Attunement**: *(requires attunement)*

## Description
The metallic, thin and oddly-shaped club is made from a material that gleams unnaturally and you canâ€™t help but wonder what the strange head of the weapon is intended to do. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, this wrench can be used to not only repair inanimate objects and heal constructs, but also to temporarily enhance them. In addition, while you are attuned to this item, leaving the *fastfix wrench* unattended on an object or construct heals it for 1d4 hit points after an hour. The wielder of a *fastfix wrench* can also, once per 24 hours, double the damage threshold of an object for 10 minutes.
