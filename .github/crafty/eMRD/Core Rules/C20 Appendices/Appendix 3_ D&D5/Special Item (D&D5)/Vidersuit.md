## Description
This *[[Mycelosuits|mycelosuit]]* filters the light reaching the wearer’s eyes, bathing it in enchanted infrared that grants the user darkvision (if they already have darkvision, they gain superior darkvision instead). Additionally, tendrils of fungi constantly probe the earth and stone the wearer stands on, granting them stonecunning as though they were a dwarf (if they already have Stonecunning, increases the bonus to thrice the wearer’s proficiency bonus). These suits are made from [[Videre Spongos|twilight caps]] ([[Videre Spongos|videre spongos]]).
