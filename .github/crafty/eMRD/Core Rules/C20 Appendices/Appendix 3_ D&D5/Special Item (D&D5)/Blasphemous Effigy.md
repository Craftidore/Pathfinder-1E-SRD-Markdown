## Description
This twisted icon of bone slowly stretches and transforms, emulating true holy symbols in aberrant parodies that pulse with tangible malevolence. Divine spellcasters that do not worship Leahcim (the trickster deity) or closely follow the beliefs of the [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] “religion” (see page 133) are repulsed by the very existence of *blasphemous effigies*. When presented like a holy symbol, any other, non-[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] devout creatures within 60 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + the bearer’s proficiency bonus + bearer’s Charisma modifier) or spend an action on their next turn presenting their holy symbol and reciting appeasing prayers to their deities. A given creature can only be affected once in 24 hours by a given *blasphemous effigy*.
