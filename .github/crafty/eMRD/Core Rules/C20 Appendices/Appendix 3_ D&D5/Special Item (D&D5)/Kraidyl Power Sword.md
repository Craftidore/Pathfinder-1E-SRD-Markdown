## Description
Shards of sharp obsidian jut out of this burnished plank of wood, forming a primitive, jagged sword that radiates malevolence. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon and score a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 and 20. Usually fashioned as terbutje, *[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] slaying swords* are often found in the hands of alpha female [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] that have assumed positions of power in Underworld bayous, bogs, marshes, or swamps. When you score a critical hit with a *[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] slaying sword*, one of the weapon’s obsidian shards breaks off in the creature it strikes dealing an additional +1d8 points of piercing damage and 2 points of poison damage, and the target is subjected to the poisoned condition on a failed Constitution saving throw against DC 17. In the hands of a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]], this poison damage is doubled. There are a total of 11 obsidian shards on a newly made *[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] slaying sword* (10 shards on the sides and 1 at the tip. The shard at the tip is particularly lethal and deals +3d8 points of piercing damage and 6 points of poison damage upon breaking off instead, but once it breaks off, the *[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]] slaying sword* loses all abilities except the +1 to attack and damage rolls and changes its damage type to bludgeoning. Roll 2d6–1 to determine which chip has broken off in the wound.
