## Description
These wicked pieces of ebony bone are as hard as steel and twice as sharp. Though they fit into a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]’s mouth without causing injury, most creatures cannot use *insidious incisors*. In the snouted mouth of a [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]], *insidious incisors* infuse the [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]’s bite with dread power, inflicting an extra +1d6 necrotic damage.
