## Description
This grisly collection of mummified fingers is always hidden from sight by its users. The preserved digits are from five different humanoids, all of varying races and ages, and each fingernail seems to contain within an endless abyss. Any creature wearing a charm of vital inference has their aura suppressed, making them immune to the *detect good and evil* spell.
