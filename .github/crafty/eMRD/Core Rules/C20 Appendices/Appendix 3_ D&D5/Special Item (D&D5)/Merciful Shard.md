## Description
This [[Colliatur|colliatur]] shard radiates visibly with magic, vibrating with a pleasant sensation when touched. [[Colliatur]] implant these shards into creatures not fully trusted, but deemed either important or potentially useful, in order to teach them the sanctity of life. Implanting a merciful shard requires the creature to either be willing, helpless, restrained, unconscious, paralyzed, stunned or otherwise incapacitated and requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check. (DC 10). On a success, the shard painfully merges with the creature, which from now on has the Sacred Life racial trait. Removing a merciful shard is much more difficult and requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC 30. Additionally, removing such a shard results in it splintering, which sends forth a subsonic pulse clearly audible to all [[Colliatur|colliatur]] within 5 miles, which usually means that [[Colliatur|colliatur]] soon will arrive to investigate what has happened.
