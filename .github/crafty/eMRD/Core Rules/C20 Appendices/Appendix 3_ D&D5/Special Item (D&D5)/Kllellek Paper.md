## Description
*Kllellek paper* is a [[Drow|drow]] invention made from an alchemical mixture of giant slug and neothelid skins. These are drenched in acid and then pressed together and bonded with a thin outer layer of rendered dwarven fat to hold the entire mixture together, creating four sheets of paper that measure 9”x12”. These components give the paper invulnerability to physical harm (such as tearing, cutting, or burning by natural fire). Spells that deal damage (like *burning hands* or *fireball*) damage *kllellek paper* normally, but the layer of dwarven fat gives the paper advantage to saving throws against these spells. *Kllellek paper* can be personalized by a [[Drow|drow]] if they add 4 drops of their own blood to the mixture (allowing them to use it as identification). This doesn’t ever seem to work for any other race.
