# Outsider Gem
## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item
#Special-Item-Type/Magic-Item

**Group**: Wondrous Items
#Special-Item-Group/Wondrous-Items

**Rarity**: Rare
#Special-Item-Rarity/Rare

## Description
These gems come in a wide variety of hues and colors that reflect the souls connected to them; some are as black as the darkest heart, others as bright as the sun. An *outsider gem* operates exactly as an elemental gem, but instead of summoning an elemental, it summons any non-elemental creature from the outer planes. There is a 5% chance that any creature that uses an *outsider gem* to summon an outsider of the opposite alignment is attacked by the summoned creature at the start of each of its turns. It is impossible to know what kind of outsider is called forth before doing so, making the use of these gems rather risky.
