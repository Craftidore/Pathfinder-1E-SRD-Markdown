## Description
This lustrous, 1 pound heavy steel trinket is shaped like a miniature anvil perhaps a centimeter tall. By uttering the command word, it expands instantly to full size and weight (100 lbs. ) and is fully serviceable for the manufacturing needs of any metalsmith. Additionally, a pocket anvil may be thrown at a target as a ranged attack, expanding to full size as it sails through the air. The pocket anvil is treated as though it had the Thrown (20/60) property. A creature hit takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage. Once a pocket anvil has expanded, it can only be shrunk back to trinket size by casting *enlarge/reduce* on it, though it remains in trinket size indefinitely.
