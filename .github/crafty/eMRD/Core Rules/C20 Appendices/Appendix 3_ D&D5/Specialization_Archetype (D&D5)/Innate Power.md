# Innate Power
## Overview
Most common among the dwarven races, some [[Stonespeaker|stonespeakers]] draw their power from their own bodies, channeling the powers of the earth through their very beings. These [[Stonespeaker|stonespeakers]] sometimes belong to established martial traditions or orders, while other times, they are at a complete loss to explain their unique powers.

## Features
**Bonus Proficiency**

When you choose this stone lore at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

**Armor of Stone**

Also at 1st level, you can enhance your armor by calling forth rocks or earth to further enhance your armor. After completing a long rest, you may meditate for 1 minute and expend a use of exploding earth to fashion armor from the earth or enhance your existing armor. You can upgrade your armor by 4 steps, up to the equivalent of plate mail. The stone-enhanced armor behaves as the armor the ability emulates. Alternatively, the stones can also emulate less powerful armors, up to 4 steps. For example, a [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]] not wearing any armor could duplicate padded, leather, studded leather or hide armor. Emulating padded armor would result in the [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]] treating the armor of stone as light armor as well as suffering from disadvantage on Stealth checks and provide an AC of 11 + Dexterity modifier. Emulating hide armor would count as wearing medium armor and provide the equivalent of an AC of 12 + Dexterity modifier (maximum 2). A [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]] must meet the Strength requirements for heavy armors to use this ability to upgrade an existing armor to heavy armor. Armor of Stone is treated as stone, not as metal for the purpose of interaction with features, spells such as *heat metal*, etc. Magical properties of armor you wear are not changed by this ability.

**Shard Growth**

At 6th level, as a reaction to being hit with a melee attack, you can expend one use of exploding earth to cause sharp spikes of stones to grow from your body and pierce nearby foes. Creatures within 5 feet of you when you use this feature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your exploding earth DC or be impaled upon those stone spikes, taking exploding earth’s damage as piercing damage. Additionally, the area affected is considered difficult terrain for all creatures apart from you until the end of your next turn.

**Stone Spikes**

At 9th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with razor sharp stone shards. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice, chosen every turn) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. Additionally, as a bonus action, you may expend one use of exploding earth to make this ability’s effects apply to all your attacks for 1 minute.

**Stone Barrier**

At 17th level, you learn to conjure forth devastating barriers of churning stones. As an action, you can expend 3 uses of exploding earth to create a variant of *blade barrier* that deals bludgeoning instead of slashing damage, with a save DC equal to your exploding earth feature’s DC.
