# Reaving Vortex
## Overview
Some [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|colliatur reavers]] learn to grow razor-sharp filament wires from their bodies, whipping them around with a flick of the wrist, standing immovable in a vortex of destruction as the filament-wires cut apart any opposition.

## Features
**[[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|Reaver]]****'s Filaments**

Starting at 3rd level, you can generate deadly [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]]’s filaments—crystalline, fragile and dazzling, the [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]] filaments deal the same damage and damage type as the one chosen for the Claws of Crystal class feature. [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|Reaver]] filaments are treated as monk weapons. [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|Reaver]]’s filaments are ranged and melee weapons at the same time and may be used to attack adjacent foes without suffering from disadvantage. When used as melee weapons, [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]]’s filaments have the reach property. When you use them as ranged weapons, they are subject to cover and all usual modifications for ranged attacks and have a range of (20/40). You can wield one [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|reaver]] filament per hand. The usual rules for two-weapon fighting apply when using two filaments. A filament requires gestures to execute attacks, thus you needs to have nothing but the filament in your hands to direct the attacks. [[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|Reaver]]’s filaments are not precise enough to open doors, pick locks or perform similar actions.

[[Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)|Reaver]]’s filaments have hit points equal to your Wisdom score, a damage threshold of 0 and, if destroyed, can be reformed as an action that provokes opportunity attacks.

**Filament Superiority**

Beginning at 6th level, you may perform devastating tricks with your razor-sharp filament wires.

***[[Maneuvers]]******.*** You learn two [[Maneuvers|maneuvers]] of your choice, which are detailed under “[[Maneuvers]]” below. [[Maneuvers]] enhance your attack or defense in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack with a filament and may only use them when attacking with a filament. You learn one additional [[Maneuvers|maneuvers]] at 11th and 17th. Each time you learn new [[Maneuvers|maneuvers]], you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

***Filament Dice.*** You have four filament dice, which are d6s. A filament die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended filament dice when you finish a long or short rest. You gain an additional filament die at 11th and 17th level.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your [[Maneuvers|maneuvers]] require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Constitution modifier (your choice)
