# Smithkin (Martial Archetype)
## Overview
Those who emulate the archetypical [[Dweorg|dweorg]] fighting smith epitomize the traditional image of their fighting style.

## Features
**Dweorg Prowess**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level you forge a tie with the flames of creation. You learn special maneuvers fueled by forge dice.

***Maneuvers.*** You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. Maneuvers enhance your attack or defense in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers at 7th, 10th and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

***Forge Dice.*** You have four forge dice, which are d8s. A forge die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended forge dice when you finish a long or short rest. You gain an additional forge die at 7th and 15th level.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

**Strength of the Forge**

Starting at 7th level, your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 30. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry. Additionally, you can push, drag or lift up to 60 times your Strength score in pounds.

In addition, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any Strength or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus.

**Improved Dweorg Prowess**

At 10th level, your forge dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

**Unstoppable**

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no forge dice remaining, you regain 2 forge dice.

**Maneuvers**

***Flaming Trip Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one forge die to attempt to knock the target down. If the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw, On a failed save, you knock the target prone and flames erupt from the ground below the creature, dealing fire damage to the target equal to double the result of your forge dice. You may expend an additional forge dice to increase the damage at 7th level and 15th level.

***Forge’s Blessing.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one forge die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the forge die to the attack’s damage roll. The weapon deals fire damage instead of its regular weapon damage.

***Forge’s Retribution.*** You can expend forge dice whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack. Flames surge forth from your body. The attacker takes fire damage equal to the forge dice you expend.

***Forge’s Spark.*** You can expend a forge die to hurl a spark of fire at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes forge die fire damage. Any flammable objects hit by this ability ignite when not being worn or carried. You may expend an additional forge dice to increase the damage at 7th level and 15th level.

***Forge’s Weapon.*** You may expend a forge die to draw upon the fire within your body to evoke a fiery battleaxe or warhammer, which manifests in your hand. If you let go of the weapon, it dissipates, but you can evoke it again as a bonus action. Attacks performed with this weapon deal fire damage. The forge’s weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***Guarded Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one forge die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the forge die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target treats your AC as though as though it had a bonus equal to your forge die’s result until the end of your next turn.

***Lunging Flame.*** When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one forge die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, your attack deals fire damage instead of the regular weapon damage.

***Maneuver set-up.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one forge die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the forge die to the attack’s damage roll, and if you hit, you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its bonus action on its next turn to use the Disengage action to retreat from the target of your attack.

***Melting Attack.*** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one forge die to attempt to undermine the creature’s resistance to fire. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses resistance to fire until the end of your next turn.

***Take the Hit.*** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one forge die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your forge die + your Constitution modifier. Additionally, opportunity attacks you perform against the target until the end of your next turn receive a bonus equal to the result of your forge die.

***Burning Assault.*** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one forge die to change an amount of damage you inflict with your attack, up to a maximum equal to twice the result of your forge die, to fire damage. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

***Bellows Blast.*** As a reaction to you or an adjacent ally being attacked with a ranged weapon, you can huff and puff like a great bellows. You expend can expend one force die. If the ammunition or projectile is Large or smaller, the attacker trying to hit must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the projectile harmlessly falls to the ground in a square of your choosing within 15 feet of you.

***Endurance of the Forge.*** On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one forge die to bolster one of your companions suffering from exhaustion. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you that has at least one level of exhaustion. That creature decreases its exhaustion levels until the start of your next turn by an amount, equal to ½ your forge die’s result, minimum 1. The exhaustion returns on your next turn, stacking with any exhaustion levels incurred in the meanwhile. An ally may only be affected once by this maneuver, before requiring a long rest to be able to benefit from it again.

***Sweeping Flame Arc.*** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one forge die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack, as flames extend in a sweeping arc from your original target. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes fire damage equal to the number you roll on your forge die. You may expend an additional forge dice to increase the damage at 7th level and 15th level.
