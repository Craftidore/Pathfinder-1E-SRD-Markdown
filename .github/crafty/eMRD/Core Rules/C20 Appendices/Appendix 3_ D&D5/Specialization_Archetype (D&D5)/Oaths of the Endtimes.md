# Oaths of the Endtimes
## Overview
Becoming a [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] requires a mindset characterized by an absence of hope, a belief in the finality of all things and a commitment to tearing the comforting illusions and distractions of other creatures away to make them realize the truth of your vision. The final oath, taken when a [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of the trauma and indoctrination received.

## Features
**Oath of Destruction**

The Oath of Destruction binds a [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] wholly to the process of destroying what mortals and gods have wrought. Many who swear this oath have lost fortunes, masterpieces and items of utmost importance, realizing the futility of even the most magical of items.

**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the oath vary, dour destroyers of this oath share these tenets:

***I shall not create, for all shall be dust in the end.*** Dour destroyers are agents of dissolution and destruction and creation, whether of items, houses or anything else, is anathema to them.

***I place no value on baubles and fleeting flesh, for all is dust.*** Dour destroyers are expected to lead a minimalist lifestyle; while gorging oneself on the spoils of war is perfectly acceptable, the constant disintegration of finery, jewels etc. just shows the ephemeral nature of being and vices should never be the focus of their quests.

***There is no beauty, only dust.*** Dour destroyers are expected to destroy art and means of creating art when they encounter it; anything that lifts the spirits of others is a hindrance towards the eventual transition to dust.

**Devouring Instrument**

Upon taking this oath, you may take a magic weapon and ritualistically destroy it in a 1-hour ceremony. Upon destroying the weapon, you add all special features of the weapon apart from its bonuses to attack and damage rolls permanently to your instrument of entropy. Upon destroying a *flame tongue*, for example, your instrument of entropy would begin shedding light and, when activated, it would deal an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target you hit with it. The number of such abilities an instrument of entropy may hold at any given time depends on your [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] level and the scarcity of the magic weapon destroyed. At 3rd level, your instrument of entropy can hold the abilities of up to two uncommon magical weapons at a given time.

**Improved Devouring Instrument**

Starting at 7th level, your instrument can hold the abilities of an additional two uncommon magic weapons for a total of the abilities of four uncommon magical weapons held. Alternatively, the instrument may hold the abilities of one rare magic weapon instead of the abilities of two uncommon magic weapon. Your instrument of entropy could, for example, hold the abilities of one rare and two uncommon magic weapons or hold the abilities of two rare magic weapons.

**Greater Devouring Instrument**

Starting at 15th level, your instrument can hold the abilities of an additional four uncommon magic weapons for a total of the abilities of eight uncommon magical weapons held. Alternatively, the instrument may hold the abilities of one very rare magic weapon instead of the abilities of three uncommon magic weapon. Your instrument of entropy could, for example, hold the abilities of one very rare, two rare and one uncommon magic weapon.

**Legendary Devouring Instrument**

Starting at 20th level, your instrument can be used to assimilate, but not destroy, legendary magic weapons and even artifacts. Your instrument can hold the abilities of an additional four uncommon magic weapons for a total of the abilities of sixteen uncommon magical weapons held. Alternatively, the instrument may hold the abilities of one legendary magic weapon instead of the abilities of five uncommon magic weapons. The instrument may also hold the abilities of one artifact instead of the abilities of twelve uncommon magic weapons. Legendary weapons or artifacts are not destroyed in the ceremony, though—instead, they dematerialize and cease to exist for as long as [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|the dour destroyer]] lives. Subject to GM approval, a [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] of this level who managed to absorb an artifact may commit ritual suicide with his instrument of entropy while an artifact is absorbed in it, destroying both in the process.

**Oath of Elimination**

The Oath of Elimination binds a [[The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)|dour destroyer]] wholly to the service of entropy, focusing on the destruction of immortal adversaries that seek to cheat entropy.

**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the oath vary, dour destroyers of this oath share these tenets:

***All shall be dust***. Dour destroyers are expected to hunt down and eliminate all creatures that seek to cheat death, rendering them a foe to undead and the mirthful [[Dødelig|dødelig]] in particular as well as certain outsiders and similar immortal creatures.

***I shall not let my passions guide me.*** While all shall be dust in the end, dour destroyers seek to be as passionless as possible, working together even with loathed adversaries to bring down liches and similar creatures that seek to cheat death.

***I shall not prolong my life, for I welcome becoming dust.*** Dour destroyers may accept healing and heal themselves, but they may not engage in any practice that prolongs their lifespan, nor may they return from the dead without losing access to all class abilities until they make atonement for the violation of their oath.

**To Bleed but Dust**

Starting at 3rd level, your blood and flesh become unpalatable to all creatures known. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 5 or less never willingly attack you with bite attacks. Your flesh turns to ash and dust in the mouth of any creature that tries to eat you. Additionally, all creatures that drain life force or blood from you with their abilities or features gain no sustenance from you, nor do they gain any benefits. Intelligent creatures sense this and must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC to attack you with bite attacks.

**Dust is Eternal, Impeccable**

Beginning at 7th level, whenever you suffer from attribute drain due to the attack of an undead or a similar, immortal creature, you may use your reaction to expend entropic power points from your Touch of Entropy class feature to reduce this amount by an equal amount. You may also expend entropic power points in this manner to mitigate a reduction of your maximum hit points you incur (such as from a vampire’s bite). For each entropic power point used, you decrease the reduction by 2. You only mitigate the reduction of the maximum hit points, not the damage you suffer You may use this feature again after completing a short rest. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that inflict the charmed and frightened conditions. Finally, you have advantage on all skill checks made to track immortal creatures.

**Unstoppable Advance**

Starting at 15th level, you become immune against the charmed and frightened conditions. Additionally, you gain advantage on saving throws against all spells and effects that reduce your speed.

**Inevitable Demise**

Starting at 20th level, you automatically succeed all skill checks made to track immortal creatures. Creatures you slay cannot be raised from the dead, resurrected or otherwise be brought back from the dead. Creatures with means to return from total destruction like liches and similar beings are destroyed utterly unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + your Charisma modifier.

**Oath of Despair**

The Oath of Despair focuses on the disintegration of the illusions that provide solace and comfort to the creatures of the mortal planes. You spread despair and your dread world-view, eroding the will of the unfortunates that cross your path.

**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the oath vary, dour destroyers of this oath share these tenets:

***I do not believe in hope and shall make others see the futility of their resistance.*** Dour destroyers genuinely believe that ceasing to struggle and embracing extinction is the noble thing to do—hope is considered an anathema to them.

***I place no value on baubles and fleeting flesh, for all is dust.*** Dour destroyers are expected to lead a minimalist lifestyle; while gorging oneself on the spoils of war is perfectly acceptable, the constant disintegration of finery, jewels etc. just shows the ephemeral nature of being and vices should never be the focus of their quests.

***There is no beauty, only dust.*** Dour destroyers are expected to destroy art and means of creating art when they encounter it; anything that lifts the spirits of others is a hindrance towards the eventual transition to dust.

**Accelerated Decay**

Beginning at 3rd level, you gain an additional number of entropic power points equal to your proficiency bonus x 5. At any given time, you may expend 5 entropic power points as a bonus action to accelerate and extend the potency of your All is Dust class feature for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. Whenever a hostile creature within 20 feet of you while this is activated, it must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be subjected to the effects of an enhanced version of your All is Dust feature, immediately lowering the damage threshold of all of its items by 5. If an item’s damage threshold is reduced to 0, it is subjected to the usual reduction of maximum hit points. Additionally, all creatures within the aura are suffer from disadvantage on saving throws versus spells and effects that inflict the frightened condition.

**Nimbus of Decay**

At 7th level, you extend the radius of your accelerated decay class feature to 40 feet. Additionally, you may expend more than 5 entropic power points. For each additional 5 entropic power points you expend, you reduce the AC of all hostile creatures that failed their saving throw by –1, as your aura starts eroding the armors, be they manufactured or natural. The reduction is permanent, but manufactured armor may be repaired in a workday. If a manufactured armor’s bonus to AC is completely negated by this ability, it falls apart and is destroyed. Natural armor can be regenerated naturally over the course of a week or by being subject to a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic.

**Sticks and Stones**

At 15th level, a lifetime of decay and disillusion has rendered you immune to the taunts of others. You are treated as though you were deaf and blind for the purpose of spells and class features when being deaf or blind would be beneficial to you. You can as though you have averted your eyes from, for example, a basilisk’s eyes, even when directly staring at it. Additionally, creatures that fail their saving throw against your Accelerated Decay class feature immediately incur one level of exhaustion.

**End of All Hope**

At 20th level, all creatures within the aura granted by your Accelerated Decay class feature lose any immunity to the charmed, frightened and poisoned conditions. If a target creature’s armor is completely destroyed by Accelerated Decay, it is immediately incapacitated for 1d4 rounds.
