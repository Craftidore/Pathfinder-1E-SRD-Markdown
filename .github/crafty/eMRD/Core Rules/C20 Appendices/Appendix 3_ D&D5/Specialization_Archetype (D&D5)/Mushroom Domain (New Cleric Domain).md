# Mushroom Domain (New Cleric Domain)
## Overview
The massive, strange mushroom-jungles pulse with an inherent energy that is considered to be a kind of anima mundi suffusing all, its power springing from the massive, gorgeous jumble of colors, spores and life pulsing eternally in the underworld. The propagation of these places and the protection of their biomes have become nigh-rapturous experiences for some of the devout, with enlightenment beckoning in the hallucinogenic spores, teas and armors crafted from the very mushrooms themselves.

**Mushroom-Whisperer**

At 1st level, you learn the language of mushrooms, allowing you to enter a strange form of communication with mushrooms. By touching a mushroom, you can imbue it with limited sentience, allowing it to communicate with you. You can question fungi about events within 30 feet of their location that have transpired within the day, gleaning information about creatures that have passed, weather and similar circumstances. You also become proficient in your choice two of the following skills: Insight, Medicine, Nature, or Survival. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using either of those skills chosen.

**Channel Divinity: Explosive Caps**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to grow special, magically imbued explosive mushroom caps on either yourself or the immediate vicinity. Explosive caps are drawn as part of the Attack action. You gain a total number of explosive caps equal to twice your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. Explosive caps last for 1 day or until you complete a long rest before withering and becoming inert. Thrown explosive caps detonate and cannot be salvaged after combat. You treat explosive caps as simple ranged weapons with the finesse and thrown (range 20/60) properties. You are proficient with explosive caps. Explosive caps deal your proficiency bonus times 1d6 points of force damage on a successful hit.

**Hallucinogenic Visions**

Beginning at 6th level, your explosive caps contain inert, but hallucinogenic spores over which you can exert a modicum of control. When you throw an explosive cap, it detonates and leaves behind a wispy cloud of spores that lasts until the end of your next turn. The cloud is a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the target and it does not impede sight. As an action on your turn, you can will the spores to coalesce on a target currently within the cloud of spores that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, it experiences strange hallucinations and must roll a d10 on the hallucinogenic visions table below:


-tx-
| **Hallucinogenic Visions** ||
|---|---|
| **d10** | **Behavior** |
| **1** | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn‘t take an action this turn. |
| **2-3** | The creature doesn‘t move or take actions this turn, instead becoming entranced by the translucent, rococo patterns it sees covering every nearby surface. |
| **4-5** | The creature is *charmed*. |
| **6-7** | The creature must succeed its choice of either a Dexterity or Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC on each of its turns for the duration or fall prone. |
| **8-9** | The creature becomes *confused*, hallucinating crawling swarms of insects on itself and others. |
| **10** | Suffering only mild hallucinations, the creature can act and move normally. |
| The effects of hallucinogenic visions last for 1 minute. ||

**Potent Visions**

At 8th level, any creature affected by your hallucinogenic visions must roll twice on the table. You choose which of the two effects affect the creature.

**Spell-powered Caps**

At 17th level, you can expend spell slots to enhance your explosive caps as part of making an attack with an explosive cap. You gain a number of cap-points equal to the level of the spell slot you expended, which you can use to modify the respective attack.

- 1 point: Increase the damage your cap inflicts by +1d6 force damage, up to a maximum of +5d6 per cap.
- 1 point: Bigger spore cloud. Increase the radius of the spore cloud your cap leaves behind by 10 feet.
- 1 point: Aerodynamic caps. Increase the range of your mushrooms by (+10/+30), up to a maximum of (+30/+90).
- 1 point: Obscuring cloud. Your spore cloud obscures sight at though it were a fog cloud.
- 2 points: Increase the duration of your cap’s spore cloud by 1 round, allowing you to affect up to two creatures with hallucinogenic visions.
- 4 points: Potent mushrooms. Creatures suffer from disadvantage on saves against the hallucinations caused by your explosive caps’ spores.
- X points: Regrowing cap. Instead of modifying an explosive cap, you can expend a spell-slot as an action to regrow your explosive caps. You regain a number of explosive caps equal to the level of the spell slot expended.
