# Naraneus Domain (New Cleric Domain)
## Overview
The mistress of poison and arachnids that lords over the feared [[Drow|drow]] of Aventyr’s underworld bestows special gifts upon her servants, granting them the prowess in both spell and deed to withstand the rigors of the treacherous life in the cut-throat society of [[Drow|drow]]... and beyond.

**Blessing of Poison**

Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you choose either Dexterity (Stealth) or Charisma (Deception). Once made, this choice cannot be reversed, unless you complete an appropriate quest. (Subject to GM’s approval.) You can grant yourself or a creature you touch advantage on checks with the chosen skill. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again. You also gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit.

**Channel Divinity: Poisonous Cunning**

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the divine favor of Naraneus upon those wielding or subject to poison. As an action, you call your deity’s name. Up to two allies, one of which may be yourself, who are currently wielding a poisonous weapon or who are suffering from the poisoned condition, may spend their reactions to make an attack with their weapons. If these attacks hit, they add your Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt. At 11th level, allies (or yourself) who hit with this attack deal an additional 1d8 poison damage on a hit. At 17th level, allies (or yourself) who hit with this attack deal an additional 2d8 poison damage.

**Pure Spite**

Beginning at 6th level, whenever you are below half of your maximum hit points and suffering from either the grappled, poisoned or prone conditions due to the actions of an enemy that has not yet been vanquished, you may treat any result of 1 or 2 as a 3 on dice you roll to determine damage or healing effects for attacks you execute and spells you cast. This immediately ends if the foe is brought to 0 HP or if the condition ends.

**Poisonous Shadows**

Starting at 8th level, whenever you would lose your shadow due to an effect, spell or similar circumstance, you may use your reaction to regrow your shadow and negate any and all negative effects associated with having no shadow. Additionally, any beneficial spell or ability that requires the use of your shadow that may currently be in effect is not ended by this, allowing you to potentially have more than one spell or ability that uses your shadow in effect at any given time. You can use this feature again after completing a short rest. Furthermore, as a reaction to being poisoned or to suffering poison damage, you can siphon poison coursing through your veins into your shadow, immediately ending any ongoing poison damage and the poisoned condition. You are still treated as poisoned for the purpose of this domain’s abilities for as long as your shadow that absorbed the poison persists. Abrupt exposure to total darkness or magical light ends this boon. Your shadow may only hold one poison at any given time. If your shadow holds a poison and you complete a long rest, it is no longer considered to be holding poison.
