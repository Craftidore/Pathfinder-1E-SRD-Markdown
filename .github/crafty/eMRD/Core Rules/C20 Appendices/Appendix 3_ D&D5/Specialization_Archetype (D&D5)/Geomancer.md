# Geomancer
## Overview
You have studied arcane theorems related to stone and earth and learned to utilize it as a lethal force against your foes. Most geomancers are either scholars or people who have studied in one of the underworld’s academies and arcane schools to become a [[Stonespeaker|stonespeaker]].

## Features
**Grasp of the Earth**

Starting at 1st level, you can petition the earth to hold the fools that dare challenge you. As an action, you can expend a use of exploding earth to cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Constitution or Strength saving throw (your choice) against your exploding earth save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all grappled or prone until the end of your next turn.

**Exploding Pebble**

At 6th level, you can expend a use of exploding earth as part of a ranged attack, throw a pebble infused with your exploding earth. The pebble behaves like a dart, but a target hit takes damage as though you successfully affected it with exploding earth. The target hit does not receive a saving throw to halve the damage, but may save against additional effects granted by exploding earth.

**Stone Telekinesis**

At 9th level, you learn to feel stone as it literally shifts to your whim. You may, as an action on your turn, duplicate the effects of *telekinesis* by expending 3 uses of your exploding earth. The save DC is equal to your exploding earth’s save DC. Stone telekinesis can only manipulate objects and creatures made of stone or earth. Additionally, you gain additional uses of exploding earth equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Geomancer's Storm**

At 17th level, you can manipulate the very earth around you to create a churning maelstrom of deadly earth and rock, crushing your foes while leaving your allies unharmed. You can expend 5 uses of your exploding earth as an action to turn the earth in a radius of 60 feet around you into a rumbling, churning zone of destruction. All creatures within the area are subject to your exploding earth ability and also are subjected to all three additional base effects you can generate by expending an additional use of exploding earth (see exploding earth, above). Creatures affected by this ability, even those that successfully save, treat the area as difficult terrain until the end of your next turn. Additionally, you may exempt up to your Wisdom modifier creatures from the effects of this feature.
