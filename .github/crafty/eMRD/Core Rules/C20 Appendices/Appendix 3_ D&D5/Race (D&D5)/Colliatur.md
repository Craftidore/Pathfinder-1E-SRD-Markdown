# Colliatur
## Overview
### Colliatur
![[Colliatur.png|Colliatur|300]]
[[Colliatur.png|open outside]]

*We are the radiant, we are the eternal. We are the scourge of the undead, the salvation of the meek and downtrodden. By our light you shall know us. By our gleaming skin, our radiant stride. We bring deliverance and an end to the unloving threat that plagues your lands. Some call us the Shining Ones, others the Luminaires or Luxites, and still more name us Krystallerne, Eðalsteinn or Gimsteinnmenn—we prefer Colliatur. Choose freely for we judge you not, for we are your salvation.*

**Crystal Scourge or Salvation?**

Colliatur are Aventyrians that drank from waters carrying a pathogen designed by one of the world’s first masters of magic, Udødelig, released through Underworld streams and to the surface above. These microorganisms cannot completely stop the advance of the alien biology’s invasion of a host body, but they do prevent them from becoming completely sublimated to the otherworldly entity’s will. The limited time available to the undead wizard prevented wide dispersal of the anti-colloid virus, leaving the extraterrestrial sentience puzzled by how any creature could resist its psyche (there is a 1% chance that a PC has been exposed to this otherwise benign virus and is immune to the detrimental effects of the colloid). Colliatur are often found leading the subjects of the colloid—their independence proving to be an attracting force to the alien’s thralls—and may be encountered anywhere in the Underworld or Upperworld.

## History
The colliatur are a new race to the world of Aventyr, created by the mad designs of Udødelig after The Confluence. Their “parent”, the colloid, is a creature from the far flung stars of the cosmos and unlike any other on Aventyr (even the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], though they share some eerily similar traits). A collective intelligence that rivals deities in its mental powers, it sensed the mass transposition of life forms across the galaxy during the Great Schism. For centuries it studied the conduit maintained by the alien half-god Exis, engineering a means to take that power for its own.

Eventually the colloid’s chance came; through incalculable machinations for nearly any other entity, the colloid seized the half-god Exis’ divine connection to the [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], subverting it to catch upon an asteroid headed for Aventyr. The [[Hive Mind|hive-mind]] of the alien insects in both Underworld and Upperworld was destroyed instantly, and as the bizarre entity hurtled across the galaxy, their societies fell in upon themselves.

When the colloid and the meteor it used to traverse the cosmos landed in the First Hive, the overload of stimulation in its reentry to the atmosphere left the alien entity confused and distraught. In the onslaught that ensued, thousands of [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] died as the colloid rampaged away to solitude far below in the Underworld, where it could regain its senses of purpose and understand all that had occurred since it’s relatively quiet journey across the stars.

As it re-assembled itself and re-encountered sentient life, the colloid began to understand more of what had occurred and recognized the great threat represented by the necromancy of the first lich, Udødelig. Centuries before he had fled below the surface of Aventyr, taking refuge in an undertower near the First Hive. When the colloid landed in the Underworld, his shambling minions were the first formidable force the alien encountered and the hatred it feels for all undead knows no bounds.

Before the colloid could reach and consume the obsessed lich, the undead wizard managed to enact one of his countless ploys to undermine the alien entity. Though the ancient mage’s mastery of biology was largely useless to the creation of an entire race of undead, he was well-suited to craft an organism which could aid the living against the otherworldly entity.

After fleeing from the colloid’s arrival in the First Hive, Udødelig crafted a grand undertower that stretched far into the bedrock of Aventyr, a place where he thought only his kind could survive. For decades he employed advanced arcane techniques and powerful spells to hone his craft and eventually, using the bacteria and countless other creatures invisible to the naked eye, Udødelig created a microorganism tailored to modify living tissue to resist the colloid. Immediately, the undead mage set off to disperse his fabrication across Aventyr, releasing batches of the creatures into the many waters of the Underworld. While he was away, the colloid discovered the location of Udødelig’s undertower. The colloid lay in wait, and on the mage’s return struck a fatal blow. Udødelig did not survive to create more of the virus, but enough propagates that the colliatur have begun to appear all across Aventyr.

## Physical Description
Colliatur appear much like the base creature does, save for a few subtle changes. Their hair has several strands that are crystalline, their pupils appear to be distorted into the shape of many pointed stars, and their fingertips become reflective and metallic. Perhaps most disturbing of all, the teeth of all colliatur are a perpetually clean, stark white.

## Society
These children of the colloid are inclusive, kind and friendly to all races. When left entirely to their own devices, colliatur are disturbingly quiet and seemingly lethargic, though they’re more likely to be in deep contemplation. There is little celebration for the arts or purportedly impressive deeds, but the few stories told of settlements of their kind speak of architecture that defies understanding and resonances that shake men to their cores.

## Relations
Most upperworlders and underworlders greet the colliatur with open arms, accepting their warm embrace with either a hidden dagger or hand out for mercy. Their tendency to deeply value life make them fast allies in both cases, but their hatred of undead make them mortal enemies of the [[Dødelig|dødelig]]. [[Hoyrall]] that recognize them for what they are will attack them instinctively (which anyone who knows their true purposes is wont to do). Despite all of that, aside from the [[Dweorg|dweorg]], they are the most celebrated and desirable race from the Underworld as far as most of Aventyr is concerned.

## Alignment & Religion
Colliatur typically gravitate towards the Neutral alignment over time, but may be of any alignment they please. They rarely worship any of the gods, instead gaining quasi-mythic abilities from the colloid. Those few that turn their backs on the alien entity find solace in He who Renews, Eureum.

## Adventurers
Exploring is a natural impulse for the colliatur, and spreading the message of the alien overmind is their first priority. Spellcasters are common among them, but warriors of particular prowess are frequent as well.

## Names
Colliatur tend to keep the names they had before their transformation.

## Additional Details
**Emissaries Across Aventyr**

Some colliatur take refuge with the colloid, but not all; the otherworldly entity is pleased when creatures immune to its call ally with it regardless, but it does so with a cold, calculating plan to segregate these unique beings from the areas of itself most likely to be tread across. Other colliatur create their own settlements, hybridizations of the culture they once knew and the otherworldly forces at play within themselves. Duplicating architecture from Upperworld and Underworld, their buildings have an architecture that seems to twist when looked upon, their structural points truly bizarre and difficult to comprehend.

Whether on the surface or below it, the vast majority of these wondrous towns and villages are said to be extremely amicable to passersby, providing them with free lodging and foodstuffs. Explorers, however, should be reticent when entering a colliatur settlement; some of their race have become militant to the dangers presented by the colloid, and travelers that take of their kindness are soon to find themselves conscripted into service against the alien entity. An Intelligence (History) check (DC 20) gives warning enough that a colliatur settlement has taken on this aggressive stance before it’s too late.

## Traits
Your colliatur character counts as both the parent race and as a colliatur for purposes of race.

***Ability Score Increases.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2 and two of your other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Colliatur mature at the same rate as their parent race.

***Alignment.*** Colliatur tend to gravitate towards true neutrality, though the high value they ascribe to life also means that quite a few of them are perceived as good.

***Size.*** Colliatur come in different shapes and sizes due to the diverse parent races. Your size is your choice of either Small, Medium or Large.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet if you are Medium, 25 feet if you are Small or Large.

***Acid Conversion (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** Your organic parts may be hurt by acid, but your crystalline parts are capable of converting it into life. As a reaction to taking acid damage, you may regain 10 hit points on your next turn. Acid damage can never kill you, only knock you out.

***Condition Immunity.*** If you are of Small size, your body inadvertently has a higher crystal/colloid-density than your larger brethren. You gain immunity to the charmed condition.

***Conductivity.*** While your crystalline structure provides a lot of benefits, it also conducts lightning much better than flesh and bone. If you take lightning damage, you suffer from disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.

***Crystal Refraction (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** Your crystalline structure can absorb certain types of magic, but only under the right circumstances. Whenever you are targeted by a ranged spell attack or a spell that specifies that it works via a “ray” (like *disintegrate*, *prismatic spray* or *ray of enfeeblement*), you may, as a reaction to being hit by the ray, harmlessly absorb it. If you do, you immediately end the spell’s effects. Consuming the magical energy nourishes you as if you have eaten a full meal, but also is strenuous: You immediately increase your exhaustion level by +1 upon using this ability.

***Energy Immunity.*** As a resplendent being of crystal and flesh, you are immune to radiant damage.

***Energy Resistance.*** You are anathema to the undead and the tainted energies of unlife. You gain resistance to necrotic damage.

***Parent Race.*** You choose the parent race for your colliatur character. You qualify as both your parent race and as a colliatur for purposes of racial prerequisites, item-use restrictions, etc. You do not receive any of the racial features of your parent race, though.

***Sacred Life.*** You value life, any life, more highly than just about all other races as a consequence of your entwinement with the colloid. Ending a life is an emotionally and physically draining procedure for you. If you choose to kill a living creature upon reducing it to 0 hit points instead of knocking it out, you immediately increase your exhaustion level by +1, up to a maximum of 5. Constructs, elementals and undead are exempt from this—you can destroy these creatures without ramifications.

***Superior Darkvision.*** Seeing the world through star-shaped, resplendent pupils has its benefits. You can see in dim light within 120 ft. of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Thunder Vulnerability.*** Due to the crystalline structures suffusing your body, you suffer from vulnerability to thunder damage.

***Languages.*** You can speak Common and the languages of your parent race.
