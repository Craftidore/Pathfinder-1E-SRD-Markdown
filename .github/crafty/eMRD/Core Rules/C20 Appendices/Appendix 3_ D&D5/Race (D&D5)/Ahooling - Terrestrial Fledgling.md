# Ahooling - Terrestrial Fledgling
## Overview
Not every [[Ahooling|ahooling]] evolves to take to the air or the water; some scamper along the walls and squeeze into the minute cracks of the endless caves, living as rat kings of the Underworld.

## Traits
***Born Climber.*** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill and gain advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb. Once you gain 3rd level, you gain a climb speed equal to your base speed.

***Change Shape.*** At 3rd level, you can use *polymorph*, except you can only target yourself and you can only assume the form of a swarm of rats for 1 hour. You must take a long rest to use this ability again.

***Ground Control (Recharge 5-6).*** At 5th level, you can use your action to touch the floor of any subterranean cave, unworked stone or rock to make it ripple at your command. The terrain in a 5 by 30 ft. -line originating from you becomes difficult terrain. When you use ground control, all creatures in the area must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
