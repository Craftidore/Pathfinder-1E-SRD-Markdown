# Maculosfunglets
## Overview
Poisonous and powerful, maculosfunglets.

## Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Maculosfunglet Venom (Injury).*** The rhizomorphs within your maculosfunglet body are poisonous and a may produce poison. A number of times equal to your Constitution modifier per day, you can envenom a weapon with toxic saliva or your blood as an action. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier or take 1d6 points of poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. This damage increases to 2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 8th level, 4d6 at 13th level and 5d6 at 18th level. At each of these levels, you also get an additional use of your poison. The creature affected must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. A successful save neutralizes the poison. As a reaction to being bitten by a foe, you can expend one use of your poison to poison the creature who attacked you with a bite attack. Your poison quickly spoils when exposed to air, preventing you from harvesting and selling the poison. Your poison rhizomorphs produce new doses of poison on a long rest.
