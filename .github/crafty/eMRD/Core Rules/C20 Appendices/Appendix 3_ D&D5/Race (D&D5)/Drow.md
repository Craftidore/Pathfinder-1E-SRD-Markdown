# Drow
## Overview
### Drow
![[Drow.png|Drow|300]]
[[Drow.png|open outside]]

The drow were once denizens of Upperworld, sharing the realm with their elven brethren without consequence. Thousands of years have passed since those mythical times, and the drow have fallen far from their original state. The drow live far beneath the surface of known lands, deep in the Underworld, in large cities dedicated to Naraneus, the Queen of Venom.

Drow societies are matriarchal, and females hold almost every position of power within a city, their priesthoods always led by women of potent ability and foresight. Cold, cunning and manipulative, the drow live to obtain power over those around them. Their entire race is inherently evil but there are rare occasions—when the moon is full and Naraneus’ attentions are devoted elsewhere—that a good-aligned dark elf is born. Children born during these periods are generally sacrificed to Naranaeus without a second thought, but mothers with a strong parenting instinct who are unwilling to make the sacrifice give birth in secret, sneaking away and passing the child to an upperworlder or asking an underworlder of another race to care for the newborn. They may follow their offspring, secretly assisting from afar to see that their child grows and adapts to life amongst the other races.

Unless otherwise permitted by the GM, any drow character in Aventyr is of evil or at best neutral alignment. Any drow of a good alignment will have been raised by one of the good-aligned races of the Underworld, or—rarely—by humanoids of Upperworld. Evil drow PCs hail from the subterranean metropolises of the Underworld, and a rare few are connected to Hivaka or Leahcim, the lone good and neutral drow deities.

## History
During the *Forging of the* *[[Dvergr]]* the immortals, both light and dark, were left alone in the Underworld. Unwelcome in the dwarven cities and smart enough to avoid any involvement with the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] (despite their many innocuous offerings), they traveled throughout the endless caverns as nomads. Their patron gods—Naneth the Leaf Mother, Onael the Forest Lord, and Naraneus, Queen of Venom—watched over them, enforcing in each a sense of control, the nature of their wild souls, and the skills they would need to survive in the harsh world of Aventyr. Their exodus came to an end with the founding of the Silent Forest, home of the elves. With the need for fierce survival instincts at an end, the darkest of the immortal’s gods took up far less of the elves’ attentions; whereas Onael was still needed to tame their savage spirits (although as they became more civilized, he too became abandoned) and Naneth garnered greater devotion as the slender folk finally found a true home and hearth, Naraneus, the Weaver of Shadows, has forever been a dark god.

The Queen of Venom dwelt in the [[Shadow Cast|shadow cast]] by the Prime Event’s brilliance, waiting like the creature of her namesake. When the gods created the elves, she felt a kinship with their eternal plight and joined the Forest Lord and Leaf Mother in guiding the immortals to the Silent Forest. Naraneus taught them the nature of true deception and stealth, making them cunning warriors and silent hunters, well-suited to survival in the Underworld. After emerging upon the surface, however, her worship faded as Naneth and her mothering ways flourished. It was not long before Naraneus struck back at her sister, inciting a feud between the darkness and the light. After a time this came to consume both races, embroiling the drow and the elves in bloody battles that marked the Silent Forest with thousands of immortal corpses in a war that lasted decades. Eventually, Naneth and the elves proved victorious, banishing the Queen of Venom and her followers back to the Underworld.

This suited the Weaver of Shadows and her devoted peoples well; their natural stealth, cunning and ruthless efficiency made them ideal denizens of the Underworld. By the time of the Grand Sculpting, the drow had dispersed far from the Silent Forest and into the farthest reaches beneath Aventyr, establishing small settlements generally removed from the cave networks left by the Prime Event. Naraneus blessed her female children, making the strongest among them into matron mothers, whose iron rule sustained the fledgling noble houses of the Silent Forest in inexorable marches to prominence.

By the time the Great Schism came, the diminutive outposts had quickly grown into thriving villages brimming with potential, but limited by the murderous, self-inflicting instinct of its citizenry. The many fleeing refugees of the Dracoprime’s calamitous fall sated the self-destructive tendencies of these drow populations however, and provided enslaved backs upon which to build the first grand city of the dark elves—Holoth.

Finally seeing the value in the lesser, inferior races, the children of Naraneus found their place in Aventyr. The initial (and greatest) metropolis of the drow, Holoth was ideally situated to collect the masses of displaced underworlders and expanded quickly. Its earliest years are rife with turmoil as warring noble houses and subterranean terrors destroyed the settlement in countless conflicts.

The drow are, however, nothing if not determined, and the skeletal remains of the city’s many previous incarnations sit below the current Holoth. Reeling from the loss of the *Vidrefacte* and the Fall of House Gullion (see *Rise of the Drow*), the first city of the dark elves is still a powerhouse in the Underworld. Like the many drow settlements that exist in the realm hidden behind the cardinal metropolis (the drow locale closest to Upperworld), it boasts arcane academies and temples of the most dangerous and highest regard, warriors of the greatest prowess and rulers with insight that leaves their peers baffled and dismayed.

## Physical Description
Drow are tall and slender like their elven counterparts, with graceful and pleasant features that belie their evil nature. Their hair color can range from brunette to gray or white. They are quick in both body and mind, their slightly enlarged and pointed ears keen to hear the slightest scuffle in the Underworld.

## Society
The drow are matriarchal and exist entirely to do the whim of the Matron Mother of their home settlement. Women are valued far more highly than men; most of the latter are little better than smart dogs—fit to serve as guards but easily worth a few gold pieces as a youth. They are uniformly slavers, and even the lesser houses of nobility can count dozens of indentured servants to their estate. While they all answer to the Matron Mother of the first house, all drow vie for power and prestige; they will (and many times have) slaughter their own parents without a second thought if it means the acquisition of greater influence.

## Relations
Cunning to the last, dark elves are sly, subtle and resourceful individuals. They rarely expose themselves until they’ve assumed a considerable upper hand, and by then, few who’ve survived what follows managed to escape to tell of it. Ruthless, efficient and capable of mindless savagery the drow are, at best, extremely dangerous allies (to both those they profess to aid and their perceived enemies).

## Alignment & Religion
Drow are of the Evil alignment, be they chaotic, neutral or lawful. Most of the former are quickly beaten into submitting to the latter or sacrificed to appease Naraneus, who only truly blesses a few of her female subjects and even fewer of her male devotees. Naraneus is by and far the most revered of their gods, but demigods of Shadow and Pain have begun to take hold in a few drow cities without their orders falling to blades in the night.

## Adventurers
Dark elven adventurers can be of many different mindsets, but most are dissatisfied with drow life for one reason or another. Women born into lower castes seethe with jealousy for their high born peers, and males from any house literally live at the whim of their female counterparts, a dangerous proposition that they would be keen to escape should the opportunity to safely do so arise. Females may be of any role, although they specifically seem to excel as clerics. Men are rarely clerics (and if so, only have one or two levels of the class) and chiefly master the art of mundane combat, with perhaps some dabbling in the graceful arts of the rogue or, in the event they’ve a talent for it, pursuing the arcane workings of the wizard.

## Names
**Male Names:** Diun, Gal, Gylor, Ieot, Quanot, Slior

**Female Names:** Aranreae, Haermadia, Lilith, Maethon, Maeronea, Slienaia

## Age
Some dark elves in Aventyr enjoy lifespans that far surpass their peers. These wizened wizards, elder priests, devious warlocks and treasured oracles see their longevity extended by hundreds of years either by their deity or through deftly sustained arcane magics.

## Additional Details
**Female Drow**

Raised to rule, dark elven women have deft tongues and cunning wits but lack the grace and natural instincts of their ancestral counterparts on the surface. Female drow in Aventyr receive skill proficiency in their choice of two of either Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion).

**Male Drow**

Dark elven society subjugates males, reducing their roles into defenders of their settlements and little else. They are trained from birth to hone their keen senses, agility and ability to remain unseen and unheard, but their lack of social commitments leave them less able to maneuver in conversation as their female counterparts. Male drow in Aventyr receive skill proficiency in their choice of two of either Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Dexterity (Stealth), or Charisma (Deception).

**Drow Enclaves in Aventyr**

The subterranean dark elves rule over a large region of the Underworld protected from the rest of the endless caves by the bastion metropolis of Holoth. All of their settlements are built upon the backs of enslaved races, ruled over by matriarchs that worship the Queen of Venom, Naraneus. The infighting and intrigue that suffuses their cities makes them a moderate threat to the whole of Aventyr, but travelers should beware any chance encounter with a drow settlement. An Intelligence (History) check (DC 20) reveals to an Underworld explorer how likely it is they will be caught by dark elven magic when making their way through a drow settlement (if it absolutely cannot be avoided). The vast majority of incarcerated interlopers are forced into slavery and in some cases, have their very souls extinguished in mystical rituals.

## Traits
Drow in Aventyr use the race traits for drow.
