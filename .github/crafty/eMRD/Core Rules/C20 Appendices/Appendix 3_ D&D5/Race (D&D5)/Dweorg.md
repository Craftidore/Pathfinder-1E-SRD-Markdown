# Dweorg
## Overview
### Dweorg

Dweorg are the most common dwarven subtype, denizens of the Underworld that enjoy mining and blacksmithing. While rare outside of the Underworld, upperworlders are often accepting of these stout folk—the legends tell that the first two humans, Ask and Embla, were themselves forged by the ancient dweorg. This belief has warmed even the cold hearts of the Klavekians, who freely accept these dwarves into their villages and homes. Although they are friendly with upperworlders, the dweorg tend to keep to themselves and rarely allow outsiders to travel into their realm.

## History
After the Forging of the [[Dvergr]], each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans (dweorg, [[Dvergr|dvergr]] and [[Zwerc|zwerc]]) were it not for the arrival of the Great Sculpting. Before their very eyes, the cities of each fell to draconic claws and magics as quickly as the forces they could muster to their defense. Unwilling to forge an alliance, each struck their own path through the Underworld, leaving their shattered homes behind them. The dweorg consulted their historians and clerics, ultimately following the same path as the first two humans, leading the stout folk toward the surface near Upperworld. Their journeys from the darkness of the deep Underworld are the stuff of legend, playing a large role in the devotion the dweorg show to their ancestors and traditions. As prophesied, this removal from the lowest reaches preserved their race, buffering them from the fallout of the Dracoprime and its death. Having settled in stable areas, the dweorg’s defensible cities proved to be a bulwark against the many races born from the mythical creature’s essence, saving the world above from most of the dangers created by the recently liberated primal dragons.

Some traveled a more wayward route, living a nomadic existence before finally establishing the city of Stoneholme after an enduring trial that intertwined its history with the devilish influence of the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]].

The most famous dweorg settlement was far humbler, a simple outpost made to act as a place of commerce that would maintain contact between the disparate clans as they sought new homes near the surface. For ages it remained a small village, but since it has grown considerably and now it is known throughout Aventyr as Embla, the city of fair trade.

## Physical Description
Dweorg are anywhere between four and five feet in tall, with stout shoulders and bodies that defy their diminished height. Their hair colors are commonly brunettes or blondes, but some clans sport great red manes that weave into their beards. Nearly all dweorg men wear beards, often carefully tended to with rings of precious metals stylized to honor their ancestors or traditions. Both genders are tough and possess strong core muscles; the color of a dweorg’s skin ranges from pale to reddish white and olive. They favor armors made from metal and pride themselves on craftsmanship, often wearing expertly crafted equipment made by their own hands.

## Society
Smithing and craftsmanship are the backbone of dweorg society, but these dwarves are keen on all of the aspects each entails. They are well-known for having keen eyes for gems, ores and precious stones of all kinds, as well as a penchant for trading them. Their warriors and defenders pose a threat alone or at the backs of allies, each with an instinctive understanding of their equipment (often forging their weapons and armor themselves). Miners and engineers are just as common as soldiers, known throughout both the Upperworld and Underworld for their natural penchant to intellectually grasp the complex calculations required for large-scale excavation and construction.

## Relations
Though their past is filled with hardship, dweorg maintain the friendliest demeanor of all the dwarves in Aventyr. While travelers are normally granted only temporary asylum within their settlements, they have been known to accept foreigners into their cities—so long as they embrace dweorg culture and tradition. They are a just people filled with pride and often able to recite their lineages to the founders of their settlement (and in the case of nobility, even farther). This isn’t always fully understood by other Aventyrians, and sometimes their strange ways isolate the dweorg but more often than not, they are openly accepted into upperworlder society, valued for their talents at the forge and staunch loyalty.

## Alignment & Religion
While they can be of any alignment, most are Lawful Neutral and follow Balir, the Burning Hero and Master of the First Forge. His teachings, condensed in the 3,000 page tome The Life of Balir, call for practicality and humble magnificence, traits embodied by both his temples and followers. While there are some that pursue the arcane arts, most tend to frown at a reliance on magic and only show their respect for the mystical arts to devout members of the clergy.

## Adventurers
Many dweorg leave their homes to act as scouts or wardens, trekking across the Underworld to map out emerging cave systems, identify dangerous geological movements and locate threats both old and new that prowl the depths close to the dwarven cities. Others endeavor to expand the reach of their clan by establishing new trade routes both above and below the surface, or take to lives as mercenaries with ambitions to bring back glory to their family’s name. While they are not disposed to ostracizing, dweorg society doesn’t treat those without a reverence for history very well and dwarves that defy traditions often leave of their own accord.

## Names
**Male Names:** Alvis, Brocker, Danik, Frednir, Maylorin, Otis

**Female Names:** Bridgette, Edna, Franlina, Hlazel, Normja, Ragnarose

Dweorg close to the surface tend to marry traditional [[Dvergr|dvergr]] names with those of the surface dwellers, so names can differ wildly from region to region.

## Age
Living nearer to the surface of Upperworld than any of their kin, dweorg enjoy slightly longer lifespans than their counterparts deeper in the Underworld (as well as those from other material planes). Depending on how much interaction they have with humanity and the other surface races, sometimes dweorg find the spans of their lives to be significantly reduced by upperworlder assaults or dangers awakened by meddling explorers.

## Additional Details
**Dweorg of Aventyr**

The dweorg cities and kingdoms of the Underworld are as varied as the human settlements on the surface, save that all of them show reverence to crafting in some fashion or another, and a staunch appreciation for tradition. Still, the dangers of the endless caves have hardened the resolve of some dweorg settlements, making them unkind and unwilling to accept foreigners for any period of time (unless they’ve proven themselves worthy).

A traveler can determine that a certain dweorg settlement is on good terms with interlopers by making a successful Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 15). Notably less vicious than the other races, most intruders receive a fair trial and brief imprisonment before being dropped off outside the gates.

## Traits
As a dweorg, you belong to the most numerous of dwarven subraces in Aventyr and tend to live close to the Upperworld. When an upperworlder thinks “dwarf,” you and your kin are likely what comes to mind. You have all the standard dwarf traits. Additionally, you have the following Dweorg subrace traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.

***Efficient Crafter.*** You double the rate with which you craft items. For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp instead of the usual 5 gp.
