# Hoyrall
## Overview
### Hoyrall

[[Hoyrall.png|open outside]]

Hoyrall are insectoid humanoids that burst from the skull of the Dracoprime, killing the monstrosity instantly and heralding the Great Schism. Vicious and barbaric in their alien ways, they live within the Woven Warrens, a series of tunnels that they rule over with virtually no dissent.

## History
The hoyrall are not from Aventyr. Scholars, seers, high mages and venerated oracles have all attempted to determine from whence these strange creatures came, but none have had much success in that regard. All they know is that the destructive hoyrall are from somewhere far across the Material Realm. Their arrival in Aventyr, both above and below the surface, was brought about by the Great Schism, and their race was forever changed by The Confluence.

During the first great event, the Progenitors (mutated now into the [[Draaki|draaki]]), sacrificed most of their remaining high mages in an effort to call for aid against the rising Dracoprime, and it was the god of the hoyrall, Zagnexis (CN, minor deity), that answered the call. It transported its physical form, called ‘Zagn’, along with many of the hoyrall, across the cosmos and directly into the forming brain of the draconic idol, killing it instantly. The massive half-god erupted from the enormous, collapsing figure’s skull, many drowning to death in the oceans of Aventyr but more still surviving on their patron deity’s enormous back or emerging in the caves of the Underworld.

For centuries the dual-god watched over its children; on Upperworld, Zagn swam the hoyrall to the southernmost shores of Picollo and supported their booming population by shepherding thousands of schools of fish into their nets. Meanwhile, Exis extended its essence across the cosmos to grant his children a great [[Hive Mind|hive mind]], allowing them to act in concert to terrifying effect. After a time however, the insectoid aliens turned to expansion. The halflings of Picollo, at first only thinking the hoyrall to be a minor threat, soon found themselves utterly besieged by their invasion. In the Underworld, they hoyrall had mined out countless tunnels (some leading to Upperworld) making honeycombed fortresses in preparation for a grand martial campaign to capture the entirety of Aventyr in the name of Zagn and Exis. As the time to strike neared they had nearly subjugated the island of Picollo, and their hives below the surface were becoming overpopulated, creating a ripe army to overwhelm all that could stand in their way.

Then The Confluence came to Aventyr.

While the colloid is a magnificent entity, it is not actually a divine being. It did however sense the massive displacement of life forms when Zagnexis transported the hoyrall and its physical self (Zagn), and continued to assess the conduit the god used to connect with its charges. After centuries of studying the anomaly, the timing was right and the colloid struck; an asteroid passing by the alien collective was traveling straight for Aventyr. The impossible calculations of the colloid allowed it to wrest away the Exis’ energies using the comet’s cosmic power, and the bizarre creature used the hurtling chunk of space rock to carry it away into the universe. The link between Exis, Zagn, and the hoyrall was severed by the colloid’s maneuvering, leaving Exis half-formed on the other side of the galaxy. The hoyrall were left without their [[Hive Mind|hive mind]], and Zagn was reduced to an uncontrollable, mindless beast wandering the oceans of Aventyr.

The halflings, ever quick, seized the initiative and fought the hoyrall to a standstill on Picollo that persists today. In the Underworld, things went very differently. In the First Hive (the most populated of all the subterranean bastions), the hoyrall attempted to combat the colloid, but they stood no chance against the alien entity and it quickly grew to overwhelm the few insectoids that managed to organize against it. The primary hive was quickly abandoned to the colloid, and the hoyrall left to travel across the Underworld without the instinctual communication on which they had come to rely so heavily. Tens of thousands died while traveling to the fortress hives of their kin.

What they came to find in these honeycombed bastions nearly broke the hearts of the proudest of their race. The overpopulated fortress-hives had fallen in on one another, all falling to cannibalism as they were besieged by the ever-hungry predators of the Underworld. Still, the heroes from the First Hive brought order to the barbarized hoyrall, marshalling the survivors into parties of warriors that came to carve the insectoids a new place in the Underworld.

The hoyrall from the First Hive began dynasties that largely endure in the Underworld, though any semblance of unity between them fell away some time ago. Now every hive-fortress is a world unto itself with laws and traditions as different from one another as the hoyrall are to upperworlders, ruled over by whatever government the populace is willing to tolerate. The only common trait among them is their reverence for the seers, priests and clergy of Zagnexis. These holy hoyrall are their only connection now to the god that once made them each a part of one whole, and they all feel a primal urge to see that divine gift restored.

## Physical Description
Hoyrall aren’t very tall, only three or so feet in height, but they are powerfully built and possess two sets of arms. Their entire bodies are covered in a glossy, hard chitinous exoskeleton that varies in color by region. Talons surround their fanged maws, which have three small tongues inside rather than one (making them difficult to understand when they speak Common), and the uneducated mistakenly believe them to have two sets of eyes or to see through the large, gem-like stones in their faces, but in truth these were once focuses for their god to exert power through them. The arms and legs of a hoyrall end in claws as sharp as their teeth, each of their bodies patterned with different colored markings that denote to which hive-fortress they belong.

## Society
The hoyrall are unfailing in their pragmatism and ruthless, with little room for emotion, a trait only introduced once their deep connection to Zagnexis was sundered by The Confluence. In lieu of familial ties, they identify with their home hive-fortresses and are cold to one another even in those social confines. Power structures vary from subterranean bastion to bastion, but on the surface they have become deeply militarized in an effort to attain the kind of order they once knew from the influence of their patron deity. Hoyrall rarely record the events of their past and when they do so, it is often in bizarre arrangements difficult for even their elders to interpret correctly. These sparing, primal paintings can be found in the most removed caves of the Woven Warrens, the most populated and well-known honeycombed tunnels the hoyrall call home.

## Relations
While other underworlders might engender hate because of their appearance, the hoyrall inspire revulsion. Their totally alien bodies are extremely disturbing to upperworlders in particular, and their equally strange mannerisms rarely go over well. Still, centuries of cohabitation(albeit largely aggressive) have forced many of them to adopt behavior more suitable to their adopted home—some have transcended these potent social barriers to form extremely valuable alliances with other races and are highly valued for their otherworldly mindset and abilities.

## Alignment & Religion
While they once might all have been the same alignment (indeed, of the same mind) in the centuries since The Confluence the hoyrall developed into as myriad a peoples as any other in Aventyr. While their cultures and traditions may vary, the hoyrall that do not worship Zagnexis are extremely rare and find themselves turned into pariahs instantly when their faith is discovered, if they are not murdered on the spot.

## Adventurers
Life in a hive-fortress can be a daunting experience for any hoyrall, even those with great resolve. While reticent to leave their defensible homes, when one ventures out into Aventyr they typically fare quite well in the wilds, taking easily to the role of barbarians, druids and rangers. Arcane casters among them are rare, and greater honor comes to the most potent warriors of their people.

## Additional Details
**The Hive Fortresses of the Hoyrall**

The hoyrall still live in the original honeycombed cave systems dug out by their ancestors. Many differ from one another—some monetize or even celebrate cannibalism while others abhor it, some happily accept travelers and others kill foreigners on sight—and a Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 20) is the only means to find out just how dangerous entering a particular hive-fortress might be. Being from the same clan within a hive-fortress means very little, save that killing or consuming your kin in plain view of others is extremely taboo. The infractions against whatever laws prevail in the region are also typically met with little patience. The militarization that persists in hive-fortresses does not tolerate criminals, and the chopping off of a hand is disturbingly common.

## Traits
Your hoyrall character counts as a humanoid (hoyrall) for purposes of race. Hoyrall are, however, similar in many ways to aberrations.

***Ability Score Increases.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Hoyrall mature quicker than humans, reaching adulthood at 12 years. Hoyrall can live to become up to 80 years.

***Alignment.*** Where hoyrall once were of a singular alignment, they nowadays do not exhibit a racial tendency per default; while most fortress-hives and hoyrall are lawful, that is a tendency and nothing more. Thanks to their alien perspective, few hoyrall possess the empathy necessary to be called ‘good.’

***Size.*** Hoyrall average about 3 feet and 34 pounds. Your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet and you have a climb speed of 20 feet.

***Alien Mind.*** Your strange psychology render you resistant to being charmed. You have advantage on saves against spells or effects that inflict the charmed condition.

***Carrion Sense.*** Your antennae can pick out corpses and corporeal undead rather easily. You have advantage on scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice corpses and corporeal undead.

***Darkvision.*** You are well-adapted to seeing in the dark thanks to your odd sensory organs. You can see in dim light within 60 ft. of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Light Blindness.*** Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds you for 1 round.

***Multi-Armed.*** You have 4 arms you can use when making attacks. When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to also attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in another hand. You may attack with an additional number of hands beyond your first of up to your Dexterity modifier or 3, whichever is lower. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the additional attacks, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon used has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it. If you attack with more than 2 weapons this way, melee attacks against you gain advantage until your next turn. You still cannot benefit from more than one shield. You may not wield more than one two-handed weapon and two-handed weapons count as two separate weapons wielded for the purpose of this ability. Abilities and feats that usually enhance your capability to wield two weapons instead apply their benefits to all your arms.

***Hoyrall Poison Blood (Ingested).*** The blood of hoyrall is poisonous to almost all species and hoyrall have limited control over it, allowing them to temporarily increase its toxicity. A number of times equal to your Constitution modifier per day, you can envenom a weapon your blood as an action that deals at least 1 point of damage to you. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier or take 3 (1d6) points of poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. This damage increases to 6 (2d6) at 3rd level, 9 (3d6) at 8th level, 12 (4d6) at 13th level and 15 (5d6) at 18th level. At each of these levels, you also get an additional use of your poison. The creature affected must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the poison ends. As a reaction to being bitten by a foe, you can expend one use of your poison to poison the creature who attacked you with a bite attack. Your poison quickly spoils when exposed to air, preventing you from harvesting and selling the poison. Your body produces new doses of poison on a long rest.

***Social Pariah.*** Most races consider hoyrall to be disturbing at best, kill-on-sight material at worst. You suffer disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks against non-hoyrall.

***Strange Anatomy.*** Hoyrall anatomy is strange to other races and there are significant variations between the different hive-fortresses. Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to treat you suffer from disadvantage unless made by a hoyrall from your own hive-fortress or by someone who has studied your anatomy for more than 1 year. (Subject to GM approval.)

***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Languages.*** You can speak Common and speak, write and read the clicking, pitched, chittering language of Hoyr, nigh indecipherable to other races.
