# Funglets
## Overview
### Funglet

[[Funglet.png|open outside]]

These are the children of the mushroom jungles of the Underworld. They are true children of nature, embracing the fungal forests they call home as though each individual capped stalk growing in the subterranean soil were a cousin or sibling. Philosophers have come to believe that they are the sentient expression of lush Underworld forests, literally made for and by the mushrooms themselves. While they are predominantly loners, a small society of funglets have gathered in Dregharka’s Bayou, a fungal jungle bordering the Forever Deep.

## History
The fall of the Dracoprime in the Great Schism presaged the arrival of the funglets in the mushroom jungles below Aventyr, but their true origins are disputed both amongst themselves and Underworld scholars. They aren’t a particularly private or xenophobic race, but their reverent worship of the subterranean groves that birthed them keep the funglets from traveling the breadth of the world, and most folk who even know of the fungal men make no distinction between their individual beliefs.

[[Fantasfunglets]] have deduced that they are the natural evolution of mushroom life. Acting as the historians of their race, they place phenomenal value on reasoning and logical skills—all the pertinent information at their disposal ultimately concludes that while some catalyst may or may not have been present at the time of their appearance after the Great Schism, they are undeniably birthed by a fungal forest.

[[Audirefunglets]] believe they are vestiges of the Dracoprime’s life force, carried to the mushroom jungles by its blood. They refer to the massive draconic idol as the Natural Force (NG, minor deity) and refuse to recognize the claims made of its origin with the Progenitors and their slaves. Instead they personify it as a deity of their own image, a powerful force that persists through each of them.

[[Maculosfunglets]] worship the oldest living thing on the planet, the Honningsop Mushroom, as their patron god and creator. According to their legends they were born within the enormous rhizomorphs of Aventyr’s eldest organism, carried across the Underworld to the many mushroom jungles that fill its endless caves. Any trace of the Honningsop is treated with even greater reverence by [[Maculosfunglets|maculosfunglets]] than their kin, but the Natural Force sees their faith as equally worthy devotion.

However they came to be, the funglets quickly spread throughout the Underworld in the years leading up to and after The Confluence. They have become the wardens of nature beneath the surface of Aventyr, respected by all for their services as caretakers of the exotic, bountiful, mushroom jungles that provide so many subterranean races with means to survive the desperate environments. Were it not for the funglets, the lush fungal forests throughout the endless caves would never have prospered into the enormous groves that dot the Underworld today.

## Physical Description
Funglets are a tall and thin race, typically no shorter than 7 feet in height. Despite their prodigious size, they are a slight peoples and are actually rather weak given their stature. There are three types of funglet, each patterned to have different colors: the fantas are reddish-brown in complexion (with darker spots), the audires are colored much like a bright, sprouting flower and the maculous are a light tannic brown, covered in off-yellow spores. The eyes of these fungal giants are hooded by the mushroom caps that comprise their skulls, often casting shadows over their surprisingly small mouths.

## Society
In the past, funglets were lonesome creatures, tending to the groves of their birth rather than their relationships with other underworlders. Now that The Confluence has come to an end, some of the giant mushroom men have taken to traveling away from the fungal forests they call home and establishing relations with races they previously ignored or gathering together to form communities of their own. Their tightly-knit settlements are seamlessly woven into Underworld groves across Aventyr, typically in burgeoning mushroom jungles being expanded and tended to by the funglets.

## Relations
The solitary lives led by their ancestors have left the funglets rather at a loss when dealing with other races of the Underworld. They are rarely perceived as the gentle giants they are, and they see the fear at their prodigious height and ultimately become quite apprehensive with others. Despite their poisonous appearance, masculosfunglets are the most well-liked variety, though the [[Fantasfunglets|fantasfunglets]] are valued repositories of knowledge and [[Audirefunglets|audirefunglets]] are respected for their deep connection to the natural world.

## Alignment & Religion
Overwhelmingly, funglets are a race of Good-aligned creatures (a true rarity in the Underworld), although there is always the occasional, anomalous growth of an evil funglet, they are uncommon at best. The Natural Force is the principal god of funglets, worshipped by each in their own way.

## Adventurers
Funglets may be adventuring for any number of reasons: to carry abundant spores to new regions of the Underworld, seek out areas recently reached by the Honningsop Mushroom or, in the rare case their own grove has been destroyed or overtaken, to establish a new fungal forest. They are capable warriors of every stripe despite their slow reflexes and lacking strength, but prove to be truly potent spellcasters. Many of these mages or holy mushrooms leave their homes inadvertently on unintended rites of passage inspired by hallucinogenic minerals found in locales known only to their proudest shamans. On the whole, however, they are largely druids or rangers, though not exclusively so.

## Additional Details
**Funglets And Mushroom Jungles**

Previously they were quite sparse, but now funglets are becoming a common sight in the fungal forests of Aventyr. When entering into a mushroom jungle, an Intelligence (Nature) check (DC 20) informs a traveler if they near a settlement of the funglets. Signs of their passing are ubiquitous to those that know them, the giants tromping through the subterranean soil and tending to the vast mushrooms that dominate the regions they inhabit. Of all the Underworld races, they are often perceived as the most kindly and approachable; many survivors of Underworld expeditions praise them highly for providing a safe place to rest from the countless dangers of the endless caves. Explorers ought to be wary, however; myceloids have been known to enchant themselves to appear as funglets to lure unsuspecting travelers to their untimely deaths.
