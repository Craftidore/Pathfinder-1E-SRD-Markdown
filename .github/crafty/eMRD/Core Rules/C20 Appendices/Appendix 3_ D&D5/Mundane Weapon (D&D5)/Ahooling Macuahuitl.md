## Description
This vicious and savage weapon crafted by the [[Ahooling|ahooling]] is also known as “thirsting stick” in their guttural tongue. The weapon is a sword-like paddle crafted from bones or fungi, with grooves along the cutting edges, These are filled with chips or obsidian, sharpened bone or crystals, usually held in place with a mossy, fungus-based adhesive. The jagged edges of these chips have a nasty tendency to splinter off in the wounds of foes. The [[Ahooling|ahooling]] macuahuitl is a martial weapon, but [[Ahooling|ahoolings]] treat it as a simple weapon.
