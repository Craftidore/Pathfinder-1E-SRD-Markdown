## Description
This odd weapon is held in high regard by [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] champions. Fashioned from an odd combination of lightweight metal and resin known only to the [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]], this weapon is reminiscent of a large gleaming paddle, with the head half as long as the haft (around 2 feet). The shape of the katana-eku allows it to be used in chopping or slashing movements, but it may also be employed as a bludgeoning weapon. It also makes for a great paddle when not used in combat, providing tool proficiency for water vehicles for vessels relying on oars. The [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] katana-eku is a martial weapon, but [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] treat it as a simple weapon instead.
