## Description
A highly efficient and deadly siege weapon also used in the defense of most major [[Dweorg|dweorg]] cities, a rock-singer constitutes basically a set-up not unlike a catapult crossed with a repeating ballista, though most folks will never see it as such—the [[Dweorg|dweorg]] tend to integrate these in gigantic statues depicting their ancestors. When activated, the mouth opens and begins firing massive rocks (or stalactites) at the target area. While stationary (and targeting e.g. the area in front of a city’s gates), the machinery is so efficient, it only requires one crew member to reload and man. When moving, it does require a second crew member to properly aim.

**Rock-singer Stone.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 200/800 (can't hit targets within 20 ft. of it), one target. *Hit:* 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage. (Rock-singers firing stalactites may cause piercing damage instead, subject to GM's approval.)
