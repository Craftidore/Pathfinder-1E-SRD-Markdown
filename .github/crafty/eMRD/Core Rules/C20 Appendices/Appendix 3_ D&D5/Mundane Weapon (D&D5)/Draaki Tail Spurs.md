## Description
Employed exclusively by the Abbsins [[Draaki|draaki]], the noninitiated who do not know about the different [[Draaki|draaki]] subtypes have provided the more commonly known moniker. Tail spurs are small, retractable blades built into armored sections and this is an adaptation of the more commonly known regular spurs employed by martial artists of all races. The blades are released by turning the tail in a specific, curling motion. A primary use for these weapons is that they can be used while grappled. Usually, an abbsins tail is not flexible or precise enough to wield weapons, but this one is designed to work for their tail in grapples and may thus be used while restrained or after being swallowed whole and similar situations where the properly hand-wielded weapons simply do not work. The [[Draaki|draaki]] tail spur is a light martial weapon, but only [[Draaki|draaki]] with the abbsins tail racial feature have proficiency with it.
