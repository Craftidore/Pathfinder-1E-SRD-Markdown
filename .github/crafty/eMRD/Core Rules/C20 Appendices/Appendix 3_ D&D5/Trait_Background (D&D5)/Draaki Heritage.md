**[[Draaki]] Heritage**

***Breath Weapon.*** You can use your action to exhale a destructive line or cone of energy. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Abbsins Tail.*** You can use your tail as a weapon to attack foes. *Melee Weapon Attack:* 1d8 + your Strength modifier, reach 10 ft., one target. You are proficient with your tail. A creature hit must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC= 8 + your Strength of Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, it falls prone.

***Yuralith Wings.*** By flapping your wings, you can slow your descent to 60 feet per round. You do not take falling damage and land on your feet. If you are incapacitated, paralyzed or petrified before reaching the ground, you begin falling normally.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your [[Draaki|draaki]] heritage.
