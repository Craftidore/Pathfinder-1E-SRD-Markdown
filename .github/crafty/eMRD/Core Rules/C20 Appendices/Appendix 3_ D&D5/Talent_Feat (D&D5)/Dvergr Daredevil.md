# Dvergr Daredevil
## Overview
You have seen enough cave-ins to know exactly what to do.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on all Strength and Dexterity saving throws to avoid being caught in a cave-in, avalanche, collapsing structure, etc. On a successful save, you take no damage from the collapse and don’t fall prone or become buried.
- You gain advantage on all Strength and Dexterity checks to dig yourself free from rubble, snow and similar substances that bury you.
- You do not treat the ground subject to an earthquake or similar event as difficult terrain and don’t have to make Constitution saving throws during earthquakes to avoid having your concentration broken.
- You add your proficiency bonus to the save DC of ambersticks you throw.
