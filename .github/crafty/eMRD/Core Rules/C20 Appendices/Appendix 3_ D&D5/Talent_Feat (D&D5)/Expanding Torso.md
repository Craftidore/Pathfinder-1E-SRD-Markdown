# Expanding Torso
## Overview
Your lungs are impressive and breathing deeply causes your torso to expand considerably, making it appear as if you are larger than you really are.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Kraidyl]], Constitution 17 or higher*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You can hold your breath for an additional number of rounds equal to your Constitution score.
- You can breathe deeply as an action to make yourself appear as if you are one size larger than you are, gaining advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks as creatures instinctively cower before your bulk. However, your speed is halved while you bolster yourself this way and you canâ€™t benefit from any bonus to your speed. You may breathe out at any time as your free object interaction during a move or as a reaction to being attacked or taking damage.
