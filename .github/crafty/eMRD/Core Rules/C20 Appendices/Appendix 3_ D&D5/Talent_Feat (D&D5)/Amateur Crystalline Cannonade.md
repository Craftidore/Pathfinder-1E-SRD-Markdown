# Amateur Crystalline Cannonade
## Overview
You have learned to grow a powerful [[Crystalline Crossbow Rules|crystalline crossbow]] from the protrusions of your body.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Colliatur]], Dexterity 10 or higher*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You may grow your choice of either a light crossbow, hand crossbow or heavy crossbow from your crystal-sheathed arm as part of making a ranged attack. This crossbow is loaded and fires shards of your own, rapidly regenerating body as ammunition. The crystalline ammunition is in all regards identical to regular ammunition for the respective crossbow. Only your crossbow can fire your ammunition. You can will your crossbow back into your body as an action that provokes opportunity attacks.
- Starting at 6th level, your crystalline ammunition receives +1 to attack and damage rolls and is treated as ammunition+1 for all intents and purposes. This bonus increases to +2 at 12th level and +3 at 18th level. Crystalline ammunition becomes brittle and loses all potency when taken from your body and thus can never be sold.
