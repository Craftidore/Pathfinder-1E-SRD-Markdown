# Terrifying Revelation
## Overview
You know how to use your reputation to strike terror into the hearts of your foes.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Ahooling]], flying speed*

## Effects
- You gain advantage on attacks against creatures you have surprised.
- If you surprise a creature and hit it with a bite during the first round of combat, the target and all creatures hostile to you within a 30-feet radius of the target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Charisma modifier (your choice). On a failed save, the creatures are frightened for 1 round per point of your Strength or Charisma modifier (your choice).
- If you have vampiric bite, you may use it one additional time before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.
