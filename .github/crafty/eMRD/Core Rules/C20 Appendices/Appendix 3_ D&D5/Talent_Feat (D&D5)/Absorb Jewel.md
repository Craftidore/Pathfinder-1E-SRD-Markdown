# Absorb Jewel
## Overview
Tapping into the earthly powers of your ancestors, you absorb a gem or jewel into your body, gaining some of its resilience for a time.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Svirfneblin]], Constitution 15 or higher*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- As an action, you can force a jewel of at least 1000 gp into your skin, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC. You increase this value by+ 1 for every additional 500 gp of the gem’s value (maximum +5). You may only have one gem implanted at any given time.
- Alternatively, you can gain damage threshold 1, + 1 for every additional 1500 gp of the gem’s value you inserted for a number of minutes equal to class level. This consumes the gem. You may only have one gem implanted at any given time.
