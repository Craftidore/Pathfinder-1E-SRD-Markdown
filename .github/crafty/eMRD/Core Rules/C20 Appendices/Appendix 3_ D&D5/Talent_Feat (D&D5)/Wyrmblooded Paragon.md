You have ingested strange concoctions and lived among different types of [[Draaki|draaki]], regaining some of the erstwhile splendor of your race.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- Choose one subtype of [[Draaki|draaki]] to which you currently do not belong from the [[Draaki Heritage]] table. You gain the Breath Weapon or Other Abilities of the [[Draaki|draaki]] subtype as well as their [[Draaki]] Resistance. You now are treated as belonging to both subtypes of [[Draaki|draaki]].
- You may use each of your breath weapons, if you have one breath weapon or more, one additional time before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.
- You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you choose another [[Draaki|draaki]] subtype, gaining the benefits associated. The effects stack.
