# Freeze
## Overview
Lacking the requirement to move, eat or breathe, you can freeze in place, blending in almost perfectly.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Dødelig]]*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from a statue. Even close examination does not give you away, though attacking you obviously causes pain and may cause you to give your true nature away.
- You gain proficiency in Dexterity (Stealth) checks. When you try to hide in a subterranean environment or against a backdrop of unworked rock, your ossified bones blend right in, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
