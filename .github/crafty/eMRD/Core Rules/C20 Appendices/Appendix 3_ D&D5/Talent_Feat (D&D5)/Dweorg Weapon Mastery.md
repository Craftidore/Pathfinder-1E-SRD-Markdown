# Dweorg Weapon Mastery
## Overview
You are particularly adept at using the traditional [[Dweorg|dweorg]] weapons.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the Attack action and attack with only a battleaxe or a warhammer, you use the damage value for use with two hands when wielding the weapon in one hand. When wielding the weapon in two hands, the weapon instead has a damage value of 2d6.
- When using light hammers or handaxes to make a ranged attack, increase the normal and maximum range by +10 ft.
