# Helfire Master
## Overview
You have mastered the eldritch practices and infernal powers of the [[Gitwerc]].

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You reduce the price the creation of a *blood candle* costs by 50 gp per hit die.
- You may use [[Helfire Ash|helfire ash]] as a material component when casting a spell that deals fire damage to convert all of the fire damage caused to necrotic damage. You may also use [[Helfire Ash|helfire Ash]] as a material component for a spell that deals necrotic damage to convert that damage to fire damageâ€”either half (for half necrotic, half fire damage), or all of it. You also may use [[Helfire Ash|helfire ash]] up to 6 times per day as an optional material component. A 7th use in a given day knocks you unconscious.
- You gain 2 additional [[Dweorg|dweorg]] forms you can freely choose.
