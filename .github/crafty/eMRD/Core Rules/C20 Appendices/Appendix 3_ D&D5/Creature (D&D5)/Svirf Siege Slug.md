***Bred for Convenience.*** While svirf siege slugs are notoriously stupid and foul-tempered, they have been bred over generations to understand and heed the commands of svirfneblin. Any attack the siege slug performs against a svirfneblin suffers from disadvantage, as something within the creature refuses to attack the beings it was bred to serve.

***Mobile Siege Platform.*** Siege slugs have a stretch of skin on their back where they simply have no nerves - this section was specifically bred into the creature to allow svirfneblin not only to place whole regiments on their backs: The tissue is surprisingly sticky, allowing svirfneblin to erect siege platforms and weapons on the back of svirf siege slugs.

## Description
With the troubles of Svirfdozers indelibly marking the history of [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]], there is a sensible aversion to the creation and use of mechanical vehicles. After the fall of the last network of Amber Roads during the Confluence, most undergnomes have taken to adapting the Underworld to their advantage and developed a pervading fondness for riding slugs. Virtually every [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] enclave, regardless of its technological prowess, boasts stables and pens of mollusc mounts for traversing the endless caves of Aventyr.
