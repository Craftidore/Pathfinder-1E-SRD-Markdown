## Description
*Bluish mist forms into the shape of a purple-fleshed dog. Its long red tongue loll out of a viciously fanged mouth beneath two blank, ovoid eyes.*

Gøgelid are typically found with or near [[Dødelig|dødelig]], usually coexisting peacefully and helping the undead halflings find their buried kin in the Underworld of Aventyr. Where the gøgelid originally come from remains unknown. Though intelligent and sometimes quite talkative, the animated canines never speak of more than the name of their home dimension: Preokret. This has never diminished their relationship with [[Dødelig|dødelig]], who happily accept the four-legged creatures into their families. Once part of a home, gøgelid are fiercely territorial of both the building and its inhabitants, but otherwise they are generally quite friendly and curious.

A gøgelid is roughly the size of a very large dog, standing on its hind legs at a height of about 5 ft., and weighs as much as 110 pounds.
