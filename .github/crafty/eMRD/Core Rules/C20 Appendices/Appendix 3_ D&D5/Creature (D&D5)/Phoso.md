***Material Prisoner.*** The phoso can never become ethereal or leave the Material Plane. Any spell or effect that would teleport it or otherwise move it to another plane automatically fails.

***Multiattack.*** . The phoso makes four slam attacks. It may use one necrotic ray instead of two of its slam attacks. It can fire up to two necrotic rays instead of making any slam attacks.

***Detaching Slam.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (1d10+6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a medium or smaller creature and is hit by two or more slam attacks in one round, the phoso may impose the grappled condition (escape DC 17) on the target. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and the phoso can't execute any other attacks, as it focuses on pulling the limbs from the creature, dealing 49 (4d10+24) bludgeoning damage on any subsequent round. Additionally, a target suffering this damage must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take one level of exhaustion from the painful strain. Creatures without discernible limbs are immune to having their limbs pulled off.

***Slam.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (1d12+6) bludgeoning damage.

***Necrotic Ray.*** The phoso may shoot up to two necrotic rays at one or two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or it can't take reactions until the end of its next turn and takes 9 (3d4+2) necrotic damage. A successful save negates the effects of the ray.

## Description
*A giant skitters toward you on six clumping hooves, the four arms jutting out of the top of its torso menacingly gripping and unclenching as its beady yellow eyes fix on your arms.*

The [[Drow|drow]] of the Underworld are keen to enslave every sentient (or nonsentient) that wanders into their lands, regardless of whether or not it is native to Aventyr. A sizable band of witchwyrd made the critical mistake of trusting the [[Drow|drow]], failing to realize that the dark elves’ hospitality was a dangerous ruse before it was far too late. Vastly outnumbered and grounded to the spot by mages, the otherworldly creatures entered the custody of the Endless Cave’s enslavers, never to leave this Material Plane again. Once the [[Drow|drow]] garnered every bit of information they could from their captives, they began to explore other avenues of use. Dark elven alchemists quickly took to the task, using the witchwyrd prisoners for horrifying magical experimentation and forcing them to produce offspring broken by what was being done to their bodies. The resulting children were birthed as phoso, made into personal bodyguards and watch dogs that prowl the underkeeps of their oppressive, powerful Underworld mage masters.
