*Long whipping antennae sprout from what must be the elongated neck of this long, serpentine vermin carried along by dozens of small, skittering legs. Its one eye blinks between the snapping pincers around its huge maw as it sees you and tilts its head curiously.*

***Unkind Pheromones.*** The segmented whips on the anghenfil's head slather creatures with invisible pheromones that most creatures find appallingly disgusting. Non-insectoid beasts and non-hoyrall touched by the anghenfil's antennae must succeed a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be so disgusted by the stench that any action not devoted to scrubbing the stench off is at disadvantage. Using an action to scrub off the pheromones gets rid of them, as does more than 5 points of fire damage or submersion in water. Immunity to the poisoned condition renders immunity against the pheromones as well.

**Actions**

---

***Multiattack.*** The anghenfil makes two whipping antennae attacks and one bite attack. 

***Bite.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 19 (2d10+8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the anghenfil, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the anghenfil, and it takes 25 (6d6+4) acid damage at the start of each of the anghenfil's turns. If the anghenfil takes more than 30 damage on a single turn from a creature inside it, the anghenfil must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of the turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which all fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the anghenfil. If the anghenfil dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Whipping Antennae.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* pheromones and grappled damage. Affected by unkind pheromones feature and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The anghenfil has two antennae, each of which can grapple one target.

## Description
Whipping antennae sprout from what must be the elongated neck of this long, serpentine vermin carried along by dozens of small, skittering legs. Its one eye blinks between the snapping pincers around its huge maw as it sees you and tilts its head curiously.

A few decades after the [[Hive Mind|hive mind]] shattered, many [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] devoted themselves to mending the destroyed connection to their homeworld—all of them ultimately failed but a few saw a measure of success, drawing baby anghenfil across the cosmos to Aventyr. On their native planet these durable creatures are made for war, but stripped of the connection to their riders, they are now little more than draft animals or gladiatorial combatants.

Anghenfil are 30 ft. long but taper to their end, so only 20 ft. of the creature is substantial enough to take up much space. They typically weigh between 4000 and 5000 pounds.
