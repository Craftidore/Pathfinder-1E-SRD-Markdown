## Portfolio: Ahool
*This creature is easily the size and stock of a strong man or orc, corded with thick muscles that belie a nearly elven litheness. Unlike the kinder races, sharp talons extend from its hands and feet and its ears dwarf the creature’s head in their impressive size. The resemblance to a bat is uncanny, made concrete by the massive leathery wings that sprout from its back. Mottled brown fur covers its skin and accentuate the incredible tone of fitness apparent in the bat-like humanoid.*

***Multiattack.*** An ahool makes one bite attack and two claw attacks. It may substitute a weapon attack for the bite attack, if it has a weapon.

***Bite.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the piercing damage taken, and the ahool regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. 

***Claw.****Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and is hit by both claws in a given round, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the ahool can't bite another target. When the ahool moves, any target it is grappling moves with it.

Ahool are terrifying creatures that soar through the endless caverns of the Underworld of Aventyr. They are primordial hunters that strike swiftly and without warning, carrying subdued prey away to a moss cavern for eating later.

The average ahool is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds or so (despite its slender form and ability to fly).
