**Save:** Fortitude DC 18

**Onset:** 1d3 day

**Frequency:**

When a character takes more than 30 points of acid damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil (such as the presence of an evil outsider or a desecrated area), she risks contracting acid fever. Festering boils cover the victimâ€™s flesh, and the skin blackens and withers.

When damaged, character must succeed at another saving throw or 1 point of temporary damage is permanent drain instead.
