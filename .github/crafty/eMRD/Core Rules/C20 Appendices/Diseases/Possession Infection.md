# Possession Infection
## Overview
**Type:** disease, contact

**Save:** Fortitude DC 17

**Onset:** 1 day

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d6 Wis, 1d6 Cha

**Cure:** 

This malady occurs only after an evil spirit, outsider, or other dominating force (including the effect of *dominate person* cast by an evil caster) has possessed the victim. The victim slowly becomes despondent and lethargic, apparently mentally affected by the alien presence that was within her soul.

Successful saves do not allow the character to recover. Only magical healing can save the character.

**Source:** Book of Vile Darkness, pg. 32
