# Sleeping Sickness
## Overview
**Type:** disease (parasite), injury

**Save:** Fortitude DC 14

**Onset:** 1d2 days

**Frequency:** 1/day

**Effect:** 1d4 Wis damage and target is [[Fatigued|fatigued]]

**Cure:** 2 consecutive saves or arsenic (see text)

Endemic throughout the Sodden Lands and the Mwangi Expanse, the parasitic aff liction known as “sleeping sickness” is spread when f lying insects inject tiny parasites into their unsuspecting victim’s bloodstream, thus inducing fever, headache, joint pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia.

While exceedingly dangerous, even when administered by a practiced healer, the best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). If the patient survives, there’s a cumulative 30% chance per dose that the disease is immediately cured.
