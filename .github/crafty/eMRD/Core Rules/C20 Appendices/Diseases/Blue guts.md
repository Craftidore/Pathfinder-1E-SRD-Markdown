# Blue guts
## Overview
**Type:** disease, special

**Save:** Fortitude DC 14

**Onset:** 1d3 days

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d4 Str

**Cure:** 

This disease comes from eating the flesh of particularly disgusting creatures such as otyughs, gibbering mouthers, and gray oozes. It results in a bluish complexion, particularly around the creatureâ€™s intestines (hence the name). Many (but not all) predatory magical beasts, aberrations, and other creatures are immune to this disease, but no humanoids are.

**Source:** Book of Vile Darkness, pg. 30
