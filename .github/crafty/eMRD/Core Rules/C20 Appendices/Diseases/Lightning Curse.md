# Lightning Curse
## Overview
**Type:** disease, contact

**Save:** Fortitude DC 18

**Onset:** 1 day

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d6 Int

**Cure:** 

When a character takes more than 30 points of electricity damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil (as with acid fever, above), she risks contracting lightning curse. As her blood vessels burst, the victim is covered in blue and black bruises. Her muscles ache and she cannot think straight.

When damaged, character must succeed at another saving throw or 1 point of temporary damage is permanent drain instead.
