# Deafened
## Overview
A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a –4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks based on sound, takes a –4 penalty on opposed [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
