# Grappled
## Overview
A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a –4 penalty to Dexterity. A grappled creature takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler's CMB + spell level), or lose the spell. Grappled creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity.

A grappled creature cannot use [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so. If a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its CMD to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.

**GM NOTE**

The official errata didn't say to change this but under concentration it says...."Casting a spell while you have the grappled or [[Pinned|pinned]] condition is difficult and requires a concentration check (DC 10 + the grappler’s CMB + the level of the spell you’re casting). [[Pinned]] creatures can only cast spells that do not have somatic components." It is our opinion that the condition should also be updated to match but until errata or an FAQ is provided indicating such, Iwill not alter the actual text.
