# Exhausted
## Overview
An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a â€“6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
