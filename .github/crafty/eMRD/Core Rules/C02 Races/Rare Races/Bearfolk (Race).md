# Bearfolk (Race)
## Overview
Although they typically eschew urban areas, bearfolk exist in scattered enclaves throughout Midgard. A rare few even live the life of an adventurer, defying the prejudices and ignorance they face among populations that neither know about nor respect their kind. Bearfolk are typically quiet and insular but devoted to their families and communities. For adventurers, this translates into a fierce loyalty to their companions. Bearfolk are often drawn to a path early in life; whether it’s as a fighter, a barbarian, a druid, an oracle, or another discipline, bearfolk often find that they have a powerful connection to nature and to their more primal natures. 

**Physical Description:** There are two main subtypes of bearfolk in Midgard. The bearfolk that were born in the far north are known as Grizzlehides, and they are thicker, hardier examples of the race. Their fur ranges from black to golden, and often has lighter gray or blond tips. They are more likely to be tough and ferocious in battle. These bearfolk have the bear hug and thick coat alternate racial traits.

Rarer than their grizzlehide kin, Purifier bearfolk often possess a strong affinity for nature, acting as spiritual anchors in their communities. Purifiers are usually slighter in build, with reddish or pale fur. A recent branch of the bearfolk race, most Purifier bearfolk originate in the Moonlit Glades as opposed to Bjeornheim in Midgard. These bearfolk often have the nature's gift and stalwart will alternate racial traits (*Midgard Player's Guide* 27).

**Alternate Racial Traits**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of the standard xxx racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Bear Hug (Ex):** Bearfolk are renowned for using their bulk to overwhelm foes. They can attempt to bear hug an opponent of their size or smaller by making a bite attack as a full-round action. If the bearfolk hits with its bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. This racial trait replaces scent. 

**Nature's Gift:** Many bearfolk develop an affinity for spiritual matters over physical strength and violence. Bearfolk with this racial trait and a Wisdom score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities once per day: *[[Guidance (Spell)|guidance]], [[Know Direction (Spell)|know direction]], [[Speak with Animals (Spell)|speak with animals]],* and *virtue*. The caster level for these effects is equal to the bearfolk's character level. This racial trait replaces natural weapons and powerful build. 

**Stalwart Will:** Some bearfolk possess nearly unbreakable resolve and a deep self-awareness. If the bearfolk fails save against a charm or compulsion effect that that has a duration greater than 1 round, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect. This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If a bearfolk with this racial trait gains a similar ability from another source, they can only use one of these abilities per round, but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails. This racial trait replaces armor. 

**Thick Coat**: Bearfolk native to the northern climes of Midgard can comfortably survive frigid temperatures. The bearfolk does not have to make Fortitude saves and takes no damage due to cold environments. The bearfolk does not gain resistance to cold damage from non-environmental sources. This racial trait replaces ursine talent.
