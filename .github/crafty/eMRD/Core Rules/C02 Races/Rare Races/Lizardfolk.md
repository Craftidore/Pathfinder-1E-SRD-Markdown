# Lizardfolk
## Overview
Lizardfolk are one of the most misunderstood races in the world, reviled by other humanoid societies for their practice of cannibalism, their frequent alliances with or subjugation by evil dragons, and their tendency to war over border encroachments and environmental exploitation.

Despite the misunderstandings of outsiders about this race of people, lizardfolk occupy and protect ecological niches which benefit the world at large. When treated fairly and given the means to peaceably integrate with other humanoid societies, they become valued allies and powerful members of standing multicultural armies.

**Physical Description**: Most lizardfolk resemble iguana-descended humanoids, with thick scales and spines running down the length of their backs and tails. Scale coloration varies from a bright blue to all shades of yellow and green and several hues of dusky brown. Lizardfolk who evolved from other species of lizards also exist; depending on the individual racial traits they possess, a tribe may more closely resemble geckos, chameleons, or monitors, with scale coloration varying correspondingly. Some lizardfolk are also descended in part from true dragons, and typically sport the scale coloration and bone structure of the type of dragon whose genes they inherited. Although their average height and weight are only slightly more than that of humans (6 to 7 feet tall, 200 to 250 pounds), lizardfolk hulks and pygmies represent extreme outliers to the median, with varying statistics as described below.

**Alignment and Religion**: Lizardfolk are highly attuned to nature, and their superstitions reflect this closeness to the environment. Druidic and elemental faiths are the most common religions among lizardfolk tribes, although a tribe may adopt a deity as a result of exposure to another culture or having been conquered by another race. A few lizardfolk tribes, particularly the dragonsired variants, worship dragons as gods made flesh. They appear to be granted spells through their prayers to these living “gods,” but exactly how this happens is largely a mystery. Given their reverence for equilibrium, lizardfolk typically tend toward neutrality on both alignment axes, although their individual tribal cultures and favored deities can swing them toward good or evil quite easily.

**Names**: Lizardfolk names feature many *h, s*, and *k* consonant sounds. They avoid *b, m*, and *p* consonant sounds due to the lack of a true bilabial mouth; although these phonetics are absent from the Draconic language for this very reason, lizardfolk can approximate these sounds when speaking other languages.

In personal names, the first spot between two consonants which would normally be joined by a vowel sound is a slurred combination of the consonants, denoted in written Common with an apostrophe. Typically, female names end in vowels, and male names end in consonants. 

Tribal names are one-word phrases in Draconic, usually ending in *i*, that translate to a descriptor-noun pairing of either the tribe’s physical appearance or the place where they live. Tribal names are not usually part of a personal introduction, unless the lizardfolk is formally representing her tribe. When a lizardfolk speaks in another language, she translates the pairing literally—so F’haisa, our signature lizardfolk, would introduce herself in Common as F’haisa Yellow Crest if speaking for her tribe.

*Male Names*: H’serisseth, K’vaal, L’soorh, S’hesh, T’siik.

*Female Names*: F’haisa, J’haira, N’hannali, T’siika, V’sana.

*Tribe Names*: Dry Riverbed (Vhitaari), Low Marsh (Tsiikil), Red Talon (Kharusi), Ruined Temple (Ixtupi), Yellow Crest (Dhuuvij).

**Society and Lands**

**Tribes and Families**: Lizardfolk tribes consist of anywhere from three to 20 families living and working in concert to ensure their continued survival. For this very reason, cannibalism is not taboo among their kind: the dead are a food source, no different from hunted game or butchered cattle. Hatcheries are a core element of tribal society: every tribe has a dedicated building for laying, storing, and caring for eggs and younglings. Juveniles live in these hatching enclaves for the first year of their lives before returning to their families, protected by the tribe’s strongest warriors and taught to work and contribute from birth. Mothers rotate shifts within the hatching enclave so that the younglings learn to value those who have given them life and acquire a wide range of skills from the tribe’s parental figures.

**Government and Leaders**: Due to their survivalistic nature, lizardfolk pick their leaders from those most capable of leading them toward prosperity. Typically, tribal leaders include the most powerful warriors, the most fertile females, and the advisors with the most sophisticated understanding of nature and magic. Rarely does a tribe defer to a single leader, unless they have been subjugated by a greater power such as a dragon. Instead, two to five tribal leaders are recognized by the collective community and rule via majority consensus in disputes. Any dispute which cannot be settled peaceably is decided in ritual combat (which is usually not fought to the death).

**Love and Mating**: Romantic love is a strange concept to lizardfolk; they acknowledge it on some level, but it takes up far less of their socialization process than it does among other humanoid races. Given their species’ narrow focus on reproduction and survival, lizardfolk have no concept of monogamy, and homosexual behavior is extremely rare. However, there is evidence to suggest that protandry and protogyny (the spontaneous changing of biological sex) occurs within stressed lizardfolk populations, which may cause a sudden reversal of an individual’s gender role. Although lizardfolk manipulate the distribution of males and females within their communities by altering the ambient temperature of their hatcheries, sometimes calamity (usually war or plague) befalls a tribe so as to deplete large numbers of one sex. As a result, lizardfolk may spontaneously change sex so as to rebalance the population.

**Language and Script**: Lizardfolk use the Draconic language for all communication. They arrange stones or hack letters into trees to mark their territory in simple Draconic words, usually no more than four to a sentence. Writing is otherwise scarce among their people; the oral tradition plays a central role in lizardfolk life, since nights are spent by cookfires reciting tribal histories over meals. Lizardfolk can learn other languages but speak with sibilant, hissing accents regardless of the tongue in which they are speaking.

**Relations**: Lizardfolk tribes share borders, and sometimes crucial trade routes and resources, with a multitude of races. Their relations with their neighbors are as varied as their own genes.

*Aasimars and Tieflings*: Superstitious lizardfolk may interpret the appearance of a humanoid with outsider blood as a sign from a deity. Which way that interpretation falls is dependent upon what sort of deity the lizardfolk tribe in question happens to worship. At best, they might consider the half-outsider a piece of divinity made flesh, beseeching them for guidance or blessings. At worst, they’ll deem the very presence of such a being an encroachment by a rival power and attack it mercilessly, lest the “godling” draw its presumed master’s attention to the tribe.

*Dwarves*: Curt, insular, and resistant to sudden change—these descriptors apply as well to lizardfolk as they do to dwarves. Lizardfolk get on oddly well with dwarves in the few regions where these races happen to cross paths, primarily because they are both doers rather than talkers. Neighboring lizardfolk tribes and dwarven clans tend to broker land disputes and trade agreements quickly, simply, and amicably, and generally stick to their word once any formal pacts have been forged. Although substantial interaction between the two people is rare, their dealings are usually cordial.

*Grippli*: Lizardfolk cooperate and trade with nearby grippli settlements, since they fill an important ecological niche: grippli eat dangerous pests that bring disease to lizardfolk tribes and hunt creatures like spiders, snakes, giant insects, and worse monsters that feed on the eggs and young of both races. However, grippli also hunt the same prey and forage the same plants as lizardfolk. In an environment where these resources are particularly scarce, a lizardfolk tribe will not hesitate to exterminate a competitor race—and this pragmatic outlook is well-known and feared among the grippli.

*Humans*: Contact between humans and lizardfolk is overwhelmingly tense and fraught with diplomatic pitfalls on both sides of the racial divide. Humans tend to exploit and divert natural resources without regard for the environmental impact they may cause on a given ecosystem. This does not sit well with lizardfolk, whose survival depends on steady, predictable equilibrium. As a result, even well-meaning human visitors are viewed with suspicion among lizardfolk. Humans also have a funny way of opening relations with new people, when they bother to even do it—usually, it involves a lot of words, and most lizardfolk are too concerned with survival and duty to indulge in loquaciousness. Human delegates may mistake a tribe’s curt, but honest (and even positive), response to diplomatic overtures for an insulting retort or a disregard for the station of the noble or government who sent them.

**Adventurers**: Adventurers are less common among lizardfolk than other player races on average. Tribes need their best soldiers, mages, and priests to remain among their people in order to ensure their survival, and to leave one’s duties for such base desires as glory or greed is to dishonor oneself in the eyes of the tribe. However, some lizardfolk defy tradition or receive permission from their leaders in order to pursue an end greater than the welfare of the individual tribe, such as preserving the regional ecology or serving their tribe’s deity. Lizardfolk who are enslaved or press-ganged into service by outsiders may resort to the adventuring lifestyle if freed, especially if their servitude has carried them far away from their tribe.

*Barbarian*: The most common class among lizardfolk communities, barbarians are prized as fierce defenders of tribal lands. Lizardfolk tribes who are allied with or worship an evil dragon patron boast higher numbers of barbarians among their ranks, since these dragons usually prefer unthinking brutes who follow orders without question.

*Druid*: Second only to barbarians in number, lizardfolk druids play many roles in the existence of a tribe. They are healers, nurses, religious leaders, and protectors of the natural equilibrium that sustains a tribe’s ecological niche.

*Hunter*: Occupying a solid middle ground between the role of druid and ranger, lizardfolk hunters often bond with reptilian or dinosaur companions native to the areas in which they live. They typically fall into the role of providing food for their tribe rather than defending borders or offering magical support, although their versatility allows them to do either when necessary.

*Magus*: True magi are rare among lizardfolk compared to sorcerers and witches, but are not unheard of. However, most lizardfolk who pursue this class take up a path of magical discipline which refocuses their talents on their inborn magical aptitude rather than the study of written magic (such as the eldritch scion ACG or hexcrafter UM archetypes).

*Ranger*: Lizardfolk tribes that seek to expand or relocate due to encroachments by other races or changes in the local ecology prize rangers for their ability to handle field reconnaissance and lead other tribal soldiers through rough terrain. Lizardfolk rangers typically eschew animal companions, preferring to focus their talents on enhancing their allies’ acumen in combat and scouting.

## Lizardfolk Racial Traits

**Humanoid**: Lizardfolk are humanoids with the reptilian subtype. 

**Medium**: Lizardfolk are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed**: Lizardfolk have a base land speed of 30 feet. They also have a swim speed of 15 feet, allowing them to move in water without making Swim checks and granting them a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks.

**Hold Breath:** A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

**Natural Armor**: Lizardfolk have tough scaly skin, granting them a +2 natural armor bonus.

**Natural Attacks**: Lizardfolk have sharp teeth and hard nails, granting them two claw attacks (1d4 points of damage each) and a bite attack (1d3 points of damage).

**Languages**: Lizardfolk begin play speaking Common and Draconic. Lizardfolk with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aquan, Dwarven, Grippli, and Sylvan.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**ALTERNATE RACIAL RULES**

Lizardfolk are a wildly varied and independent race. As a result, there are many variations in their abilities, outlooks, and styles. The following rules are just some of the different traits that manifest in lizardfolk, frequently without regard for heritage or training.

**Additional Racial Traits**

The following race traits are available for lizardfolk.

**Autotomic Tail:** Your tail can break off and regrow itself, allowing you to escape certain situations more easily. You may take a +20 trait bonus to any CMB check or Escape Artist check to escape a grapple or full-body restraint as a swift action; when you do so, your tail breaks off, and you lose any benefits gained from having a tail until it regenerates. The tail regrows itself in 1d6+8 days (if you have regeneration, such as from a magic ring, spell, or other effect, this time is halved).

**Expressive Dewlap**: You have a colorful flap of skin beneath your chin and neck that expands dramatically when you breathe, and you can use this when attempting to impress others. You gain a +2 trait bonus to all Intimidate and Perform checks and also on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against any creatures of the dragon type or reptilian subtype who are sexually attracted to you.

**Nictitating Membranes**: You possess a secondary set of translucent eyelids that protect you from assaults against your vision. You gain a +2 trait bonus to all saving throws against effects that would cause you to become blinded. 

**Pain Tolerance**: You gain a +2 trait bonus to Constitution checks made to stabilize when reduced to negative hit points, as well as to concentration checks made due to taking damage while casting spells.

**Tough-Scaled**: You gain a +2 trait bonus to your AC against critical hit confirmation rolls from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing weapons.

**Alternate Racial Traits**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of standard lizardfolk racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Adhesive Feet**: Lizardfolk whose evolutionary forebears include geckos frequently exhibit this trait. These lizardfolk have a climb speed of 15 feet, allowing them to take 10 on most Climb checks and granting them a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks (see the Climb skill description in the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook* for more details). Additionally, a Climb check that fails by 9 or less means that she makes no progress, and one that fails by 10 or more means that she falls from whatever height she has already attained. The lizardfolk must not be wearing a hands or feet slot item in order to benefit from this ability. This replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed and hold breath racial trait.

**Autotomic Tail**: Your tail can break off and regrow itself, allowing you to escape certain situations more easily. You may take a +20 trait bonus to any CMB check or Escape Artist check to escape a grapple or full-body restraint as a swift action; when you do so, your tail breaks off, and you lose any benefits gained from having a tail until it regenerates. The tail regrows itself in 1d6+8 days (if you have regeneration, such as from a magic ring, spell, or other effect, this time is halved).

**Change Color**: Chameleon-like genes in some lizardfolk’s lineages allow them to blend in nearly flawlessly with their surroundings when they remain perfectly still. As a full-round action, the lizardfolk gains concealment from creatures more than 10 feet away (attacks have a 20% miss chance), and total concealment from creatures more than 40 feet away (attacks have a 50% miss chance), but is considered flat-footed (regardless of any ability that would otherwise prevent it, such as uncanny dodge). The effect ends immediately if she takes any action other than remaining still. This replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed and hold breath racial trait. A lizardfolk oracle who selects this alternate racial trait may not select the albinism curse (detailed below).

**Chromatophore:** Some lizardfolk are born with the ability to alter their skin color, but must remain motionless to blend in to their environment. If the lizardfolk remains still for at least one round, she gains a +4 racial bonus to Stealth skill checks. This racial trait replaces the racial bonus to Acrobatics checks.

**Climber:** Some lizardfolk use powerful claws and tails to ascend cliffs or trees. These lizardfolk gain a climb speed of 15 feet and a prehensile tail. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small stowed objects carried on their persons as a move action. This racial trait replaces their swim speed and hold breath ability.

**Crocodilian:** Some lizardfolk have long mouths and shorter limbs like a crocodile. When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a lizardfolk with this trait can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The lizardfolk inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the lizardfolk maintains its grapple. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s claw attacks and racial bonus to Acrobatics checks.

**Digger:** Some lizardfolk are more adept at burrowing through sand or dirt than swimming. These lizardfolk gain a burrow speed of 15 feet. This racial trait replaces their swim speed.

**Diseased Bite**: Lizardfolk descendants of monitor lizards have gingivitic gums that bleed during feeding, leaving virulent saliva in the bite wounds they inflict. The lizardfolk’s bite attacks inflict the disease detailed below. This replaces the lizardfolk’s natural claw attacks.

**Saurian Filth**

**Type** disease (injury); **Save** Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 lizardfolk’s HD + lizardfolk’s Con mod; **Onset** 6 rounds;

**Frequency** 1/day; **Effect** 1d2 Str and 1d2 Con damage;

**Cure** 2 consecutive saves

**Dragonsired**: A dragonsired lizardfolk boasts the ancestry of wyrms in her family. She gains resistance to one of the following energy types equal to her Hit Dice (maximum 5; this type cannot be changed once chosen): acid, cold, electricity, fire. Once per day, she can also breathe a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone of the energy type chosen as a standard action. This breath weapon deals 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die of the lizardfolk (maximum 5d4, Reflex half, DC 10 + 1/2 the lizardfolk’s HD + the lizardfolk’s Con modifier). If she later gains a breath weapon from another class feature, such as the draconic sorcerer bloodline or the dragon disciple’s breath weapon ability, that breath weapon replaces this one. This trait replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed, hold breath racial trait, and natural armor bonus; dragonsired lizardfolk may still select the hulk or pygmy alternate racial traits, but at an additional cost (see those trait descriptions for more details).

**Giant:** Some lizardfolk grow far greater in size, but are not as quick or agile. These lizardfolk increase to Large size, gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, and a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. They take a -1 size penalty to their AC, a -1 size penalty on attack rolls, a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to their CMD, and a -4 size penalty on Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s racial bonuses to natural armor and Acrobatics, as well as their swim speed and hold breath abilities.

**Glider:** The lizardfolk possesses a thin membrane of skin stretched between its arms, ribs, and legs. The lizardfolk stretches these membranes out and launches itself into the air to travel 10 feet laterally for every 5 feet it falls. A lizardfolk suffering an involuntary fall can make a DC 15 Reflex save to begin gliding. This trait replaces hold breath and the lizardfolk’s swim speed.

**Gout of Blood:** Some lizardfolk can force a jet of hot blood from their eyes out to a range of 15 feet, targeting a single creature once per day as a swift action. The target is frightened for a number of rounds equal to the lizardfolk’s Hit Dice. On a successful Will save (DC 10 + ½ the lizardfolk’s HD + lizardfolk’s Cha modifier) the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The gout is a supernatural, mind-affecting fear effect. It has no effect on other lizardfolk. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s natural claw attacks.

**Healing:** Some lizardfolk can heal at an impressive rate. These lizardfolk regain 1 hit point per minute, and can regrow lost limbs. This otherwise functions as fast healing. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s racial bonus to natural armor.

**Hulk**: The impressive stature of lizardfolk hulks lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. A lizardfolk hulk receives a +1 size modifier to her Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense. A lizardfolk hulk is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s combat maneuvers or special attacks based on size (such as bull rush, drag, overrun, reposition, trip, grab or swallow whole) can affect her. A lizardfolk hulk can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, her space and reach remain those of a Medium creature. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category. This replaces the lizardfolk’s natural armor bonus. A dragonsired lizardfolk who selects this alternate trait also loses her racial bonus to Constitution.

**Parietal Eye:** Lizardfolk with iguana progenitors often can sense subtle changes in heat and light that other creatures can’t. The lizardfolk has blindsense out to a range of 15 feet. This replaces the lizardfolk’s swim speed and hold breath racial trait.

**Poisoned Bite:** Lizardfolk are sometimes born with venomous fangs or poisonous saliva delivered through a bite attack. The save DC for the poison is 10 + ½ the lizardfolk’s HD + lizardfolk’s Con modifier. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s natural claw attacks.

     **Poison (Ex) Bite**—injury; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.

**Purple-Blooded:** Some lizardfolk carry certain waste products through their blood, excreting excess toxins. Lizardfolk with this trait have a +4 bonus on all saving throws against poisons and natural diseases. This replaces the lizardfolk’s natural armor bonus.

**Pygmy**: The diminutive stature of lizardfolk pygmies lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category smaller. A lizardfolk pygmy receives a +1 size modifier to her Armor Class and attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. A lizardfolk pygmy can use weapons designed for a creature one size smaller without penalty. However, her space and reach remain those of a Medium creature. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category. This replaces the lizardfolk’s natural armor bonus. A dragonsired lizardfolk who selects this alternate trait also loses her racial bonus to Strength.

**Small:** Many remote tribes of lizardfolk are much smaller than their common kin. They are Small sized creatures, and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to their CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Small lizardfolk have a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity scores and no bonus to Strength scores.

**Strong-Scaled:** Lizardfolk with this trait have scales that are much stronger than usual for their race, giving them a +3 bonus to their natural Armor Class. This raises it from the existing +2 bonus to a +5 bonus to natural armor. This replaces the lizardfolk’s bite attack and hold breath racial trait.

**Water Running:** The lizardfolk possesses a slight build and broad feet. When running or charging they treat the surface of calm water, mud, or even quicksand as normal solid ground. Choppy or rough water is considered difficult terrain. If the lizardfolk ends their movement in the substance for any reason they sink as normal. This racial trait replaces the lizardfolk’s racial bonus to Acrobatics.

## Racial Subtypes
**RACIAL SUBTYPES**

You can combine various alternate racial traits to create unique tribes or individual lizardfolk, such as the following. 

**Horned Skins:** The Horned Skin lizardfolk are a desertdwelling tribe of nomads known for their impressive neck frills. They sometimes develop the digger and gout of blood racial traits.

**Stalking Ghosts:** The Stalking Ghosts are a reclusive tribe of lizardfolk hunters that camp within forested canopies. A few possess the healer and chromatophore traits, and they often develop either the climber or glider traits.

**Saurians:** The Saurian lizardfolk are a tribe of savage primordial throwbacks. They breed and tame great dinosaurs for mounts, pets, and food. Many grow to enormous size, possessing the giant racial trait.

**Races of Faerun**

**Regions:** Chessenta, Chondalwood, Chult, Lake of Steam, Nelanther Isles, Vilhon Reach, Western Heartlands.

**Racial Feats:** Rapid Swimming, Survivor.

**Racial Hit Dice:** 2d8.

**Level Adjustment:** +2

Living mostly in the marshy areas of Faerûn, lizardfolk are large, scaly humanoids who are savage marauders and scavengers. They have no traditions for cultivating food, so they arrange their meals by either hunting prey or raiding the larders of others.

Lizardfolk grow to between 6 and 7 feet tall, and weigh between 200 and 250 pounds. Their scales range in color from dark green to gray to brown. Their thickly muscled tails run from 3 to 4 feet long. Most nonlizardfolk have a very hard time telling the difference between males and females, but the lizardfolk have no such troubles, of course.

Lizardfolk young are hatched from eggs, which are carefully protected in the tribe’s lair. This is usually hidden deep in a swamp, but about a third of the time it’s an air-filled underwater cave. Hatchlings grow to maturity within about five years. Lizardfolk have been known to live as long as 80 years, although it’s common for the males to die in combat long before they reach such an august age.

In Faerûn, lizardfolk are found anywhere there are temperate or warm marshes and swamps. This includes the Deepwash, the Flooded Forest, the Marsh of Chelimber, the Marsh of Tun, and Rethild, the Great Swamp. A large population of lizardfolk is also found in the Lizard Marsh, despite the relatively cold climate of the Sword Coast.

Lizardfolk have the same life expectancy and age categories as humans.

**History**

Lizardfolk don’t have anything in the way of a written history. They claim that they were among the first of the humanoid races and that all the weaker, more civilized races evolved from lizardfolk who left the swamps millennia ago. The lizardfolk look down on the other races for this reason, seeing them as weaklings who could not endure the rigors of life in the swamp. In fact, there seems no reason to doubt that lizardfolk are an offshoot of one of the Creator Races, the long-vanished saurians, and that theirs is a very ancient culture. They have lived in much the same fashion they do now for time out of mind, since long before any on the interloper races arrived on Toril.

**Outlook**

Lizardfolk mostly assess everything in terms of whether or not it is good to eat. They have no use for money or jewels. They fashion their own crude weapons from rocks, trees, and plants found in their wetland homes. If something might be worth eating, it immediately captures the interest of the lizardfolk. Otherwise, it is not worth bothering with.

Growing up in a lizardfolk tribe is hard. The young are often hungry, as they are only giving the leavings of the meals the males capture once the adults are done with them. They often subsist on edible plants found nearby the tribe’s lair. Lizardfolk are omnivorous, although they have a strong preference for meat, and they find human flesh to be the tastiest of all. Most lizardfolk don’t care much about strategy or tactics.

They are cunning hunters, but in battle they simply rush their foe and try to overwhelm him with their superior strength or by force of sheer numbers. When the lizardfolk are attacked, however, they use their skill as hunters to lay snares, pitfalls, and other traps for those who pursue them. Simple but deadly traps such as these protect many lizardfolk lairs.

Lizardfolk sometimes leave their homes to hunt for larger, more formidable prey. Others wish to learn more about the world beyond the swamps, so that they can report back to the leaders of their tribes. While lizardfolk aren’t evil by nature, they are savage, and they have a difficult time assimilating into Faerûnian society. Most don’t even try. They are there to learn about the softskins and perhaps to teach them a thing or two about how real people—lizardfolk, that is—live.

**LIZARDFOLK CHARACTERS**

Lizardfolk live close to the land, taking all the blessings that nature has to offer them. For this reason, a lizardfolk’s favored class is druid. They also have many barbarians and fighters in their tribes, and the occasional cleric or two.

**Lizardfolk Society**

The lizardfolk have a patriarchal society. The strongest member of the tribe rules over the others by virtue of his power alone. Most are wise enough to recognize this power, so challenges only happen infrequently. When they do, they entirely disrupt the life of the tribe until either a new leader has been established or the old one has reaffirmed his position.

Lizardfolk females concentrate on hatching eggs and raising the hatchlings. It is also their job to maintain the tribe’s camp. Sometimes this is little more than bits of wet plants the lizardfolk use for beds, but some tribes fashion crude huts and make and use shields and weapons. Some have even learned to use the weapons they have stripped from the bodies of earlier prey.

Mothers watch over their hatchlings closely. In this, they have the help of all female members of the tribe. The hatchlings are often hard to handle, prone to wandering out of the camp and into the wider swamp. At any time, there are half as many hatchlings as there are adults. In a typical camp of 150 lizardfolk, about 50 are adult males, 50 are adult females, and 50 are hatchlings.

As lizardfolk age, they slow down. Over the age of 60 or so, they do not care to do much more than lie on a warm rock and bask in the sun. When these creatures die, they are consumed by the rest of the tribe at a ceremonial wake, their flesh becoming part of the tribe both literally and figuratively.

When wandering outside their marshy territories, most lizardfolk work in small groups of two to three. On rare occasions, one can be found traveling alone. Normally, though, lizardfolk feel the need to have at least one other lizardfolk with them to remind them at all times of who they are. Otherwise, they fear that they might be seduced by the civilized ways of the outside world and never return home.

**Language and Literacy**

Lizardfolk speak Draconic. The more intelligent ones sometimes pick up Common, the better to frighten potential prey. More rarely, they learn languages like Dwarven, Elven, Goblin, Orc, or the language of neighboring home regions, depending on where they live.

All lizardfolk are illiterate, except for those who have a player character class other than barbarian.

**Abilities and Racial Features**

Lizardfolk have the following racial traits:

• +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, –2 Intelligence. Strong and hardy warriors, lizardfolk place little value on the accumulation of knowledge.

• Medium-size: As Medium-size creatures, lizardfolk have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

• Lizardfolk land speed is 30 feet.

• Darkvision 60 feet.

• +5 natural armor.

• Proficient with all simple weapons, shields, and barbed darts.

Lizardfolk usually stick to weapons they can fashion out of available materials.

• +4 racial bonus on Balance, Jump, and Swim checks.

• Humanoid Hit Dice: A lizardfolk has 2d8 racial Hit Dice. A lizardfolk character receives the maximum hit points for his first humanoid Hit Die and rolls his other humanoid Hit Dice normally. He rolls all Hit Dice from class levels and does not automatically get maximum hit points on his first class-level Hit Die. A lizardfolk’s racial Hit Dice also provide a +1 base attack bonus and saving throws of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +0. Lizardfolk with class levels add their class attack bonus and save bonuses to their racial attack and save bonuses.

• Humanoid Skills: A lizardfolk’s humanoid Hit Dice grant him skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) ×5. Class skills for these skill points are Balance, Jump, and Swim. A lizardfolk does not get the ×4 multiplier for skill points acquired from his first class level.

• Humanoid Feats: A lizardfolk’s humanoid Hit Dice grant him one feat. A typical lizardfolk chooses Multiattack. A lizardfolk character with class levels gains feats based on his total Hit Dice, as shown on Table 2 in the Introduction.

• Natural Attacks: A lizardfolk can attack with 2 claws and a bite. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage, and the bite is a secondary attack (–5 penalty on the attack roll, and half Strength bonus on the damage roll) that deals 1d4 points of damage. A lizardfolk can attack with a weapon at his normal attack bonus, and make either a bite or a claw attack as a secondary attack.

• Hold Breath: A lizardfolk can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 × Constitution score before he is at risk of drowning.

• Automatic Languages: Draconic, home region. Bonus Languages: Common, by region.

• Favored Class: Druid.

• Level Adjustment: +1. Due to his racial Hit Dice, his natural attacks, and his racial skill bonuses, a lizardfolk has an effective character level of 3 plus his class levels. Thus, a 3rd-level lizardfolk druid would have an ECL of 6. See Table 1 in the Introduction.

**Lizardfolk Deities**

Lizardfolk worship Semuanya. Their clerics don’t have true shrines or sacred places, or hold regular services. Instead, they function as shamans, bringing the blessings of Semuanya to the god’s people whenever they are called upon. The god of the lizardfolk is a source of great pride for these creatures. This deity works hand in hand with nature, which helps to explain the great number of lizardfolk druids about. Those who grow up worshiping Semuanya find it easy to make the leap to worshiping nature itself.

**Relations with Other Races**

The only relation most lizardfolk have with other races is that of hunter to prey. The more civilized lizardfolk realize that the other races may have something to teach them, and they are willing to parley with them—at least as long as their bellies are full. Lizardfolk on empty stomachs are notoriously difficult to reason with.

**Lizardfolk Equipment**

Lizardfolk use a limited number of weapons, preferring to stick to tools of war they can fashion by hand from readily available materials. They do have one weapon unique to their race, however: the barbed dart (see the appendix).

**ANIMALS AND PETS**

Lizardfolk don’t raise animals or keep pets. To them, such creatures are for stealing, slaughtering, and eating. On rare occasions, lizardfolk druids use magic to enchant dinosaurs and ride the mighty beasts into battle.

## Favored Class Options
**FAVORED CLASS OPTIONS**

The following options are available to all lizardfolk who have the listed favored class, and the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

**Barbarian:** Add +1 to the barbarian’s total number of rage rounds per day.

**Druid:** Add +1 hit point to the druid’s animal companion. If the lizardfolk ever replaces her animal companion, the new animal companion gains these bonus hit points.

**Hunter:** Add a +1/2 bonus on Perception checks while in a forest or swamp.

**Ranger:** Add +¼ to damage rolls against one of the ranger’s favored enemies.

**Shaman:** Add ½ to the shaman’s effective class level for the purpose of determining her spirit animal’s natural armor adjustment and special abilities.

**Skald:** Add +1 to the skald’s total number of raging song rounds per day.

**Sorcerer:** Choose a bloodline power from the serpentine bloodline or the verdant bloodline that the sorcerer can use. The sorcerer treats her class level as though it were ½ higher (to a maximum of +4) when determining the effects of that power.

**Witch:** Add one spell from the witch spell list to the witch’s familiar. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level she can cast. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, the new familiar knows these bonus spells.

## Racial Archetypes
**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

The following racial archetypes are available to lizardfolk.

**AMBUSH PREDATOR (ROGUE)**

A lizardfolk’s low metabolism allows some to wait in perfect ambush points for hours or days at a time. She strikes without warning, ending a victim’s life with a rapid violent assault.

**Ambush (Ex):** An ambush predator can prepare a hidden location that allows her to catch prey completely unaware. If the ambush predator does not move for more than 1 minute, she gains a bonus on her Stealth checks equal to ½ her level. The ambush predator also gains this bonus on melee attack rolls made during the surprise round. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Timing (Ex):** At 2nd level, an ambush predator is not limited to a standard action during the surprise round, and may perform a full round of actions. This includes a full attack action, if the target is within range. This ability replaces evasion.

**Patience (Ex):** At 3rd level, an ambush predator learns to wait in a single spot with infinite patience. She gains a +1 bonus on Constitution checks made to hold her breath; Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from starvation or thirst; or Fortitude saves to resist fatigue or exhaustion. These bonuses increase by +1 at 6th level, and every three levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability stacks with any bonuses from the Endurance feat and replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents:** The following rogue talents complement the ambush predator archetype: camouflage, resiliency, slow reactions, stand up, survivalist, and surprise attack.

**Advanced Rogue Talents:** The following advanced rogue talents complement the ambush predator archetype: crippling strike, entanglement of blades, hunter’s surprise, and knock-out blow.

**PESTILENT SAVAGE (BARBARIAN)** 

Certain tribes of lizardfolk in the deep jungles revere plague as a divine gift, and many warriors among these tribes are riddled with disease. They tear through foes in ecstatic fury, spreading sickness and death in the name of dark gods.

**Pestilent Bite (Ex):** At 2nd level, festering bits of flesh in the pestilent savage barbarian’s jaws bear the dark blessing of disease. Anyone bitten by the pestilent savage must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 +½ the barbarian’s class level + his Con modifier) or contract filth fever and gain the sickened condition for 1 minute. If the pestilent savage does not possess a natural bite attack, then the pestilent bite can be inflicted as part of a successful grapple check to damage. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Infected (Ex):** Starting at 3rd level, the pestilent savage barbarian becomes infused with disease and toxins. He gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist disease. At 9th level the pestilent savage becomes immune to disease. At 15th level the pestilent savage gains a +4 bonus to saves against poison. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Fevered Assault (Ex):** At 4th level, the pestilent savage barbarian burns with fever in battle. While raging, his natural attacks gain a +1 bonus to damage. This bonus increases by +1 for every five levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +4 at 19th level). This ability replaces the rage power gained at 4th level.

**Miasma (Su):** At 5th level, the pestilent savage barbarian is surrounded by a haze of greenish vapor while raging. All living creatures without the miasma ability within 10 feet of the pestilent savage suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls and Fortitude saves. Immunity to disease prevents this penalty. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rage Powers:** The following rage powers complement the pestilent savage archetype: come and get meAPG, internal fortitude, mighty swing, no escape, quick reflexes, scent, and superstition.

**PRIMITIVE WEAPON MASTER (FIGHTER)**

A warrior from ancient tribes might eschew modern weapons and materials, instead making war with the tools of his ancestors.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A primitive weapon master is proficient with all simple weapons, and with any two martial, exotic, or racial weapons (even if he does not share a race with the chosen weapon), provided they are not crafted from iron, steel, mithril, or adamantine. Primitive weapon masters are proficient in light armor, medium armor, and small shields crafted from bone, wood, bronze, or gold.

**Weapon Maker:** Beginning at 1st level, a primitive weapon master ignores any disadvantageous qualities of primitive weapons and armor, such as the fragile quality. Weapons made from primitive materials still count as fragile for any beneficial effects. Primitive weapon masters gain a +4 bonus on Craft (armor) and Craft (weapon) rolls to manufacture or repair weapons or armor made from primitive materials. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.

**Sturdy (Ex):** At 2nd level, any primitive weapon the primitive weapon master wields gains the benefits of the masterwork quality. At 6th level, any primitive weapon held gains a +2 bonus to hardness and hit points. This bonus increases by +2 per four levels after 6th. This ability replaces bravery.

**First Fighter:** The primitive weapon master employs ancient fighting techniques lost since refined materials made them obsolete. Despite their simplicity, these maneuvers remain potent tools in the warrior’s arsenal. Whenever a primitive weapon master could choose a fighter bonus feat, he may instead choose one of the following techniques in place of that feat.

*Broken Weapon (Ex):* The primitive weapon master uses the delicate quality of his melee or throwing weapon when it strikes true. Before he confirms a critical strike with a primitive melee or thrown weapon, he may choose to deal 10 points of damage (bypassing the weapon’s hardness) to the weapon to automatically confirm the critical.

*Cracked Blade (Ex):* Cracks and ridges on the weapon’s surface better store liquids applied to it. If the primitive weapon master applies a poison, disease, or other agent to the weapon, it retains the substance for a number of hits equal to its critical multiplier. Any saves against these applied effects are made at a cumulative +1 bonus for every strike after the first.

*Curved Throw (Ex):* When the primitive weapon master misses a target with a thrown primitive weapon, he may make a second attack roll against a second target adjacent to the first, with a -4 penalty. If the second attack hits, it deals normal weapon damage plus any bonuses derived from Strength or magic sources. Bonuses to damage from precision or other class features do not count for the second target.

*Flakes and Slivers (Ex):* Any critical hit confirmed by the primitive weapon master with a primitive melee or thrown weapon deals bleed damage equal to the weapon’s critical multiplier.

*Heavy Strike (Ex):* Primitive weapons are frequently crafted from heavier materials. When charging, a primitive weapon in the fighter’s hands deals damage as if it were one size category larger. In addition, when the primitive weapon master charges he may forgo the +2 bonus to his attack roll and instead apply that bonus to his damage roll. This bonus does not increase for weapons wielded in two hands, but it does multiply on a critical hit.

*Mystic Proxy (Su):* The ancestral spirits of the primitive weapon master’s tribe give him their blessing. Any primitive weapons he wields count as a single additional material type (cold iron, silver, or adamantine) for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability may be taken more than once, each time the primitive weapon master chooses an additional material type.

*Shattered Steel (Ex):* The thick primitive armor the weapon master wears damages weapons used to strike it in combat. Melee and thrown weapons that successfully strike the primitive weapon master (while wearing armor or wielding a shield made from bone, wood, bronze, or gold) take damage equal to the Strength bonus of the weapon’s wielder (if any). This damage bypasses the weapon’s hardness.

*Warrior’s Mark (Ex):* The primitive weapon master uses heavy materials and crude weapons to dismantle the armor of his enemies. On a critical hit, he may choose one piece of armor worn or one shield wielded by the target: that item gains the broken condition.

*Weighted Throw (Ex):* Whenever the primitive weapon master hits with a thrown primitive weapon, he may compare the attack result with his target’s CMD. If the attack roll is equal to or higher, the fighter may choose to push his opponent backwards 5 feet or to knock the opponent prone. This ability only affects creatures the same size or smaller than the primitive weapon master. He gains no bonuses to CMB for feats related to combat maneuvers for this check, but his opponent gains any bonuses to CMD related to bull rush or trip maneuvers. A given opponent may only be pushed backwards or knocked prone once per round.

**SANGUINE SCALE (WITCH)**

Some lizardfolk witches power magic with ancient sacrificial rites. 

**Blood Magic (Su):** A sanguine scale witch records her spells in a pattern of tattoos, veins, and scar tissue over her body. She chooses her spells and learns patron spells based on these patterns without the help of a familiar.

The sanguine scale can empower spells she casts with blood magic. A spell modified with blood magic must be of the divination, enchantment, or necromancy schools. At 1st level, she can deal weapon damage to a helpless or willing creature (including herself) as part of the casting to increase the caster level of the spell by +1. The amount of damage dealt is equal to the level of the spell being cast. At 5th level, the spell also has any save DC increased by +1. At 10th level, any blood magic spell cast by the sanguine scale in the round following a successful coup de grace maneuver gains double the bonus to caster level and save DCs. At 15th level, the sanguine scale can add the benefits of any single metamagic feat she possesses spontaneously to a blood magic spell as it is cast. The sanguine scale takes 10 hit points of damage for each level increase of the metamagic feat. For example, the sanguine scale would take 30 points of damage to spontaneously apply the Maximize Spell feat to a spell because that feat causes the witch to use a spell slot three levels higher than the normal level of the spell. This ability replaces the witch’s familiar.

**Bleeding Conviction (Su):** At 6th level, a sanguine scale can wound herself as a swift action and choose one of her spells or hexes currently in effect. She begins taking bleed damage equal to the level of the chosen spell (hexes count as 2nd level spells, major hexes as 5th level spells, and grand hexes as 9th level spells) that round and at the beginning of her turn each round. The chosen spell or effect remains in effect until the sanguine scale stops the bleed damage or she becomes unconscious. This ability can be used in conjunction with the blood magic ability, with the sanguine scale taking regular hit point damage in addition to the required bleed. At 8th level, the witch can use this ability as part of an action to cast a spell or hex, and double its range in addition to extending its duration. At 16th level, the range is tripled.

**Hexes:** The following hexes complement the sanguine scale archetype: charm, evil eye, misfortune, scar, swamp hag.

**Major Hexes:** The following major hexes complement the sanguine scale archetype: agony, retribution. 

**Grand Hex:** The following grand hexes compliment the sanguine scale archetype: death curse.

**SAURIAN CHAMPION (CAVALIER)**

Some great lizardfolk heroes ride enormous dinosaurs into battle, with ancestral banners and trophies displayed. Skills: At 1st level, a saurian champion cavalier adds Acrobatics to his list of class skills and removes Diplomacy from his list of class skills.

**Saurian Mount (Ex):** A saurian champion chooses a dinosaur and trains it as a mount at 1st level. The mount functions as a druid’s animal companion, using the champion’s level as his effective druid level. The saurian champion uses the following statistics for his young mount, which increases in size at 8th level, and again at 15th level. A Medium-sized champion may choose a Large version of one of the following saurian mounts (with the mount’s modified statistics included below): elasmosaurus, pteranodon, stegosaurus, triceratops, tylosaurus, or tyrannosaurus. A Small‑sized champion may choose a Medium-sized version of any of these companions.

A saurian champion does not take an armor penalty to Ride checks made while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and has Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A saurian champion’s mount never gains the shared spells special ability.

A saurian champion’s bond with his mount is strong, with the champion learning to climb, guide, and move across his mount during combat. Should a saurian champion’s mount die, he can find and train another saurian mount to serve him after one week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the champion gains a level. This ability modifies the normal mount feature for cavaliers, and replaces the cavalier order ability.

**Mounted Acrobat (Ex):** At 1st level, the saurian champion grasps the scales of his mount while boarding, riding, or leaping during combat. He can mount or dismount his animal companion as a free action during his turn with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. A mounted saurian champion with a reach weapon may use the weapon’s reach or his mounts reach for all melee attacks, whichever he prefers.

At 9th level, as part of a single melee attack action, the saurian champion can make a DC 15 Acrobatics check. If successful, the attack originates from any square in his mount’s space. In addition, a champion with a reach weapon counts as flanking any creature his mount attacks in the same round.

At 17th level, any movement an opponent makes within the reach of the saurian champion’s mount provokes an attack of opportunity from the champion. This includes but is not limited to a 5-foot step, the withdraw action, and forced movement from falling or a bull rush. This ability replaces tactician, greater tactician, and master tactician.

**STORY KEEPER (SKALD)**

The lizardfolk maintain oral traditions dating from before mammals discovered fire, and it is the story keepers who protect a tribe’s sacred legends. Story keepers preserve the history of eons with their painstaking memorization of tribal tales.

**Rote Memorization (Ex):** A story keeper skald perfects his memory, gaining power from words and actions repeated innumerable times over countless generations. He casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time, but does not require a spellbook to prepare any spell known (as if he possessed the Spell Mastery feat for all known spells). He gains an additional spell slot of each available spell-level he can cast. His spellcasting otherwise functions as normal, including skald spells known and learning new spells. This ability modifies a skald’s spellcasting ability.

**Share Knowledge (Ex):** At 1st level, a story keeper skald learns to share the knowledge of generations with others. When he successfully assists an ally on a Knowledge check with the aid another action, he adds his bardic knowledge skill check bonus to the normal bonus for assisting (minimum +3). This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.

**Tale Teller (Su):** A story keeper skald gains the following raging song, allowing him to inspire his allies with stories from the past.

**Song of Support (Su):** A story keeper skald can tell tales born in the ancient past to inspire allies with a sense of community. By expending 1 round of raging song, the story keeper allows all allies within 60 feet to double any bonuses gained from the aid another action in combat that round. This replaces the song of marching raging song.

**Spell Kenning (Su):** At 5th level, the story keeper skald can prepare any one spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known. The spell’s casting time is not altered. At 11th level, the story keeper can prepare two spells in this manner. At 17th level, he can prepare three spells in this manner. This ability modifies spell kenning.

**Succor (Ex):** At 7th level, the story keeper skald remembers tales that assist in any situation. He automatically succeeds on any attempted aid another action, in combat or otherwise. Once per day, when the story keeper is aiding an ally in an ability check or skill check, that ally may take a 20 as a standard action, instead of spending the normal time taking 20 requires. He can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level. This ability replaces lore master.

**Rage Powers:** The following advanced rage powers complement the story keeper archetype: clear mind, lesser spirit totem, greater spirit totem, moment of clarity, spirit totem, and superstition.

**TRIBAL DEFENDER (FIGHTER)**

Tribal defenders are the appointed guardians of lizardfolk settlements. Tasked with protecting the tribe’s younglings and elders, these soldiers hone combat techniques designed to shield weaker allies.

**Associated Class**: fighter

**Associated Race**: lizardfolk

**Replaced Abilities**: bravery, armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Body Shield**: At 2nd level, when fighting defensively or using total defense, a tribal defender can, as an immediate action, grant an adjacent allied creature a natural armor bonus to AC equal to his own until the beginning of his next turn. The tribal defender can use this ability only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor.

**Covering Guard**: At 3rd level, when the tribal defender is fighting defensively or using total defense, allied creatures that are adjacent to him gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), this bonus increases by +1 each time, to a maximum of +4.

**Get Behind Me**: At 6th level, when an adjacent ally makes a Reflex saving throw, the tribal defender may, as an immediate action, roll the same saving throw as if he were the one subject to the effect requiring it. He must declare that he is using this ability before his ally has rolled the save. If this save is successful, the ally takes no damage or ill effects from the effect that triggered the save; however, the tribal defender suffers half of any damage that would normally be dealt by the effect. Failure indicates that the original target of the effect takes damage as normal, and the tribal defender still takes half damage.

**Savior’s Dash**: At 10th level, when an ally within range of his base land speed is targeted by a melee attack, a tribal defender may immediately move up to his speed, but he must end his movement adjacent to the attacked ally. Using this ability also uses up the tribal defender’s move action for the coming turn.

**Savior’s Block**: At 14th level, when a tribal defender uses savior’s dash, he can also make an attack roll to parry the melee attack that triggered his movement. If his result is greater than the attacking creature’s result, the creature’s attack against the adjacent ally automatically misses.

**Unrivaled Protector**: At 18th level, a tribal defender is merely staggered rather than disabled or unconscious when at 0 hp or dying. While he is fighting defensively or using total defense, allies adjacent to him gain DR 5/— and are not subject to critical hits.
