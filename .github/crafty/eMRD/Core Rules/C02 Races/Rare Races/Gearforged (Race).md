# Gearforged (Race)
## Overview
The infusion of sentient minds, of souls, into mechanical bodies has long been a dream of the sick and ailing, of madmen and saints. Whether for weal or woe, for effectiveness or altruism, the fascination of this alternative to dread unlife has haunted mind upon mind. Visionaries have achieved this impressive feat of arcano-magical engineering—unfettering of the soul from the fragile bounds of flesh—and ushered in a new age. The beings subjected to this process are now known as the gearforged.

**Gearforged Life**

The gearforged are not only an artificial race but one whose members are created one at a time, coming from a vast array of backgrounds. Nevertheless, they maintain rich traditions of history, culture, and spirituality all their own, partly due to the influence of the race’s patron, the gear goddess Rava.

**Physical Description:** Gearforged most often look like metallic, clockwork versions of other Medium sized races.

**Society:** Gearforged (with a few exceptions) have no society of their own; they most often live and take part in the culture and society of others.

**Relations:** Being exceptionally rare, gearforged most often form relationships based on individual interactions.

**Alignment and Religion:** In the Midgard campaign setting, most gearforged worship Rava. In other settings, gearforged follow individual deities based on their alignment and class.

**Adventurers:** Gearforged adventurers are rare, but when encountered may be of any class.

**Male Names:** Gearforged names are often taken from parts of mechanical devices or toools (such as brake, cog, hammer, etc.)

**Female Names:** Gearforged names are often taken from parts of mechanical devices (such as awl, ratchet, wheel, etc.)

## Gearforged Racial Traits
**Gearforged Racial Traits**

All gearforged have the following racial traits.

**+2 to One Ability Score**: Gearforged come in many variants. Their makers pride themselves on fitting the body to the needs of the soul.

**Gearforged Constructs**: Gearforged are constructs with the gearforged subtype. As such, gearforged possess no Constitution scores and are immune to disease, poison, magical sleep effects, enchantment effects, paralysis, and effects that require a Fortitude save (unless those effects can also affect objects). They cannot become [[Fatigued|fatigued]] or [[Exhausted|exhausted]]. Gearforged do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. As living creatures, though, they do not have any other immunities common to constructs.

**Medium**: Gearforged are medium creatures and have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed**: Gearforged have a base speed of 30 ft. Their speed is not modified by wearing medium armor.

**Darkvision**: Gearforged can see in the dark up to 60 ft.

**Low-light Vision**: Gearforged can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

**Armor**: Gearforged gain a +1 natural armor bonus.

**Skills**: Gearforged have lost a part of their humanity to cold, precise, clicking steel. This change also affects their minds and makes them more detached and sometimes awkward in social situations. They take a –2 penalty on all [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks. However, their new state makes them frightening to some and grants precise insight into clockworks. Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks.

**Immortal**: As partially artificial creatures, gearforged suffer none of the drawbacks and gain none of the benefits of aging. They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that age a character: The whirling gears and preservative fluids keep what little may remain of the meek flesh just as strong as the clockworks powering their bodies.

**Rust Vulnerability**: A gearforged suffers damage from a rusting attack since it corrodes the gearforged body. Use the damage value given for the spell or effect if one is provided. If no damage value is given, the gearforged makes a Fortitude save using the DC and save type indicated for the effect, if any. If no save is allowed or if the save fails, the gearforged takes 1d6 points of damage for each of its Hit Dice with half damage on a successful save.

**Machine Healing**: Gearforged cannot heal damage on their own. Cure spells, wands, and potions heal gearforged for the minimum amount per charge or dose. The *[[Mending (Spell)|mending]]* spell heals a gearforged for 1 point of damage, while the *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]* spell heals 2d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +10). Spells which repair constructs (cf. *[[Repair Light Damage (Spell)|repair light damage]], [[Repair Moderate Damage (Spell)|repair moderate damage]],* etc.) heal gearforged (and clockwork) as outlined in the spell.

**Routine Maintenance**: Rather than sleep, gearforged must rewind their springs, repair gears, and oil and clean their parts each day for a 4-hour period to ensure normal functioning. They are fully aware during this period, but any interruption in their routine during these 4 hours requires them to start again from the beginning. Gearforged can function a number of days equal to their character level without performing this maintenance, but each day without such a repair period applies a cumulative –2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If a gearforged neglects his repair period a number of days equal to his character level, he becomes immobile and [[Helpless|helpless]] until repaired by someone else. One 4-hour repair period eliminates all accumulated penalties.

**Clockwork Savvy**: Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks. Gearforged intimately understand how their own race works and can apply that knowledge elsewhere, while most living creatures find gearforged a little unsettling.

**Languages**: Gearforged begin play speaking the Trade Tongue (Common). Gearforged with high Intelligence scores can choose to speak Draconic, Dwarven, or Elven.

### Description
The gearforged are the children of Rava, the Gear Goddess of Fate and Industry. Her priests were the first to forge bodies of brass and copper with cunningly wrought gears and well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh; a special ritual (see page 16) is required to transfer a living creature’s soul into the housing that makes it gearforged. Once created, a gearforged can in theory live forever, though in practice most wind down or are destroyed by the ravages of time and the difficulty of surviving as a well-crafted machine.

### Scaling the Gearforged and the Gearforged Subtype
Scaling the gearforged turned out to be a rather tricky business due to their significant array of immunities and drawbacks. As presented above, the gearforged already are on par with the stronger of the core-races without any need for further modification. If you wish to have an easy, simple take on gearforged, just treat the gearforged subtype as a regular humanoid with all options for healing and susceptibilities—the soul inhabiting the body, bellows and filters as lungs, and such duplicate the functions of flesh. However, this means that, while the race looks like a construct, it doesn’t necessarily play like one.

If you elect for a slightly more construct-like take on the race approximately on par with the planar races, you may use the gearborn racial traits below as something granted by the gearforged subtype. For ease of reference, unless otherwise noted, the term “gearforged” refers to any humanoid with the gearforged subtype.

#### Gearborn and the Gearforged Subtype
One recently created gearforged, once known as the brilliant, kind merchant [[Heet Nul]], has perfected a process that leaves some organic elements of the original creature intact. These beings are called gearborn in honor of their rebirth, their second chance. The innovations of Nul have made a gradual transformation possible.

Gearborn receive the following racial traits through their gearforged subtype.

**Clockwork-Powered Mind and Body**: Gearborn gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue.

**Gearborn Immunities**: Gearborn do not breathe, eat, or sleep unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a gearborn can drink potions to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities are required for the gearborn to survive or stay in good health. Gearborn are immune to magic sleep spells and effects.

**Racial Heritage**: Unlike full gearforged, gearborn still have some components of their original bodies. They count as both the race they belonged to prior to their transformation and as gearforged for purposes of any effect related to race.

**Second Chance**: Gearborn cannot be *raised* or *resurrected*, though a *wish* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* can restore them fully.

**Stable**: Gearborn are not at risk of death from massive damage, and they automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hp.

#### "Classic" Gearforged and the Gearforged Subtype
The astute reader will note that the gearborn are less mechanical, less alien than the default “classic” gearforged. If you prefer to play a character that receives more construct immunities but also pays a steep price for them, you might wish to select the following ability suite. 

Gearforged receive the following racial traits through their gearforged subtype:

*Clockwork-Powered Mind and Body:* Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind‑affecting effects and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue.

*Gearforged Immunities:* Gearforged are immune to disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, and poison. Gearforged take no penalty from energy draining effects, though they still can be killed if they accrue more negative levels than they have Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels they’ve gained are removed without any additional saving throws.

Gearforged are also immune to necromancy effects that rely on transference or modification of life force (such as the *[[Vampiric Touch (Spell)|vampiric touch]]* or *[[Ghoul Touch (Spell)|ghoul touch]]* spells), subject to GM approval.

Gearforged do not breathe, eat, or sleep, unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a gearforged can drink potions to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities are required for the gearforged to survive or stay in good health.

*Gearforged Drawbacks:* Gearforged have a number of drawbacks.

*Water Susceptibility:* A gearforged drenched in water can continue to function normally for a number of hours equal to their Strength score. After spending that much time while soaking wet or in the water, the gearforged will grind to a halt and require a 4-hour repair period. Heavy cloaks and similar clothes can be used to prevent becoming drenched by rain, subject to GM approval. Gearforged suffer a −2 penalty to [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks.

*Repairs Required:* Gearforged cannot heal damage on their own and the application of the Heal skill has no effect on them. Cure spells, wands, and potions heal gearforged for the minimum amount per charge or dose, and the psionic repair damage power works normally. The *[[Mending (Spell)|mending]]* spell heals a gearforged for 1 point of damage while *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]* heals 2d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +10). Gearforged may be repaired using [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) or by another gearforged possessing the Self‑Mechanic feat. Spells which repair constructs (cf. *[[Repair Light Damage (Spell)|repair light damage]], [[Repair Moderate Damage (Spell)|repair moderate damage]],* etc.) heal gearforged (and clockwork) as outlined in the spell.

*Rewind the Gears:* Rather than sleep, gearforged must rewind their springs, repair gears, and oil and clean their parts each day for a 4-hour period to ensure normal functioning. They are fully aware during this period, but any interruption in their routine during these 4 hours requires them to start again from the beginning. Gearforged can function a number of days equal to their character level without performing this maintenance, but each day without such a repair period applies a cumulative −2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If a gearforged neglects his maintenance period a number of days equal to his character level, he becomes immobile and helpless until maintained by another gearforged or an individual with the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) skill. One 4-hour maintenance period eliminates all accumulated penalties.

*Stable:* Gearforged are not at risk of death from massive damage, and they automatically stabilize when taken below 0 hp.

*Destruction Is Not The End:* A gearforged body is destroyed at their negative Con score, though they can have their soul gem and memory tapes implanted in a newly-constructed body as long as they are intact. They cannot be raised or resurrected through normal magical means, though a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* can restore them as usual.

**MORE AND VARIABLE POWER**

A relatively easy way to further increase the power of the gearforged for truly high-powered campaigns would be to simply take the drawbacks of the race away. The race receives a significant increase in power in the average group once it can be healed by positive energy, like everyone else. Additionally, you may want to start as a gearborn and slowly turn more and more into a gearforged. Hence, as an alternative means of increasing power for gearborn, you could provide a number of gear points and have the player choose free alternate racial traits and racial feats up to the target value. Gear points are an abstract way to judge how much of a character has been transformed into a gearforged.

### Making a Gearforged
The most important moment for many gearforged is the moment of their remaking when they leave their flesh body behind and enter their new, clockwork body of brass and steel. One can spend a fortune on these new bodies or simply scrape together something that will work—though only barely—if they are aging or deathly ill. The details don’t matter a great deal, since the iron body can be rebuilt.

Without exception, the gearforged are shaped like humanoids, and the vast majority appears in one of two styles: roughly human-sized, with articulated joints, hands, feet, and magical eyes; or a stouter version made by the dwarves. These dwarflike gearforged are more common in the cantons of the Ironcrags than in the Free City of Zobeck but are accepted as receptacles for dwarf souls. In the South, minotaur gearforged are rare but not entirely unknown. A few gearforged are built in even smaller sizes, intended for kobold souls, but these are subject to frequent failure and even the extinction of the souls they carry.

All gearforged were once other creatures, now inhabiting standardized bodies with cylinders, springs, and articulated joints of varying quality. Each is made of iron, brass, and steel and is as distinctive in appearance as other people differ by their hair and eyes. The gearforged are thinking creatures and can serve as city watchmen and soldiers. Gearforged have free will that separates them from other mechanical devices, which are no more than simple servants responsive to orders and capable of little more than a limited amount of memorization.

Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because all gearforged are machines with a soul. Their arms and legs depend on actuators powered by everwound springs. Their minds depend on memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements are all held in a shell of iron, brass, and steel, and the bulk of the things is remarkable. A large and heavily armored gearforged can weigh 400 pounds, since its armor is built in.

### Gearforged Components
The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts.

**Everwound Springs**

These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged’s limbs and fingers. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb.

**Soul Gems**

The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, and its mind—are retained in one or (for an extra 8,000 gp) two soul gems. These are the elements that retain an individual’s spirit or soul, and their destruction means the death of that gearforged.

**Memory Gears**

These delicate constructions are scroll-like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin-sized holes, wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity. The memory of a gearforged for all the days after its creation lives in the memory gears. Older gearforged have many such gears, and the material component for the magic to create them requires one new memory gear/two levels attained or every 10 years of life. Installing one requires one day’s work and 2,000 gp. Memory gears can be taken from a dead gearforged and read by others. This is a lengthy process and viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is peering into the most private details of a creature’s life. Installing an existing, used memory gear in a new gearforged requires a new [[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|ritual of soulforging]] and at least one week for the recipient to remember and understand the process. The process is dangerous, requiring a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half level of dead gearforged + Cha modifier of dead gearforged) to succeed. If the Fortitude save fails, the gearforged is ill for two weeks as it resorts its own memories, and the found memory gear is rendered useless.

### Gearforged Height and Weight
Gearforged require a certain size in which to fit in all those whirling gears and tapes used in their operation. Hence, all gearforged are at least Medium size (until an enterprising clockworker manages to solve that problem, of course). Since the *[[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|ritual of soulforging]]* seems to work better when the new body is close in size to the original body, gearforged tend to have the same or similar heights as their parent race—fangforged are as tall as [[Dragonkin (midgardpf)|dragonkin]], geardwarves as stocky as regular dwarves. However, small folk and those not content with their size have opted for the base height of humans as well, which oddly seems to impose next to no problems for kobolds, halflings, and similar small folk.

### Gearforged Age
As partially artificial creatures, gearforged suffer none of the drawbacks and gain none of the benefits of aging. They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that might age a character. The whirling gears and preservative fluids keep what little may remain of the meek flesh just as strong as the clockworks powering their bodies.

### Gearforged History (Midgard)
The history of the gearforged is a history of desperation. During the Great Revolt of the City of Zobeck against the rulership of House Stross, the citizens seized the watch barracks with the help of many of the watch captains, and the mages of the Collegium enchanted soldiers of the citadel. It was enough to give the rebels hope. But they could not turn to their side the private army of Stross. These were hard and cruel soldiers, renowned for their brutality and certain of victory. The heavy knights of the Order of the Undying Sun, a company of crossbow dwarves from Melano, cruel shadow fey mercenaries, and a swath of peasant levies came to Zobeck—all under the command of the wizard Lord Kranos Stross.

Against this were arrayed the wands of the Collegium and the many citizens of Zobeck—but no cavalry, no trained pikes, no heavy infantry to speak of. They had the help of dwarves from the Gear District and others from the Ironcrag Cantons, but they needed tough troops. Their solution was a mad wizard’s apprentice, Black Marcenzo. With the assistance of dwarf master smiths, mages from the city’s college of magic, and priestesses of Rava, this renegade apprentice devised a ritual to animate bodies of iron with mortal souls. The spirits required came from the people of the city: elderly volunteers, angry and idealistic young, criminals seeking a reprieve, and a few seeking a new life in a whole and healthy body. Their bodies died, but their souls lived on—and, more importantly, fought on—seeking to change the course of the revolt.

Overnight, more than 100 of the bravest hearts of the citizens of Free Zobeck became ticking hearts with everwound springs and minds of brass and magic. The nobles of House Stross were caught completely off guard. These shining heavy infantry were an unshakeable core for the people’s army. The iron bodies could withstand the shock of knights in full battle dress, their new-made pikes held true, and the overwhelming numbers of the free people of Zobeck pulled down many a landed knight from the saddle into the mud, never to rise again. The Battle of Oros Bridge was won, the Stross were hung from the walls of their ancestral castle at Rosehaven, and the city declared its charter as one of a free people, governed by their own council and a mayor. The gearforged were the fist that struck off the shackles of a decadent house.

At their making, the gearforged were thought to be a special cadre, a one-time creation never to be repeated, but this was not so. Within 20 years, others came forward to undergo the [[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|Ritual of Soulforging]]. Many of the living faithful of Rava came to see the transformation into a gearforged as a form of bodily pilgrimage, a way to grow closer to the Gear Goddess herself. Some individuals sought out soulforging as means to stave off death, and others did so for mysterious reasons all their own. The cost is high for all: gearforged love is purely a thing of the mind and their senses are much simplified, pure sight and sound shorn of all elements of taste, smell, or touch.

### Gearforged Society (Midgard)
While gearforged do not reproduce in any normal way, their numbers grow, and their longevity means that they have become, slowly, a larger proportion of the citizenry than anyone might have expected. The gearforged for many years argued over their status and their acknowledgment as citizens. The veterans of the Revolt were naturally acknowledged as citizens at once. Some clockworkers have claimed that the gearforged are servants, more akin to familiars than people. The most strident claim that an animated body is always property and not a person at all. The topic is a delicate one among the gearforged, for their sense of ownership of their bodies is fraught with the difficulties of repair and the alien sense that what they are is neither flesh nor golem. 

Gearforged gather among themselves frequently to discuss the old days (a fact that annoys the younger gearforged and pleases ancient loremasters). This is a practice they call “redundancy and distribution,” meaning simply the sharing of knowledge, rather than opinions. Many such gatherings supplement these recitations of history with more contemporary knowledge acquired through three methods: adventure, experiment, and study. All three of these branches of knowledge are held to be noble endeavors by the gearforged. Gearforged also value discussion of martial prowess as all gearforged know at least a little of the fighting arts. Though they may be scholars or experimentalists among their own kind, they were first made for war, and combat is counted an honorable profession among the gearforged.

*Gearforged Memory:* Once human, now mechanical and undying, the gearforged tend to be radicals in their youth and more conservative with age: it takes a radical to shed his or her body for a mechanical one, and they grow reactionary and unable to adapt to a world shifting around them. Some priests believe that the inevitable death of their mortal friends and loved ones drives them into a certain stiff-necked conservatism. At the same time, the gearforged are keenly aware of history and its dangers. They guard against the creeping return of aristocracy and against the decay and corruption of diabolic cults. They remember how things were. And they do not forgive easily what they remember of the slaughter in the streets. A few more join the gearforged every year. Many are wealthy merchants at the end of life, others are soldiers seeking a new edge, and a few are criminals compelled to serve the city as the price of their crimes.

### Gearforged Religion (Midgard)
Nearly all gearforged worship Rava, the Gear Goddess. She is their creator: the goddess who gave the secret of soulforging to the crazed zealots of the Revolt. The praise of Rava and the faith of her gearforged have been unshakeable ever since. They are among the chief servants of the Clockwork Oracle, a magnificent contraption whose gears, wheels, and actuators form a face that is said to be inhabited by the goddess herself on high holy days (see Zobeck Gazetteer, page 17).

*The Saints:* The most fanatical of Rava’s gearforged followers—and some are truly mad with devotion—are called the Gear Saints. They are generally implanted with a third hand and a third eye and are said to be Rava’s Hands and Rava’s Eyes in the world. Indeed, sometimes the goddess does seem to see through these eyes and react. In some sense, the Saints are her distant and distributed minds and hands.

*The Machine Speech:* Some gearforged speak a whistling, clicking language among themselves that is incomprehensible to non-gearforged and certainly unpronounceable even under the effect of *tongues* or similar magic. These speakers call this the Machine Speech and use it to exclude flesh-and-blood from their company. They claim that the Clockwork Oracle speaks in this form as well and that their speech is faster and purer than any language of mortal races.

*The Cult of Zurvan:* There are those that maintain that the worship of Rava has become too fixated on the novel charm of clockwork, neglecting the roles of law, fate, and destiny in the goddess’s portfolio. Some have abandoned the faith entirely, directing their worship instead toward Zurvan the Iron Angel, First of the Inevitables. The cult of Zurvan quietly plots to overthrow the church of Rava and convert the Gear Goddess’s worshippers to the cause of their true mechanical god of destiny. Zurvan’s largely human worshippers view gearforged with awe and envy. While virtually all gearforged have far too much reverence for Rava to join such a cause, some cultists have used deceit and bribery to undergo the [[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|ritual of soulforging]]. There are rumors that the group has developed an alternate ritual (not requiring the complicity of a priestess of Rava) that will expel the soul from a gearforged body and allow a new occupant to take over the empty shell. This is rank blasphemy and an outrage to followers of Rava.

*Other Gods:* Rava is not the only goddess of the gearforged—far from it. Many of the dwarf gearforged also honor the gods of their former lives: Wotan the Rune-Giver and Volund the Smith. Many of the once-human gearforged are inclined toward Perun the Thunderer in his aspects of war and bravery, Anu-Akma in his guardian aspect, and Arachne and Techne, the southern goddesses of fate and smithwork who are sometimes said to be masks of Rava. Some human faiths do not look kindly on gearforged, and a few of the most life-affirming even consider soulforging to be an abomination similar to the creation of undead. The followers of gentle Lada, for instance, consider the creation of the gearforged a regrettable and grievous error. The rare gearforged that continue to adhere to these faiths live complicated existences indeed.

As the patron of Zobeck, Rava is a goddess whose beneficence has given the city autoscribes, clockwork scullions, the gearforged, and other inventions. Merchants believe she blesses their hard work, and her mark is on contracts and bills of lading as a surety of delivery or payment. She is also a sponsor of magic, knowledge, and industry.

Rava’s physical form resembles a six-armed woman, and she is frequently shown weaving or spinning. She is shown as a maiden, as the mother of industry, and as a wise crone in different shrines and at different seasons.

**WORSHIPERS**

The industrious, the learned, and the gearforged are Rava’s closest followers, and dwarves, humans, and kobolds all have shrines to her. Most of her followers are hard-working and willing to try new things. Novelty and invention are a part of her tradition as much as tradition and crafting. Alchemists, wizards, scribes, guild masters, weavers, and merchants all turn to Rava for wise counsel.

**SYMBOLS AND BOOKS**

Rava’s priestesses have written dozens of volumes of prophecy at the Clockwork Oracle in Zobeck and have a dozen more of the sacred works of Ariadne on the southern islands. These books are kept closely guarded. Most of their predictions do come true in time. The priesthood sells this knowledge their wealthiest followers and gives it away to the most fervent and boldest followers, the paladins and inquisitors of the faith. These are most often gearforged heroes. Rava’s symbols are the gear and the spider. Many of her priestesses carry a spindle for thread and spin as often as possible, the better to feed the looms of Rava’s weaving spiders.

**SHRINES AND PRIESTS**

The current human high priestess of Rava is Lena Ravovik (LN female human cleric 9 \[Rava]). Her surname is traditional one for priests and priestesses of Rava, who abandon their families and former lives when they enter the service of the goddess. The current dwarf high priest in Zobeck is Ondli Firedrake, and the high priestess on the island of Archae is Alkestis. The most famous of Rava priestesses are the goddess-forged. These powerful clerics have been blessed to become immortal, magical machines. Their bodies become completely covered in metal, and they gain the construct type and other abilities as a gearforged.

**OTHER FAITHS**

Rava is not fond of Bastet’s sybaritic luxuries and even less fond of Addrikah, the derro mother of madness and chaos, whose works are abominations. Rava is considered cool or hostile to the followers of Yarila and Porevit, and she has a long-standing-but-genial feud with Volund over whose artifice and creation skills are greatest.

**MASKS**

Rava is called Ariadne in some southern realms, and she is a great patron of weavers, jewelers, and scribes. In the North, she is associated with the Norns. A few believe she is a female mask of Thoth-Hermes.

**WHAT RAVA DEMANDS**

Rava demands her followers be wise and hard-working. Learning and scholarship are prized among her followers as is the discovery and the making of new things. As a goddess of both novelty and fate, she demands her followers seek out new learning and steer the world’s fate to peace and plenty. In Zobeck, Rava’s followers must defend her patron city against any threat that the Clockwork Oracle identifies. Rava despises sloth and luxury.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**Alternate Racial Traits**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of the standard gearforged racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

Gearforged come in many shapes and sizes and are customized for a variety of tasks. Players may choose from the following list of traits when selecting traits for their gearforged characters. While these traits are intended for gearforged, other races may take them, subject to GM approval. Creatures without the gearforged subtype receive 1 gear point per trait taken.

**Adamant (Combat):** Your crafters made your body more resilient than normal. You receive a +1 trait bonus to natural armor. If you did not have a natural armor bonus before, you instead receive a +1 natural armor bonus.

**Cannonball (Combat):** You excel at using your heavy metal body as a formidable battering ram. You gain a +2 trait bonus to CMB when attempting to bull rush an opponent and an additional +1 trait bonus to attack rolls made while charging.

**Deception (Social):** Your earnest, mechanical manner puts those around you at ease regarding the guileless sincerity of your intentions. You no longer take a −2 penalty to [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks. You gain a +2 trait bonus to [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks.

**Discharge (Magic):** Your body was designed to generate slightly more energy than your regular operations require. Choose one damage type from the following upon taking this trait: electricity, fire, or sonic. You may release this energy once per day in the manner of the *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]* spell for 1d4 points of the chosen energy type. If you have chosen to deal sonic damage, you instead deal 1d3 points of damage. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). You may unleash this energy once per day and an additional time for every 5 character levels.

**Emergency Surge (Combat):** Mechanisms hidden deep within your structure kick into action at critical moments to provide you a final burst of activity. You may make a single standard action the round after being reduced to fewer than 0 hp. This does not allow you to act if you have died due to the attack.

**Hidden Compartment (Equipment):** Your body has a secret compartment and you can discretely access it. You can hide an object no bigger than a dagger or wand and gain a +4 circumstance bonus on your [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks when you draw it from the compartment.

**Mind Breaker (Magic):** Once per day, as a touch attack, you may mentally commune with a living creature, opening your mind up to them. Unfortunately for your target, most organic beings are ill-prepared to grapple with the mechanical mind of a gearforged. The subject of your touch is affected by the *[[Confusion (Spell)|confusion]]* spell with a caster level equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). This is a spell-like ability. 

**Oriented (Race):** Your elegant mechanical mind was optimized for mapping physical spaces, effortlessly compiling information from the environment around you into a cohesive, navigable picture. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks.

**Phantom Limb (Equipment):** While clockworkers and engineers have long dreamt of many-limbed gearforged, few have made any substantive headway. Your creation was an experiment of questionable success. Twice per day, you may perform an extra item manipulation action without provoking an attack of opportunity. You may activate your third arm an additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. The rest of the time your third arm lies inert and you take a −2 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks unless it is concealed.

**Rock Crusher (Equipment):** Your mechanical digits were designed for the harshest tasks. When attempting to smash an object outside of combat, you may activate your hydraulic vise by concentrating on powering it up for 1 minute. If you move or engage in any other activity during this period, the charge is lost, rendering it impossible to use this trait in combat. After this duration has elapsed, you may execute a single sunder attack against an object with a +2 trait bonus. This attack has a base damage of 2d8.

**Split Personality (Social):** Your living soul was not perfectly integrated with your new mechanical form. As a result, your personality occasionally drifts to places ranging from the coldly mechanical to the borders of madness. You gain a +2 trait bonus to Will saves but also increase the penalty to [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] by a further +2. If you also have the deception trait, you only take the increased penalty to [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]].

**Unnatural Attack (Race):** Some schools of thought find the practice of designing martial weapons into gearforged forms to be distasteful. This does not prevent them from providing gearforged with more integrated and subtle forms of defense. You possess a horn, retractable barb, or similar secondary natural attack dealing 1d4 points of either piercing or slashing damage. Once chosen, this damage-type cannot be changed.

## Racial Subtypes
**Racial Subtypes**

Though the minority of gearforged that do not conform to a human base standard are a diverse lot, clockwork engineers have cataloged a number of subtypes. 

*Fangforged:* Gearforged in the mold of Midgard’s upstart dragonkin are exceedingly rare but not unheard of. That the sultans of the draconic Mharoti Empire are committed to tradition is not to say that they lack foresight. Having lured a number of talented Zobeck clockworkers to their lands, the sultans have immortalized some of their greatest warriors, placing gleaming and fearsome fangforged at the command of several units of the edjet warrior caste. Fangforged usually have the adamant and discharge racial traits. 

*Gear Hacks:* Not all gearforged walking the streets are the product of top-tier clockwork magic. Some underwent the ritual of soulforging at the hands of less-than-expert spellcasters. Others are living in ill-advised experimental bodies. While the gearforged underclass known as gear hacks are typically regarded somewhat pitifully, the messy circumstances of their creation occasionally give them an edge over their more robust brethren. No two gear hacks are the same, but a typical specimen might have the phantom limb and split personality racial traits.

*Geardwarves:* While it was Rava that passed down the secret of soulforging to the people of Zobeck, the first gearforged in the Crossroads were created in Templeforge by the dwarfs in the Ironcrags. While dwarven soulforging seems archaic and inscrutable to many Zobeck clockworkers, the dwarves maintain theirs is soulforging as it was originally passed down by the god Volund. Geardwarves are thundering, steam‑belching spartans, spearheading the most dangerous tasks in the deep dwarven mines. Geardwarves typically have the cannonball and rock crusher racial traits.

*Infernal Machines:* Whether by accident or by design, some soulforgings are not magically sterile processes. On rare occasions, something diabolical rises from the lower planes to insinuate itself into a new living construct. Some tainted gearforged struggle mightily with their darker natures whereas others become sinister mechanical versions of their former mortal selves. While not exclusively evil, infernal machines are a uniformly troubled lot and often get along far better with tieflings than their fellow gearforged. Infernal Machines tend to have the mind breaker and either deception or split personality racial traits.

*Tauric Engines:* Rumors of a ferocious gearforged minotaur dominating the Barsella gladiatorial arena were long dismissed in Zobeck as exotic nonsense until curiosity got the better of a small group of clockworkers, and they traveled across the Wastes to see this wonder for themselves. Though not fully accepted by their flesh and blood brethren, many tauric engines have found great success as gladiators and mercenaries. Tauric engines often have the oriented and unnatural attack racial traits.

## Favored Class Options
**Favored Class Options**

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, gearforged have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon the character’s favored class. 

The following options are available to all gearforged who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

**Alchemist (Tinker Alchemist):** Add +1 ft. to the range of your breath weapon granted by the internal furnace ability. This has no effect unless taken 5 times, at which point it increases the range by +5 ft.

**Barbarian (Quiet Explorer):** Add +1/5 round to your daily assortment of gearforged rage.

**Bard:** Add +1/2 to any clockwork-related skill check.

**Battle Scion:** Add +1/2 to the damage dealt by the battle scion’s force blast ability.

**Cavalier:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the mount granted by the cavalier’s class ability.

**Druid:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the animal companion granted by the druid’s class ability.

**Fighter (Clockwork Fighter):** Add +1/3 damage to melee attacks with the forgeclaws class ability.

**Inquisitor (Lawmaster):** Add +1 to the bonuses granted by the assessment class ability.

**Magus:** Add +1/4 to the magus’s arcane pool. 

**Monk:** Add +1/4 natural armor bonus.

**Oracle (Clockwork mystery):** Select one spell with the word “cure” or “inflict” in the title. This spell also affects regular creatures, not just constructs.

**Paladin (Faithforged):** Add +2 hp to the faithforged’s lay on hands ability when healing creatures of the gearforged subtype or of the construct type.

**Ranger:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the animal companion granted by the ranger’s class ability.

**Rogue:** Add +1/2 to any clockwork-related skill check.

**Sorcerer (Mechanical Bloodline):** Add +1/2 daily use of the launch gears spell-like ability.

**Summoner (Salvager):** Add +1 ft. to the movement rate of your eidolon granted by the sphere class ability. This has no effect unless taken 5 times, at which point it increases movement rate by +5 ft.

**Witch:** Add +1 natural armor bonus to the AC of the witch’s familiar.

**Wizard (Clockwork Crafter):** Add +1 bonus to concentration checks made due to taking damage while casting spells defensively.

**Clockwork Traits**

While the following traits are specific to the Midgard city of Zobeck, GMs and players are encouraged to adapt them to their own campaign world as appropriate. While retaining the general topic of clockworking, none of these traits grant gear points.

**Clockworker Apprentice (Regional: Zobeck):** You tried life as an apprentice in the Clockworker’s Guild. While the guild didn’t suit you, you learned the craft. You gain a +1 trait bonus to Disable Device checks involving clockwork and to Craft (clockwork) checks. Disable Device and Craft (clockwork) are always class skills for you. This bonus stacks with Clockwork Scholar.

**Clockwork Scholar (Religion: Rava):** You are a hard-working follower of the Gear Goddess. You gain a +2 trait bonus to [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks with gearforged and constructs. You gain a +1 trait bonus to [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (scribe) and to any one Craft skill (chosen when the trait is taken).

**Mark of Rava (Religion: Rava):** You can feel the warp and weft of the world’s fabric and understand both its mundane and magical workings. You gain a +1 trait bonus to [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.

### Tinker Alchemist (Alchemist)
**TINKER ALCHEMIST (ALCHEMIST)**

It should come as no surprise that many gearforged excel in the field of clockwork, making great names for themselves as the creators of fantastic inventions. Tinker alchemists turn their relentless tinkering inwards, combining mechanical and alchemical aptitude to explore and expand the possibilities of their physical forms.

**Mutagen (Su):** This functions as the alchemist ability, though tinker alchemists do not acquire a natural armor bonus or undergo any bestial physical changes. Non‑gearforged who consume a tinker alchemist mutagen must make a Fort save (DC 10 + alchemist level + alchemist intelligence modifier) or be [[Nauseated|nauseated]] for 6 hours. Tinker alchemist mutagens are inert for other gearforged until the tinker alchemist reaches 6th level.

**Tune-Up (Ex):** At 1st level, a tinker alchemist is able to perform 4 hours of gearforged maintenance (on himself or an incapacitated gearforged) in 2 hours. This ability replaces throw anything.

**Internal Furnace (Su):** Rather than throwing bombs, tinker alchemists consume mixtures of reactive bombs should be treated as utilizing the breath weapon bomb discovery. This ability modifies bomb and replaces poison use.

**Alternative Energy (Su):** At 2nd, 5th, and 8th levels, tinker alchemists are able to re-engineer systems in their bodies to resist and eventually take advantage of a particular kind of energy (sonic, fire, or electricity‑the type of energy must be chosen at 2nd level). At 2nd level, a tinker alchemist gains resistance 10 against this energy type. At 5th level, a tinker alchemist is immune to this energy type. At 8th level, a tinker alchemist gains temporary hp equal to half the damage dealt by an attack of this energy type. This ability replaces poison resistance.

**Pharmacy (Su):** Beginning at 6th level, a tinker alchemist may share his mutagens with other gearforged. Shared mutagens have a duration of 5 minutes per alchemist level. This ability replaces swift poisoning (and modifies mutagen).

**Well-Oiled Machine (Ex):** At 10th level, a tinker alchemist can create an admixture that, consumed daily, allows him to forego maintenance entirely. This ability replaces poison immunity.

**Discoveries:** The following discoveries complement the tinker alchemist archetype: acid bomb, cognatogen, concussive bomb, grand mutagen, greater mutagen, infuse mutagen, infusion.

### Quiet Explorer (Barbarian)
**QUIET EXPLORER (BARBARIAN)**

Given their reverence for martial prowess, it is no surprise that many gearforged choose to explore the path of the barbarian. Although a living soul exists within each gearforged, that is not where the quiet explorer turns in harnessing her amazing rage powers. Rather, she digs down into her methodical, mechanical mind and deploys battlefield ferocity with the coolness of a monk.

**Gearforged Rage (Ex):** This functions as the barbarian ability with several exceptions. A quiet explorer can rage for five rounds per day plus two additional rounds each level after first. While in rage, the quiet explorer gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and a −1 penalty to her AC. They have no restrictions on skill checks during a rage and do not become [[Fatigued|fatigued]] by raging. This ability modifies rage. 

**Retaliation (Ex):** At 14th level, a quiet explorer is prepared to deftly respond with an attack under virtually any circumstance. If an opponent misses a melee attack roll against a raging quiet explorer by more than 5, the quiet explorer may expend an immediate action to make an attack of opportunity against them.

**Magic Denial (Su):** At 17th level, the quiet explorer’s resolve is so strong that she may shrug off magical effects through force of will. She gains spell resistance equal to 5 + 1/2 her class level + her Constitution modifier. This ability replaces tireless rage.

### Battleborn (Battle Scion)
**BATTLEBORN (BATTLE SCION)**

Battleborn are determined, elite, highly trained war machines armed with martial and arcane abilities that allow them to shape and control the battlefield. Battleborn are typically found at a battle’s vanguard, issuing tactical commands, unleashing spells, rallying the troops, and laying enemies low.

Battleborn are single-minded in their quest for arcane knowledge that might further enhance their battle prowess. They are particularly fond of combat divination spells (for more information, see Southlands).

**Race:** Gearforged.

*Force Bolt (Sp):* The battleborn can unleash a single blast of arcane force targeting a foe within 60 ft. as a ranged touch attack. The force bolt deals 2d4 points of damage at 1st level plus an additional 1d4 points of damage for every three battleborn levels beyond 1st (3d4 at 4th, 4d4 at 7th, 5d4 at 10th, and so on). This is a force effect. A battleborn can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. 

Using a force bolt is a standard action. For purposes of spell-like force bolt effects (see below), concentration checks, and overcoming spell resistance, the battleborn’s caster level is equal to his full battleborn level.

Three times per day, as an immediate action before unleashing a force bolt, a battleborn may choose to apply any one of the following force bolt effects to a force bolt. If a force bolt effect duplicates a spell and the bolt hits the target, the target receives any saving throws listed in the spell. If the duplicated spell does not normally allow a saving throw, the target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this effect (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the battleborn’s level + the battleborn’s Intelligence modifier). If the save is successful, the target does not suffer the force bolt effect but still receives the force bolt’s normal damage. This ability replaces force blast.

**Force Bolt Effects**

The following force bolt effects are available to the battleborn:

*Charged Force Bolt (Su):* A battleborn can expend an unused spell slot to charge his force bolt with additional raw magical energy. He may add +1d6 damage to the force bolt per level of the spell slot expended (+1d6 for a 1st-level spell, +2d6 for a 2nd-level spell, and so on). The battleborn must be at least 4th level to select this effect.

*Dampening Force Bolt (Sp):* Target is encased in an [[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]] for 1 round per 5 battleborn levels. The [[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]] affects only the creature hit by the force bolt and moves with the creature. Each round on its turn, the affected creature may attempt a new Fortitude save to end the [[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]] effect. The battleborn must be at least 15th level to

select this effect.

*Dispelling Force Bolt (Sp):* Target is subject to a targeted [[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]] spell. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The battleborn may add his Intelligence modifier to the dispel check (1d20 + battleborn’s caster level+ battleborn’s Intelligence modifier). A battleborn must be at least 6th level before selecting this effect.

*Penetrating Force Bolt (Sp):* The battleborn may add a bonus equal to his Intelligence modifier to the caster level check to overcome a creature’s spell resistance.

*Repelling Force Bolt (Su):* The force blast has the potential to push the target backward and knock him prone in addition to dealing normal damage. If the target fails its Fortitude save, it is pushed backward in a straight line up to 5 ft. per 5 battleborn levels and knocked prone. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 ft. (–5 ft. for Large, –10 ft. for Huge, –15 for Gargantuan, and –20 ft. for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 ft. Additionally, this ability cannot knock Gargantuan or Colossal creatures prone. If the target succeeds on its Fortitude save, it still takes the force blast damage but is not knocked backward or prone. The battleborn must be at least 5th level to select this effect.

*Stunning Force Bolt (Su):* The target is [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1 round per 4 battleborn levels. The battleborn must be at least 12th level to select this effect. Each round on its turn, the target receives a new Fortitude save to no longer be [[Stunned|stunned]].

*Arcane Aura (Su):* Beginning at 2nd level, a battleborn gains a +1 deflection bonus to his AC. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 battleborn levels beyond 2nd. In addition, the battleborn gains spell resistance equal to 6 plus his battleborn level. This ability modifies arcane aura.

*Dweomer Armor (Su):* Starting at 5th level, the battleborn may focus the innate arcane power of his soul gem into enhancing his armor. Glowing arcane runes and symbols appear across the surface of dweomered armor, causing it to shed light as a torch. These enhancements last for 1 minute per battleborn level. The battleborn can add any one of the following weapon properties to his armor beginning at the listed level. The details of these properties can be found in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Equipment.

*5th level: balanced, benevolent, bolstering, brawling, deathless, defiant, fortification (light), grinding, impervious, mirrored, spell storing*

*8th level: glamered, jousting, shadow, slick, rallying, spell resistance (13)*

*11th level: delving, energy resistance, fortification (moderate), ghost touch, invulnerability, spell resistance (15)*

*14th level: energy resistance (improved), martyring, shadow (improved), slick (improved), spell resistance (17)*

*17th level: energy resistance (greater), fortification (heavy), shadow (greater), slick (greater), spell resistance (19)*

The properties granted are determined each time the armor is dweomered and cannot be changed until dweomered again. The dweomer imparts no magical properties if the armor is worn by anyone other than the battleborn but, if returned to the battleborn while still dweomered, resumes having the properties.

A battleborn can use this ability once per day at 5th level and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

Beginning at 10th level, a battleborn can add any two armor properties of the appropriate level to his armor. He can also now dweomer his armor as a move action instead of a standard action.

At 15th level, a battleborn can add any three armor properties of the appropriate level. He can also now dweomer his armor as a swift action. This ability replaces dweomer weapon.

**Battle Tactician (Su):** Beginning at 7th level, a battleborn can amplify his voice to rally his companions and issue crucial tactical commands on the battlefield, granting all allies within 30 ft. a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, critical hit confirmation rolls, combat maneuver checks, and initiative checks for a number of rounds per day equal to his battleborn level. These rounds do not need to be used consecutively. The allies must be able to see or hear the battleborn and must remain within 30 ft. of him to receive these bonuses. Issuing battlefield commands is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The battleborn can end this effect as an immediate action.

Beginning at 9th level, a battleborn can perform a spellcharge, meaning he can cast a spell instead of a performing a melee attack as part of a charge. This must be an evocation spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. The battleborn gains a +2 bonus to the concentration check to cast this spell defensively (if necessary) and treats his caster level as if it were 2 higher when determining the spell’s effects.

At 11th level, allies benefiting from the battleborn’s tactical commands may also add the battleborn’s Charisma bonus to their concentration checks, Fortitude saving throws, and Will saving throws for the commands’ duration. They are also immune to the shaken and frightened conditions for the duration.

At 13th level, when using spellcharge, any target affected by the spell cast as part of the charge is blasted backward in a straight line up to 5 ft. per 5 battleborn levels and knocked prone. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 ft. (–5 ft. for Large, –10 ft. for Huge, –15 ft. for Gargantuan, and –20 ft. for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 ft. Additionally, this ability cannot knock Gargantuan or Colossal creatures prone. This ability replaces spell tactician.

**Battle Master (Su):** Beginning at 20th level, the battleborn’s caster level and effective fighter level becomes equal to his full battleborn level instead of his battleborn level –3. In addition, the battleborn may choose to apply a force bolt effect to his force bolts as often as he wishes.

### Clockwork Warrior (Fighter)
**CLOCKWORK WARRIOR (FIGHTER)**

Some gearforged retain their bloody ways and skills from their former life. Some become dedicated to a battle or cause that makes them take up arms and take advantage of their new metallic form.

**Forgeclaws (Ex):** At 2nd level, the clockwork warrior receives two primary natural claw attacks. The clockwork warrior is treated as if he were one size larger than he is for purposes of determining the base damage of the claws. The claws thus deal 1d6 bludgeoning and slashing damage. Unlike most attacks executed with claws, a clockwork warrior may choose to inflict nonlethal damage without incurring a penalty to attack. This replaces bravery.

**Clockwork Resilience (Ex):** At 3rd level, the clockwork warrior gains a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This replaces armor training.

**Grinding Gears (Ex):** At 5th level, the clockwork warrior gains a +1 circumstance bonus to all natural weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and to CMD when attempting to grapple a target. This bonus increases by 1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This replaces weapon training 1.

**Pneumatic Extensions (Ex):** At 9th level, the clockwork warrior increases the reach of his natural attacks by 5 ft. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Forged in Fire (Su):** Starting at 13th level, the clockwork warrior acquires fire and cold resistance 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 18th level. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Shattering Blow (Su):** At 17th level, the clockwork warrior gains a +4 circumstance bonus to sunder and disarm attempts with his natural weapons. This replaces weapon training 4.

**Steel Step, Steely Eye (Ex):** Starting at 19th level, the clockwork warrior ignores both difficult terrain and concealment. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Metal Mastery (Ex):** At 20th level, the clockwork warrior must choose his natural weapons for his weapon mastery ability. His critical threat range with his natural weapon increases by one in addition to the benefits of weapon mastery.

### Lawmaster (Inquisitor)
**LAWMASTER (INQUISITOR)**

While lawmasters are typically associated with the Cult of Zurvan, these single-minded gearforged may follow any god strongly associated with the rule of law. Whatever the case, lawmasters are united by their admiration for the inevitables, relentless outsiders devoted to law. For some lawmasters, this is merely an unusually strong reverence, but for many, it is an aspiration. The most fanatical interpret their existence as gearforged as one phase in a transition to a powerful new form, a final reward always seemingly dangling just out of reach. Most lawmasters have the justice, order, or truth inquisition, and choose a focus identical to a particular caste of inevitable, frequently pursuing those who cheat death or evade justice.

**Spells:** Lawmasters cannot cast spells with the \[chaotic] descriptor.

**Assessment (Ex):** At 1st level, a lawmaster gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception and Sense Motive checks. This replaces monster lore.

**Righteous Order (Ex):** At 3rd level, a lawmaster gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate checks. Attitudes influenced by intimidate last twice as long as normal. This replaces solo tactics.

**Piercing Sight (Ex):** At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, a lawmaster gains new lenses of truth with which to observe the world. As a free action, lawmaster observing his surroundings may attempt to focus his gaze on a target. If he succeeds at a caster level check against 10 + the target creature’s Hit Dice, he may see through incremental means of magical deceptions. He receives his Wisdom modifier as a circumstance bonus to this check. At 3rd level, a lawmaster can see invisible and ethereal creatures or objects. At 6th level, a lawmaster can see through illusions. At 9th level, a lawmaster can see the true form of polymorphed creatures or objects. This replaces the 3rd, 6th, and 9th level bonus teamwork feats.

**Mark of Law (Sp):** At 12th level, once per day, a lawmaster may mark a target with a mark of justice. This ability works identically to the spell with two exceptions: casting time is 1 minute and the offending action must be some violation of law. This replaces the 12th level bonus teamwork feat.

**Integrity of Self (Ex):** At 15th level, a lawmaster gains regeneration 5 (acid). This replaces the 15th level bonus teamwork feat.

**Ethereal Prison (Su):** At 18th level, a lawmaster scoring a critical hit may imprison a target in a featureless cell on the ethereal plane. The imprisoned target does not need to eat and does not age but is otherwise conscious. Once per hour, the target may attempt to free him or herself (rematerializing within 30 ft. of the lawmaster) with a successful Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the lawmaster’s class level + the lawmaster’s Wisdom modifier). The lawmaster may retrieve the target at will and may only keep one ethereal prisoner at a time. This replaces the 18th level bonus teamwork feat.

### Clockwork Mystery (Oracle)
**CLOCKWORK MYSTERY (ORACLE)**

As clockwork creatures and devices enter the world, the gods who oversee invention and artifice grow in power. An oracle with the clockwork mystery can alter the workings of machines and construct items out of thin air.

**Class Skills:** An oracle with the clockwork mystery adds Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge (arcana), and Knowledge (engineering) to her list of class skills. Bonus Spells: crafter’s fortuneAPG (2nd), clockwork timerDM (4th), enter imageAPG (6th), malfunctionUM (8th), fabricate (10th), wall of iron (12th), control constructUM (14th), iron body (16th), time stop (18th).

**Special:** At 1st level, an oracle with the clockwork mystery gains access to spells with the word “cure” or “inflict” in their title as usual. However, these spells heal or harm only constructs.

**Revelations:** An oracle with the clockwork mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.

*Automatic Control (Sp):* At 1st level, you gain a +4 insight bonus to Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against intelligent constructs. Enchantment and mind-affecting spells you cast also affect constructs.

At 7th level, you can cast dominate monster on a construct once per day. This effect lasts 1 round per oracle level. You can use this twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 17th level.

*Binding Chains (Sp):* As a standard action, you can cause a 20-ft. radius of iron chains to burst from the floor and wrap around any creature in the area. This acts as black tentacles, except the chains are made of iron and have hardness 10, 10 hp, and a break DC equal to 10 + the chain’s CMB. You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and an additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

*Clockwork Engine (Su):* Once per day at 11th level, you can imbue inanimate objects with life as animate objects for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. These animated objects gain 1 additional CP. You can do this twice per day at 15th level. At 15th level, these animated objects gain 2 additional CPs. You must be 11th level to select this revelation.

*Clockwork Incorporation (Ex):* Your knowledge of steam and brass allows you to replace body parts with mechanical devices. Choose one of the following options whenever you can select a new revelation. You can select each option only once, but you can select a different option each time you are able to choose a new revelation.

*Mechanical Legs:* You increase your base speed by 10 ft., and you are always considered to have had a running start when making jump checks. At 11th level, your speed is never reduced by armor. Oracles with the lame curse cannot select this revelation.

*Mechanical Arms:* You gain a +2 inherent bonus to Strength and a +4 racial bonus to all skills and checks based on Strength as well as your CMB. At 11th level, your inherent bonus to Strength increases to +4.

*Steel Skin:* You gain a +2 natural armor bonus as well as fire and cold resistance 5. This increases to a +4 natural armor bonus as well as fire and cold resistance 10 at 11th level.

*Mechanical Eyes:* You gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks and darkvision 60 ft. If you already have darkvision, the range increases by 30 ft. At 11th level, you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against blindness. Oracles with the clouded vision curse cannot select this revelation.

*Clockwork Messenger (Su):* You gain a clockwork familiar as per the wizard’s arcane bond class ability. For this familiar’s purposes only, your effective wizard level is equal to your oracle level. The familiar gains all the abilities of the animal it mimics, but it is a construct instead of an animal. Your oracle levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of your familiar. This ability does not allow you to have two familiars at one time.

*Construct Expert (Ex):* You gain a +4 insight bonus to knowledge checks regarding constructs. You require only half the time to craft a construct.

*Instant Fortress (Sp):* You can conjure a structure of iron and steel as a full-round action for a number of hours per day equal to one-half your oracle level. This ability otherwise acts as an *instant fortress*. You must be at least 13th level to choose this revelation.

*Soul of the Machine (Sp):* Once per day at 11th level, you may move your soul from your body into a construct or mechanical object as the spell magic jar. Intelligent constructs receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect. Since constructs and machines have no soul to replace, you do not need a receptacle to house the displaced soul. Once in the machine, you may control it as if it were your own body. You may use any special, supernatural, or spell-like ability the machine or construct possesses. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

*Steam Jet (Su):* As a standard action, you can breathe a 15-ft. cone of steam. This cone deals 1d4 points of fire damage per oracle level. A Reflex save halves this damage. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a clockwork creature. You gain immunity to bleed, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. You are also immune to fatigue, exhaustion, and nonlethal damage. If you are a gearforged, you instead receive a +4 inherent bonus total to your attributes, which you may freely distribute among your ability scores. Once per day, you can cast resurrection but only to return a construct to life.

### Industry Mystery (Oracle)
**INDUSTRY MYSTERY (ORACLE)**

Oracles of the industry mystery find their divine magic in automation, toil, pollution, and noise. Some may attain positions of prestige as techno-chaplains of great forges and mills. Others flourish in the criminal underground as saboteurs, leaders of cult-like street gangs, and relentless assassins. Many evil oracles develop a taste for swift and ruthless violence, their passion for amoral industrial efficiency seemingly knowing no bounds.

**Skills:** As an oracle with the industry mystery, add Appraise, Disable Device, Intimidate, and Stealth to your list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells:** grease (2nd), magic siege engine (4th), heatstroke (6th), steam blastDM (8th), winding keyDM (10th), animate objects (12th), timeless engineDM (14th), maze (16th), implosion (18th).

**Revelations:** An oracle with the industry mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.

**Confusion (Sp):** You may cast confusion once per day. You gain an additional use at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

**Dirty (Ex):** You receive your selection of either Catch Off-Guard, Combat Expertise, or Improved Dirty Trick as bonus feats. You do not have to meet the prerequisites for these feats.

**Factory Tours (Sp):** As a standard action, you can create an effect that replicates the stinking cloud and distracting cacophony spells. You can use the effect for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level per day. The rounds need not be consecutive. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

**Haywire (Sp):** You can animate clockwork or other machinery, albeit with control limited to not injuring yourself. As a standard action, you may cause (Large or smaller) machinery within 20 ft. of you to violently activate and shake uncontrollably, moving away from you at slow speed. For machinery that is secured, use the “DCs to Break or Burst Items” table against your oracle level. The GM should make an attack roll against anyone within 5 ft. of an agitated machine (base attack bonus +0). Damage is dealt depending on the size of the machine (small—d4, medium—d6, large—d8). Constructs can resist this ability with a successful Will save. You can use the effect for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level per day. The rounds need not be consecutive. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

**Morlock (Su):** When entering or leaving a sewer, you can do so through passages two sizes classes smaller than yourself. In a sewer, you can use darkvision and *spider climb* at will.

**Ragman (Su):** You can conjure surprisingly durable armor of little more than dirty rags and cloth around yourself. You gain a +4 armor bonus, which increases by +2 at 7th level and every four levels thereafter. You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

**Sweatshop (Su):** You may summon a crew (five per oracle level) of miniature workers to do your bidding. The diminutive humanoids are not suitable for strength tasks and disappear when attacked in any way. Between them, the group may work on any Craft skill project as if they were you with your oracle level in Craft skill ranks. The workers appear equipped with appropriate tools but do require raw materials. They will work unattended for up to 1 week straight and any work period must be followed by an equal amount of time off. They are uncommunicative aside from accepting your instructions and can follow only one set of crafting instructions at a time.

**Urban Interrogation (Sp):** In a sufficiently urban environment, as determined by the GM, you may commune with buildings as in the stone tell spell. You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.

**Vigilante (Ex):** Embracing messy modernity, you receive Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) and Amateur Gunslinger as bonus feats. You do not have to meet the prerequisites of these feats.

Final Revelation: Upon reaching 20th level, you become the master of the mechanical infrastructure around you. You may use winding key at will with no duration limit as long as you are in the presence of the affected constructs. You may affect up to 3 + Charisma modifier constructs at once. Conversely, you may also cause one machine within line of sight to simply fall completely to pieces as a standard action. Constructs take 15d6 points of damage (5d6 with a successful Will save).

### Fathforged (Paladin)
**FAITHFORGED (PALADIN)**

Faithforged do not choose their calling as holy warriors. Rather, the Ritual of Soulforging serves as dramatic consecration, a commitment of their new life to serving their deity’s causes. With potent holy symbols and reservoirs of positive energy forged directly into their forms and without the foibles of mind and body that most paladins work long and hard to cast off, the faithforged are physically and spiritually engineered powerhouses of good.

**Spells:** In lieu of daily spells, faithforged receive extra uses of their lay on hands ability. They receive extra uses equal to their cumulative available spell levels for the day. For instance, a 14th-level paladin can cast 3 1st level spells, 2 2nd-level spells, 1 3rd-level spell, and 1 4th-level spell, so a faithforged would receive 14 (1st × 3 + 2nd × 2 + 3rd × 1 + 4th × 1) extra uses. This ability replaces the spells per day ability.

**Lay on Hands (Su):** This functions as the paladin ability, though faithforged may also heal their fellow gearforged and even herself, which makes them quite sought after.

**Holy Vessel (Ex):** At 3rd and 8th levels, the faithforged’s body becomes a more perfect expression of her holy might. At each of these two levels, the paladin gains a +1 inherent bonus to Strength and Dexterity and a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor. This ability replaces divine health and aura of resolve.

**Holy Furnace (Su):** At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, as a swift action, a faithforged may use the positive energy burning within to enhance its martial ability by granting magical properties to any weapon or unarmed attack that she makes for 1 round. Each of the following costs one use of lay on hands. The faithforged deals +1d6 additional points of the damage type chosen per 3 class levels. Only one such bonus damage may be applied at a given time.

At 3rd level, the faithforged may add fire damage. At 6th level, the faithforged may add electricity damage. At 9th level, the faithforged may add sonic damage. At 12th level, the faithforged adds the axiomatic special weapon ability to her weapons whenever she uses this ability. At 15th level, the faithforged adds the holy special weapon ability to her weapons whenever she uses this ability. At 18th level, the faithforged adds the disruption special weapon ability to her weapons whenever she uses this ability. This replaces mercy and divine grace.

**Channel Positive Energy (Su):** This functions as the paladin ability, though it may also be used to heal gearforged but not the faithforged herself. Furthermore, the faithforged’s holy symbol is his or her own physical form, so the paladin may channel positive energy while bound. When a faithforged’s hp reach her negative Con score and her physical form is destroyed, the positive energy flowing within her is released in a final use of this ability. In that particular case, the amount of damage dealt or healed (player’s choice) is equal to 1d6 per 2 uses of lay on hands remaining.

**Divine Bond (Sp):** This functions similarly to the weapon form of the paladin ability but with a focus on the faithforged’s own mechanical form. When a faithforged calls upon her divine bond ability, she glows like a torch. This ability modifies divine bond.

**Unstoppable (Su):** At 17th level, the faithforged may harness the positive energy flowing within her to stave off incapacitation. Upon reduction to zero or fewer hp (but greater than her negative Constitution score), a faithforged may, as an immediate action, spend three uses of her lay on hands ability to remain fully operational for 1 round. This ability replaces aura of righteousness.

### Mechanical Bloodline (Sorcerer)
**MECHANICAL BLOODLINE (SORCERER)**

You have deep empathy with the mechanical devices around you, and your physical form changes dramatically over time until you are a magnificent fusion of flesh, metal, and magic.

**Class Skills:** Add Knowledge (architecture and engineering) and Disable Device to your list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells:*** analyze device* (1st), *shocking grasp* (3rd), *bullet shield* (5th), *arcane sight* (7th), *detonate* (9th), *rapid repair* (11th), *repulsion* (13th), *control construct* (15th), *iron body* (17th), *dominate clockwork* (19th).

**Bonus Feats:** Diehard, Endurance, Improved Unarmed Strike, Ironguts, Nimble Moves, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Craft), Skill Focus (Knowledge \[architecture and engineering]), Toughness.

**Bloodline Arcana:** You gain a +3 bonus to Will saves against spells in the charm and compulsion subschools.

**Bloodline Powers:** Your bizarre abilities come from the various—and usually quite powerful—clockwork devices around you. At the pinnacle of your power, you become one with the very machinery you revere so deeply.

*Launch Gears (Sp):* At 1st level, you can replicate the *gear barrage* spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 2 + your Charisma modifier.

**Mechanical Empathy (Sp):** At 3rd level, you can speak with clockwork and other machines as per the stone tell spell. You may use this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level each day. Most machines will be limited to providing information relating to their purpose and users. At 9th level, your mechanical bond allows you to affect clockwork constructs once per day as per the *mass charm monster* spell. Duration of the charm is 1 hour/level.

**The Rebuild (Ex):** At 9th level, your increasingly mechanical form’s rather superior physical capabilities reveal themselves. Your base speed increases by +20 ft. and you receive a +2 inherent bonus to Strength. You also receive a +10 competence bonus to Acrobatics checks for long or high jumps. These bonuses increase (+10 ft. base speed, +1 Strength, and +10 Acrobatics check bonus) at 13th and 17th levels.

**War Machine (Su):** At 15th level, as a move action, you can assume the form of a clockwork giant. You gain construct immunities to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), bleed, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. Your fists become primary natural slam weapons equivalent to great clubs (2d8 hp base damage), and your adaptable limbs increase your melee touch attack range by 15 ft. without increasing your threatened area. You may use this ability once per day for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer level.

**Clockwork Masterpiece (Su):** At 20th level, the mechanical, magical, and biological form you can access at 15th level becomes permanent. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus and the temporary construct immunities ability at will.

### Salvager (Summoner)
**SALVAGER (SUMMONER)**

Any summoner can rightfully claim the companionship of an exotic planar entity, but the salvager’s eidolon is something stranger still. It is raw material from the plane of Rusty Gears given form and alien intelligence—young eidolons begin their existences as ominous floating spheres of metal scrap but quickly transition to their more mature form, a swirling, grinding cloud of cogs, wire, and spring. Class Skills: The salvager replaces Handle Animal on his list of class skills with Disable Device.

**The Sphere:** In its base form, the salvager’s eidolon is a medium sphere of tightly packed fine and diminutive mechanical refuse from Rusty Gears. This form counts as a 2-point evolution. It begins with the following starting statistics:

**Size Medium:** Speed fly 20 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Saves Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will (bad); Attack bite (1d6); Ability Scores Str 12, Dex 16, Con -, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions bite, flight. The eidolon’s type changes to construct. Do not recalculate Hit Dice, Base Attack Bonus, hp, skills, or saves. The eidolon may be healed in the same manner as a gearforged. The eidolon takes 150% damage from electricity and may not choose the resistance or immunity (electricity) evolutions. It may be banished like an outsider. This modifies the summoner’s eidolon ability.

**Construct Summons (Sp):** A salvager using summon monster typically summons ragged clockwork creatures from Rusty Gears. The scrap beast template (see sidebar) should be applied to creatures that would typically take the celestial or fiendish template. The salvager’s summon monster list is modified as follows:

*Summon Monster I:* A salvager can also summon clockwork spies (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3).

*Summon Monster II:* A salvager cannot summon small elementals or lemures.

*Summon Monster III:* A salvager cannot summon dretches or lantern archons but can summon clockwork beetles (Midgard Bestiary, page 24), clockwork servants (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3), and arbiter inevitables (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 2).

*Summon Monster IV:* A salvager cannot summon medium elementals, hell hounds, hound archons, or mephits but can summon clockwork beetle swarms (Midgard Bestiary, page 24), clockwork hounds (Midgard Bestiary, page 25), clockwork huntsmen (Midgard Bestiary 26), junkyard clockwork dogs (Dark Roads and Golden Hells, page 106), and weaving spiders (Midgard Bestiary, page 96).

*Summon Monster V:* A salvager cannot summon babau, bearded devils, bralani azatas, large elementals, salamanders, or xills but can summon clockwork myrmidons (Midgard Bestiary, page 27) and clockwork soldiers (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3).

*Summon Monster VI:* A salvager cannot summon huge elementals, erinyes, lillend azatas, or succubi, but can summon clockwork stalkers (Kobold Quarterly 23, page 57).

*Summon Monster VII:* A salvager cannot summon bebiliths, bone devils, greater elementals, or vrocks but can summon alchemical golems (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 2) and zelekhut inevitables (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 2).

*Summon Monster VIII:* A salvager can only summon clockwork golems (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 2), clockwork leviathans (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3), and kolyarut inevitables (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 2).

*Summon Monster IX:* A salvager can only summon brass golems (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 3) and steam golems (Midgard Bestiary).

**Salvage Cloud (Su):** At 2nd level, the salvager can select salvage cloud as a 2-point evolution. As a full‑round action, the eidolon may expand its mass into a cloud of refuse one size larger than its sphere form. As a cloud, the eidolon behaves similarly but not identically to the swarm subtype. The cloud’s starting form is a square, though it may rearrange itself as a move action so long as no dimension is more than 50% larger than the original square. It may move through squares occupied by other characters freely, though it provokes an attack of opportunity in doing so. The cloud’s only attack is a swarm attack executed following a move ending in another creature’s square. Once in the square, its attack is automatically successful. This attack deals 1d6 points of slashing damage at 2nd level plus an additional 1d6 every three summoner levels thereafter. The swarm cannot be grappled, tripped, or bull rushed and is immune to weapon damage, flanking, critical hits, and spells that target a specific number of creatures. The swarm takes 150% damage from area-of-effect spells and is susceptible to wind effects as a diminutive creature. Reduction to fewer than 0 hp disperses and kills the eidolon. In cloud form, the eidolon is mute and may not use skills, feats, or other evolutions.

**Mitosis (Su):** At 10th level, the salvager may select mitosis as a 3-point evolution. While in cloud form, the eidolon may divide into a pair of clouds one size smaller as a move action. Each new cloud retains the original’s base stats with hp divided between them. Damage from the swarm attack is 1d6 lower than that of an undivided salvage cloud. If the summoner has taken the large evolution by 18th level, he may choose mitosis a second time, allowing each of the smaller clouds to divide once again. While swarms may move through each other freely, they may not occupy the same square at the end of a move action. Clouds adjacent to one another may rejoin together as a move action. The eidolon may only return to its sphere form when all surviving clouds are intact. If one or more clouds have been destroyed when the eidolon reforms, its maximum hp are proportionally decreased. This ability replaces aspect and greater aspect.

**Ejector (Ex):** At 16th level, the salvager may purchase ejector as a 3-point evolution. While in cloud form, the eidolon may hurl an opponent across the battlefield at the end of its swarm attack. The eidolon must be as large or larger than the opponent and fully occupy all of the opponent’s squares to attempt this. This effect works identically to a single round of enemy hammer. It may be used a number of times per day per two summoner levels. This ability replaces merge forms.

**Devour (Su):** At 20th level, the salvager may purchase devour as a 3-point evolution. In conjunction with a swarm attack, the eidolon may attempt to absorb a weapon, piece of armor, or other metal item into itself, using these to heal damage to itself or the summoner. While making a swarm attack, the eidolon makes a disarm check against the target, using the summoner’s CMB. The item removed by a successful check will be the most accessible, at the GM’s discretion. This item is effectively destroyed to heal 4 hp of the eidolon or 2 hp of the summoner. Outside of combat, the eidolon may absorb available metallic material at a rate of 1 piece per round. This ability replaces twin eidolon.

### Heavy Gauntlet Witch (Witch)
**HEAVY GAUNTLET WITCH (WITCH)**

The heavy gauntlet witch is a racial variation on the gauntlet witch archetype. Full details on the gauntlet witch and other variants can be found in Kobold Quarterly #23.

Though admittedly extremely rare, heavy gauntlet witches are formidable beings. Combining the bulk and power of their gearforged frame with the eldritch might of battle-witchcraft, heavy gauntlet witches prove their mettle in the chaos of war or as dedicated bodyguards to those that can afford their services. A few are wanderers, finding solace in the lure of adventure and the discovery of new experiences and knowledge, feeling assured that the power of their adamantine gauntlet will sustain them.

A heavy gauntlet witch’s adamantine gauntlet has the following modifications. The witch’s gauntlet is a permanent adamantine modification to the gearforged’s structure and cannot be removed. The witch cannot benefit from the toughness ability nor take the alertness, lore, legend lore, teleport gauntlet, or drain husk powers. The adamantine gauntlet receives all bonuses associated with adamantine items.

At 1st level, the adamantine gauntlet grants the gearforged a +1 inherent bonus to Strength. This improves by +1 for every five class levels the gearforged possesses.

At 3rd level, adamantine gauntlet confers the light fortification armor special ability. This improves to moderate fortification at 8th level and heavy fortification at 14th. At 18th level, the witch becomes immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. If the witch chooses to replace hexes with armor training, its adamantine DR increases by 1 point with each option (that is, DR 2/– with medium armor, DR 3/– with heavy armor).

**Forged Pain Clasp (Sp):** The witch’s pain clasp ability overrides a construct’s immunity to paralysis. This modifies pain clasp and improved pain clasp.

**Telescopic Strike (Ex):** At 10th level, the adamantine gauntlet has improved to enable the witch to make telescoping strikes. The witch gains reach 10 ft. when attacking with the gauntlet or when using the pain clasp ability.

### Clockwork Crafter (Wizard)
**CLOCKWORK CRAFTER (WIZARD)**

Some gearforged wizards focus on perfecting their own forms over crafting items for others. Such wizards specialize in enchanting their own mechanical bodies and maximizing the potential of their new metallic forms.

**Arcane Crafter**

Instead of specializing in a particular school of magic, a clockwork caster instead gains the universalist school, gaining the Arcane crafter sub-school and replacement power at 1st level.

This ability alters arcane school.

**Replacement Power**: The following school power replaces the hand of the apprentice power of the universalist school.

**Metacharge (Ex)**: As an Arcane crafter, you gain a bonus feat at 3rd level, which must be an item creation feat or metamagic feat. You must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. When using metamagic feats to create magic items, your skill and understanding of the principles involved in the item’s creation give you a +2 bonus on the skill check made to create the item.

**Self-Made (Ex):** At 1st level, the clockwork crafter gains the Craft Wondrous Item item creation feat. This feat may only be used on his own body until he reaches 5th level when he may craft items for others using this feat. When doing this, the clockwork crafter literally enchants a part of his own body as if he were making a specific wondrous item for that particular magical item slot. For example, rather than enchant a pair of magical *boots of speed;* the clockwork crafter would enchant his own feet. When enchanting a part of his own form, the clockwork crafter reduces the gp cost by 10%. Unfortunately, when he is crafting an item for another (at higher levels), he increases the cost by 25%.

At 4th level (and every 3 levels thereafter) the clockwork crafter add an additional separate wondrous item enchantment to a selected body slot. So he might enchant his feet slot with the equivalent of *boots of speed* and then later on might also create *boots of striding and springing.* These are separate enchantments (like two separate wondrous items) which the clockwork crafter can switch between as a standard action.

At 8th level switching between wondrous enchantments in a given body slot becomes a move action.

Finally, at 12 level, the clockwork crafter can switch between enchantments in a given body slot as a free action (though he may still only take 1 free action of a given type once per round).

**Bonus Feats**

At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a clockwork crafter gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose an item creation feat. The clockwork crafter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains from advancing levels. The clockwork crafter is not limited to item creation feats when choosing feats gained from regular level advancement.

This alters the bonus feats received at these levels.

## Additional Rules
The following additional rules may be applied to gearforged characters.

### Clockwork Skills
**Clockwork Skills** 

In societies rich with mechanical devices and automatons, many citizens may do nothing but wind keys, feed boilers, and repair gears all day long. While most NPCs may know a thing or two about the technology that surrounds them, real skill is required to make a lasting repair beyond the simple restoration of fuel or resetting of a valve.

**Craft (Clockwork)**

This skill operates just like any other Craft skill, but because of the complexity of clockwork devices, the DCs start at 10 for the most basic items and skyrocket to 40 or higher to create a gearforged. A clockworker can attempt to create a clockwork item in half the normal amount of time by adding +5 to the DC of the desired item. This skill may be used to repair clockworks in the following ways.

*Quick Fix:* You may use a full round action to remove the broken condition from a clockwork item for a short time. Make a Craft (clockwork) check (DC 10 + hp damage to be repaired). Success means you may use that item normally for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Craft (clockwork).

*Repair Construct:* Repair a construct or sentient clockwork. Repairing a construct takes 4 hours. Make a Craft (clockwork) skill check (DC 15 + construct’s Hit Dice). If successful, restore 1d4 hp to the construct. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Intelligence modifier (if positive) to this amount.

*Treat Critical Damage:* To treat critical damage, make a Craft (clockwork) skill check (DC 20) as a full round action. Success restores 2 hp per level or Hit Dice of the creature. Success of 5 or more over the DC adds your Intelligence modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from this ability once every 24 hours.

**Disable Device**

This skill allows a character to turn off a clockwork device if he knows the method of its construction and has the proper clockworking tools. For a typical household device, this requires a DC 10 check while larger and more elaborate devices can have DCs of 30 or higher. Each device is made differently and requires a different check. Even those that are superficially similar or made by the same clockworker can be very different on the inside, so a check is needed even in these situations. Using Disable Device in this way requires 1 minute.

Clockworks meant to fight, stand sentry, or otherwise thwart rogues and rascals are very difficult to turn off. For a hardened device meant to evade this sort of tampering, the DC is 20 + target construct’s CR and the check can only be attempted while the construct is unaware of its attacker. Attempting such a check provokes attacks of opportunity and requires the disabling character to succeed on a melee attack. No retry is possible once a construct is aware of such an attempt. Using Disable Device to deactivate a clockwork device requires a full-round action.

**Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering Expanded)**

This skill gains new uses in a city where gearforged and other clockwork devices are common as shown on the following table.


| **DC** | **Task** |
|---|---|
| 10 | Determine mode of power for a clockwork device |
| 15 | Restore power from springs or boilers to an immobile clockwork device or shut it down |
| 20 | Safely shut down a dangerous clockwork device |
| 25 | Determine the maker or workshop that built a clockwork |
| varies | Disable a clockwork device, such as a steam gate, lift, or bridge |

**Use Magic Device Expanded Skill**

This skill can be helpful in activating an inactive clockwork device, finding its mode of arcane power (if it has one), and determining how much energy remains in its alchemical or arcane weaponry. It is also the skill used when attempting to trigger the power of a disassembled device.


| **DC** | **Task** |
|---|---|
| 20 | Activate clockwork |
| 25 | Analyze clockwork power source |
| 30 | Trigger disabled device |

### Gearforged Components and Enhancements
**Gearforged Components**

Any character capable of creating magic items can make the same item as a gearforged component. Gearforged components usually take up the same space on the body that that a magic item of the same type would use, items can be crafted that do not take up a defined space, but they cost twice the normal cost and are bonded to the gearforged’s body. Embedded items cannot be damaged or targeted, attached components can. If an item requires activation, the gearforged can do so with a thought, it still requires a standard action, but it can be done without movement or sound and the gearforged never draws an attack of opportunity when doing so. Embedded or attached components cannot be forcibly removed unless the gearforged has less than zero hps. If the gearforged is destroyed, each component gets an appropriate saving throw to see if they survive. Any attached component can be made so as to fold and compress itself until it fits into the gearforged's body (Perception DC 30 to notice something odd about that particular part of the body) for an additional cost of 2,000 gp. Transforming such a component from a compressed state to a useable one is a move action.

*Armblade:* (Attached Component) A long metal cylinder with a heavy serrated blade at one end attaches to a gearforged arm. It is the equivalent of a +1 bastard sword and requires the exotic weapon proficiency to use it properly. While it is attached, the gearforged cannot be disarmed but he cannot use that hand for anything else. He gains a +2 bonus on attempts to disarm an opponent. If he uses a ready action to set an armblade against a charge, he deals double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature. Faint transmutation; CL 5; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; *heroism*; Price 2300 gp; Weight 8 lbs.

*Armbow:* (Attached Component) This is a +2 repeating light crossbow formed from dense wood, it attaches to a gearforged arm, completely covering the hand and locks into place. It magically arms and fires with a thought, it creates its own ammo and its clip holds 5 bolts. It can create 20 bolts per day. The gearforged can spend 1hp to create extra bolts and 3 hps to create a bolt that is aligned, creating bolts are a free action. The armbow cannot use normal bolts. Moderate evocation and conjuration; CL 9; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; *abundant ammuntion, minor creation*; Price 15,000 gp; weight 12 lbs.

*Battlefist:* (Attached Component) This +1 weapon resembles a massively oversized spiked gauntlet; one designed for a medium gearforged that looks like it was made for an ogre. It attaches to the arm, completely covering the hand. The damage done by a battlefist is 1d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage. Gearforged monks using a battlefist increase their unarmed damage as if they were one size larger, and he adds the bonus of the fist to his attack and damage rolls. Faint transmutation; CL 3; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; *bulls strength*; Price 2,600 gp; weight 6 lbs.

*Circlet of Preservation:* (Attached Component) This is a heavy torc of blackened adamatine, it adjusts to fit the neck of any medium gearforged. The torc is designed to provide whatever construct it is attached to Fast Healing 5 while the construct is intact and even after its been destroyed, regenerate it back to 1 hit point after an hour since its destruction. The circlet itself is nearly impossible to damage, having a hardness of 25 and 50 hit points. Also, any spell immunities that the construct has also covers the circlet as well. Strong Enchantment; CL 20; Slot neck, Craft Wondrous Item; *vigorous repair*; Price 8,000 gp; weight 3 lbs.

*Circlet of the Third Eye:* (Attached Component) This headband bears the sigil of a single eye situated in the center of the brow. On command, the eye transforms into a 1 inch eye that is controllable by thought. The eye glows yellow and is clearly visible even in darkness and deep shadow (Stealth checks at -5). The wearer can continually *see invisible* as the spell. In addition, the eye is can fly 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.

The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can’t enter another plane of existence, even through a *gate* or similar magical portal. and has perfect manueverability. The eye has an AC of 20 and 15 hp. If it is taken to below 0 hps, it disappears and cannot be used again for one week. The circlet can function for one hour per day but it need not be consecutive. The minimum time it can be activated is ten minutes though. Faint Transmutation; CL4; Craft Wonderous Item, *arcane, darkvision, see invisibility*; Price 30,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

*Disc of Energy Resistance: (Embedded Component)* A metallic disc, engraved with runes and set with a gemstone at it center, it occupies the same spot as an amulet on a gearforged and grants the wearer resistance to one kind of energy (acid, cold, electric, fire, sonic).A minor disc gives 10 ER, a major disc gives 20 ER and a greater disc grants 30 ER. Faint (minor or major) or moderate (greater) abjuration; CL 3 (minor), 7 (major), 11 (greater); Craft Wonderous item; *resist energy*; price 12, 000 gp (minor), 28,000 gp (major), 44, 000 gp (greater); Weight 1 lb.

*Disc of Illumination:* (Embedded Component) This shimmering metal disc occupies the same body slot as an amulet. Three times a day the disc can illuminate the metallic parts of the gearforged body, making it shine as the *daylight* spell for one hour. When the gearforged is illuminated he is difficult to look directly at and gains a +2 concealment bonus to AC. Moderate Evocation; CL6; Craft Wonderous Item, *daylight*; Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

*Disc of Shadow:* (Embedded Component) This dark crescent shaped disc occupies the same body slot as an amulet. Three times per day the disc can cause ink-like black vapors to pour from the gearforged’s mouth, shrouding it in an effective *darkness* spell centered on him for one hour. The gearforged gain a +2 concealment bonus to AC and a +5 bonus to hide checks. Moderate Evocation; CL 6; Craft Wonderous Item, *darkness*; Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Rava, the patron goddess of Zobeck, shines her blessings on the hard-working Zobeckers, giving them the gift of the clockwork knowledge fueling the Clockwork City’s ticking heart and protecting them from a host of neighbors who seek to subjugate the city. Under Rava’s aegis, Zobeck’s population has burgeoned, and the city has blossomed into a thriving trade hub with land access along the Great Northern Road and the Great Southern Road and river traffic up the River Argent.

### Gearforged in Midgard
**Gearforged in Midgard**

Most visitors to the Free City of Zobeck are dazzled by the myriad mechanical miracles on display, foremost among them the gleaming clockwork men who walk alongside beings of flesh and blood on the city’s streets. But woe to the traveler who addresses one of these wonders as a mindless automaton! Zobeck’s gearforged are living constructs, mechanical forms housing mortal souls.

Originally created as powerful soldiers, gearforged must now find their own paths with which to navigate the second life they have been given. Many devote themselves to civil service, others to their gods. Some dedicate their extraordinarily long lives to the pursuit of knowledge. Others, naturally, seek out lives of adventure.

**Silent Councils of the Old Masters**

The gearforged also gather to share Machine Speech or memory gears from time to time, especially the eldest among them. These are the Council of the Anvil in Zobeck, the Secret Brotherhood in the Ironcrag Cantons, and similar councils in all other cities where the gearforged are numerous, such as the Free City of Melano, the island of Kyprion, and the sultanate’s clockwork centers of Methony and Quresh.

### Optional Rule: Gear Points
**Optional Rule: Gear Points**

Gear points are an easy way to depict the gradual progression of a gearborn toward becoming a full‑blown gearforged or simply for a regular character taking gearforged traits or feats. Gearborn begin play with 5 gear points granted by their race. Subject to the GM’s approval, non-gearforged races may ignore the gearforged racial prerequisite by gaining the noted amount of gear points. Unless otherwise noted, each gearforged trait taken increases the gear points of a character by +1.

Gearforged feats taken by gearborn or non‑gearforged characters increase the gear point total as well. If a feat can be taken multiple times, the gear points incurred are cumulative. The following table lists all gear points incurred by taking feats:


| **Feat** | **Points** |
|---|---|
| Armor Upgrade | +2 |
| Aquatic Explorer | +1 |
| Autonomous Appendage | +2 |
| Construct’s Bane | +1 |
| Echoes of Former Flesh | −1 |
| Echoes of Lives Past | −1 |
| From the Crucible | +2 |
| Gearforged Utility | +1 |
| Gorgeous Gearforged | +1 |
| Jury-Rigged | +0 |
| Limb Lock | +1 |
| Magnet Snatch | +3 |
| Rust-Proof Armor | +1 |
| Scrap Heap | +1 |
| Self-Mechanic | +0 |


| **Point** | **Total Modifications** |
|---|---|
| 1 point | The character takes a –2 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. |
| 2–4 points | The character gains the Rust Vulnerability racial trait. |
| 5–6 points | The character receives the immortal racial trait but can no longer be raised or resurrected. |
| 7–8 points | The character no longer needs to eat or sleep but loses his old racial type. He is now treated as a humanoid with the gearforged subtype for the purpose of all effects. |
| 9–10 points | The character loses all his old racial traits and receives the traits of a gearborn. |
| 11–13 points | The character receives the water susceptibility drawback. |
| 14 points | The character can choose any two of the following immunities: disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, poison. However, the character also receives the repairs required drawback. |
| 15 points | The character can choose any one of the following immunities not chosen before: disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, poison. However, the character also receives the rewind the gears drawback. |
| 16+ points | The character replaces all gearborn racial traits with the gearforged racial traits |

### Optional Rule: Gearforged Flaws
**Optional Rule: Gearforged Flaws**

Gearforged characters may choose flaws unique to their race:

**Flashy:** The metals of your body were made to be shiny and noticeable: -2 to Disguise and Stealth checks.

**Just for Show:** The metals of your body are lighter and not as dense as those of most gearforged; lose the +1 natural armor bonus that gearforged normally have, as well as a general -1 to Armor Class. These metals may be altered later through alchemical, mundane, or even magical methods.

### Gearforged Spells
The gearforged are the children of Rava, the Gear Goddess of Fate and Industry. Her priests were the first to forge bodies of brass and copper with cunningly wrought gears and well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh; a special ritual is required to transfer a living creature’s soul into the housing that makes it gearforged.

The following spells are reserved for gearforged characters, although other appropriate races may use them at the GM’s discretion. For more information on the gearforged, including stats for gearforged PCs, see *Advanced Races: Gearforged*.
