# Goliath
## Overview
Mountain-dwelling nomads, the goliaths are a reclusive, tribal race more at home scaling a sheer cliff than walking the streets of a city. This chapter provides all the necessary details for adding this race to any D&D campaign.

**A DAY IN THE LIFE**

For Keothi Softspeaker Thunukalathi, the day begins with the low drones of the dawncallers—musically gifted goliaths who watch over the tribe’s camp at night, then awaken everyone in the morning with songs that exhort and inspire. Keothi’s family dresses and then gathers together for a brief meal of goat’s milk, berries, and smoked fish from a mountain stream. The tribe isn’t moving the camp today, so everyone gathers near the central fire pit for the day’s work. The tribal chief chooses ten “captains” for that day, assigning four to the hunt, two to berry- and root-gathering, two to food preparation, one to care for infants, and one to tend to the tribe’s small herd of mountain goats. The chief looks Keothi’s way as he chooses captains but doesn’t call his name. “Perhaps tomorrow I’ll be captain for the first time,” thinks Keothi.

One by one, the captains select tribe members for their teams. Because Keothi is adept at archery, he is chosen for a hunting team. Keothi is happy, because he’d rather hunt than dig up roots all day. Had the tribe been moving the camp that day, most of the members would have been assigned to “travel teams” charged with carrying the tribe’s tents on their backs, and Keothi might not have been picked for a hunting team. Once all the teams are filled, the goliaths chant a prayer to Kavaki the Ram-Lord, then rush off to their appointed tasks.

Along with four other goliaths, Keothi begins to scour the ridges and valleys of the mountains for an elk herd whose tracks have been spotted nearby. But the elk prove elusive that morning, and Keothi’s band of hunters begins to get nervous. It will be embarrassing if they return to camp in the evening empty-handed, especially if other hunting teams have had better luck.

By midday, any elk are bedded down in the brush, making finding them almost impossible. The hunting team amuses itself by wrestling each other in a hastily drawn circle in the dirt (Keothi wins one match and loses two) and challenging each other to feats of archery (Keothi comes within an arrow-width of beating even the captain, and he handily defeats everyone else).

When the sun is low in the mountain sky, it’s time to hunt again. Keothi and the captain wait at the bottom of a river gully while the rest of the team beats the bushes above them. This trick works, sending more than a dozen elk rushing past Keothi. Two fall to his arrows, and Keothi’s captain also fells an elk. Amid much laughter, the goliaths butcher the elk quickly, then stagger back to camp, carrying as much meat and elk-hide as they can.

They are the last of the four hunting teams to return to camp. A late hunting party often arrives empty-handed, so another hunting team is already celebrating their two-elk bounty when a weary Keothi places his team’s third elk carcass at the chief’s feet. The chief declares Keothi’s team to have won the hunt that day, amid cheers from the entire tribe. When the captain reports that Keothi felled two of the elk himself, the chief says, “Beginning tonight, you are no longer Softspeaker. You are now Keothi Steadyhand Thunukalathi.”

Grinning from ear to ear, Keothi enjoys the spoils of victory—first in line when the roasted haunch of elk is ready. After an evening spent hearing campfire tales of brave climbers and cunning hunters, Keothi returns to the family tent for sleep. “Perhaps tomorrow I’ll down three elk,” Keothi thinks as he drifts off to sleep.

**DESCRIPTION**

Unlike the previous two chapters, which covered races previously described in the Player’s Handbook, this chapter gives a full description of goliaths, their racial traits, and all other information necessary for creating goliath characters.

**OVERVIEW**

Goliaths are massive creatures unafraid of throwing their weight around in a fight. Highly competitive, these strong nomads can prove to be powerful allies and welcome additions to any adventuring party.

**Personality:** Goliaths are known for their almost foolhardy daring. In their mountain homes, they leap from precipice to precipice, heedless of the fatal consequences of a misstep. They place great stock in clan and family; life in the mountains teaches even the youngest goliath to rely completely on his fellows for a hand across a crevasse. Because most goliaths are hunter-gatherers, they tend to be inquisitive, always curious about whether better hunting lies over the next ridge or a good water source can be found in the next canyon.

Goliaths are completely unsympathetic toward tribe members who can’t contribute to the well-being of the tribe anymore—an attitude reinforced by social structures. Old, sick, and otherwise infirm goliaths are exiled from their clans, never to return.

**Physical Description:** A typical goliath is larger than the largest half-orc. Most stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Unlike with most other races, there is no appreciable difference in height or weight between male and female goliaths.

Goliaths have gray skin, mottled with dark and light patches that goliath shamans say hint at a particular goliath’s fate. Lithoderms—coin-sized bone-and-skin growths as hard as pebbles—speckle their arms, shoulders, and torso. Their skulls have a jutting eyebrow ridge, wide jaw, and occasional lithoderms as well. Female goliaths have dark hair on their heads, grown to great length and always kept braided. Male goliaths generally have hair only on their limbs. Goliaths’ eyes are a brilliant blue or green, and they often seem to glow a little from underneath their furrowed brows.

Because their skin mottling has cultural significance, goliaths generally dress as lightly as possible, displaying their skin patterns for all to see. For the same reason, few goliaths would willingly get a tattoo—to draw on one’s skin is tantamount to trying to rewrite one’s fate. Goliaths instead decorate themselves with jewelry, often sporting ear, nose, or brow rings. A goliath’s lithoderms are also common places to embed a gem or two, since they have few nerve endings and stand out on the goliath’s body already.

**Relations:** When encountered in the mountains, goliaths are outwardly friendly to anyone who doesn’t threaten the tribe and can keep up with them as they climb from peak to peak. Humans who brave the mountains—rangers and druids, most often—can often earn a tasty meal by helping a team of goliath hunters.

Goliaths hold dwarves in particularly high regard, wishing their tribes had the dwarven aptitude for weapon crafting. Some of the bravest goliaths climb down into the tunnels and natural caverns under a mountain, seeking a dwarf community to trade with.

The smaller-than-human races are regarded as curiosities, but many a nimble-climbing gnome or halfling has earned respect by beating a goliath in a race up a cliff. Goliaths view the extended life span of an elf as vaguely frightening, finding it hard to imagine a person who could have known one’s great-great grandfather.

A goliath tribe’s attitude toward any nearby giants varies widely. Some tribes eagerly trade with giants; the giants’ weapons aren’t up to dwarven standards, but they are made in larger sizes (which goliaths greatly prefer). However, giants have a bad habit of trying to turn goliaths into their slaves, using them for menial tasks they’re too big or too lazy to do themselves. Conflict inevitably ensues, and soon either the giants are dead, the goliaths have fled, or the goliaths are chained up as slaves to a giant-lord.

Goliaths tend to hold goblinoids and orcs (including half-orcs) at arm’s length, noting that the “downlanders” they trade with regard such races as troublemakers. But because goblinoids rarely stray into the high mountains, they are usually someone else’s trouble, so goliaths don’t bear them any actual malice.

**Alignment:** Goliaths have a slight tendency toward chaotic alignments, which is reflected in their wanderlust and the small, mobile communities in which they live. Still, each goliath tribe has one or more adjudicators that settle disputes within the clan, and such goliaths are generally lawful. Goliaths have a slight preference for good over evil, since among the high mountain peaks, survival becomes much easier when one aids a fellow goliath without insisting on recompense.

**Goliath Lands:** Because they don’t support large-scale agriculture or extensive settlements, the mountain ranges where goliaths live are home to few other intelligent races. Most tribes of goliaths wander from peak to peak, tending their goat flocks and foraging for alpine roots and tubers. Typically, a tribe sets up a temporary village in an alpine meadow and remains there for a month or two, then moves on when the season changes or better hunting can be found elsewhere. Larger tribes tend to follow a similar trail from year to year, retreating to lower elevations in midwinter and when they need to trade, then ascending to the highest peaks once the snow melts.

Some goliaths live at lower altitudes among humans or other races, most often because their tribe exiled them after a crime, dispute, or injury. Many a folk tale features a forlorn goliath working as a farmhand after a failed courtship in the mountains.

**Religion:** Kavaki the Ram-Lord is the primary deity of the goliaths (see the Religion section later in this chapter). As the Chief of All Chiefs, he watches over the goliaths and their mountain homes. His clerics say that Kavaki created the goliaths when he found a bush bearing gems in place of fruit growing atop the highest mountain peak in the world. When Kavaki plucked gems from the bush, those gems became the first tribe of goliaths. Kavaki instructs his followers to seek out the hidden bounty of the mountains and keep the tribe safe from harm.

**Language:** For millennia, the goliaths have had only a spoken tongue, Gol-Kaa, which has only thirteen phonetic elements: a, e, g, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, u, th, and v. Recently, the goliaths have picked up the alphabet of the Dwarven language, though the concept of a written language hasn’t spread to all the tribes yet. Those tribes that have learned the Dwarven alphabet are busily transcribing the goliaths’ vast oral tradition into carvings, cave paintings, and even books.

**Names:** Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname or honorific assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. The birth name tends to be short—often only a syllable or two—but the clan names often have five syllables or more and always end in a vowel.

The honorific isn’t a traditional name so much as it is a descriptive nickname, often a two-part sobriquet. The honorific can change at the whim of the tribal chief, whether because a particular goliath did something useful for the tribe (earning an honorific such as “Highclimber” or “Nighthunter”) or as punishment for failure (a middle name such as “Latesleeper” or “Wanderslost”). Goliaths who have been exiled from their tribe generally carry a middle name that reflects their status, such as “Solitary” or “Kinless.” Some specific roles within the tribe, such as lorekeeper or shaman (described in the Society and Culture section later in this chapter), have honorifics attached to them as well.

When introducing themselves for the first time, goliaths always use the first name/honorific/family name construction, translating the honorific into the listener’s language if possible. Thereafter, they refer to themselves and each other by the honorific alone. Goliaths traveling among other races sometimes assign honorifics to their comrades rather than use their given names.

**Male Names:** Aukan, Eglath, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Lo-Kag, Maveith, Meavoi, Thotham, Vimak.

**Female Names:** Gae-Al, Kuori, Manneo, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Uthal, Vaunea.

**Honorifics:** Bearkiller, Dawncaller, Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Skywatcher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter.

**Family Names:** Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Vaimei-Laga.

**Adventurers:** Traditionally, the only goliaths to become adventurers are those exiled (voluntarily or other wise) from the goliath tribes high in the mountains. However, since some goliath tribes spend more time with “downlanders,” especially the dwarves, it’s becoming more common for a tribe to send a particularly competent goliath on a mission that aids the tribe or goliaths in general. Once they descend from their mountain homes, most goliaths find the lowlands fascinating, although they are generally on their guard against “downland tricksters.” The same wanderlust that keeps goliath tribes moving often keeps a lone goliath among humans for far longer than he originally intended.

## Goliath Racial Traits
**GOLIATH RACIAL TRAITS (PF)**

- **+2 Strength, +2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity:** Goliaths are strong and powerful, but not graceful. 
- **Medium Size:** Goliaths are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size, but see powerful-build below. 
- **Normal Speed:** Goliaths have a base speed is 30 feet. 
- **Giant Subtype:** A goliath has the giant subtype and is count as a humanoid (giant) for any effect related to race. 
- **Darkvision:** A goliath can see in the dark up to 60 feet. 
- **Mountaineer:** A Goliath has a +2 to climb and survival checks, thanks to their mountain heritage. 
- **Powerful Build:** Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for CMB, the goliath is treated as large if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be large when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a large creature without the -2 penalty (but the weapon size increases from light to one-handed or one-handed to two-handed). However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. If a spell or effect changes the goliath’s size to large or larger, the abilities of the spell or effect override the effects of powerful build. 
- **Languages:** Goliaths begin play speaking Common and Giant. Goliaths with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Dwarven, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran.

**GOLIATH RACIAL TRAITS (3.5)**

- **+4 Strength, –2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution:** Goliaths are massively muscled, but their bulk sometimes gets in the way when they’re trying to be nimble.
- Goliath base land speed is 30 feet.
- **Medium:** As Medium creatures, goliaths have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size. However, see the powerful build ability description below for more details.
- **Monstrous Humanoid:** As monstrous humanoids, goliaths are proficient with all simple weapons, but they have no proficiency with any armor or shield.
- **Powerful Build:** The physical stature of a goliath lets him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.
- **Mountain Movement:** Because goliaths practically live on the ledges and cliffs of the most forbidding mountains, they are particularly adept at negotiating mountain hazards. Goliaths can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. A goliath can engage in accelerated climbing (climbing half his speed as a move action) without taking the –5 penalty on the Climb check.
- **Acclimated:** Goliaths are automatically acclimated to life at high altitude. They don’t take the penalties for altitude described in the Mountain Travel section on page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Unlike other denizens of the mountains, goliaths don’t lose their acclimation to high altitude even if they spend a long time at a lower elevation.
- **+2 bonus on Sense Motive checks:** When speaking to one another, goliaths tend to augment their verbal communication with subtle body language. They are likewise able to “read” the unintentional body language of others.
- **Automatic Languages:** Common and Gol-Kaa. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Giant, Gnoll, Terran.
- **Favored Class:** Barbarian. A multiclass goliath’s barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty (see the XP for Multiclass Characters section, page 60 of the Player’s Handbook). The tribal life of the goliaths produces many barbarians. 
- **Level adjustment** +1.

## Psychology
**PSYCHOLOGY** 

Goliaths’ love of competition shapes a significant part of their worldview. A goliath instinctively keeps score about anything that’s a challenge, and casually mentions how he’s doing compared to his comrades and rivals. “That’s the third time I’ve fed you a potion when you were about to die,” a goliath might say, or, “It’s frustrating—my enemies have drawn first blood four times in a row today.” Those unfamiliar with goliath culture often find the need to keep score annoying, arrogant, or self-centered, but they’re placing more weight on such utterances than the goliaths themselves are. To a goliath, scorekeeping is as natural as breathing, and it isn’t meant to belittle or demean anyone.

While goliaths obviously love competing with and against each other, they face a more implacable foe. It’s invisible to even a close friend, but a goliath is always competing against himself. If a goliath slays a dragon, he won’t be satisfied with another dragon battle unless it’s against a larger, older dragon. When a goliath doesn’t measure up to his former achievements, he frequently becomes morose and withdrawn. Goliaths rarely speak of this inner struggle, and in fact many couldn’t articulate why they feel the way they do. But to a greater or lesser degree, all older goliaths are haunted by their need to compete against their younger selves.

Because tribes rely on the utmost effort of each member to survive in the forbidding mountains, goliaths are almost incapable of holding a grudge if they lose a fair competition. Goliaths compete as teams more often than they do as individuals, and an oft-repeated goliath maxim is “Today’s rival is tomorrow’s teammate.” Cheating in a competition—which for goliath covers most life activities—is so severely frowned upon that few goliaths will risk the social consequences of being caught. Many can’t conceive of cheating, instead redoubling their efforts or finding another game or sport to try.

Competition drives another mind-set common among goliaths: the notion that “everyone gets a turn.” Just as most goliath competitions are open to all, goliaths expect that everyone should have the chance to compete for power, prestige, and other goals. Goliaths who visit areas of lower elevation are often puzzled by the plight of serfs. “Why does the lord not give them the chance to become knights?” a goliath traveler might ask. Anyone in a situation that affords no hope of advancement will earn pity—and possibly more tangible assistance—from a goliath.

Competition among goliaths has a darker side as well. The convivial attitude among goliaths extends only to the able-bodied and the very young, who are nurtured for their potential. A goliath who can’t keep up with the rest of the tribe, either literally or in terms of production, is carried for only a few days before the tribe begins to shun the weak goliath. Sometimes the tribe will deny a weak goliath food and shelter, but it’s far more likely that the weak goliath will refuse food and shelter until he has proven his worth to the tribe or until he walks away in shame.

Another noteworthy aspect of goliath culture is that while tribes do a thorough job teaching the principles of friendly competition and fair play to their youngsters, not every tribe has exactly the same notion of fair play. A goliath who leaves one tribe and joins another is often torn between his upbringing and the unspoken precepts of his new tribe. This struggle often drives a goliath into exile if he is unable to reconcile his new tribe’s rules of fair play with the ones he grew up with.

**Roleplaying Application:** If you’re playing a goliath character, consider keeping a tally of the monsters he defeats and track events such as “most damage dealt in a single blow” or “biggest wound I survived.” Your character’s desire to outshine his previous accomplishments probably influences what adventures he undertakes as he goes up in level. Consider carefully what your character regards as fair play, especially with regard to situations that come with some frequency in the D&D game, such as the dilemma of a helpless foe or the notion of breaking the law to achieve a greater good.

## Goliath Life
**GOLIATH LIFE**

No two goliath tribes are alike. However, as with any race, tribes share enough common traits to make it possible to define a unique goliath culture. Your character, of course, can either embrace that culture or stand apart from it.

**LEISURE**

Sports and games are central to goliath life. Because they are hunter-gatherers, goliaths don’t have a lot of time for elaborate games that require extensive equipment. Competitions tend to be impromptu affairs that require little preparation, such as a foot race to the tree and back or a game of “keep away” played with a stuffed backpack.

Each tribe has its own games, but some (especially those described below) are widespread across goliath culture.

**Cliff-Climb:** Among the simplest of goliath games, a cliff-climb is simply a race to the top of a sufficiently tall cliff. There are only two unusual wrinkles: The race is sometimes to the top of the cliff and back to the ground, in which case a daring or foolish racer can sometimes win by intentionally falling to the finish line. Goliaths sometimes race in a best-of-three format, with the winner of each race having to accept a backpack full of rocks (and thus a penalty for being encumbered) as a handicap on future climbs.

**Participating in a Cliff-Climb:** Goliaths generally pick cliffs with Climb DCs of 15 or 20. Racers always use accelerated climbing (which bestows a –5 penalty on Climb checks made by nongoliaths). A goliath backpack full of rocks usually weighs 70 pounds, enough to give the average goliath a –3 check penalty due to encumbrance and reduce his speed from 30 feet to 20 feet. If winning a cliff-climb matters in the context of the ongoing adventure, the winning character earns experience as if it were an encounter of an EL equal to the cliff’s height in feet divided by 20.

**Stubborn Root:** This game is similar to the “king of the mountain” game played by children at lower altitudes. One goliath, known in the parlance of the game as the root, stations himself at a high point—often on a ridge or peak but sometimes atop a boulder or simply on a marked patch of ground. Then the other players (usually three to six) try to bull rush the root away from the high point or grapple the root and drag him away. Whoever does so is the new root, and the process repeats itself until all goliaths are tired out or everyone fails in multiple attempts to move the root. No specific number of consecutive failed attempts results in a winner; the goliaths’ sense of fair play determines when a particular root has won the game. It’s considered bad form to gang up on a root (using the aid another action or similar tactics) until everyone has failed to move the root singly, and it’s always bad form to attack the root outright. For his part, the root is obligated to forego the attack of opportunity that precedes the bull rush attempt, unless his opponents are ganging up on him, in which case the root can attack with nonlethal force.

**Participating in Stubborn Root**: PCs who win at stubborn root have overcome a challenge equal to the CRs of the two toughest opponents, as long as the game of stubborn root somehow has a bearing on the ongoing adventure.

**Wrestling:** Goliath wrestling matches start in a 20-foot-radius circle marked on flat ground, the center of which is clearly marked to indicate where matches will begin. To win a match, a wrestler must pin his opponent, then drag his pinned foe outside the circle while still maintaining the pin. Matches last for an indeterminate number of 1-minute rounds, with a referee counting out loud so the wrestlers know when their time is up. At the end of each round, the wrestlers break their clinch and have a few moments to rest before returning to the center of the circle.

**Participating in Wrestling:** Goliath wrestling matches follow the grappling rules outlined on page 156 of the Player’s Handbook, except that making an attack of opportunity against an opponent who’s trying to start a grapple is considered cheating. Damaging an opponent in a wrestling match is considered cheating unless both wrestlers agree before the match begins to allow nonlethal attacks. Defeating a foe in a wrestling match important to the adventure earns experience just as any other combat would.

**Goat-Ball:** This team game uses a furry, misshapen ball made out of stuffed goat-hide—the more lopsided and lumpy the ball, the better. Goat-ball requires a dozen to two dozen platforms (usually boulders, logs, and tree stumps) raised above the ground in a random pattern. Two teams of four clamber onto adjacent platforms, and a referee runs out to place the goat-ball on a platform somewhere roughly equidistant from the two teams. The teams then leap from platform to platform, each trying to be the first to reach the ball.

Whichever team reaches the ball first is on offense. When a team is on offense, it tries to complete three consecutive passes involving teammates on four different platforms (in other words, you can’t just pass it back and forth three times; you have to leap from platform to platform). If the team on offense completes three passes, whoever has the ball can try to hit an opponent with the thrown ball. The team on defense tries to intercept the ball and push its opponents off the platforms.

A player who falls off a platform (either because he missed a jump or because an opponent pushed him off) or gets hit by a ball is “out” and can’t participate until possession changes and the two teams trade offensive and defensive roles. Whenever the ball hits the ground (including when the player holding the ball touches the ground), possession changes—unless the ball hits the ground after a successful throw at an opponent, in which case the offense keeps the ball. A team wins if all its opponents have been knocked out of the game at the same time.

**Participating in Goat-Ball:** The jumping and bull rush aspects of goat-ball use the usual D&D rules. Throwing a ball at an opponent is a ranged touch attack, and every nongoliath player takes a –4 penalty for nonproficiency because it’s almost impossible to get used to the misshapen goat-ball. Throwing a ball to an ally is likewise a ranged attack, except that Dexterity bonuses and penalties are reversed when calculating the target’s AC (in other words, it’s easier to throw the ball to a dexterous target, and harder to get a clumsy teammate to catch it). To attempt an interception, you must be within 5 feet of the ball’s path and get a better result on your ranged attack roll than the thrower got on his ranged attack roll. Also, because the players aren’t fighting, they can share the same platform (and often the same square) without penalty. Winning a game of goat-ball is a challenge equal to the combined CRs of the losing team members, as long as success in the game is somehow relevant to the larger adventure.

**Drink-and-Tell:** A decidedly nonathletic contest, the game of drink-and-tell involves participants and spectators alike sitting in a circle. One participant produces a massive flagon of specially brewed mead, drinks from it, and then tells a tale. Depending on how entertaining the tale is, he’ll either hear cheers from the rest of the circle (meaning the participant is still in the game) or jeers (meaning the participant is now out of the competition but remains a spectator). Then the flagon is passed clockwise around the circle; spectators merely pass it to their left, but participants drink from it and offer a tale of their own. The flagon keeps going around the circle until it’s either empty or only one participant remains. If drink-and-tell ends with an empty flagon, everyone who hasn’t been knocked out can claim a shared victory.

**Participating in Drink-and-Tell:** It generally takes a successful DC 15 Perform (comedy) or Perform (oratory) check to earn the cheers of the circle. Unfortunately, the mead brewed for drink-and-tell, though tasty, is known to slur speech more than most alcohol, making success in later rounds more difficult. Drink-and-tell mead is technically an ingested poison (DC 14 Fort save; 1d3 Cha/1d3 Cha), although it only induces drowsiness and reduces speech to a slurred gibberish. It isn’t otherwise dangerous.

**ARTS AND CRAFTS**

Goliaths are inherently competitive, but most understand that art can’t always be measured and doesn’t have a “winner.” Goliaths decorate their weapons, tents, and what little clothing they wear with abstract designs, many featuring jagged, parallel lines and symbols that have astronomical significance (tracings of constellations, moon-and-sun designs, and so on). A few goliath painters practice representational art, but even they intentionally favor stick-figure designs that capture the essence of the subject, not its literal reality. “I could look at a running warrior anytime I like,” reasons the goliath artist. “Why would I try to reproduce his every feature on the cave wall?” For a goliath artist, the whole purpose of art is to be decorative and show the viewer something he can’t see in the real world.

Goliath tribes have an extensive oral tradition of stories, myths, legends, and songs. Almost every tribe has one or more dawncallers (see Chapter 5: Prestige Classes), an honorific given to bards who act as sentries and lorekeepers for the tribe. What free time isn’t spent engaged in games and sports is spent listening to tales around the campfire—although they’re mostly tales of games and sports, of course. Within the last decade or two, some tribes have started using the Dwarven alphabet to phonetically spell out words in the goliath language of Gol-Kaa. The first goliath scribes are enthusiastic, so it’s not uncommon to find a mountain cave where an entire goliath epic has been painted on the walls, ceiling, and floor.

Goliath crafts are hampered by the paucity of raw materials above the tree line. As nomads, they don’t mine metals or grow crops, so smithing and cloth weaving are almost unheard of. Many goliaths excel at flintknapping, the craft of making arrowheads, knives, spear points, and other tools from flint found near riverbeds. Goliaths are also adept at tanning animal hides and stitching them together into everything from armor to massive tents. Some goliath tribes with a regular migration pattern stay in one place long enough to build kilns there, so they have potters—and ceramic vessels to trade with other tribes. Most goliaths rely on woven baskets to carry things, though, and those with the honorific of Threadtwister spend much of their time crafting baskets and hempen rope by hand.

Because most goliaths can’t make their own metal goods or jewelry, they tend to hold in high esteem those who can do so. Goliaths are eager to trade their furs and meat for the wonders created by dwarf and gnome artisans.

**Roleplaying Application:** Goliaths are fascinated with anything outside the scope of their nomadic mountain existence, so most goliath PCs will be eager to travel and see things they’ve never seen before. Because oral folklore is so important to goliaths, they often compare their situations to those of legendary heroes. Some sample tales of goliath heroes are found in the History and Folklore section later in this chapter, but you can certainly invent other goliath folklore that your character would know. Because jewelry is rare among goliaths, you’ll most likely gravitate to jewelry when you find treasure.

**TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC**

Goliaths aren’t primitive, but they are nomadic, which puts some significant restraints on the technology they use in daily life. In general, goliaths make for themselves only what they can carry with them—including the tools necessary for the creation to occur. Few goliaths are blacksmiths, for example, because you can’t take a forge with you on a mountain trail. Still, goliaths have a basic understanding of how metallurgy works, and they are canny buyers of metal goods from the races they trade with—mostly dwarves and giants.

Because goliaths are subsistence hunter-gatherers, they excel at tanning, leatherwork, flintknapping, and bonecarving. For a goliath tribe to survive a cold mountain winter, it must make use of every resource at its disposal. That means using every part of a game animal, from the sinews to the hide and bones.

Without magic, the goliaths’ nomadic lifestyle would leave them on the edge of starvation and social collapse. Goliath spellcasters, especially the omnipresent druids, are instrumental in finding food, healing the sick and injured, and warding the camp against the worst of the elements.

**GOLIATHS AT WAR**

Goliaths are not generally warlike. When pressed by a formidable foe, they’re more likely to pack up and leave for safer territory than stay and fight. Goliaths are definitely not cowardly, but they regard each fellow goliath who falls in combat as a teammate lost forever, and they’re acutely aware of how battle losses make life harder for the surviving members of the tribe.

Still, war is sometimes the only realistic option. A goliath tribe might be unable to outrun or outfox its enemies, or part of the tribe might be taken captive. Goliaths regard imprisonment and slavery as especially heinous crimes, so in these cases the entire tribe goes to war, treating battle as the most important game of all.

With the exception of infants and small children, all goliaths are capable warriors (otherwise they wouldn’t remain with the tribe). A tribe can transform itself into an effective warband by simply handing out weapons and armor, choosing war-captains, and marching out to meet their foes. Goliaths favor leather and hide armors, and Large two-handed weapons that maximize their immense strength. Because goliaths come from a culture of hunters, they’re adept at using camouflage and terrain to their advantage, and they prefer to fight guerrilla-style rather than meet on an agreed upon battlefield.

The goliath tendency toward competitiveness and fair play expresses itself on the battlefield as well. Goliaths are inveterate scorekeepers, tallying the number of foes they’ve vanquished in battle. When they fight, goliaths seek to prove their superiority in all facets of warfare. “It’s not enough to win a battle,” thinks a typical goliath. “You should win in a way that shows your opponent what a good soldier you are.” Winning by sheer numbers or through attrition is regarded as no victory at all. When two goliath tribes war against each other, the larger tribe almost always holds back troops so it won’t win through numerical superiority.

Goliaths extend principles of fair play to the battlefield, but they aren’t foolish enough to believe that their enemies are playing by the same rules (unless the enemies are also goliaths, of course). Striking from ambush is acceptable to most goliaths, because getting into such a favorable position is no easy task. On the other hand, most goliaths regard finishing off a fallen foe, taking hostages, and attacking civilians as distasteful or “cheating.”

Some goliaths relish the competitive nature of combat so much that if they’re winning too handily, they handicap themselves to restore a semblance of fairness to a fight. If a goliath sunders an enemy’s weapon with his first blow, he might voluntarily cast away his own weapon and commence grappling. Goliaths aren’t stupid, however—they only engage in such a “fair play” fight if they have a reasonable expectation of winning anyway, or if circumstances are such that the loser of the battle is likely to survive.

**Roleplaying Application:** If a fight is going particularly well for your goliath character, consider handicapping yourself, or at least mention to the other characters that you’re sorely tempted to do so. Keep track of your kills, and engage your fellow characters in friendly competitions or low-stakes wagers, even as combat swirls around you.

## Society and Culture
**SOCIETY AND CULTURE**

The most pervasive aspect of goliath culture is the sense of congenial competitiveness that permeates almost every action a goliath undertakes. Goliaths are always jockeying for position within their tribes and will turn even the most mundane task into a race, wager, or other competition. Additionally, the social pressure to be a “good sport” is almost overpowering—cheaters and poor losers find themselves shunned by the tribe. Goliaths compete almost without thinking about it. A team of hunters might find themselves sprinting toward a mountain peak, but none of them announced a race and none of them could say who started running first.

Goliath tribes tend to be generous and hospitable to visitors, as long as those visitors don’t pose a threat. In yet another indication of the race’s competitive nature, a goliath tribe will provide as much food and entertainment as possible for a visitor, hoping that tales of the tribe’s excellence will spread. This generous tendency is tempered by the fact that, as huntergatherers, goliath tribes don’t have much in the way of traditional wealth, and only when a hunt goes particularly well do they have a surplus of food.

**TRIBAL STRUCTURE**

Between forty and sixty goliaths—three to five extended families—comprise a typical tribe. Most goliaths stay members of the same tribe for life. Tribes that grow too large and unwieldy sometimes split into two or three smaller tribes, and tribes that fall on hard times and become too small to survive on their own might merge with more stable tribes. However, such changes are rare; the lorekeepers of most goliath tribes can trace their tribal history back a dozen generations or more.

Most goliaths identify far more strongly with their tribe than they do with their family. Family members generally share a sleeping tent and regard each other as particularly close companions, but the bonds between them aren’t as strong as they would be in a typical human society. The tribe as a whole raises its young, so children don’t form strong parental bonds. Marriages and remarriages are frequent among goliaths, so families tend to be rather fluid.

**Key Tribal Members**

Though tribe members are generally considered equals, several key roles are important to every goliath tribe.

Chieftain: The tribal chieftain is the primary authority figure for a tribe, but by no means the only source of power within a tribe. The chieftain leads the tribe by acclamation when the former chief steps down (or is forced out). He is responsible for setting the path of the tribe, leading it to food-rich regions, and deciding when to move on once hunting is scarce. Each day, the chieftain selects a number of captains (“kathunae” in Gol-Kaa) and gives each of them a task for the day, such as hunting, gathering raw materials, cooking, or scouting new terrain. Wise chiefs assign at least two captains to each task, because then the two teams compete against one another and get more done.

**Captain:** The chieftain chooses captains each morning after breakfast, and most chieftains give each adult goliath an occasional turn as captain so everyone has leadership experience. Each captain gets a broad outline of the day’s task from the chieftain. Then the captains take turns picking from the adult population of the tribe to form work teams, and the day’s work begins. Captains generally have great discretion in how they accomplish the assigned task—the chieftain, and by extension the tribe, wants results, not a specific set of criteria followed to the letter. Most captains relish the competitive aspect of leading a team and outperforming the other teams assigned similar tasks that day. Captains have almost absolute authority when directing their teams, but they’re loath to throw their weight around too much; any resentment they foster might show up in tomorrow’s captain.

**Skywatcher:** Regardless of whether they’re pantheist or animist goliaths (described in the Religion section later in this chapter), most tribes have a druid with the honorific of Skywatcher who preaches against the needless slaughter of game and overharvesting of resources such as firewood and edible plants. The chieftain often holds the skywatcher out of team selection, letting him roam as he pleases. Sky watchers spend most of their time scouting out new territory, monitoring the hunting and gathering teams, and preparing various seasonal festivals and rituals.

**Dawncaller:** Most goliath tribes have four to six members with the Dawncaller honorific. Dawncallers are bards who act as night sentries, patrolling the perimeter of the goliath camp at night and sounding the alarm if danger is nearby. Shortly before dawn, they sing anthems of bravery and virtue to awaken the rest of the tribe. During the day, whatever teams remain in camp pick dawncallers last, then give them light duty so they can sleep during the day and be alert at night.

**Adjudicator:** Adjudicators act as referees for the many games that comprise goliath leisure time, and they also settle disputes among members of the tribe. Unless the matter is particularly urgent, adjudicators hear disputes after the evening meal, listening to each party in the dispute tell his tale. The adjudicator then renders a decision. Any goliath can appeal an adjudicator’s decision to the chieftain, but the chieftain can’t overrule an adjudicator without taking the Adjudicator honorific away, so most chiefs are reluctant to do so. If an adjudicator can’t determine who is in the wrong in a particular dispute, he often settles the matter with a contest of some kind—often a contest that relates to the matter at hand. For example, if two goliaths each claim ownership of a particular ram, an adjudicator might award the ram to whichever goliath can carry it farther before collapsing under its weight.

**Tent-Mother:** The position of tent-mother is unusual because it’s the only aspect of goliath society that is gender-specific. The tent-mother is responsible for the care of the

tribe’s infants and toddlers. She’s selected as a captain almost every morning, and she picks her own assistants. Goliath females have the ability to nurse multiple babies, so the tentmother is often able to act as wet nurse for the entire tribe. No child can be picked for a task by a captain until the tent-mother deems him old enough (which often happens around ten years of age and involves an important rite of passage). Goliath folk tales abound of children who chafe under the rule of a tentmother but suffer misfortune when they run away from the tribe and are eventually rescued by a team led by the very same tent-mother. The chieftain chooses the tent-mother and can take the honorific away, although this form of punishment rarely occurs.

**Lamenter:** A goliath tribe’s lamenter has a single job: identify when a particular goliath isn’t being a productive member of the tribe. If a goliath is obviously too old or too ill to survive the rigors of mountain life without assistance, the lamenter prepares a long chant or dirge that commemorates the goliath’s achievements throughout life. At the conclusion of the dirge, the entire tribe moans and wails as the old or sick goliath walks away from the camp, never to return. The lamenter does likewise with goliaths who die suddenly or fall in battle, and then buries them under a simple cairn. A good lamenter talks with a goliath perceived as weak before preparing a lament, and sometimes a heart-to-heart talk with a lamenter is sufficient to get a goliath back on his feet and producing. Lamenters generally consult with the chieftain before preparing a lament and defer to the chieftain’s judgment if it’s more merciful (for example, the tribe is moving to a lower, warmer elevation where an infirm goliath will be less of a burden).

**Roleplaying Application:** What role did your goliath character play in the tribal hierarchy before he became an adventurer? Goliath tribes are essentially meritocracies, so it’s not inconceivable that even a young goliath could have an important position within the tribe. What were the other members of the tribe (especially the chieftain and your character’s tent-mother) like?

**Power Struggles**

Because he’s responsible for bringing the tribe to food and water, a foolish or otherwise ineffective chieftain puts the whole tribe at risk. When a chieftain makes bad decisions or is simply unlucky too often, challengers to his authority might develop.

In most tribes, a would-be chieftain can take over a tribe by defeating the existing chieftain at each of three contests. The challenger chooses the first contest, the existing chieftain chooses the second, and the third is a traditional contest. It’s an expected part of the power struggle that chieftain and challenger each choose contests that reward their particular skills and abilities, but a contest that’s obviously impossible for one contestant isn’t a contest at all and will earn a shunning from the tribe (see Shunning later in this chapter). The challenger must win all three contests to become the new chieftain. When that happens, the former chieftain often, but not always, leaves the tribe. For safety reasons, members of the tribe feel strong social pressure against challenging a chieftain in the middle of a crisis or repeatedly challenging a chieftain.

If a chieftain voluntarily retires or dies suddenly, a similar set of contests among aspiring chieftains determines the new chieftain. Unlike with a challenge to a sitting chieftain, however, a candidate need only win a plurality of the contests to become the next chieftain.

Unlike in many human societies, most goliaths don’t seek power for its own sake, and most regard being chieftain as a grave responsibility, not as something to aspire to. Goliaths love competition, after all, and the chieftain doesn’t get to participate in many of the daily contests and games that make up goliath life.

More primitive goliath tribes have only one simple rule for succession: If you beat up the old chieftain, you become the new chieftain.

**Roleplaying Application:** How does your goliath character feel about your current or former chieftain? Does he have interest in leading a tribe himself? If so, does he have a plan to make this happen? Has he ever taken part in a power struggle for chieftain? If so, what was the result?

**LAWS AND JUSTICE**

Because goliaths don’t have a written legal code, it’s hard to make generalizations about goliath law. In general, only one law matters: Obey the chieftain, and by extension, the captains he chooses.

The system of punishment for goliaths is likewise less structured than it is in many other societies. Because goliaths are nomadic, imprisonment isn’t an option, and fines rarely work in a society where many goods are owned jointly by the tribe. Goliaths who disobey the chieftain or are caught stealing, cheating, or committing other crimes are often simply beaten. Goliaths have a healthy respect for pain as a motivator. Their other primary punishment is social: To a greater or lesser degree, the rest of the tribe shuns the criminal.

**Shunning**

When a goliath is completely shunned, the rest of the tribe pretends that the criminal doesn’t exist. The criminal isn’t picked for teams, can’t participate in sports and games, and isn’t provided food and shelter by the tribe. For the duration of the shunning (known as “volok-thea” in Gol-Kaa), the goliath must survive on his own.

A less severe form of shunning known as “volok-kanu” exists for minor crimes. A criminal suffering a period of half-shunning is treated poorly by the rest of the tribe. The criminal is picked last by captains, given particularly loathsome work assignments, and receives only leftover food and water. These half-shunned goliaths are allowed to participate in contests and games only if their presence is necessary for some reason, and opponents often gang up on the criminal rather than try to win themselves.

Goliaths who assist a shunned goliath face shunning themselves, because breaking the solidarity of a shunning is an attack on the very foundation of goliath society.

What is remarkable to a nongoliath who witnesses a goliath shunning is how everyone acts in concert without anyone saying, “We’re going to shun Thotham completely for three days, then half-shun him for four more.” Goliaths communicate the degree of shunning by slight shifts in their body language, and many contend that they “just know” how long a shunning should last.

**Roleplaying Application:** Goliaths who sneak off on adventures might face shunning from a disapproving tribe when they return. Rebellious young goliaths often learn the traits of self-sufficiency and independence—useful in a future career as an adventurer—when they spend a lot of time being shunned for minor infractions. Has your goliath character been shunned by his tribe? If so, for what infraction? How does he feel about this? Even when away from his tribe, does he use shunning to convey his disapproval of others’ actions? How does he explain this behavior to his companions?

**Exiles**

Being exiled from the tribe is both the worst punishment an adjudicator can mete out, and the ultimate fate of all goliaths who don’t die in battle or mishap. Exiles get a new honorific from the chieftain reflecting their changed status; then they pack their personal items into a backpack, say goodbye to friends and family, and walk away from the tribe, never to return. If a goliath is exiled due to age or debilitating injury, the lamenter performs a lament as the exile leaves. However, if exile is a punishment handed down by an adjudicator, no lament is performed, and the exiled goliath is shunned until he walks away.

Most chiefs and lamenters interpret rather inflexibly the maxim that every goliath must always contribute to the good of the tribe. Even a goliath who will probably recover from an injury—a goliath with a badly broken leg, for example—is left behind when a tribe moves on. Goliath society is also hardly immune to the petty jealousies and power struggles that make politically motivated exiles a reality. Goliaths exiled while young often descend to areas of lower elevation and take up a nomadic, competitive lifestyle: that of the wandering adventurer. While some stubborn goliaths are forced into exile, it’s much more common for a goliath who feels his skills slipping to choose exile voluntarily rather than force the tribe into the awkward position of exiling him. Some goliaths live as solitary hermits for months or years after exile. But without the support and protection of the tribe, all exiles eventually succumb to the rigors and dangers of mountain life.

**Roleplaying Application:** Most goliath PCs are exiles—voluntary or involuntary—from their tribes. Being exiled from the tribe is a natural stepping-stone to becoming a goliath adventurer. Your character is already nomadic; now he just has to make it on his own. Many goliaths who’ve been exiled surround themselves with close friends—creating a makeshift “tribe” out of their fellow adventurers. Is your goliath character an exile? If so, what was the reason for his exile? How does he feel about his former tribe? How does this exile affect his interactions with other goliaths?

## Nature Worship
**NATURE WORSHIP**

For millennia, goliaths have been nature worshipers who relied on druids to attend to their spiritual needs. While deities figure prominently in goliath folklore and culture, actual clerics have been exceedingly rare. Recently, however, clerics worshiping the five-member goliath pantheon have been evangelizing among the goliath tribes, and the connection between folklore and daily worship is winning them converts. Goliath druids have responded to this effort with everything from outright hostility to enthusiastic support, but in most cases the arrival of a new religion (while the folklore and rites are old, active worship is new) has ushered in an era of competition for the spiritual lives of each goliath tribe. Goliath druids are just as competitive as any other goliaths, after all.

When druids handle a tribe’s religious needs, the tribe’s skywatcher often leads prayers to Kavaki or the mountains themselves. Each equinox and solstice has its own druidic festival, and druidic blessings accompany each birth and death. A portion of each meal is left on a simple stone altar under the open sky as a sacrifice to preserve nature’s bounty.

In tribes without clerics, druids are responsible for much of the healing required by the tribe, and high-level rangers often help a little. This obligation takes up more of the druids’ time and energy, so the druids don’t roam as far from camp as they do if the tribe also has clerics. Because they wield great power within such a tribe, druids wind up influencing the alignment of other tribe members. A tribe with a neutral evil druid, for example, will gradually develop a strong “every tribe for itself” attitude and become particularly ruthless in competitions. A lawful neutral druid often finds that his tribe follows a more regular migration pattern and tends to repeatedly choose the same captains for the same tasks.

## Pantheistic Religion
**PANTHEISTIC RELIGION**

Pantheist goliath clerics show reverence for the five deities that comprise the goliath pantheon as a unit, but they pick one deity as their favorite. A cleric chooses from among one deity’s domains and wears that deity’s holy symbol. Still, those clerics are comfortable leading rites and prayers to any of the five deities, and clerics of the different deities display no animosity (and, unusual for goliaths, no competition) toward one another. A goliath cleric appeals to Kavaki for protective magic, Theleya for healing, and Vanua for a curse, for example.

With the DM’s permission, a character can instead worship the goliath pantheon as a single unit. Worshiping a pantheon in this fashion allows a cleric to pick from any of the deities’ offered domains, rather than picking one deity as a favorite. The details of following this pattern of worship are described more fully in Complete Divine.

A sixth goliath deity, Kuliak, is venerated strictly for burial rites and necromancy spells. Outside these contexts, the goliaths do not generally speak of her.

**KAVAKI, THE RAM-LORD**

Greater Deity (Neutral)

Kavaki is the creator and guardian of the goliaths, guiding them safely from alpine meadow to snowy mountain peak and back again. He bids his followers to honor goliath heritage, to compete fiercely, and to act for the good of the tribe in all things. Cave paintings often depict him as a massively muscled goliath with curled ram horns emerging from his head.

**Portfolio:** Goliaths, competition.

**Domains:** Protection, Strength, Travel, War.

**Cleric Training:** Because Kavaki is the chief of all chieftains, clerics of the goliath pantheon learn about him from their tribal chieftain. Every morning, the chieftain offers a prayer to Kavaki, often adding a brief homily or tale of Kavaki protecting the goliath people.

**Quests:** Whenever the welfare of one or more goliath tribes is at stake, Kavaki wants a cleric there. Kavaki’s agents often send brave goliaths to rescue tribes captured by giants or otherwise endangered.

**Prayers:** Worshipers of Kavaki often use comparisons to venerate their deity or make a rhetorical point. For example, a prayer of praise might begin “Kavaki, you are taller than the mountains and more constant than the stars themselves.”

**Shrines:** A simple wooden shrine to Kavaki stands within sight of the main campfire in a goliath camp. A ram skull often rests atop it. The goliaths design shrines to Kavaki to be portable when disassembled, but particularly good mountain campsites have more permanent, stationary shrines.

**Rites:** Kavaki is called upon in rites that honor a new chieftain, bestow a new honorific on a goliath, or bless a new campsite. The most common rites involving Kavaki are the ceremonies after particularly important games or competitions. Speaking on behalf of Kavaki, the ceremony leader compares the victors favorably to their opponents and exhorts all to strive even harder next time.

**Herald and Allies:** The herald of Kavaki is a titan with 20 Hit Dice that looks like a ram-headed goliath. His allies are hound archons, leonal guardinals, and hound archon heroes. (See the Deity Description Format sidebar on page 17 for further information about heralds and allies.)

**Favored Weapon:** Greatclub.

**KULIAK, THE DEAD GODDESS**

Demigod (Neutral)

When they speak of her at all, clerics of the goliath pantheon say that Kuliak was once the deity of mountain springs, but the other deities spurned her when she overslept and forgot to lead the goliath tribes to water. Now Kuliak is venerated only when a goliath dies. Additionally, exiled goliaths find comfort in Kuliak’s tale, and many worship her rather than the rest of the goliath pantheon. Kuliak looks like a rail-thin, starving goliath.

**Portfolio:** The dead, exiles.

**Domains:** Death, Magic, Travel, Water.

**Cleric Training:** Except as part of a burial rite, it’s considered bad luck for nonexiled goliaths to even mention Kuliak’s name. Clerics of the goliath pantheon memorize the words to the rite and try not to think about Kuliak after that. But unlike the other deities that comprise the goliath pantheon, Kuliak is served by exiled goliath clerics who worship her and her alone. Because they are so widely scattered, her clerics have few specific teachings to impart and are eager for lore about their goddess.

**Quests:** The dead occupy relatively little of Kuliak’s attention, so she acts as a shepherd for the goliath exiles. If exiles are endangered, her followers spare no effort to rescue them and keep them safe.

**Prayers:** Kuliak’s prayers are often sung, and even if spoken they have a singsong quality. They have no regularity in meter or theme, because worshiping Kuliak is such an individual pursuit.

**Shrines:** Kuliak has no formal shrines, but her worshipers sometimes gather at the graves of goliaths who died particularly heroic deaths.

**Rites:** As a counterpoint to the shunning that precedes most decisions to exile a tribe member, Kuliak offers a brief “rite of welcoming,” in which someone is embraced three times when he or she enters a home or joins a group.

**Herald and Allies:** Kuliak’s herald is an 18th-level goliath ghost barbarian. Her allies are Medium, Large, and Huge water elementals.

**Favored Weapon:** Morningstar.

**MANETHAK, THE WISE HUNTER**

Intermediate Deity (Neutral)

His clerics say that Manethak guides goliaths to the best game, although he teaches that “Each goliath must throw the spear himself.” Manethak’s followers contend that the search for game is the most important part of the hunt, and that the best hunter is the one who knows the most about his prey. When the hunt is over, Manethak’s followers are the first to share what they’ve learned around the campfire. Manethak looks like an elderly goliath, but he is always depicted hunting, leaping, or performing some other action that leaves no doubt he’s still spry.

**Portfolio:** Hunting, lore.

**Domains:** Animal, Knowledge, Luck.

**Cleric Training:** Many goliath hunters pray to Manethak, of course, but goliaths who take care to explain to others what they’ve learned on the hunt—the nuances of an elk’s tracks or the feeding patterns of a cave bear—have taken Manethak’s lessons to heart. Thus young clerics of the goliath pantheon practice aptitude as both hunters and teachers.

**Quests:** When a particularly dangerous monster threatens goliaths, Manethak often arranges for a hunting quest to slay it. Manethak is also eager to hunt down lost lore of the goliaths and artifacts of bygone ages.

**Prayers:** Prayers to Manethak take the form of a request or goal, followed by the means to achieve it. For example, a prayer said before butchering a carcass begins “May Manethak bless this animal for the good of the tribe. May he bless it as we separate flesh from bone, hide from meat.”

**Shrines:** A flat rock where game is butchered serves as Manethak’s shrine. Because food preparation is a messy job, the shrine usually isn’t decorated. Rites: Manethak’s most well-known rite is the “ritual of the hunt,” which concludes with the hunters briefly mimicking the movements and actions of their prey.

**Herald and Allies:** Manethak’s herald is an old silver dragon with 28 Hit Dice. His allies are barghests, greater barghests, and elder arrowhawks.

**Favored Weapon:** Spear.

**NAKI-UTHAI, THE BRAVE CLIMBER**

Lesser Deity (Neutral)

Whenever goliaths reach a summit, pass, or high point safely, they offer thanks to Naki-Uthai, paragon of bravery and deity of climbing. Naki-Uthai urges his followers to push themselves to the limit and fear no great height or narrow ledge. Naki-Uthai is also known for having arms that hang down to the ground—all the better for reaching high handholds. Goliaths consider it heretical to depict Naki-Uthai descending rather than ascending.

**Portfolio:** Mountains, climbing, bravery. Domains: Earth, Strength, Sun.

**Cleric Training:** Would-be clerics of the goliath pantheon learn about Naki-Uthai during an extended climbing expedition. As they scale sheer cliffs and inch their way along narrow ledges, the goliaths are expected to pray to Naki-Uthai and meditate on the value of bravery.

**Quests:** When something wonderful is rumored to lie just beyond the mountains or at the top of a particular peak, Naki-Uthai is the first to encourage an expedition there. Finding new lands for a goliath tribe and slaying a dragon that lairs on a mountain summit are typical quests associated with Naki-Uthai.

**Prayers:** Naki-Uthai’s prayers are often in verse. Frequently, the first line or two is whispered, with each successive line delivered at greater volume until the prayer ends with a shout.

**Shrines:** By tradition, the first goliath to climb a mountain then builds a cairn or other marker that claims the peak for Naki-Uthai. Fierce mountain weather often destroys these shrines, so goliaths who reach a peak and don’t find a shrine often make a pile of rocks just to be sure Naki-Uthai is represented on the mountain.

**Rites:** Naki-Uthai has ceremonies for starting a journey and reaching a mountain peak—and by extension, any geographical goal. He also has a call-and-response liturgy known as the “exhortation of bravery” that almost every goliath knows by heart.

**Herald and Allies:** Naki-Uthai’s herald is a 7th-level storm giant barbarian. His allies are Medium, Large, and Huge earth elementals.

**Favored Weapon:** Heavy pick.

**THELEYA, THE FERTILE ONE**

Intermediate Deity (Neutral)

The goliath deity of fertility and growth, Theleya is given credit whenever a healthy baby is born or a particularly rich patch of berries is found. Theleya’s clerics are often a tribe’s best healers, midwives, and tent-mothers. Theleya is generally depicted as a pregnant goliath holding a gourd-rattle full of seeds.

**Portfolio:** Fertility, growth. Domains: Healing, Magic, Plant.

**Cleric Training:** Tent-mothers are particularly fond of Theleya, so they pass along much of her lore to clerics in training. A goliath who takes ranks in the Heal, Profession (herbalist), or Knowledge (nature) skill probably learned about these skills in the context of Theleya’s teachings.

**Quests:** Anything that endangers the fragile ecosystem that the goliaths rely on is of paramount concern to Theleya. She often bids adventurers to halt large-scale mining, overharvesting of timber, and the encroachment of civilization into goliath migration paths.

**Prayers:** Prayers to Theleya involve more rhythmic breathing than complete sentences. After several cleansing breaths, someone praying might simply say, “Intercede...” or “Bless...”

**Shrines:** The tent-mother often keeps a small shrine to Theleya—often a wood-and-hide box full of seeds and dried berries.

**Rites:** Theleya probably has as many rites as the rest of the goliath pantheon put together. Her ceremonies honor the birth of a new goliath, bless each meal before it’s consumed, and mark the passing of the seasons.

**Herald and Allies:** Thelaya’s herald is a 20th-level goliath cleric. Her allies are bralani eladrins, couatls, and planetars.

**Favored Weapon:** Sickle.

**VANUA, THE HARBINGER OF WOE**

Lesser Deity (Neutral)

It is said that Vanua is behind every avalanche, hidden crevasse, and sudden winter storm. Vanua is also responsible for countless pranks against deity and mortal alike. Stories of Vanua’s schemes are common in goliath folklore. While Vanua has a cruel, capricious streak, he’s not evil. His clerics contend that only through misfortune and hardship will the goliath people grow stronger. Vanua appears as a pale white goliath with fiery eyes.

**Portfolio:** Natural disasters, misfortune.

**Domains:** Destruction, Fire, Trickery.

**Cleric Training:** Almost every goliath child is warned that if he doesn’t behave, Vanua will steal him away or make the rock beneath his feet crumble when he’s climbing. Vanua is so embedded in goliath folklore that little formal training is necessary to understand his role in the pantheon.

**Quests:** Vanua likes nothing better than to separate the weak from the strong, so his agents sometimes set up schemes that put goliaths in harm’s way or create divisions within a healthy tribe.

**Prayers:** Vanua’s prayers include a number of riddles and question-and-answer flourishes, such as “Who is the flutter in the elder’s heart? Vanua!”

**Shrines:** Vanua’s shrine is the goliath camp’s main campfire. Sacrifices are simply thrown in the fire to burn.

**Rites:** Vanua has few rites, other than some brief ceremonies intended to bring misfortune to a spurned lover or other rival.

**Herald and Allies:** Vanua’s herald is an efreeti with 30 Hit Dice. His allies are Medium, Large, and Huge fire elementals.

**Favored Weapon:** Heavy flail.

## History and Folklore
**HISTORY AND FOLKLORE**

Because they rarely travel beyond their mountain migrations, goliaths have had little influence on the events of the wider world—thus far. Nonetheless, when goliaths tell tales of their own history, they are as full of great heroes, perfidious villains, and epic struggles as the histories of other races.

The following events and people are central to the goliaths’ oral tradition. Every goliath who grew up in a goliath tribe has heard them, but these stories are almost unheard of in the outside world.

Each bit of goliath history detailed below has an associated adventure hook that describes a possible way for the event to be worked into an ongoing campaign.

**The Path into Icydark**

Decades ago, a well-organized band of frost giants under the leadership of Jarl Raurekk roamed the mountains, hiring every able-bodied goliath they could find to build an ice fortress called Haladath. The giants promised the goliaths payment in gold, armor, and weapons. But when Haladath was ready, Raurekk’s soldiers shackled the goliaths together and began marching them north through the mountains to a land where night conquered day. Many goliaths died along the way due to starvation, the bitter cold, or the cruelty of their captors. Some were forced to eat the corpses of the fallen to survive. None returned from the frozen north. Ever since, many goliath tribes honor their memory with a mournful chant to Kavaki delivered while the tribe faces north and weeps.

No one knows why Raurekk marched the goliaths north, nor their ultimate destination. A few goliath escapees and frost giant deserters told tales of the harrowing journey, but they didn’t know the answers to several perplexing questions: Why did Raurekk build a fortress he never used? What led him into the darkness of the northern mountains? Why did he betray and imprison the goliaths?

**Adventure Hook:** The descendants and relatives of the missing goliaths want adventurers willing to walk the Path into Icydark and return their family members to them. Unfortunately, such an endeavor involves more than simply forming an expedition to the north. A cabal of undead controls Haladath now, and the few survivors of the Path into Icydark are widely scattered among goliath tribes and frost giant steadings. The mountains of the far north feature an array of hazards both natural and malevolent that have so far kept anyone from mounting a serious rescue effort.

**Mualio Lonehunter**

Perhaps the most famous goliath of all is Mualio Lonehunter, a goliath ranger with a peerless gift for stalking the most elusive game. For centuries, goliaths have told tales of Mualio Lonehunter around the campfire. One tale describes how starving goliaths were about to succumb to hunger when Mualio crept into their camp with a gutted elk over each shoulder. Mualio’s gift would have remained anonymous if not for a goliath toddler who peeked out from her tent at the right moment. Other stories speak of Mualio fighting the dark elves with his dwarf allies deep underground, visiting the cities of the humans, or searching unceasingly for an albino dire elk said to possess great intelligence and a measure of magic power. Some say Mualio is a demigod and a child of Kavaki himself, while others say he wears a crown made of antlers that keeps him forever young.

**Adventure Hook:** The characters meet an older goliath with powerful magic weapons and consummate stealth and tracking prowess. He reveals the secret that has ruled his life: He is the twenty-third goliath to call himself Mualio Lonehunter—each previous holder of the name chose a successor when he grewtoo old to hunt well. Now, the current Mualio isn’t strong enough to continue his wanderings on behalf of the goliath people. He offers the antlered crown (a powerful magic item, though it doesn’t actually bestow immortality) to a highlevel goliath PC, but makes him swear an oath to protect a particular goliath tribe against the machinations of an evil wizard.

**Vimak’s Expedition**

Vimak Seesfar, a renowned goliath hunter and tribal chieftain, spent an entire spring in the great tent-city of Thella-Lu (described later in this chapter) recruiting the bravest and strongest goliaths he could find for a journey “beyond the mountains to the golden fields of Kathalae.” Whenever someone would win a race, a wrestling match, or a game of goat-ball, Vimak would be there with a sheaf of ancient parchments and a gleam in his eye. Almost every goliath jumped at the chance to join his expedition (for the prestige, if nothing else).

On the first day of summer three years ago, Vimak’s expedition left Thella-Lu amid much fanfare. Vimak jealously guarded the parchments detailing his journey, so no one knew exactly where he was going. Some said he was heading west beyond the mountains to an unknown part of the continent. Still others speculated that Vimak’s destination lay beyond the Material Plane itself, perhaps in some untroubled part of Ysgard, Elysium, or Celestia. No one has heard from Vimak’s expedition since, although unscrupulous goliaths have been known to sell fake copies of Vimak’s papers to the curious. The expedition is due to return this year, and the anticipation in Thella-Lu is palpable.

**Adventure Hook:** Kalakina Palehands, a badly wounded survivor from Vimak’s expedition, limps into Thella-Lu and describes a game-rich land where diamonds litter the valley floor and each mountain peak has an ancient, empty city built from ivory and emerald. She says that just as a team hand-picked by Vimak was leaving to tell all goliaths of the discovery, heavily armed creatures with black and red carapaces fell from the sky and made war against Vimak’s explorers. Kalakina escaped the invaders—or perhaps former residents of the land beyond the mountains—then survived many perils along the route to Thella-Lu. Despite her wounds, Kalakina sketched a map to the Land Beyond the Mountains. However, before she could detail the hazards of the journey, she disappeared before the very eyes of Thella-Lu’s healer clerics.

**The Broken Pact War**

The origin of the violent feud between the Thaliak and Gonimalaka tribes is a matter of controversy, but goliaths on both sides agree that the feud will end only when one tribe and its allies defeat the last of their bitter foes. Occasionally the Broken Pact War settles down to the point where Thaliak-affiliated tribes are merely rivals of Gonimalaka tribes, but bloodshed soon erupts again. Many goliath tribes now spurn both Thaliaks and Gonimalakas because they don’t want to be drawn into the war. Neither Thaliaknor Gonimalaka-affiliated tribes are welcome in Thella-Lu for the same reason.

One of the most famous battles between the Thaliaks and Gonimalakas is the Ridge of Shirts, so named because a Gonimalaka-allied war party numbering nearly a thousand braved the spears of five hundred Thaliaks determined to hold a particular ridge. Because the day was so hot, goliaths on both sides stripped to their shirts, making it difficult to tell friend from foe. When night fell, it is said that only four Thaliaks and ten Gonimalakas had escaped death or grievous injury, and that lowland rivers ran red for a week. Only the fact that an unusual number of Thaliak and Gonimalaka females were pregnant at the time kept the tribes—and the Broken Pact War—from fading into history.

**Adventure Hook:** Even now, malevolent ghosts from both tribes haunt the Ridge of Shirts—not even death could end their bitter hate. Weapons and armor, including some powerful examples of dwarven craftsmanship, are strewn across the ridge. So far the ghosts have kept away those who would scour the battlefield for war trophies. Also, a goliath sorcerer who briefly visited the site contends that the Ridge of Shirts is now a portal that transports visitors to the Outer Plane of Ysgard.

**Kunikithi Town**

While almost all goliaths are mountain hunter-gatherers, the Kunikithi tribe settled permanently in the lowlands, keeping a promise to forever till the family farm of a human adventurer who befriended the tribe a generation ago. To keep this promise, the tribe built a typical village next to the farm—in goliath scale. From the doorways to the furniture, everything in Kunikithi Town is uncomfortably big for humans, elves, and dwarves. Gnomes and halflings seem to mind it less, since they’re accustomed to clambering onto tall barstools and reaching up to grab door handles anyway.

After a difficult (and by some accounts humorous) transition, the Kunikithis have adapted to agricultural life rather well. Each Kunikithi youth is sent back up into the mountains to join a tribe for a year; the Kunikithi “mayor chieftain” says the sojourn reminds the young of their alpine heritage. Adolescent Kunikithis generally hate it, although some find the nomadic life so appealing that they never return to Kunikithi Town.

**Adventure Hook:** The PCs visit this strange town where every villager and every structure is unaccountably large, and thus they learn about the goliaths. A reluctant Kunikithi youth might need an escort into the mountains, or a nearby town might not be understanding and accepting of their large neighbors, mistaking them for ogres or hill giants.

**Schism of the Spirit**

For centuries, druids have been the spiritual leaders of the goliaths, preaching the divine power of nature but still paying homage to Kavaki and the rest of the goliath pantheon. Goliath clerics were few and far between during this time, but in recent years those ranks have swelled. The clerics have been winning entire tribes over to their doctrine, which places much more emphasis on the goliath pantheon and less emphasis on nature worship.

Goliath druids realize their primacy in spiritual affairs is under challenge, so they’re less than welcoming to visiting goliath cleric evangelists. Only rarely does a druid–cleric rivalry break out into an actual fight, but both sides do their utmost to win the hearts and minds of each goliath tribe. Plus, if one side can defeat the other in a fair competition or otherwise discredit their doctrine, so much the better. The more conservative druids listen to the teachings of Imikaula Moonshadow, a high-level druid who claims that many of the clerics don’t truly worship Kavaki. Authagua Ramhorn is the de facto leader of the more militant clerics; she contends that the druids have kept too much divine wisdom and power for themselves.

**Adventure Hook:** Goliath clerics seeking adherents among the tribes of the Aman-Kaa Valley are going missing, and their comrades place the blame squarely at the feet of the druids. As an unaffiliated group, the PCs are asked by one of the tribal chiefs to solve the mystery, rescue the clerics, and bring the culprits to justice. Representatives of Imikaula and Authagua—or the leaders themselves, in a high-level adventure—complicate the PCs’ investigations with their meddling.

**Dwarflost**

Ask goliaths why they all live in the mountains, and they quickly point out that not all goliaths do. Interestingly, every goliath proves the point with the same example: a set of tribes known as the Dwarflost. Brought near starvation by a high-mountain drought that drove away game and eliminated vegetation, the tribes followed a mountain spring to its source—an underground river. To their surprise, the tribes found that life was possible under the mountains as well as atop them. During that dry summer, they learned to forage for cavern mushrooms, hunt subterranean creatures, and make their way among the vast network of caves they found. As the seasons passed, they spent less and less time aboveground, eventually establishing an alliance with a nearby clan of dwarves. The dwarflost tribes maintain much of the traditional goliath way of life, but their pale skin and hunchback torsos mark them as different than alpine goliaths.

**Adventure Hook:** A powerful earthquake has closed the cave complex that connects the dwarf lost tribes to the surface. While the dwarf lost tribes can survive indefinitely underground, several influential tribes of surface-dwelling goliaths want the PCs to find a new pathway to them and reestablish contact. Their chieftains won’t say why the dwarf lost are so important, and rumors ascribe varying motivations for the mission. Some say the dwarf lost were tiring of life underground, and the chiefs want to rescue them. Others say the dwarf lost have a powerful goliath artifact in their possession, and yet others claim that a prophecy says that a dwarf lost must marry into a surface-dwelling tribe to avert certain doom.

**Uthanikalai**

Among the goliaths, the story of the Uthanikalai tribe is often told as a cautionary tale about how jealousy can destroy tribal unity. As recently as twenty years ago, the Uthanikalais were regarded as the most powerful and prosperous goliath tribe. Members of the tribe were often among the winners in the games of Thella-Lu, and other tribes looked with envy on the Uthanikalais’ riches (acquired through canny trading with the dwarves), prowess at hunting, and peerless ability to always predict where game and forage would be plentiful.

But today the Uthanikalais are no more, torn apart by the enmity of the tribal chief’s two daughters, Kaelao and Anamoaka. Some say the two were rivals from birth, while others say a particularly handsome hunter from another tribe wooed both females, setting them against each other. Whatever the reason, Kaelao’s and Anamoaka’s schemes against each other escalated until the entire tribe was rent asunder. At first, the sisters’ attacks were petty: Kaelao disparaged Anamoaka’s ability to hunt, while Anamoaka wondered aloud about Kaelao’s preoccupation with honey mead. Then Anamoaka’s daughter was found dead in the infant tent one morning, and Kaelao’s husband fell to his death during a cliff-race.

The two sisters began to enlist other members of the Uthanikalai tribe in their private war, and soon half the tribe was plotting the ruin of the other half. The tribe’s clerics and druids dropped their own rivalry to try to avert the infighting, but the Uthanikalais had descended too far into a spiral of betrayal and revenge. One night, almost all the Uthanikalais died immediately after a great summer solstice feast. Clerics assigned to build a cairn over the entire campsite reported that the feast pot contained traces of at least four different poisons.

**Adventure Hook:** Kaelao and Anamoaka survived the poison feast, and today they both lead smaller tribes that are largely distrusted by any goliath who knows their history. The prospect of a new Uthanikalai tribe exists; an adolescent goliath named Nanekath has come forth, claiming both Kaelao and Anamoaka as grandmothers (the result of a dalliance in Thella-Lu where neither paramour knew the other’s heritage). Nanekath can claim his birthright by joining either tribe, somehow uniting them, or forming a new tribe from outcast goliaths—a tribe that recalls the past glories of the Uthanikalais of old.

## Language
**LANGUAGE**

The goliath language, Gol-Kaa, is structurally similar to modern-day English. Nouns don’t have genders, there are three main tenses (past, present, and future), and modifiers such as adjectives and adverbs usually precede the words they modify. But unlike English, Gol-Kaa doesn’t have articles; whether you’re talking about “the wolf” or “a wolf” is made apparent through context. Goliaths speak Gol-Kaa in the active voice (“Kulagath climbed the mountain”) almost exclusively. Using the passive voice (“the mountain was climbed by Kulagath”) is grammatically torturous, so most goliaths don’t bother.

Because Gol-Kaa is entirely phonetic, spelling out Gol-Kaa words with the Dwarven alphabet is easy—the language has no exceptions or unusual spellings. But because Gol-Kaa has only thirteen sounds, it has a limited supply of possible syllables. Thus, individual words tend to be rather long.

**GOL-KAA PHRASEBOOK**

The following Gol-Kaa phrases might come up at the gaming table with some regularity. Depending on your style of play, you can use the actual Gol-Kaa words or their English translations when you’re playing a goliath PC.

*Aulak thala kaua gamala.* Literally translated as “Hunt the herd one animal at a time,” this is a common goliath proverb urging caution, patience, and proper planning.

*Kavalio...* This is a shortened, corrupted form of Kavaki

*kae lilio...* , which means, “May Kavaki grant that....” It means “I hope that...” or “Please” in a formal setting.

*Gath.* This word has no meaning by itself, but it adds emphasis to whatever word precedes it. If *kea namala* means “I’m bleeding,” then *kea namala gath* means “I’m bleeding profusely.”

*Gol ilakae kathana kulia.* The literal translation is “Make sure your spear shaft is straight,” but more broadly it means “Mind your own business, not mine.”

*Kuli gumatha goli kanakath.* “My shoulder is at your back.” This is a common promise of teamwork and an exhortation to greater deeds.

*Gol maula kae.* “You have exceeded me” is the word-forword translation, but the expression is more commonly used to indicate concession to the victor in a contest, or as a particularly polite apology.

*Goli lenamaka nae.* Translated as “Keep your antlers up,” this is a warning to be alert and perceptive.

*Kuli ananaka kulae aulaka.* “My heart is in my head.” Originating with the sensation of feeling a blood-rush in the temples when a goliath is excited, this exclamation indicates excitement and anticipation.

*Lothakal lanae lulakamana.* Literally, this means “an elk in a berry-bush,” but the goliaths use the expression to describe something that’s exceptionally lucky or too good to be true. The idiom is based on goliath folklore about an elk with its antlers caught in the thorny vines of a blackberry bush, thus simultaneously providing meat and fruit for the evening feast.

*Elieka kukanath mali kothek, naulae kukanath mali anemakua.* “Fast goats provide drink, slow goats provide food.” This is an exhortation to hurry, based on the goliaths’ relationship with the mountain goats in their care. Many goliaths tame a small number of goats for their milk, but end up eating those goats that can’t keep up (or even those that can, when game is scarce).

*Kuthalam gailek, naua namamek thanea.* “Respect the width, but don’t fear the height.” A goliath afraid of heights wouldn’t last long as a mountain nomad, of course, but goliaths are appropriately careful when they’re walking along a narrow cliff ledge. The proverb points out that the distance to the ground doesn’t matter nearly as much as the width of the ledge you’re balancing on.

*Kauma nau emaka nauth.* Literally, this means “The mountain doesn’t climb itself.” It reminds one to work hard, especially when beginning a new or difficult task.

*Thaaval.* Roughly translated as “rotten carcass,” this is an all-purpose goliath curse. A rotten carcass is useless to a goliath, so this term is used to describe reactions ranging from disgust to exasperation to ridicule. The goliaths’ use of the word *thaaval* is analogous to how humans use various synonyms for excrement.

**GOLIATH NAMES**

Goliaths have three names: a short first name, an honorific or nickname, and a long family name. Tribe members call each other by their middle names most of the time, using the first name in somewhat more formal settings and when identifying a goliath to someone outside the tribe. For example, a visitor to a goliath encampment would be introduced to the chieftain, Nakelath. That visitor wouldn’t hear the tribe members call the chieftain Nakelath, but probably Swiftclimber instead. The family name is reserved for ceremonial situations and other times when one’s heritage is significant.

**Random Name Generation:** Because the goliath language consists of thirteen phonetic sounds, constructing goliath names is relatively easy. First names have 1d3+1 syllables, while last names have 1d4+3 syllables. Make sure the last name ends in a vowel—keep adding syllables until it does.

Table 3–1 has two columns. Use the first column unless the previous syllable in the word ended in a consonant. If it did end in a consonant, use the second column.

## Example Tribe: The Kathaals
**EXAMPLE TRIBE: THE KATHAALS**

The Kathaals are a typical goliath tribe, content to spend their winters in the alpine meadows, then summering at higher elevations to avoid the heat and follow the game. While they don’t follow the same path year after year, the Kathaals have fallen into a reliable pattern. Still, a number of challenges threaten the comfortable rule of chieftain Akala Fishstringer Kulie-Kamana—not the least of which is Akala’s advancing age.

At any given time, the Kathaal tribe numbers between eighty and ninety goliaths. Of these, about ten are infants and toddlers; the rest spend their days hunting, foraging, and crafting new clothing and gear for the tribe. The average age of the tribe members is twenty-four, and at the age of fifty-five, Akala is by far the oldest member.

**KATHAAL MIGRATION PATTERN**

The Kathaal tribe maintains a stationary camp for two to four weeks, then spends anywhere from a few days to two weeks traveling. Their annual loop takes them across nearly a thousand miles of rugged mountain terrain, so it’s not an easy life. Many goliath tribes live on the cusp of starvation. Luckily, the Kathaals are adept at maintaining their nomadic lifestyle, and they retain a stockpile of three to seven days’ food on hand at any given time.

**January:** The Kathaals spend the coldest part of winter in low-elevation foothills. Their favorite place to camp is in a box canyon that opens in the direction of the prevailing winds. This choice of location keeps their campsite frigid and uncomfortable, but the winds disperse the smoke from their campfires, keeping them well hidden from the goblinoid tribes and meddlesome human bandits that also hole up in the hills. This is the toughest month for finding food; the Kathaals subsist on dried meat and root mash, with only occasional fresh game. Characters who meet the Kathaals at this point will find them extremely cautious toward interlopers. Once the PCs have gained the Kathaals’ trust, however, the goliaths happily trade goods or services for food.

**Adventure Hook:** The Kathaals, near starvation, attempt to waylay the PCs and take their food. They pull their punches to avoid killing PCs, unless the PCs kill one of them first.

**February:** With the first rains, the Kathaals move to a series of camps just above the tree line or within the forest itself if the higher elevations experienced heavy snow fall earlier that winter. When the alpine forests get significant moisture, the goliaths enjoy a special bounty: mushrooms. Seemingly overnight, a half-dozen varieties of edible mush rooms sprout in the forest, and the Kathaals do their best to pick the woods clean. Although they are at home in the mountains, the goliath hunters and foragers are also competent at woodcraft, so PCs in the woods might find themselves surprised by a team of Kathaal mushroompickers or deer-hunters. The omnipresent cold rain can lead to a dreary existence for goliaths cooped up in the forest, so the Kathaals will be particularly welcoming to strangers who promise entertainment, as long as they pose no obvious danger.

**Adventure Hook:** PCs wandering the forest come to the Kathaal campsite around suppertime and are invited to play drink-and-tell with the bored, morose goliaths. If they do well, the goliaths provide information about the forest’s dangers and maybe even a guide.

**March:** As soon as the snow melts from key passes in the foothills, a halfling trade caravan visits the Kathaals at a camp called Mirror Lake. The halflings trade metal tools, luxury items, and arrowheads for mushrooms the Kathaals have gathered, as well as examples of artisanship that talented goliaths have been working on all winter, such as embroidered blankets, fur coats, and intricate wooden carvings. Characters who meet the Kathaals at Mirror Lake find them anxious for word of the halflings and increasingly worried if they think they are lingering at the lake too long. The lake isn’t an easy place to defend from a nearby tribe of ogres. Last year, it was the site of a major battle that ended in the death of eight goliath warriors.

**Adventure Hook:** The PCs arrive at Mirror Lake just as the ogres attack, and they must choose sides—or a nervous combatant will choose sides for them.

**April:** The herds of elk, deer, and mountain goats are on the move to higher ground, and so are the Kathaals. The tribe rarely stays in the same place for more than two days, although the amount of snow left on the trail can place a limit on their progress. This is one of the better hunting times for the tribe, so fresh meat is plentiful—a refreshing change from the winter fare of dried meat, day after day. The Kathaals often spend a few weeks tracing the Leviak River to its source, trapping spawning salmon in nets and hunting the occasional bear. The Kathaals preserve any extra food by smoking it, because they know they can trade it next month. Because almost half the days this month are spent traveling, it’s more likely that PCs encounter either an advance scouting party or the entire tribe moving en masse.

**Adventure Hook:** Characters fording the Leviak River accidentally frighten the fish away from a goliath net. They have to talk or fight their way past angry goliaths who don’t want to go back to camp empty-handed.

**May:** The Kathaals’ migration path takes them near an egress point to a cave complex ruled by the Brightdagger clan of dwarves. Akala makes it a point to visit the dwarves near the end of the month to trade meat and fish for weapons, armor, and other metal goods. The tribe is happy to visit the Brightdaggers for two reasons: Every goliath is pleased to have a sharp new axe, and they are all glad to be rid of the overstuffed packs of food that Akala insisted they carry with them to trade with the dwarves. This month finds the Kathaals quite welcoming of visitors who offer trade, although the goliaths can afford to be cagey bargainers because they know they can look forward to trading with the dwarves.

**Adventure Hook:** Traveling underground, the characters encounter a very nervous band of torch-bearing goliaths, heavily laden with meat and fish. The goliaths don’t know it, but they took a wrong turn on their way to the Brightdagger clan.

**June:** The Kathaal tribe spends most of the month in the Five Lakes Basin, a valley accessible only after a treacherous climb. The fruitful hunting and foraging makes the climb worth it. Many goliath tribes know about the Five Lakes Basin, so the Kathaals sometimes share a campsite with an allied tribe or find themselves fighting a rival tribe over a particularly good hunting area or water source. If encountered this month, the Kathaals are generally friendly, but alert to anyone who poaches on “their” territory and eager to defend it from interlopers.

**Adventure Hook:** The PCs come across a pitched battle between a Kathaal hunting team and a team from a rival tribe. The Kathaals are defending a brace of gutted elk hanging from a tree.

**July:** When Akala thinks Five Lakes Basin is growing too crowded, the Kathaal tribe climbs out to a series of high alpine meadows. This month marks the peak growth of many berries and edible roots, but the available game is widely dispersed. Thus, the Kathaal diet is mostly vegetarian at this stage. The Kathaals range higher than most goliath tribes, so they don’t face competition for foraging. The tribe has a fair amount of leisure time this month, since food is plentiful and the weather is mild. The Kathaals are startled by any PCs they encounter this month, because so few people, goliath or not, climb this high.

**Adventure Hook:** The characters must contend with an avalanche (see page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) accidentally started by a goliath cliff-race far above them. From the PCs’ perspective, the avalanche might not look like an accident.

**August:** After a tricky series of descents from the high country, the Kathaal tribe comes to the great goliath tentcity of Thella-Lu (described later in this chapter). They spend two to four weeks there engaging in sport, religious celebration, and interaction with the other tribes. Akala spends most of his time conferring with other chieftains about game migrations, and the hunting reports he hears determine how long the tribe remains in the city. Once the tribe bids farewell to Thella-Lu for another year, it continues its slow descent from the mountains.

**Adventure Hook:** When the PCs arrive in Thella-Lu, they’re offered a hot meal among the Kathaals in exchange for a detailed description of the flora and fauna they’ve encountered on their travels.

**September:** The autumn season begins with as much hunting as Akala can manage, because the month ends with another trading visit to the Brightdagger clan. The nature of the weather determines how successful the hunting is, and thus how long the tribe tarries among the dwarves. Even if the hunting has been poor, Akala makes at least a brief visit to the Brightdaggers to offer some token trades. Whether encountered before or after the Brightdagger visit, the tribe tends to be hospitable in September; everyone knows that a long winter is coming, so any diversion is welcome.

**Adventure Hook:** The characters encounter a contingent of Kathaals on their way to visit the Brightdaggers. The PCs are invited to travel along and meet the dwarf clan.

**October:** This month marks the best hunting of the year, because the herd animals are rutting and easier to approach. The tribe focuses on getting as much hunting and skinning done as possible this month, in preparation for the long winter. If hunting is particularly good, Akala either sends a contingent back uphill to trade one last time with the Brightdaggers, or he sends food downhill to be buried in caches for winter. How the Kathaals react to strangers this month depends on how the hunting is going. They react poorly to anything that threatens their ability to hunt, but PCs who can help bring back game are quickly befriended.

**Adventure Hook:** The PCs come across a team of goliath hunters brandishing weapons in their general direction. If the characters don’t attack right away, they notice the brown bear behind them—the goliaths’ true target.

**November:** The snows fall in earnest this month, so the descent from the high country becomes a race to stay ahead of the high-elevation blizzards. Akala relies heavily on advice from Thuliana, the tribe’s skywatcher, to avoid getting the whole tribe foundered in heavy snow. The tribe tends to be inhospitable this month, since they have a pace to keep and they’re trying to eke every last morsel of food out of their environment.

**Adventure Hook:** A heavy snowfall has left a column of the Kathaal tribe unable to outrun a rampaging pair of remorhazes. If the PCs defeat the remorhazes, Akala and the rest of the tribe are exceedingly grateful.

**December:** As part of a promise Akala made years ago to his now-deceased uncle, the Kathaal tribe sends a war party east as soon as they reach lower elevations. They stealthily march to a rift valley held by a frost giant jarl who imprisoned an entire tribe of goliaths years ago (see the History and Folklore section earlier in this chapter). Each year, the Kathaals raid the frost giants’ fortress, then retreat into the snowy foothills before the giants can retaliate. Sending a war party this year is one of Akala’s most controversial decisions, because last year a frost giant tracker followed the raiders back to the Kathaal camp. She was slain only at the cost of nine tribe members, and many Kathaals worry that the frost giants will be waiting for the raiders this year. The tribe will be grateful to PCs who want to accompany them on this raid.

**Adventure Hook:** The PCs encounter the raiders on their way to the rift valley. The tribe is somewhat depleted of capable warriors, so the goliaths might offer the PCs all the treasure they can grab if they join the raiders.

**IMPORTANT KATHAAL MEMBERS**

The following NPCs are important members of the Kathaal tribe.

**Akala Fishstringer Kulie-Kamana**

Akala is getting old, and he knows it. But he still believes that he’s the best hope of the Kathaal tribe’s surviving (and, indeed, thriving) for another year. Unlike most goliaths, Akala finds that he’s getting bolder with each advancing year. His wife, Ithikea Charmweaver, tells him he’s being reckless because he wants to die in combat or by accident, rather than suffering the gradual decline of old age and exile. Akala says she’s half right: He knows his time as chieftain is running out, and he wants to make sure the tribe is in the best possible shape before he walks away from the campfire one last time. Akala also knows that the tribe has no clear successor to his position, so he’s starting to eye potential candidates.

Akala earned his honorific when the tribe first found the path along the Leviak River. Young Akala proved adept at net fishing and brought back a string of salmon so heavy he could barely carry it.

**Akala Fishstringer Kulie-Kamana:** Male goliath

Akala can still wield only Large weapons. At the end of his rage, Akala is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

*Fortification (Ex):* Akala’s tough hide negates critical hits or sneak attacks that successfully hit him 25% of the time. Damage is instead rolled normally.

*Goliath Traits (Ex):* Akala’s physical stature lets him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger, including using weapons designed for a creature one size larger. Akala can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. He can engage in accelerated climbing without taking the –5 penalty on the Climb check. Akala is automatically acclimated to life at high altitudes and does not take the penalties for altitude described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

*Trap Sense (Ex):* Against attacks by traps, Akala gets a +4 bonus on Reflex saves and a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class. *Uncanny Dodge (Ex):* Akala can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when caught flat-footed.

*Possessions:* +3 breastplate, Large +1 greataxe, amulet of natural armor +1, circlet of persuasion, cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1, 2 potions of cure serious wounds, 143 pp.

**Thuliana Skywatcher Avaelakumatha**

In many tribes, the skywatcher druid is a rival to the chieftain, subtly or overtly questioning the choices the chieftain makes. This is not the case among the Kathaal tribe. Thuliana harbors a secret love for Akala and helps him however she can. Thuliana knows she can never take Akala from Ithikea’s tent, but she can’t help hoping that something might bring Akala into her arms.

Thuliana doesn’t challenge Akala’s rule, but she is a conservative druid. She engineered the shunning and eventual exile of a young pantheist cleric last year, an act that no one knows about but that causes her much guilt.

**Thuliana Skywatcher Avaelakumatha:** Female goliath druid 9; CR 10; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 9d8+18; hp 63; Init –1; Spd 20 ft.; AC 16, touch 10, f lat-footed 16; Base Atk +6; Grp +14; Atk +8 melee (1d8+1/18–20, Large masterwork scimitar); Full Atk +8/+3 melee (1d8+1/18–20, Large masterwork scimitar); SA —; SQ earth companion, elemental bond, goliath traits, link with companion, nature sense, racial substitution levels (druid 1st, 6th), resist nature’s lure, share spells, trackless step, venom immunity, wild empathy +13 (+9 magical beasts), wild shape 3/day (Small, Medium, or Large animal), woodland stride; AL NG; SV Fort +10, Ref +4, Will +11; Str 12, Dex 8, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 17, Cha 14.

*Skills and Feats:* Concentration +11, Diplomacy +11, Handle Animal +8, Jump –7, Knowledge (nature) +13, Listen +11, Ride +1, Sense Motive +8, Spellcraft +7, Spot +11, Survival +13 (+15 in aboveground natural environments); Alertness, Natural Spell, Negotiator, Track.

*Earth Companion (Ex):* Thuliana has a wolf with the earth subtype as an animal companion. This creature is a loyal companion that accompanies Thuliana on adventures as appropriate for its kind. Its abilities and characteristics are summarized below.

**Darkscouter:** Wolf animal companion; CR —; Medium magical beast (earth); HD 6d8+18 plus 3; hp 48; Init +2; Spd 50 ft., burrow 10 ft.; AC 21, touch 12, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +4; Grp +7; Atk +8 melee (1d6+3, bite); Full Atk +8 melee (1d6+3, bite); SA earth mastery, trip; SQ bonus tricks, damage reduction 5/magic, devotion, evasion, low-light vision, scent; AL N; SV Fort +8, Ref +7, Will +3; Str 17, Dex 15, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.

*Earth Mastery:* Darkscouter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the companion takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls.

*Trip (Ex):* A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.

*Bonus Tricks:* This wolf is capable of learning three tricks in addition to any that Thuliana might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill, page 74 of the Player’s Handbook). These bonus tricks don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don’t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the creature. Thuliana selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can’t be changed.

*Devotion (Ex):* Darkscouter has a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.

*Evasion (Ex):* If Darkscouter is exposed to any effect that normally allows it to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

*Scent (Ex):* Can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

*Elemental Bond (Ex):* When casting a *summon nature’s ally* spell to summon a creature with the earth subtype, Thuliana may treat the spell as if it were the next-higher-level version of that spell. Thuliana can’t summon air, fire, or water creatures.

*Goliath Traits (Ex):* Thuliana’s physical stature lets her function in many ways as if she were one size category larger, including using weapons designed for a creature one size larger. Thuliana can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. She can engage in accelerated climbing without taking the –5 penalty on the Climb check. Thuliana is automatically acclimated to life at high altitudes and does not take the penalties for altitude described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

*Share Spells (Ex):* Thuliana may have any spell she casts on herself also affect her animal companion if the latter is within 5 feet at the time. She may also cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion.

*Trackless Step (Ex):* Thuliana leaves no trail in natural surroundings

and cannot be tracked.

*Venom Immunity (Ex):* Thuliana is immune to all poisons.

*Wild Shape (Su):* Thuliana can change into a Small, Medium, or Large animal and back again three times per day, as per the polymorph spell. This ability lasts for 9 hours or until she changes back.

*Woodland Stride (Ex):* Thuliana can move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at her normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion still affect Thuliana.

*Druid Spells Prepared* (6/5/5/4/2/1; save DC 14 + spell level): 0—*detect magic (2), detect poison, know direction, light, read magic;* 1st—*cure light wounds, entangle, longstrider, obscuring mist, speak with animals;* 2nd—*animal messenger, barkskin, delay poison, hold animal, tree shape;* 3rd—*cure moderate wounds, plant growth, speak with plants, stone shape;* 4th—*control water, cure serious wounds;* 5th—*commune with nature*.

**Kothi Silentbear Vathakanama**

Kothi is the tribe’s best hunter and warrior. He would be next in line to be chieftain if he didn’t express his disdain for leadership loudly and frequently. Akala occasionally picks him as captain of a hunting team, but the whole tribe knows they’ll have to endure a day of grumbling afterward. Kothi is also one of the tribe’s most enthusiastic athletes, eager to engage in a cliff-race, wrestling match, or game of goat-ball. He’s a good sport once the contest is over, but during a game or race he often taunts and jests with his opponents.

Kothi’s honorific is actually a tribal in-joke. He might be as strong as a bear, but he’s hardly silent when he has an opinion to share.

Kothi Silentbear Vathakanama: Male goliath ranger 8; CR 9; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 8d8+16; hp 55; Init +0; Spd 30 ft.; AC 14, touch 10, flat-footed 14; Base Atk +8; Grp +17; Atk +14 melee (2d6+6/19–20, Large +1 longsword); Full Atk +12/+7 melee (2d6+6/19–20, Large +1 longsword) and +12/+7 melee (1d8+2/×3 Large masterwork handaxe); SA favored enemy giants +2, favored enemy magical beasts +4, improved combat style (two-weapon combat); SQ animal companion, goliath traits, link with companion, share spells, swift tracker, wild empathy +9 (+5 magical beasts), woodland stride; AL CN; SV Fort +8, Ref +6, Will +6; Str 20, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 12, Wis 14, Cha 8.

*Skills and Feats:* Climb +15, Hide +13, Jump +15, Knowledge (geography) +6, Knowledge (nature) +8, Listen +9, Move Silently +9, Search +7, Sense Motive +4, Spot +16, Survival +14 (+16 to avoid getting lost, in aboveground natural environments, or when following tracks); Alertness, EnduranceB, Improved Two-Weapon FightingB, Iron Will, Stealthy, TrackB, Two-Weapon FightingB.

*Favored Enemy (Ex):* Kothi gains the indicated bonus on his Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against this type of creature. He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this type.

*Animal Companion (Ex):* Kothi has an eagle as an animal companion. This creature is a loyal companion that accompanies Kothi on adventures as appropriate for its kind. Its

abilities and characteristics are summarized below.

**Trailwatcher:** Eagle animal companion; CR —; Small magical beast; HD 3d8+3; hp 16; Init +3; Spd 10 ft., fly 80 ft. (average); AC 17, touch 14, flat-footed 14; Base Atk +2; Grp –2; Atk +6 melee (1d4, talon); Full Atk +6 melee (1d4, 2 talons) and +1 melee (1d4, bite); SA —; SQ bonus tricks, evasion, low-light vision; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +3; Str 11, Dex 16, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 14, Cha 6.

*Skills and Feats:* Listen +6, Spot +16; Alertness, Weapon Finesse.

*Bonus Tricks:* Trailwatcher is capable of learning two tricks in addition to any that Kothi might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill, page 74 of the Player’s Handbook). These bonus tricks don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don’t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the creature. Kothi selects these bonus trick, and once selected, they can’t be changed.

*Evasion (Ex):* If Trailwatcher is exposed to any effect that normally allows it to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

*Goliath Traits (Ex):* Kothi’s physical stature lets him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger, including using weapons designed for a creature one size larger. Kothi can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. He can engage in accelerated climbing without taking the –5 penalty on the Climb check. Kothi is automatically acclimated to life at high altitudes and does not take the penalties for altitude described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

*Link with Companion (Ex):* Kothi can handle his animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, with a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks made while dealing with that animal.

*Share Spells (Ex):* Kothi may have any spell he casts on himself also affect his animal companion if the latter is within 5 feet at the time. The master may also cast a spell with a target of “You” on his animal companion.

*Swift Tracker (Ex):* Kothi can track at normal speed without taking the usual –5 penalty, or can track at double speed at only a –10 penalty.

*Woodland Stride (Ex):* Kothi can move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion still affect Kothi.

*Ranger Spells Prepared* (2/1; save DC 12 + spell level): 1st—entangle, longstrider; 2nd—barkskin.

*Possessions:* +1 chain shirt, Large +1 longsword, masterwork handaxe, eyes of the eagle, cloak of elvenkind, wand of cure light wounds (19 charges), potion of bear’s endurance, 1 pp, 9 gp.

**Ulia Dawnsinger Vathakanama**

With her diligent patrols and clever perimeter traps, Ulia has probably saved tribe members’ lives more than any other Kathaal. In a typical week, she fends off three attacks from wild animals, goblinoids, or marauding monsters—often without even waking up the rest of her tribe.

Ulia often takes younger warriors under her tutelage, teaching them the finer points of stealth and warcraft. She was greatly disheartened last winter when many of her pupils didn’t come back from the frost giant raid. She is watching Akala closely for signs of weakness, because she still holds a grudge over the many burial cairns she helped build that winter.

Ulia is Kothi’s brother and one of his biggest rivals on the sporting pitch. She generally bites her tongue rather than respond to Kothi’s taunts.

**Ulia Dawncaller Vathakanama:** Female goliath rogue 3/bard 3/dawncaller 5; CR 12; Medium monstrous humanoid; HD 1d6+3 plus 2d8+6 plus 3d6+9 plus 5d8+15; hp 81; Init +3; Spd 30 ft.; AC 22, touch 14, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +9; Grp +14; Atk +11 melee (2d6+1/19–20, Large masterwork longsword) or +15 ranged (1d8+1/×3, Large masterwork composite shortbow); Full Atk +11/+6 melee (2d6+1/19–20, Large masterwork longsword) or +15/+10 ranged (1d8+1/×3, Large masterwork composite shortbow); SA sneak attack +2d6; SQ bardic knowledge 4, bardic music 8/day (countersong, fascinate, inspire competence, inspire courage +2, inspire stamina), darkvision 60 ft., goliath traits, mettle of mountains, racial substitution levels (rogue 2nd, 3rd), trapfinding, wild sense +1; AL CN; SV Fort +11, Ref +14, Will +6; Str 12, Dex 16, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 14.

*Skills and Feats:* Appraise +1 (+3 for traps), Climb +9, Craft (trapmaking) +9, Diplomacy +4, Disable Device +10, Hide +11, Jump +9, Knowledge (geography) +6, Knowledge (nature) +8 (+9 in aboveground natural environments), Listen +10, Move Silently +11, Perform (sing) +16, Search +10, Sense Motive +10, Spot +10, Survival +8 (+10 to keep from getting lost or for avoiding hazards, or +11 in aboveground natural environments); Alertness, Point Blank Shot, Stealthy, Weapon Focus (shortbow).

*Sneak Attack (Ex):* +2d6 points of damage against flat-footed opponents within 30 feet, or against targets Ulia is flanking. Creatures that do not have a discernible anatomy or that are immune to extra damage from critical hits are immune to sneak attacks.

*Countersong (Su):* Ulia can counter magical effects that depend on sound by making a Perform check for each round of countersong. Any creature within 30 feet of her who is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use her Perform check result in place of his or her saving throw, if desired. Countersong lasts for 10 rounds.

*Fascinate (Sp):* Ulia can cause up to three creatures within 90 feet that can see and hear her to become fascinated with her (sit quietly, –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks). Ulia’s Perform check result is the DC for the opponent’s Will save. Any obvious threat breaks the effect. Fascination lasts for 8 rounds.

*Goliath Traits (Ex):* Ulia’s physical stature lets her function in many ways as if she were one size category larger, including using weapons designed for a creature one size larger. Ulia can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. She can engage in accelerated climbing without taking the –5 penalty on the Climb check. Ulia is automatically acclimated to life at high altitudes and does not take the penalties for altitude described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

*Inspire Competence (Su):* An ally within 30 feet who can see and hear Ulia gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks for as long as he or she can hear the music. Inspire competence lasts for up to 20 rounds.

*Inspire Courage (Su):* Allies (including Ulia herself) who can hear Ulia receive a +1 morale bonus on saves against charm and fear effects, and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. The effect lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear Ulia.

*Inspire Stamina (Su):* Ulia can sing to refresh her tired allies. While she sings and for 8 minutes thereafter, Ulia and allies within 30 feet who can hear her song can ignore all negative effects of fatigue or exhaustion.

*Mettle of Mountains (Ex):* If Ulia is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

*Trapfinding:* Ulia can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a DC higher than 20. She can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device result exceeds the trap’s DC by 10 or more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

*Bard Spells Known* (3/2; save DC 12 + spell level): 0—*detect magic, know direction, lullaby, message, read magic, summon instrument;* 1st—*cure light wounds, expeditious retreat, feather fall.*

*Possessions:* +1 mithral shirt, +1 mithral buckler, Large masterwork composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus), Large masterwork longsword, gloves of Dexterity +2, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +1, lesser bracers of archery, ring of protection +1, wand of cure light wounds (42 charges), potion of fly, 79 pp.

**Ethavio Flamespeaker Anakathami**

Ethavio is the Kathaal tribe’s only wizard—and, because he’s the only one with parchment, its default scribe and historian as well. Ethavio learned wizardry from the halflings. He spent a year traveling with a halfling trade caravan when a severe stomach flu forced the Kathaal tribe to leave him behind. He rejoined the tribe two years ago, after waiting for the tribe to return to Mirror Lake in the spring. He is one of Akala’s favorites, and the tribe leader regards Ethavio’s return as a good omen for following the same migration pattern every year.

While the tribe welcomed him back with open arms, Ethavio is still a bit distant from the other Kathaals. Being left behind, though necessary, was painful, and few of his tribe have any interest in the arcane arts.

### Thella-Lu
![[Thella-Lu.png|Thella-Lu|300]]
[[Thella-Lu.png|Goliath City of Thella-Lu]]

## Thella-Lu
**THELLA-LU**

**Thella-Lu (small city):** Magical; AL CG; population 11,000 adults (varies widely); 15,000 gp limit (40,000 gp for Large weapons and druid magic items); Mixed (79% goliath, 9% stonespeaker \[goliath], 5% human, 3% dwarf, 2% halfling, 1% elf, 1% giant).

*Authority Figures:* High Priest Kanekathama, female goliath stonespeaker druid 7/stonespeaker guardian 10; Chieftain Arbiter Elikalani, male goliath stonespeaker druid 14; chieftain of the guard-tribe (identity changes regularly), goliath barbarian 12.

*Important Characters:* Manathua, female cleric 9 (healer in the shrine of Theleya who often casts raise dead for visitors who make a donation); Garlak Warrendelve, male dwarf wizard 4/cleric 7 (longtime resident who often magically enhances goliaths’ weapons); Rulia Appletoss, female gnome bard 7 (proprietor of Rulia’s hospitality tent and brewer of fine honey-mead); Kimoku Stoneheart Thalanama, female goliath barbarian 15 (renowned goliath athlete).

Although they are a nomadic people, the goliaths do have a major city—of sorts. Thella Lu is a sprawling tent city located in the center of the Plain of Standing Stones, an unusually large alpine meadow known for its mild weather. At any one time, more than a hundred different goliath tribes gather here to trade, socialize, and compete in the most competitive goliath sporting events. Thella-Lu is equal parts sporting event, armed camp, and never-ending party. 

Few goliaths tarry in Thella-Lu for long; most remain only for a month or two. The city’s population changes completely every season, and because Thella-Lu is a tent city, entire neighborhoods literally get up and walk away overnight when tribes leave. A visitor who marvels at the spectacle of so many goliaths gathered in one place is doubly surprised when a second visit to Thella-Lu reveals that none of those same tribes are still there.

Because the weather on the Plain of Standing Stones is mild (nearby peaks leave Thella-Lu in a “rain shadow” and block a frigid north wind), Thella-Lu’s total population doesn’t change much with the passing seasons. A hundred tribes gathered in the same place have an outsized impact on the ecology of the plain, so game is scarce near the city.

The highest authority in Thella-Lu is the Menethun, an order of high-level stonespeaker guardians (see Chapter 5: Prestige Classes for more information). The Menethun regard Thella-Lu as the best way to minister to the entire goliath people. Because they couldn’t possibly visit every goliath tribe, they wish to create a place so hospitable that every goliath tribe comes to visit them.

Goliath tribes mostly come to Thella-Lu to trade with each other. Those with connections to the dwarves of the underground or the humanoid races of lower elevations often have weapons and armor to trade with those who have had unusually productive foraging seasons. Halfling and human trade caravans sometimes brave the mountain passes to reach Thella-Lu, and dwarf trading missions aren’t uncommon. Giants are likewise welcome, although they are watched closely and usually assigned a protective escort.

In general, Thella-Lu is a small city with a 15,000 gp  limit, but the price ceiling goes up to 40,000 gp for Large weapons and magic items with druid spells as prerequisites. Additionally, the goliaths will buy Large weapons from PCs for 75% of their market price, rather than the usual 50%.

While the chieftains trade with one another, the rest of the tribe takes part in the 24-hour festival that is life in Thella-Lu. Singing, drinking, and dancing are common around the clock. Many of the goliaths in the city at any given time have been out in the wilderness for a year or more, and they throw themselves into “civilization” with a frenzy. Performers are always in demand. Thella-Lu counts as a prosperous city for the purpose of Perform checks, and successful performers there earn twice the standard amount (see page 79 of the Player’s Handbook).

During the day, sporting events dominate the agenda for many of Thella-Lu’s residents. Unlike the impromptu games played at goliath camps everywhere, Thella-Lu’s competitions are well organized and often witnessed by hundreds of carousing spectators. Over time, Thella-Lu’s temporary residents have built amphitheaters for many of their favorite events.

Characters wishing to participate in goliath games must first demonstrate their prowess to a stonespeaker, who then directs the athlete to a venue appropriate for his abilities. Characters who win events at one venue are often invited to play a game the next day against more prestigious (and higher-level) opponents.

In addition to the usual goliath games, Thella-Lu holds an endurance event known as the Test of Naki-Uthai. A dozen athletes—or sometimes a half-dozen teams of two—leave at 6-hour intervals on a journey around the base of nearby Mount Kalithini. The trail is treacherous, featuring both natural hazards and deadly monsters. Characters can climb higher to reduce the total distance they have to travel, but doing so subjects them to higher altitudes and poorer trails. It typically takes eight days for an accomplished runner to complete the journey. Druids often use their animal companions to surreptitiously monitor athletes to make sure no one cheats by using flight magic or mounts, or setting traps for later contestants.

Goliaths also travel to Thella-Lu for religious worship. It is said that after Kavaki brought the first goliath tribes down from the mountaintop, he taught them to hunt and forage on the Plain of Standing Stones. Major shrines exist for each deity in the goliath pantheon—even Kuliak, who is otherwise held at arm’s length by goliath worshipers.

The stonespeakers who are Thella-Lu’s only permanent residents are responsible for order in the city. Mostly this amounts to maintaining schedules of religious and sporting events. The stonespeakers always deputize one tribe to keep a modicum of peace in the city, breaking up drunken brawls and separating antagonistic tribes. When that tribe leaves, the stonespeakers choose another tribe to take its place, paying well for the tribe’s services.

Thella-Lu is the ultimate destination for many goliaths, for west of the city lies a field of cairns where many goliaths, famous or obscure, are buried. Kuliak’s shrine stands in the middle of all the cairns, and clerics stationed there officiate at several funerals each day.

## The Stonespeakers
**THE STONESPEAKERS**

Touched by the divine spirit of stone, stonespeakers are a far-flung order of goliath druids, clerics, and other mystics who watch over tribes of goliaths and feral garguns. The tribes regard them as holy figures, though stonespeakers stand at arm’s length from the daily life of the tribes they guard. When a dispute threatens to tear a tribe apart, or the wild game in an area inexplicably disappears, or monsters threaten the very existence of the tribe, a stonespeaker is there to provide guidance and considerable magical aid.

**Agenda:** Stonespeakers travel the mountain regions, helping and advising goliath and feral gargun tribes as they wander. This wandering serves many purposes, allowing the shamans to observe and commune with the natural world, carry news between the tribes, and remain vigilant against the depredations of hostile giants, dragons, and other dangerous creatures.

Wise and patient, stonespeakers listen before they speak, and they often find themselves in the role of teacher or mentor to members of other races. Stonespeakers love to wander and explore, and they are patient observers of the natural world.

Stonespeakers care deeply about the earth, and they work to teach others how to work stone and treat it with care. Conversely, stonespeakers have no tolerance for the rare individuals who do great damage to the earth with careless magic or irresponsible mining, and they work tirelessly to oppose such individuals, regardless of their race.

**Structure:** Unlike the druids responsible for a mountain tribes’ religious life, stonespeakers are not themselves part of the tribe they watch over. They often wander the mountainous regions, joining a tribe for a short time and then moving on. Older stonespeakers eventually settle permanently within one of these tribes, exchanging wisdom and counsel for the safety of the larger community.

Stonespeakers also tend areas sacred to themselves or to any of the other races that they are closely associated with. Powerful stonespeakers sometimes imbue these sites with magic, turning them into rune circles. 

Although a stonespeaker uses spells such as animal messenger to communicate with his brethren, he meets other stonespeakers in person only rarely—often when two wandering tribes pass each other on a mountain path. A stonespeaker is expected to instinctively know what is best for stone, best for the stonespeakers, and best for the tribe he’s watching over (in that order), and to act without needing orders or oversight.

Stonespeakers meet four times a year in gatherings known as stonemoots to discuss the welfare of their charges and threats that confront multiple tribes within a region. The goliath tent city of Thella-Lu is host to the most important stonemoot every season, which every stonespeaker is expected to attend if possible. Most of the other stonemoots are held in remote alpine valleys, elaborate mountain cave networks, and other nigh-inaccessible places. These smaller stonemoots are attended by smaller groups of stone speakers, who travel to the one nearest their current location when the time arrives. If giant slavers will be on the move from the icy north come spring, the stonespeakers will formulate a counterplan at their winter stonemoot. If the war between the Thaliak and Gonimalaka goliath tribes threatens to draw mercenaries from the lowlands into the mountains, the stonespeakers will broker a cease-fire and keep interlopers out. Decisions are made by majority vote after every stonespeaker has had a say and appropriate divination spells have been consulted for guidance.

The stonespeakers also work powerful magic at their stonemoots, building and maintaining rune circles and casting spells to keep the mountains healthy. The stonespeakers also make extensive use of divination magic during stonemoots, and many stonespeakers return to their tribes with the words of prophecy on their lips.

Finally, the stonemoots are where new members are initiated into the group. Becoming a stonespeaker is a two-step process. First, a prospective member must follow an existing stonespeaker to the stonemoot. Because most stonespeakers are accomplished druids and stonemoots are in exceedingly remote locations, doing this is harder than simply following in a stonespeaker’s footsteps—for starters, stonespeakers nearly all have the trackless step class feature and thus don’t leave footprints.

Would-be stonespeakers who reach a stonemoot must next withstand the scrutiny of the existing stone speakers, who test the applicant’s priorities and judgment in a lengthy interrogation. The stonespeakers also demand that the applicant demonstrate his magical prowess; they reject anyone who can’t cast 3rd-level spells or show off abilities of equivalent power.

For millennia, stonespeakers have spoken Druidic or the goliath tongue, Gol-Kaa, among themselves. Although Gol-Kaa is their primary language, they have incorporated other phonetic letters from Druidic and Common into their speech. Stonespeakers, like other goliaths, have recently picked up the alphabet of the Dwarven language. Stonespeakers have taken to this new written version of the language much faster than goliaths in general, and they guide and encourage the goliath scribes who are busily transcribing the goliaths’ vast oral tradition.

*Names:* When a new stonespeaker joins the group, he adds “-tor” to his name as a hyphenated suffix, denoting his devotion to earth and stone. Stonespeaker guardians further modify their names by changing “-tor” to “-ber.” For example, when Arakan, a druid, joins the stonespeakers, he changes his name to Arakan-tor. Later, after entering the stonespeaker guardian prestige class, he changes his name to Arakan-ber.

**Symbol:** The stonespeakers have no symbol that they wear to differentiate themselves from the tribe they travel with, but they use an elaborate sequence of spoken passwords in a combination of Gol-Kaa, Druidic, and invented words to identify each other. If the stonespeakers have a symbol at all, it is the circles of stone they leave scattered across the mountain landscape. Some of these stones merely mark a trail or designate a sacred place, but others form powerful rune circles.

**Membership:** The vast majority of stonespeakers are goliath druids, but members of other spellcasting classes have occasionally developed a strong enough bond with stone to join the group. Recently, a number of clerics of Kavaki joined the stonespeakers—a move reflective of the conflict between druids and clerics in goliath society.

**Relations:** Goliaths and feral garguns almost always offer a stonespeaker aid and shelter, even if they’re on the warpath or starving themselves—so high is the reputation of a stonespeaker. Stonespeakers sometimes travel with goliath traders who visit the dwarves, and they get along well with the clerics of Moradin they meet there.

Other races have little contact with stonespeakers, and few members of other races even realize that they are something more than goliath shamans. When they do meet, the stonespeaker’s obvious wisdom and peaceful nature usually keep relations smooth.

**Benefits:** Joining the stonespeakers provides two main benefits. First, a stonespeaker receives the hospitality of almost any goliath or feral gargun tribe he visits. While the tribes usually have little in the way of possessions, a stonespeaker can usually get a scout, guide, or a few strong sword-arms for whatever mission he’s undertaking.

The second benefit of membership is access to the other stonespeakers and the stonemoots. A stonespeaker has a say in the questions asked during divination spells and can quiz other stonespeakers about the conditions of their tribes and the lands they’ve visited. By traveling to stonemoots and hearing what his brethren have been up to over the course of the last season, a stonespeaker learns about the location and purpose of newly built rune circles hidden in the mountains.

## Creating Goliath Characters
**CREATING GOLIATH CHARACTERS**

Goliath characters obey all the rules for characters described in the Player’s Handbook. Because goliaths have better than usual ability score modifiers and abilities, they have a level adjustment of +1. Thus a 1st-level goliath character works well alongside 2nd-level PCs of races detailed in the Player’s Handbook.

When you create a goliath character, remember that you can do more with the Climb and Jump skills than most characters, but you don’t directly have a bonus in those skills (although you probably have a high Strength score). Likewise, you should be alert for chances to exploit the natural size of the goliath by getting Large weapons and considering combat tactics such as grappling and bull rushing.

**SPECIAL GOLIATH OPTIONS**

As a goliath character, you qualify for some goliath-specific feats and prestige classes unavailable to PCs of other races, all described in Chapters 5 and 6 of this book.

**Feats:** Auspicious Marking, Earth Fist (also available to dwarves and gnomes), Fling Ally, Fling Enemy, Heavy Lithoderms, Improved Rock Hurling, Knockback, Markings of the Blessed, Markings of the Hunter, Markings of the Magi, Markings of the Maker, Markings of the Warrior, Rampaging Bull Rush, Rock Hurling, Steady Mountaineer.

**Prestige Classes:** Dawncaller, goliath liberator, peregrine runner, stonespeaker guardian.

**GOLIATHS AS CHARACTERS**

Fundamentally, the class you choose determines more about your character than any other choice you make. While barbarian is the goliaths’ favored class, their nomadic lifestyle relies on teamwork, so goliaths of other classes are common.

**Barbarian:** Goliaths are strong and they can use Large two-handed weapons, so they make excellent barbarians. When a raging barbarian wielding a Large greataxe uses the Power Attack feat, a successful hit deals a prodigious amount of damage.

For alternative options for the goliath barbarian, see the goliath racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character Options.

**Bard:** Goliath culture is based on an oral tradition, so bards are relatively common. Many bards are dawncallers, responsible for guarding the tribe’s campsite throughout the night.

**Cleric:** Most goliath clerics worship their pantheon as a whole, praying to the entire pantheon but choosing one as their favorite. They can be of any alignment, although they usually choose their domains from one deity within the pantheon.

**Druid:** The most common spellcasting class among goliaths, druids are present in almost every goliath tribe. The senior druid in a tribe is sometimes called the skywatcher, responsible for weather forecasting and ensuring that the tribe doesn’t take more from the land than it can use.

For alternative options for the goliath druid, see the goliath racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character Options.

**Fighter:** Goliaths are suited for melee combat, so many of them take the specialized training that is the hallmark of a fighter. The goliaths don’t have standing armies, but many goliath warbands guard the tribes from giants and other mountain monsters.

**Monk:** Goliath monks are rare, but their size and strength makes them effective unarmed fighters. Many take the Improved Grapple feat at 1st level because it combines well with their size.

**Paladin:** Goliath paladins are likewise rare, because few goliaths find the trappings of the class—heavy armor and horses—useful in their mountain homes.

**Ranger:** Goliaths regard the hunters in their tribes quite highly, so rangers are common. Many take animals, magical beasts, or giants as their first favored enemy.

**Rogue:** The skill set of a rogue is useful to goliaths who can’t rely on a large civilization to meet their needs. Most goliath rogues focus on stealth and wilderness skills, rather than more urban-oriented skills such as Open Lock and Disable Device. For alternative options for the goliath rogue, see the goliath racial substitution levels in Chapter 6: Character Options. Sorcerer: Other than bards, goliath sorcerers are the primary arcane spellcasters for their tribes. Most focus on the school of transmutation, illusion, or evocation, since those schools offer the greatest number of spells that their divine spellcaster counterparts can’t match.

**Wizard:** In a society where not everyone can read, wizards are often the scribes of their tribes. It’s difficult for goliaths to learn the art of wizardry while on the move in a tribe, so most leave goliath society for a time, then return with a spellbook and a measure of arcane power.
