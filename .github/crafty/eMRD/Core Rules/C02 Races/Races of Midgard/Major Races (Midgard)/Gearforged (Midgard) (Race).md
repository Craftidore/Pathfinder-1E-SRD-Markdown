# Gearforged (Midgard) (Race)
## Overview
**GEARFORGED**

The gearforged are the children of Rava, the Gear Goddess of Fate and Industry. Her priests were the first to forge bodies of brass and copper with cunningly wrought gears and well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh; a special ritual (see page 16) is required to transfer a living creature’s soul into the housing that makes it gearforged. Once created, a gearforged can in theory live forever, though in practice most wind down or are destroyed by the ravages of time and the difficulty of surviving as a well-crafted machine.

All gearforged were once other creatures, now inhabiting standardized bodies with cylinders, springs, and articulated joints of varying quality. Each is made of iron, brass, and steel and as distinctive in appearance as other people differ by their hair and eyes. The gearforged are thinking creatures and can serve as city watchmen and soldiers. Gearforged have free will that separates them from other mechanical devices, which are no more than simple servants responsive to orders and capable of little more than a limited amount of memorization.

Each is well-balanced mechanisms to support thought and action. Each such body is the safe harbor of a soul that once lived in flesh. Once created, a gearforged can in theory live forever, though in practice most wind down or are destroyed by the ravages of time and the difficulty of surviving as a well-crafted machine.

**Physical Description:** Without exception, the gearforged are shaped as humanoids, and the vast majority of those are one of two styles: roughly human-sized, with articulated joints, hands, feet, and magical eyes; or a rather stouter version made by the dwarves. Minotaur gearforged are rare but not entirely unknown. A very few gearforged are built to even smaller sizes, believed to be intended for kobold souls, but these are subject to frequent failure and even the extinction of the souls they carry. The core fact of all gearforged is that they were once something else, and now they are somewhat standardized with cylinders, springs, and articulated joints of varying quality. Each is made as distinctive in appearance as any other people are distinctive in their hair and eyes, but the basic framework is always humanoid. This is what separates them from the devices, which are merely servants responsive to orders and capable of little more than a limited amount of memorization. Gearforged are thinking, free-willed creatures. Their mechanisms are more than mechanical, of course, because all gearforged are machines with souls. Their arms and legs depend on actuators powered by magical springs. Their minds depend on memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral, steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements are all held in a shell of iron, brass, and steel, and the bulk of the things is quite remarkable: A large and heavily armored gearforged can weigh 400 pounds, as its armor is often built in.

**Society:** Gearforged do not have a separate society of their own; instead, they insinuate themselves into existing societies as best they can. Having metal bodies and longer lifespans than most alienates them to some extent.

**Relations:** Gearforged are generally respected individuals in the realms they hail from. They get along well with members of their base race, but treat other races as would their base race. Most try to maintain good relations with dwarves and kobolds, as they rely on these crafters to keep them running.

**Alignment and Religion:** Gearforged may be of any alignment. They may also pay homage to the deities worshiped by their base race.

**Adventurers:** Many gearforged embark on adventures out of boredom, their lives having been extended past their race’s normal lifespan. Others seek to experience the world around them fully, deciding to see its awesome all because they can. Others are merely wanderers in search of places to call home.

**Names:** Gearforged names favor the character’s original race.

### Gearforged Components
**GEARFORGED COMPONENTS**

The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts.

**Everwound Springs**

These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged’s limbs and fingers. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb.

**Soul Gems**

The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, and its mind—are retained in one or (for an extra 8,000 gp) two soul gems. These are the elements that retain an individual’s spirit or soul, and their destruction means the death of that gearforged.

**Memory Gears**

These delicate constructions are scroll-like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin-sized holes, wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity. The memory of a gearforged for all the days after its creation lives in the memory gears. Older gearforged have many such gears, and the material component for the magic to create them requires one new gear/two levels attained or every 10 years of life. Installing one requires one day’s work and 2,000 gp. Memory gears can be taken from a dead gearforged and read by others. This is a lengthy process and viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is peering into the most private details of a creature’s life.

Installing an existing, used memory gear in a new gearforged requires a new [[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|ritual of soulforging]] and at least one week for the recipient to remember and understand the process. The process is dangerous, requiring a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half level of dead gearforged + Cha modifier of dead gearforged) to succeed. If the Fortitude save fails, the gearforged is ill for two weeks as it resorts its own memories, and the found memory gear is rendered useless.

### Gearforged Age
**GEARFORGED AGE**

As partially artificial creatures, gearforged suffer none of the drawbacks and gain none of the benefits of aging. They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that might age a character. The whirling gears and preservative fluids keep what little may remain of the meek flesh just as strong as the clockworks powering their bodies.

### Gearforged Height and Weight
**GEARFORGED HEIGHT AND WEIGHT**

Gearforged require a certain size in which to fit in all those whirling gears and tapes used in their operation. Hence, all gearforged are at least Medium size (until an enterprising clockworker manages to solve that problem, of course). Since the [[Ritual of Soulforging (midgardpf)|ritual of soulforging]] seems to work better when the new body is close in size to the original body, gearforged tend to have the same or similar heights as their parent race—fangforged are as tall as dragonkin, geardwarves as stocky as regular dwarves. However, small folk and those not content with their size have opted for the base height of humans as well, which oddly seems to impose next to no problems for kobolds, halflings, and similar small folk.

## Gearforged Racial Traits
**Gearforged Racial Traits**

**+2 to One Ability Score:** Gearforged come in many variants. Their makers pride themselves on fitting the body to the needs of the soul.

**Gearforged:** Gearforged are humanoids with the gearforged subtype.

**Medium:** Gearforged are medium creatures and have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed:** Gearforged have a base speed of 30 ft. Their speed is not modified by wearing medium armor. Darkvision: Gearforged can see in the dark up to 60 ft. Low-light Vision: Gearforged can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

**Armor:** Gearforged gain a +1 natural armor bonus.

**Skills:** Gearforged have lost a part of their humanity to cold, precise, clicking steel. This change also affects their minds and makes them more detached and sometimes awkward in social situations. They take a –2 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. However, their new state makes them frightening to some and grants precise insight into clockworks. Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (clockwork) and Intimidate checks.

**Immortal:** As partially artificial creatures, gearforged suffer none of the drawbacks and gain none of the benefits of aging. They never die of natural causes, and they are immune to any attacks or effects that age a character: The whirling gears and preservative fluids keep what little may remain of the meek flesh just as strong as the clockworks powering their bodies.

**Rust Vulnerability:** A gearforged suffers damage from a rusting attack since it corrodes the gearforged body. Use the damage value given for the spell or effect if one is provided. If no damage value is given, the gearforged makes a Fortitude save using the DC and save type indicated for the effect, if any. If no save is allowed or if the save fails, the gearforged takes 1d6 points of damage for each of its Hit Dice with half damage on a successful save.

**Stable:** Gearforged are not at risk of death from massive damage, and they automatically stabilize when taken below 0 hp.

**Destruction Is Not The End:** A gearforged body is destroyed at their negative Con score, though they can have their soul gem and memory tapes implanted in a newly-constructed body as long as they are intact. They cannot be raised or resurrected through normal magical means, though a wish or miracle can restore them as usual.

**Languages:** Gearforged begin play speaking the Trade Tongue (common). Gearforged with high Intelligence score can choose Giant, Gnome, Draconic, Dwarven, and The Machine Speech as bonus languages.

**Clockwork Traits**

While the following traits are specific to the Midgard city of Zobeck, GMs and players are encouraged to adapt them to their own campaign world as appropriate. While retaining the general topic of clockworking, none of these traits grant gear points.

**Clockworker Apprentice (Regional: Zobeck)**

You tried life as an apprentice in the Clockworker’s Guild. While the guild didn’t suit you, you learned the craft. You gain a +1 trait bonus to Disable Device checks involving clockwork and to Craft (clockwork) checks. Disable Device and Craft (clockwork) are always class skills for you. This bonus stacks with Clockwork Scholar.

**Clockwork Scholar (Religion: Rava)** You are a hard-working follower of the Gear Goddess. You gain a +2 trait bonus to Diplomacy checks with gearforged and constructs. You gain a +1 trait bonus to Profession (scribe) and to any one Craft skill (chosen when the trait is taken).

**Mark of Rava (Religion: Rava)** You can feel the warp and weft of the world’s fabric and understand both its mundane and magical workings. You gain a +1 trait bonus to Knowledge (engineering) and Knowledge (arcana) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.

**GM Note:** GMs may allow gearforged players to use Clockwork Traits as they would Gearforged Trait.

**Traits for Gearforged**

**Adamant** (Race: Gearforged)

Your crafters made your body more resilient than normal.

**Benefit(s):** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Hidden Compartment** (Race: Gearforged)

Your body has a secret compartment and you can discretely access it.

**Benefit(s):** You can hide an object no bigger than a dagger or wand and gain a +4 circumstance bonus on your Sleight of Hand checks when you draw it from the compartment.

**Clockwork Scholar** (Religion)

You are a scholar of mechanical devices.

**Benefit(s):** You gain a +2 trait bonus to Diplomacy checks with gearforged and constructs. Gain a +1 trait bonus to Profession (scribe) or to any one Craft skill (chosen when the trait is taken).

**Drawbacks for Gearforged**

Gearforged have a number of drawbacks.

**Water Susceptibility:** A gearforged drenched in water can continue to function normally for a number of hours equal to their Strength score. After spending that much time while soaking wet or in the water, the gearforged will grind to a halt and require a 4-hour repair period. Heavy cloaks and similar clothes can be used to prevent becoming drenched by rain, subject to GM approval. Gearforged suffer a −2 penalty to Swim checks.

**Repairs Required:** Gearforged cannot heal damage on their own and the application of the Heal skill has no effect on them. Cure spells, wands, and potions heal gearforged for the minimum amount per charge or dose, and the psionic repair damage power works normally. The mending spell heals a gearforged for 1 point of damage while make whole heals 2d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +10). Gearforged may be repaired using Craft (clockwork) or by another gearforged possessing the Self‑Mechanic feat.

**Rewind the Gears:** Rather than sleep, gearforged must rewind their springs, repair gears, and oil and clean their parts each day for a 4-hour period to ensure normal functioning. They are fully aware during this period, but any interruption in their routine during these 4 hours requires them to start again from the beginning. Gearforged can function a number of days equal to their character level without performing this maintenance, but each day without such a repair period applies a cumulative −2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If a gearforged neglects his maintenance period a number of days equal to his character level, he becomes immobile and helpless until maintained by another gearforged or an individual with the Craft (clockwork) or Knowledge (engineering) skill. One 4-hour maintenance period eliminates all accumulated penalties.

**Feats for Gearforged**

**Constructs’ Bane**

To know your own structure is to know that of the enemy, or at least that of some of them.

**Prerequisite(s):** Gearforged

**Benefit(s):** You gain a +2 bonus on your Knowledge (arcana) checks related to constructs, and this skill is a class skill for you. You also gain a +1 bonus on your melee and ranged attacks made against constructs.

**Special:** These bonuses stack with the favored enemy class feature of the ranger.

**Echoes of Former Flesh**

Your soul-link to your gearforged chassis is so strong it allows you to interact with magics and effects or take feats as if you were still a member of your original race.

**Prerequisite(s):** Gearforged

**Benefit(s):** You retain the racial traits of a human along with your gearforged traits.

**Echoes of Lives Past**

Your memory gears can draw on distant memories of a flesh-and-blood life long past.

**Special:** You can gain Mechanical Universe multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to two different skills from the list above.

**Rust-Proof Armor**

Your body constantly exudes an alchemical oil that acts as an anti-corrosive.

**Prerequisite(s):** Gearforged, must be taken at 1st level as gearforged.

**Benefit(s):** You gain DR 5/acid and a +2 circumstance bonus on your Escape Artist checks. If you are targeted by a rust monster’s antennae or a *rusting gras*p spell, the damage of the attack is reduced by 1d6 hit points.

**Special:** Trackers get a +2 circumstance bonus on their Survival checks to find you.

**Self-Mechanic**

Your diligence when it comes to daily maintenance pays off.

**Prerequisite(s):** Gearforged

**Benefit(s):** You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level after an uninterrupted daily repair period. You can also use a Knowledge (engineering) check in place of a Heal check when you try to repair yourself or another gearforged.

## Alternate Racial Rules
**Alternate Racial Rules**

Gearforged come in many shapes and sizes and are customized for a variety of tasks. Players may choose from the following list of traits when selecting traits for their gearforged characters. While these traits are intended for gearforged, other races may take them, subject to GM approval. Creatures without the gearforged subtype receive 1 gear point per trait taken.

**Adamant (Combat):** Your crafters made your body more resilient than normal. You receive a +1 trait bonus to natural armor. If you did not have a natural armor bonus before, you instead receive a +1 natural armor bonus.

**Cannonball (Combat):** You excel at using your heavy metal body as a formidable battering ram. You gain a +2 trait bonus to CMB when attempting to bull rush an opponent and an additional +1 trait bonus to attack rolls made while charging.

**Deception (Social):** Your earnest, mechanical manner puts those around you at ease regarding the guileless sincerity of your intentions. You no longer take a −2 penalty to Bluff and Diplomacy checks. You gain a +2 trait bonus to Bluff checks.

**Discharge (Magic):** Your body was designed to generate slightly more energy than your regular operations require. Choose one damage type from the following upon taking this trait: electricity, fire, or sonic. You may release this energy once per day in the manner of the burning hands spell for 1d4 points of the chosen energy type. If you have chosen to deal sonic damage, you instead deal 1d3 points of damage. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). You may unleash this energy once per day and an additional time for every 5 character levels.

**Emergency Surge (Combat):** Mechanisms hidden deep within your structure kick into action at critical moments to provide you a final burst of activity. You may make a single standard action the round after being reduced to fewer than 0 hp. This does not allow you to act if you have died due to the attack.

**Hidden Compartment (Equipment):** Your body has a secret compartment and you can discretely access it. You can hide an object no bigger than a dagger or wand and gain a +4 circumstance bonus on your Sleight of Hand checks when you draw it from the compartment.

**Mind Breaker (Magic):** Once per day, as a touch attack, you may mentally commune with a living creature, opening your mind up to them. Unfortunately for your target, most organic beings are ill-prepared to grapple with the mechanical mind of a gearforged. The subject of your touch is affected by the confusion spell with a caster level equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). This is a spell-like ability.

**Oriented (Race):** Your elegant mechanical mind was optimized for mapping physical spaces, effortlessly compiling information from the environment around you into a cohesive, navigable picture. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Survival checks.

**Phantom Limb (Equipment):** While clockworkers and engineers have long dreamt of many-limbed gearforged, few have made any substantive headway. Your creation was an experiment of questionable success. Twice per day, you may perform an extra item manipulation action without provoking an attack of opportunity. You may activate your third arm an additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. The rest of the time your third arm lies inert and you take a −2 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks unless it is concealed.

**Rock Crusher (Equipment):** Your mechanical digits were designed for the harshest tasks. When attempting to smash an object outside of combat, you may activate your hydraulic vise by concentrating on powering it up for 1 minute. If you move or engage in any other activity during this period, the charge is lost, rendering it impossible to use this trait in combat. After this duration has elapsed, you may execute a single sunder attack against an object with a +2 trait bonus. This attack has a base damage of 2d8.

**Split Personality (Social):** Your living soul was not perfectly integrated with your new mechanical form. As a result, your personality occasionally drifts to places ranging from the coldly mechanical to the borders of madness. You gain a +2 trait bonus to Will saves but also increase the penalty to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive by a further +2. If you also have the deception trait, you only take the increased penalty to Sense Motive.

**Unnatural Attack (Race):** Some schools of thought find the practice of designing martial weapons into gearforged forms to be distasteful. This does not prevent them from providing gearforged with more integrated and subtle forms of defense. You possess a horn, retractable barb, or similar secondary natural attack dealing 1d4 points of either piercing or slashing damage. Once chosen, this damage-type cannot be changed.

## Racial Subtypes
**Racial Subtypes**

**Racial Variants**

Though the minority of gearforged that do not conform to a human base standard are a diverse lot, clockwork engineers have cataloged a number of subtypes.

**Fangforged:** Gearforged in the mold of Midgard’s upstart dragonkin are exceedingly rare but not unheard of. That the sultans of the draconic Mharoti Empire are committed to tradition is not to say that they lack foresight. Having lured a number of talented Zobeck clockworkers to their lands, the sultans have immortalized some of their greatest warriors, placing gleaming and fearsome fangforged at the command of several units of the edjet warrior caste. Fangforged usually have the adamant and discharge racial traits.

**Gear Hacks:** Not all gearforged walking the streets are the product of top-tier clockwork magic. Some underwent the ritual of soulforging at the hands of less-than-expert spellcasters. Others are living in ill-advised experimental bodies. While the gearforged underclass known as gear hacks are typically regarded somewhat pitifully, the messy circumstances of their creation occasionally give them an edge over their more robust brethren. No two gear hacks are the same, but a typical specimen might have the phantom limb and split personality racial traits.

**Geardwarves:** While it was Rava that passed down the secret of soulforging to the people of Zobeck, the first gearforged in the Crossroads were created in Templeforge by the dwarfs in the Ironcrags. While dwarven soulforging seems archaic and inscrutable to many Zobeck clockworkers, the dwarves maintain theirs is soulforging as it was originally passed down by the god Volund. Geardwarves are thundering, steam‑belching spartans, spearheading the most dangerous tasks in the deep dwarven mines. Geardwarves typically have the cannonball and rock crusher racial traits.

**Infernal Machines:** Whether by accident or by design, some soulforgings are not magically sterile processes. On rare occasions, something diabolical rises from the lower planes to insinuate itself into a new living construct. Some tainted gearforged struggle mightily with their darker natures whereas others become sinister mechanical versions of their former mortal selves. While not exclusively evil, infernal machines are a uniformly troubled lot and often get along far better with tieflings than their fellow gearforged. Infernal Machines tend to have the mind breaker and either deception or split personality racial traits.

**Tauric Engines:** Rumors of a ferocious gearforged minotaur dominating the Barsella gladiatorial arena were long dismissed in Zobeck as exotic nonsense until curiosity got the better of a small group of clockworkers, and they traveled across the Wastes to see this wonder for themselves. Though not fully accepted by their flesh and blood brethren, many tauric engines have found great success as gladiators and mercenaries. Tauric engines often have the oriented and unnatural attack racial traits.

## Favored Class Options
**Favored Class Options**

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, gearforged have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon the character’s favored class. 

The following options are available to all gearforged who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

**Alchemist (Tinker Alchemist):** Add +1 ft. to the range of your breath weapon granted by the internal furnace ability. This has no effect unless taken 5 times, at which point it increases the range by +5 ft.

**Barbarian (Quiet Explorer):** Add +1/5 round to your daily assortment of gearforged rage.

**Bard:** Add +1/2 to any clockwork-related skill check.

**Battle Scion (NPC):** Add +1/2 to the damage dealt by the battle scion’s force blast ability.

**Cavalier:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the mount granted by the cavalier’s class ability.

**Druid:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the animal companion granted by the druid’s class ability.

**Fighter (Clockwork Fighter):** Add +1/3 damage to melee attacks with the forgeclaws class ability.

**Inquisitor (Lawmaster):** Add +1 to the bonuses granted by the assessment class ability.

**Magus:** Add +1/4 to the magus’s arcane pool.

**Monk:** Add +1/4 natural armor bonus.

**Oracle (Clockwork mystery):** Select one spell with the word “cure” or “inflict” in the title. This spell also affects regular creatures, not just constructs.

**Paladin (Faithforged):** Add +2 hp to the faithforged’s lay on hands ability when healing creatures of the gearforged subtype or of the construct type. 

**Ranger:** Add +1/2 natural armor bonus to the animal companion granted by the ranger’s class ability.

**Rogue:** Add +1/2 to any clockwork-related skill check. Sorcerer (Mechanical Bloodline): Add +1/2 daily use of the launch gears spell-like ability. Summoner (Salvager): Add +1 ft. to the movement rate of your eidolon granted by the sphere class ability. This has no effect unless taken 5 times, at which point it increases movement rate by +5 ft.

**Witch:** Add +1 natural armor bonus to the AC of the witch’s familiar. Wizard: Add +1 bonus to concentration checks made due to taking damage while casting spells defensively.

## Scaling the Race and the Gearforged Subtype
**SCALING THE RACE AND THE GEARFORGED SUBTYPE**

Scaling the gearforged turned out to be a rather tricky business due to their significant array of immunities and drawbacks. As presented above, the gearforged already are on par with the stronger of the core-races without any need for further modification. If you wish to have an easy, simple take on gearforged, just treat the gearforged subtype as a regular humanoid with all options for healing and susceptibilities—the soul inhabiting the body, bellows and filters as lungs, and such duplicate the functions of flesh. However, this means that, while the race looks like a construct, it doesn’t necessarily play like one.

If you elect for a slightly more construct-like take on the race approximately on par with the planar races, you may use the gearborn racial traits below as something granted by the gearforged subtype. For ease of reference, unless otherwise noted, the term “gearforged” refers to any humanoid with the gearforged subtype.

**Gearborn and the Gearforged Subtype**

One recently created gearforged, once known as the brilliant, kind merchant Heet Nul, has perfected a process that leaves some organic elements of the original creature intact. These beings are called gearborn in honor of their rebirth, their second chance. The innovations of Nul have made a gradual transformation possible.

Gearborn receive the following racial traits through their gearforged subtype.

**Clockwork-Powered Mind and Body:** Gearborn gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue.

**Gearborn Immunities:** Gearborn do not breathe, eat, or sleep unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a gearborn can drink potions to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities are required for the gearborn to survive or stay in good health. Gearborn are immune to magic sleep spells and effects.

**Racial Heritage:** Unlike full gearforged, gearborn still have some components of their original bodies. They count as both the race they belonged to prior to their transformation and as gearforged for purposes of any effect related to race.

**Second Chance:** Gearborn cannot be raised or resurrected, though a wish or miracle can restore them fully.

**Stable:** Gearborn are not at risk of death from massive damage, and they automatically stabilize when reduced below 0 hp.

**“Classic” Gearforged and the Gearforged Subtype** 

The astute reader will note that the gearborn are less mechanical, less alien than the default “classic” gearforged. If you prefer to play a character that receives more construct immunities but also pays a steep price for them, you might wish to select the following ability suite.

Gearforged receive the following racial traits through their gearforged subtype:

Clockwork-Powered Mind and Body: Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind‑affecting effects and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue.

Gearforged Immunities: Gearforged are immune to disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, and poison. Gearforged take no penalty from energy draining effects, though they still can be killed if they accrue more negative levels than they have Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels they’ve gained are removed without any additional saving throws.

Gearforged are also immune to necromancy effects that rely on transference or modification of life force (such as the vampiric touch or ghoul touch spells), subject to GM approval.

Gearforged do not breathe, eat, or sleep, unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a gearforged can drink potions to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities are required for the gearforged to survive or stay in good health.

## Optional Rule: Gear Points
**Optional Rule: Gear Points**

Gear points are an easy way to depict the gradual progression of a gearborn toward becoming a full‑blown gearforged or simply for a regular character taking gearforged traits or feats. Gearborn begin play with 5 gear points granted by their race. Subject to the GM’s approval, non-gearforged races may ignore the gearforged racial prerequisite by gaining the noted amount of gear points. Unless otherwise noted, each gearforged trait taken increases the gear points of a character by +1.

Gearforged feats taken by gearborn or non‑gearforged characters increase the gear point total as well. If a feat can be taken multiple times, the gear points incurred are cumulative. The following table lists all gear points incurred by taking feats:


-tx-
| **Feat** | **Points** |  | **Point Total** | **Modifications** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Armor Upgrade | +2 | 1 point | The character takes a –2 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks |
| Aquatic Explorer | +1 | 2–4 points | The character gains the Rust Vulnerability racial trait. |
| Autonomous Appendage | +2 | 5–6 points | The character receives the immortal racial trait but can no longer be raised or resurrected. |
| Construct’s Bane | +1 | 7–8 points | The character no longer needs to eat or sleep but loses his old racial type. He is now treated as a humanoid with the gearforged subtype for the purpose of all effects. |
| Echoes of Former Flesh | −1 | 9–10 points | The character loses all his old racial traits and receives the traits of a gearborn. |
| Echoes of Lives Past | −1 | 11–13 points | The character receives the water susceptibility drawback. |
| From the Crucible | +2 | 14 points | The character can choose any two of the following immunities: disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, poison. However, the character also receives the repairs required drawback. |
| Gearforged Utilit | +1 | 15 points | The character can choose any one of the following immunities not chosen before: disease, death effects, nonlethal damage, poison. However, the character also receives the rewind the gears drawback. |
| Gorgeous Gearforged | +1 | 16+ | points The character replaces all gearborn racial traits with the gearforged racial traits |
| Jury-Rigged | +0 |  ||
| Limb Lock | +1 |
| Magnet Snatch | +3 |
| Rust-Proof Armor | +1 |
| Scrap Heap | +1 |
| Self-Mechanic | +0 |

## More and Variable Power
**MORE AND VARIABLE POWER**

A relatively easy way to further increase the power of the gearforged for truly high-powered campaigns would be to simply take the drawbacks of the race away. The race receives a significant increase in power in the average group once it can be healed by positive energy, like everyone else. Additionally, you may want to start as a gearborn and slowly turn more and more into a gearforged. Hence, as an alternative means of increasing power for gearborn, you could provide a number of gear points and have the player choose free alternate racial traits and racial feats up to the target value. Gear points are an abstract way to judge how much of a character has been transformed into a gearforged.
