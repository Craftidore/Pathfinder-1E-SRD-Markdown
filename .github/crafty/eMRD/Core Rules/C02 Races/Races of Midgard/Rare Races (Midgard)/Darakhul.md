# Darakhul
## Overview
In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. They call themselves the People, but by those who know of them and their nefarious goals, they are called the Subterranean Lords, [[Ch. 03 - Dark Kingdoms|the Ghoul Imperium]], or, simply, the Empire of Ghouls. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their hunger knows no limits.

**Physical Description:** Darakhul (Da-rak-hul) look much like the race they were before their rebirth into undeath. They are exclusively humanoids of small to medium size. Their skin color becomes a muted dusky blue gray and their hair falls out.

**Darakhul Age, Height, and Weight:** Darakhul differ from most races because they don’t physically age after their conversion to undeath. As a result, when determining the age and size of a darakhul character, use the tables provided for its original race. Darakhul gain the benefits to mental abilities scores for aging, but take no penalties to their physical scores once they’ve risen as a ghoul. Choose how old the character was when it became darakhul and apply all mental age modifiers and any physical age modifiers up to that point. All darakhul weigh about 25% less than their original race.

**History and Origin:** The attempt to identify the first darakhul is as hopeless as identifying the first lich or vampire. The modern Imperium tracks progeny and heralds the great ancestors of the race, made easier by the fact that, as unliving creatures, some of its earliest champions endure to the present day. The Imperium has not always existed, though, and the first darakhul progenitors hail from millennia ago. Scholars of undeath debate whether the first ghouls spawned spontaneously from starved corpses or whether a demonic patron seeded the world with the monsters, but the identities of the first darakhul remain shrouded in conjecture.

The modern history of the race is less open to debate. The Imperium began just under three centuries ago after Tonderil the Bonebreaker fought a 23-year war to unite the most powerful darakhul lieges under his own crown. Though his name is remembered with titles like First among Necromancers and General of the Royal Bastards, his reign was significantly shorter than his campaign to claim it. In his ninth year as Emperor, he died leading the charge that broke the duergar lines in the Battle of the Dwarfvault near Gonderif. His great legacy includes military unification of the People and the founding of the Temple of the Hungry God.

As Tonderil’s successors advanced the cause and maintained the Imperium, drow, duergar, and other cities fell one after the other. The Empire of the Ghouls profited in coin, in land, in slaves, and in food. The forefathers who inherited the Imperium took stock of the race’s accomplishments and applied the principles of martial meritocracy to every darakhul. The People have produced powerful champions in the many decades since. Haresha Winterblood expanded the empire in every direction, taking caverns just below the surface, delving deep to build strongholds in vast subterranean vaults, and sacking cities everywhere. The infamous Sergival of the Shackles forged an immense slave trade under the guise of the cave dragon Dreadwing, feeding on mortal tributes from across the world. Arcanist Antovian Surmidus used illusion and necromancy to forge the tradition of disguise now known as the Cloak wherein hundreds of darakhul infiltrate every people and path, disguised as breathing mortals working as soldiers and shepherds, butchers and bookbinders.

The fourth and reigning Pale Emperor Nicoforus sought revenge on an alliance of drow and duergar whose best assassins slew his predecessor. Nicoforus sent legions of ghouls to their cities and razed them. Every dark elf and every gray dwarf was eaten or turned to replace darakhul losses. Today, the two races sneer bitterly at the mention of the Tide of Ghouls. Other races may hate or fear them, but at least, subterranean humanoids know the threat posed by the Imperium. Surface races remain blissfully unaware or unconcerned about the aggressive race of militant ghouls. Their armies number in the thousands, and they can strike from any crypt or cavern.

**Society:** Darakhul society prospers insofar as it can blend its inherent contradictions. The People endure constant hunger, forever at the whim of their supernatural appetites. They balance their slavery to this single passion with a brutally enforced respect for authority. Without doubt, this structure favors the progenitors who already rule, but the Imperium makes no pretense of equality or fairness. The old guard, as much in charge as when they were the new guard, maintain that without militant order the People would implode with ravenous fury.

Darakhul embrace a cruel philosophy fitting for a race of undead creatures. Because of their long unlives, complicated political games and slowly developing plots have strong appeal. Darakhul sires necessarily master the innuendo and tactics of a given Court of the People, lest they fall prey to a cleverer ghoul. Their expertise helps them train assassins and spies, and their caution shields them from infiltration in return. Constant conflict and unceasing ambition create boundless opportunities for a darakhul eager to advance her career and the plight of her people. Their eagerness to succeed complements their dark sense of patriotism.

Darakhul remember their past lives, though they tend to denigrate the person they were in their breathing days. Though many who study the undead assume this is a product of re-education by their new masters, the constant hunger and sudden lack of mortality contribute as well. Nothing changes perspective like rising from the grave stronger and more frightening.

**Relations:** To them, those who are not the People are food (shahTi)—the living must be pacified and domesticated, so their breeding sustains a ruling class of cannibalistic undead. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges powerful alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of both living and dead. They are the darakhul, and they seek nothing less than to devour the world.

**Darakhul and Ghouls**

While ordinary ghouls enjoy several eerie features and fantastic ability scores, they rarely fit in among the living. Individual ghouls typically live in graveyards and feed on decaying flesh, forsaking their potential in favor of easy meals and infrequent persecution. They rarely remember much of their lives before becoming ghouls, and many exhibit signs of insanity and demonstrate extremely poor hygiene.

Darakhul slide more easily into social settings and carry a level of ambition their cousins frequently lack. This could be due to specific demonic investment or because the progenitor darakhul instill their progeny with a sense of purpose. Regardless, the Advanced Races Compendium presents the opportunity for PCs and NPCs to crawl from the apotheosis of undeath and play a character more capable of fitting in with living humanoids.

**Darakhul and Lantern Beetles**

In Midgard, the darakhul have an affection for lantern beetles, owing to centuries of cultivation for a variety of uses. While their glow is useful, they are primarily pets and familiars, providing a rare area of sentimental attachment. Below ground, the darakhul breed lantern beetles in the tens of thousands, using them in clever traps to ward off creatures afraid of their bright green glow. They also use them for aesthetic reasons, providing color to the stark blackand-white of their darkvision.

Lantern beetles exist both above and below the surface. When venturing above ground, darakhul use their colored light as a signal to other darakhul for secret gatherings and arrange the light to avoid suspicions that arise from their cold skin and pale color. In many surface cultures, lantern beetles carry the stigma of death or other mystical properties, but almost none know the beetles are a practical indicator for the presence of the Imperium.

**Alignment and Religion:** Darakhul from any culture gravitate easily toward worship of the heinous gods of cannibalism and undeath. Their hunger sanctioned and their immortality deemed a sign of destiny, the People seek at least tacit approval from the clergy of their vast underground cathedrals where regular feeding occurs with ritualistic savagery. Those hidden in other societies know of nearby darakhul and often gather in the name of local dark gods or at least in the name of mutual survival. Even among those who scoff at religious trappings, the magical nature of darakhul existence compels most to at least give lip service to the divine.

Devout darakhul terrify even those who share their taste for the living flesh and blood. Adding priestly power to their beastly nature, a darakhul believer truly subjugates his hunger to that of his divine patron. Frequently, these ghouls form cults that allow them to further the Imperium’s influence while sating their hunger. Below the surface where great enclaves of darakhul vie for domination of the world above, they build fantastic churches, hold bloody masses, and pronounce internal judgment on traitors to the faith. While darakhul society almost uniformly forbids the practice of consuming other ghouls, powerful churches pass a ritual sentence for treason called “moad kavol” (darakhul, “the Eater shall be eaten”). For those who betray a congregation of darakhul faithful, there is no worse end than the abject humiliation and final death of this mass communion.

Servants of rival gods remain the most ubiquitous and, perhaps, the most dangerous foe to the darakhul. Their ability to channel positive energy can mean a terrible burning True Death for the ghoulish, especially if caught unawares and unable to escape. This reinforces the need for a quality disguise to conceal a darakhul player character from the clerics who see all undead as an abomination.

A darakhul seeking enlightenment or carrying out the dictums of the empire is not about to eat the miller’s daughter—but the local priest may not be willing to take that chance. A darakhul character faces unending prejudice from surface societies, and he faces an existence as a perpetual outsider, even among fellow adventurers. This relationship must be reestablished with the death and replacement of each party member, allowing for interesting roleplaying that should be considerate of the other players’ feelings.

At the very least, in-game social interactions will be complicated. Make sure everyone at the table is willing to work with a character who is an undead racial pariah either struggling to conquer the enemy within or concealing an awful secret as he faces the enemies abroad.

**Adventurers:** Without question, the darakhul are feared and reviled by almost any who know if the Imperium. Even subterranean races, rife with assassins and slavers, view the People with jealousy and suspicion. That the darakhul are a race comprised of the deceased members of their neighbors adds to the dread. Darakhul from the Imperium profit from this reputation. Their transition to undeath and immortal bond with their darakhul sires galvanizes them against potential rivals, affording them a level of organization and unity rarely found among intelligent undead or mortal evil races.

Darakhul who break away from the Imperium still retain some of the arrogance and craftiness of their parent culture. Their effort to strike a balance between self-discipline and supernatural hunger suffers the lack of connection to their peers, who use a common mission as distraction from their appetites to accomplish their goals as an undead nation.

**Into the Larger World**

Many darakhul enjoy both the fulfilling purpose of serving the Empire of the Ghouls and the independence of venturing into the wider world on the business of the empire. Maintaining their state requires envoys and ambassadors, messengers, scouts, and commerce, as well as knowledge of events in the surface world. These relatively diplomatic undead engage with races they might otherwise consider food out of duty and with a specific purpose.

However, other members of their kind have no such obligations. For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to the Imperium, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as a predator of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest du jour. These characters want to grow beyond their ghouli h

appetites and regain some part in the cultures and societies of their former lives, and they cannot overcome their nature unless they confront it.

This disparity between the more common intelligence-gathering missions or political maneuvering and their self-improvement and transcendence—as well as the blind aggression of less controlled undead—means other people view the darakhul with suspicion and hostility. It is difficult but not impossible for a darakhul to allay those fears.

**The Cloak and Anonymity**

A quality disguise remains one of the best tools for a darakhul among the breathing, and almost all ghouls traveling on the surface maintain a masterwork disguise kit and a concealing outfit associated with a cover identity. Darakhul from the Imperium call the adoption of a public disguise “the Cloak,” and darakhul law proscribes punishment for a ghoul who disrupts another’s Cloak without good reason. The Imperium adopts the practice out of a need to protect its assets both above and below ground, but its rulers and officials also view the betrayal of unaffiliated darakhul as a risk to the nation’s goals and reputation.

Few can challenge a ghoul’s skill at disguise. Their options include the wrappings of a leper, the enshrouding robes of arcane casters within the Magocracy of Allain, the veils of the Siwali ladies, or the desert raiders of the Tamasheq. Darakhul typically master one or two disguises that help them manipulate a given community but, sometimes, maintain a third identity in case they need to shift blame for their actions on another or for when they need to throw pursuers off their scent during a carefully planned escape. Without exception, the Imperium expects that a ghoul who loses his Cloak will either project blame for his actions on someone else or embrace the Hunger and convince inquisitive minds that his existence is merely an unfortunate occurrence of undeath. 

In cases where a cover identity is impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins are often enough to make an eccentric request for privacy much more reasonable. Getting raw meat surreptitiously delivered is another challenge left to the imagination of the player.

## Darakhul Characters
**Darakhul Racial Traits**

Darakhul are not born but, instead, rise from the death of a humanoid infected with darakhul fever. Only darakhul sires can inflict a creature with this disease, which burns the life from its victims until a cold corpse rises to replace the once-living subject. The resulting darakhul has the following traits. 

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma:** Darakhul are nimble and social. As undead, they have no Constitution score, but darakhul characters built using a point-buy system must assign at least a score of 10 to their Constitution. 

**Undead:** Darakhul have the undead type, and possess all the traits and immunities described in the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Race Guide*. A darakhul retains its humanoid subtype and gains the augmented subtype as well. 

**Small or Medium size:** Darakhul can be Small or Medium creatures. If Medium, a darakhul has no bonuses or penalties due to size. If Small, the darakhul gains a +1 size bonus to AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a −1 penalty to CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth check. Regardless of size, the darakhul retains some resemblance to its original humanoid subtype. 

**Bite Attack:** A darakhul has a natural bite attack that deals damage according to his size (1d4 for Small, 1d6 for Medium). This attack is a primary natural attack. 

**Channel Resistance:** A darakhul gains a +2 bonus on saves to resist the effects of channeled positive energy. 

**Hunger:** Each day, a darakhul must consume at least a small meal of fresh or rotting meat. A darakhul that does not feed for more than 24 hours must make Charisma checks to avoid starvation (see the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*). Damage from starvation is lethal damage for darakhul. Once starvation sets in, only a meal consisting of one full pound of flesh ends the condition. Once a ghoul takes lethal damage, he must make a Will save whenever he makes a Constitution check. Failure indicates the darakhul obeys the compulsion to feed on any creature available, including allies or even himself. A starving darakhul must confirm a critical hit with his bite attack in order to tear off enough meat to satisfy this compulsion. 

**Light Blindness:** *Prerequisite*: Darkvision or see in darkness trait; *Weakness*: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area. 

**Weapon Familiarity:** xxx

**Languages:** xxx

### Darakhul Sires
**Darakhul Sires** 

The strongest darakhul come from the strongest progenitors. While the average darakhul is more powerful than in his breathing days, a darakhul sire (females are called dames) creates undead progeny with both pedigree and power. Such creatures remain suitable as PCs but have an effective character level of their class levels +1 until 6th level. This can be waived by a careful GM, or it can be balanced by a −1 penalty to attack rolls, saves, and skill checks until 6th level. Darakhul sires have the same traits as regular darakhul, in addition to the traits below. 

**+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma:** Darakhul sires are practiced skulkers with quick wits and social skills. These bonuses replace the common darakhul’s racial ability modifiers. 

**Channel Resistance +4:** Darakhul sires gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist the effects of channeled positive energy. This replaces the common darakhul’s channel resistance trait. 

**Natural Armor:** Darakhul sires have a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. 

**Disease (Su):** The bite of a darakhul sire inflicts humanoids with a horrifying disease called darakhul fever. The save DC for the disease is equal to 10 + 1/2 the sire’s racial Hit Dice + Charisma modifier. *Darakhul Fever*: Bite—injury; *save* Fort DC 13; *onset* 1 day; *frequency* 1/day; *effect* 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; *cure* 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of darakhul fever rises as a darakhul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes darakhul in this way retains the abilities it had in life. It is not under direct control of any other darakhul, but a sire gains a +8 racial bonus to Diplomacy checks made to influence any of its progeny.

## Campaign Traits

**Alternate Racial Traits**

The following racial traits may be selected instead of the standard xxx racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**xxx:** xxx

## Darakhul Character
**Racial Subtypes**

You can combine various alternate racial traits to create darakhul subraces or variant races, such as the following.

The darakhul race fuels the Imperium with individual identities. The diverse races and skills of the darakhul result in variant undead who resemble one another but display remarkable differences. The following are examples of this variety of roles and abilities, born from the darakhul’s breeding, grooming, or both. 

**Aquatic:** Because ghouls have an aquatic analog, it follows that darakhul fever infects merfolk, sea elves, tritons, and others. Aquatic darakhul gain the deepsight and swim traits but lose their normal darkvision. 

**Infiltrator:** Lacking the usual pallor of darakhul, an infiltrator strongly resembles its host race. An infiltrator does not have the light blindness trait and exchanges his racial ability modifiers for a single +2 racial bonus to the ability score of his choice. He also gains the flexible bonus feat trait. 

**Necrophage:** Consummate masters of undeath, necrophages gain the fell magic trait. They exchange their racial bonus to Dexterity for a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence. Necrophages lose their bite attack. 

**Ravenous:** Darakhul who feed on undead flesh risk becoming frenzied feeders who consume flesh without ever being sated. Such beasts have the carrion sense and fast traits. 

**Skulker:** These underground guides and scouts replace their channel resistance and racial ability modifiers for a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a burrow speed of 20 ft., and 2 claw primary attacks. They also gain the sunlight powerlessness advanced trait. 

Other variant darakhul retain vestiges of their original race, creating subraces that vaguely resemble the creatures they once were.

**Drow:** Some darakhul of drow decent replace their normal darkvision with darkvision 120 ft. and the lesser spell resistance trait. They also gain the vulnerable to sunlight trait.

**Dwarf:** Some darakhul of dwarf descent have the greed, stability, and stonecunning traits. They lose their +2 racial bonus to Dexterity. 

**Elf:** Some darakhul of elf descent exchange their bite attack for the elven magic trait. In addition, they gain the weapon familiarity trait. Elven darakhul are proficient in light blades and treat all elven weapons as martial weapons. 

**Gnomes:** Some darakhul of gnome descent are Small in size and have the gnome magic trait. 

**Halfling:** Some darakhul of halfling descent are ironically lucky. They have the lesser lucky trait and Small size. 

**Trollkin:** Some darakhul of trollkin descent have the inhuman vigor and natural armor traits. They have a −2 racial penalty to Intelligence.

## Favored Class Options
**Favored Class Options**

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, darakhul have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon the character’s favored class. 

The following options are available to all darakhul who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

**Antipaladin:** Add +1/2 to the antipaladin’s channel resistance 

**Barbarian:** Add +1 to the barbarian’s number of rounds she can rage each day. 

**Bard:** Add +1/2 to Bluff or +1/2 to Disguise checks made to conceal the bard’s identity or race. 

**Cleric:** Add +1/3 to the DC of the cleric’s channel energy ability. 

**Inquisitor:** Add +1/2 to the inquisitor’s Intimidate checks and Knowledge checks to identify creatures. 

**Monk:** Add +1/6 to the darakhul’s monk AC bonus. 

**Witch:** Add +1/4 of a new witch hex. 

**Wizard:** Add +1/4 to the wizard’s caster level when casting spells from the necromancy school.

## Racial Archetypes
**RACIAL ARCHETYPES**

**Darakhul Archetypes** 

Most racial archetypes play host to the occasional outlier who learns the practices and traditions of a foreign culture. In the case of darakhul archetypes, such alien practitioners are incredibly rare. Darakhul do not tolerate outsiders learning much at all about their ways, and several archetypes or other mechanics require the character to be undead as a prerequisite.

### Darakim (Monk, Unchained)
**DARAKIM (MONK, UNCHAINED)** 

Darakhul, more disciplined than most other undead, practice a martial tradition that makes full use of their natural weapons and undead nature. 

**Bonus Feat:** Remove Gorgon’s Fist and Medusa’s Wrath from the list of bonus feats available to the darakim. At 6th level, add Improved Darkvision to the darakim’s list of bonus feats. At 11th level, add Paralytic Tongue. 

**Clawed Monk:** Beginning at 1st level, the darakim gains Ghoul Claws as a bonus feat. A darakim applies effects that would normally be delivered through flurry of blows or unarmed strikes through his natural weapons. At 3rd level, the darakim can make an additional attack with one of his natural weapons by spending a point of ki from his ki pool. This replaces flurry of blows and unarmed strike. 

**Improved Damage:** At 4th level, and every 4th level thereafter, the darakim’s natural weapons increase the damage they deal by one size category. This replaces unarmed damage. 

**Necromantic Strike (Su):** At 5th level, the darakim channels the power of undead through his martial prowess. Whenever he makes a full attack with his natural weapons, he can spend a point from his ki pool to designate one attack as a necromantic strike. If this strike deals damage, the darakim gains 5 temporary hp. At 9th level, the darakim’s target is fatigued in addition to the temporary hp. At 13th level, the target gains a negative level instead of fatigue. At 17th level, the darakim gains 10 temporary hp instead of 5. This replaces style strike. 

**Ki Powers:** The following ki powers complement the darakim: abundant step, ki hurricane, quivering palm, wholeness of body.

### Imperial Hunter (Ranger)
**IMPERIAL HUNTER (RANGER)** 

Servants of the Ghoul Empire, imperial hunters pursue escaped slaves and patrol the empire’s frontiers. 

**Class Skills**: Remove Handle Animal and Ride from the imperial hunter’s list of class skills. Add Bluff and Disguise to the imperial hunter’s list of class skills. 

**Bolas Warrior:** An imperial hunter is an expert with the bolas. In addition to proficiency with the bolas, imperial hunters gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the bolas and ignore penalties from their first range increment. This replaces wild empathy. 

**Combat Style:** An imperial hunter choosing archery as his combat style adds Quickdraw to the list of feats he can take at 2nd level. If he chooses the natural attack combat style, he adds Ghoul Claws instead. Alternatively, the imperial hunter can choose the net combat style at 2nd level. 

***Net Combat:*** If the ranger selects net combat style, the following feats are available when selecting a combat style feat: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net), Net Adept, Net Maneuvering, and Weapon Focus (net) 

At 6th level, the ranger adds Net Trickery and Two-Weapon Fighting. At 10th level, the imperial hunter adds Net and Trident and Improved Two Weapon Fighting to the list. 

**Persistent Hunter (Ex):** At 3rd level, an imperial hunter gains Subdued Pangs as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the Endurance bonus feat. 

**Taste of Prey (Ex):** At 4th level, the imperial hunter tracks prey like a natural predator. He gains the scent universal monster rule when tracking a creature he has dealt hp damage to in the last 24 hours. If the imperial hunter dealt a bleed condition or a confirmed critical hit to his quarry, he gains a bonus on Survival rolls to track that prey equal to the amount of bleed damage or the critical multiplier of the confirmed attack. These bonuses last for 24 hours or until the target receives any magical healing. This replaces hunter’s bond. 

**Spelunker (Ex):** At 7th level, an imperial hunter gains a +2 bonus to Acrobatics and Climb checks in underground terrain. He may move through any sort of underground difficult terrain at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This includes moving through caltrops, *spike stones*, or similar effects. This ability replaces woodland stride. 

**Anticipation (Ex):** At 12th level, an imperial hunter may use the Stealth skill as an immediate action to hide from a favored enemy or the target of his quarry ability. If underground, he can make this check even if the local terrain offers no cover or concealment. So long as he remains motionless, he gains concealment in darkness even to observers with darkvision. This replaces camouflage. At 17th level, he can make this check (or a regular Stealth check as part of movement) even while being observed. This replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.

### Necrophagy Subschool (Wizard)
**NECROPHAGY SUBSCHOOL (WIZARD)** 

Members of the necrophage subschool draw sustenance and knowledge from the slain corpses of friends and foes. 

**Associated School**: Necromancy.

A necrophage receives the *power over undead* supernatural ability, like a necromancer specialist. A necrophage must choose Command Undead as the bonus feat for this ability. 

**Replacement Powers**: The following school powers replace the grave touch power and the life sight power of the necromancy school. 

**Memory of Flesh (Su):** As a full round action, you can consume the flesh of a living or recently slain creature. You gain fast healing equal to half your level for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. During this time, you can make one Intelligence or Knowledge skill check, adding the Intelligence bonus of the creature that furnished your meal. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, but you can only consume the flesh of a particular creature once. 

**Raw Power (Su):** At 8th level, the necrophage may consume the flesh of a living or recently slain creature as a standard action and gain a spell effect still affecting the deceased creature. The effect and its remaining duration transfers to the necrophage so long as the necrophage is not immune to the spell effect.

### Nightblade (Magus)
**NIGHTBLADE (MAGUS)** 

The nightblade funnels the powers of darkness and necromancy through his magic weapon. 

**Armor Proficiency:** Nightblades do not gain proficiency with medium or heavy armor. 

**Skills:** Remove Ride and Swim from the nightblade’s list of class skills. Replace them with Perception and Stealth. 

**Spells:** Remove the following spells from the nightblade’s spell list: 

0—*flare*, 1—*color spray*, 2—*pyrotechnics*, 3—*daylight*, 4—*elemental body I*, 5—*elemental body II*, 6—*elemental body III*. 

Add the following spells in their place: 0—*bleed*, 1—*consume light*, 2—*protective penumbra*, 3—*deeper darkness*, 4—*enervation*, 5—*boneshatter*, 6—*circle of death*. 

**Natural Spellstrike (Su):** At 4th level, the nightblade can use his spellstrike ability to deliver a spell through a natural attack. This natural attack still suffers any penalties from the spell combat ability or from combining a natural attack with attacks with a manufactured weapon. At 11th level, the nightblade only suffers a −2 penalty for natural attacks made in conjunction with manufactured weapon attacks. This replaces spell recall and improved spell recall. 

**Ill Spirited:** At 5th level, remove dancing and vorpal from the weapon properties available to the nightblade’s arcane pool ability. Replace them with cruel, heartseeker, and vicious. This modifies the nightblade’s ability to add bonuses to his weapon with the arcane pool ability.

**Natural Armor instead of heavier armor:** At 7th level, the nightblade gains a +2 enhancement bonus to his natural armor. If the nightblade has no natural armor, his base natural armor bonus is treated as +0. At 13th level, this bonus increases to +4. This replaces the magus’s medium armor and heavy armor class features.

### Quicksilver Alchemist (Alchemist)
**QUICKSILVER ALCHEMIST (ALCHEMIST)**

Members of the Quicksilver Society often travel alongside the Imperial Legions, serving as surgeon and battlefield salvager.

**Class Skills:** Remove Survival from the quicksilver alchemist’s list of class skills. Replace it with Knowledge (religion).

**Extracts Known:** At each extract level available to the quicksilver alchemist, replace the cure wounds extract on the list of alchemist’s extracts with the inflict wounds spell of the same level.

**Ghoulish Mutagen (Su):** A quicksilver alchemist may create a mutagen which works almost identically to a normal alchemist’s mutagen. If the quicksilver alchemist chooses to increase his Charisma score to improve his physical skills, he takes a −1 penalty to Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Perform checks so long as the mutagen remains active. A quicksilver alchemist using the cognatogen discovery to increase his social mien takes a −1 penalty to Fortitude saves and loses 1 hp per Hit Die from his maximum hp as long as the cognatogen remains active. This ability also impacts greater and grand cognatogens or mutagens that would affect a normal alchemist’s Charisma score. This modifies the normal alchemist’s mutagen ability.

**Bolster the Ranks (Ex):** At 10th level, the quicksilver alchemist adds create undead to his formula book as a 4th-level extract. Rather than consuming the extract, he injects it into a corpse he intends to animate, which rises as an uncontrolled undead creature 1 hour later. The extract can only create corporeal undead, and it cannot create darakhul. This ability replaces the alchemist discovery normally gained at 10th level.

**Alchemist Discoveries:** The following alchemist discoveries complement the quicksilver alchemist archetype: alchemical zombie, combine extracts, enhance potion, feral mutagen, infuse mutagen, infusions, preserve organs, sunlight bomb.
