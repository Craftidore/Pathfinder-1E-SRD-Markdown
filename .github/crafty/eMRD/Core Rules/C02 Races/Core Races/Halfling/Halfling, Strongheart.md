# Halfling, Strongheart
## Overview
While the lightfoot halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the stronghearts are a more organized, orderly, and industrious race. They build to last, and fiercely defend their homelands against threats that their lightfoot kin would simply flee. Northland humans familiar with the easygoing ways of the lightfoot halflings are surprised to learn that some halflings are capable of a warrior tradition and aren’t afraid to show a hint of arrogance or confidence in their own abilities and strengths. Strongheart halflings enjoy athletic contests and value exceptional skills of all kinds.

**Regions**

**Faerun:** Strongheart halflings make up most of the population of the land of Luiren. They are uncommon in other lands.

**Racial Traits**

**+2 Dexterity, –2 Strength:** Strongheart halflings are quick, agile, and good with ranged weapons, but they are small and therefore not as strong as other humanoids.

**Small:** As a Small creature, a strongheart halfling gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

Strongheart halfling base land speed is 20 feet.

Halflings gain one extra feat at 1st level, because they have a strong drive to compete and many opportunities to practice their skills.

+2 racial bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], Jump, and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks. Strongheart halflings are agile, surefooted, and athletic.

+2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear: This bonus stacks with the strongheart halfling’s +1 bonus on saving throws in general.

+1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings. Throwing and slinging stones is a universal sport among Strongheart halflings, and they develop especially good aim.

+2 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. Strongheart halflings have keen ears.

**Favored Class:** [[Rogue]]. A multiclass strongheart halfling’s rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

**Alternate Racial Trait: Strongheart halfling**

**Darkvision:** Strongheart halflings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. This replaces +2 morale bonus on saving throws versus fear.
