# Contracting (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
As a free action, the wielder of a *contracting* weapon can command his weapon to shorten in length. It essentially becomes a one-handed melee weapon, and can be used to strike adjacent foes. When the weapon is contracted, it decreases one step in damage â€“ for Medium wielders use the Small size damage entry for the weapon as listed in the CRB. Returning a *contracting* weapon to its original length is also a free action. The *contracting* weapon special ability may only be added to a weapon with reach that is unable to strike adjacent foes:

Moderate transmutation; CL 6th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Reduce Person (Spell)|reduce person]]*; Price +1 bonus.
