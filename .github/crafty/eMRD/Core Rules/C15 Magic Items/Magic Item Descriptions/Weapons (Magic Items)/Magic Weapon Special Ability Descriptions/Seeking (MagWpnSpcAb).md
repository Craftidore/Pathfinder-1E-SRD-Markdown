# Seeking (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
Only ranged weapons can have the *seeking* ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.

Strong divination; CL 12th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*; Price +1 bonus.
