# Icy Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
An *icy burst* weapon functions as a *[[Frost (MagWpnSpcAb)|frost]]* weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the *[[Frost (MagWpnSpcAb)|frost]]* ability, an *icy burst* weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.

Even if the *frost* ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Chill Metal (Spell)|chill metal]]* or *[[Ice Storm (Spell)|ice storm]]*; Price +2 bonus.
