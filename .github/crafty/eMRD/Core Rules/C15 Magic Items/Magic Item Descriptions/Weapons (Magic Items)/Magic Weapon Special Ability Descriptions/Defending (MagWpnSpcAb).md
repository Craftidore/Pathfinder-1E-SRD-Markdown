# Defending (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *defending* weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon’s enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon’s enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the bonus to AC lasts until his next turn.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]* or *[[Shield of Faith (Spell)|shield of faith]]*; Price +1 bonus.
