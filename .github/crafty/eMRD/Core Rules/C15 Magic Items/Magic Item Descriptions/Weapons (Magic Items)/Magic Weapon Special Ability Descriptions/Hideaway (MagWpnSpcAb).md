# Hideaway (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
*Several studs texture this weapon, as do numerous hinges and slots, though none seems to impede its effectiveness.*

When activated, a hideaway weapon folds up into a bundle two size categories smaller than you, making it easy to conceal. You gain a +2 bonus on [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks to conceal a hideaway weapon when itâ€™s folded up (as if it were a dagger).

A second command word (also a swift action) causes the weapon to unfold to its normal shape.

Faint transmutation (DC 17); Activation swift (command); CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]*; Price +2,000 gp
