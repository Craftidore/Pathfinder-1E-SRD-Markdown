# Ki Focus (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder’s *ki*, allowing her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk’s ki strike, quivering palm, and the [[Stunning Fist (Feat)|Stunning Fist]] feat (including any condition that the monk can apply using this feat). Only melee weapons can have the *ki focus* ability.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], creator must be a monk; Price +1 bonus.
