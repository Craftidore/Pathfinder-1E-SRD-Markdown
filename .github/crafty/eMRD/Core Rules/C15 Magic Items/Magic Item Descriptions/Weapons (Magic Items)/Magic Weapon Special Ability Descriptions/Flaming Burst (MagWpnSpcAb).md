# Flaming Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *flaming burst* weapon functions as a *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* ability, a *flaming burst* weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage. Even if the *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.

Strong evocation; CL 12th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] and *[[Flame Blade (Spell)|flame blade]]*, *[[Flame Strike (Spell)|flame strike]]*, or *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*; Price +2 bonus.
