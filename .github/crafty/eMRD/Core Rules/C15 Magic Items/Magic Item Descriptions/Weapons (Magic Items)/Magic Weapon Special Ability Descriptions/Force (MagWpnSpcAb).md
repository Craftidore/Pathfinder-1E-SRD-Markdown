# Force (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
On a successful hit, a *force weapon* emits a powerful jolt of magical force. The magical force does not harm the weaponâ€™s wielder. *Force weapons* deal +1d6 points of force damage on a successful hit. If the weapon successfully hits a target protected by a force effect, such as a *[[Shield (Spell)|shield]]* spell or *bracers of armor*, it might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check (1d20+10) against the effect (DC 11 + caster level). If the check succeeds, the force effect is dispelled (if a spell) or suppressed (if a magic item). Ranged weapons bestow this property on their ammunition. Incorporeal creatures get no miss chance against *force weapons.*

*Caster Level:* 11th; *Prerequisites*: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]**; Market Price*: +3 bonus.
