# Shocking Burst (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *shocking burst* weapon functions as a *[[Shock (MagWpnSpcAb)|shock]]* weapon that explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the *[[Shock (MagWpnSpcAb)|shock]]* ability, a *shocking burst weapon* deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points. Even if the *[[Shock (MagWpnSpcAb)|shock]]* ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Call Lightning (Spell)|call lightning]]* or *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|lightning bolt]]*; Price +2 bonus.
