# Wounding (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *wounding* weapon deals 1 point of bleed damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from a wounding weapon increase the bleed damage. Bleeding creatures take the bleed damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage dealt by this weapon.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Bleed (Spell)|bleed]]*; Price +2 bonus.
