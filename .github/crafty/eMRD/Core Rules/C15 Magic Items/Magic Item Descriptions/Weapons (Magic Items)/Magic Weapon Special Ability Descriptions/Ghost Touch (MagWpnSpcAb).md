# Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *ghost touch* weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creatureâ€™s 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with *ghost touch* weapons. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a *ghost touch* weapon counts as both corporeal or incorporeal.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]*; Price +1 bonus.
