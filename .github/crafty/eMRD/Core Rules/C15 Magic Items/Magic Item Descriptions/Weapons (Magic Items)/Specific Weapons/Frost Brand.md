**Description**

This *+3 [[Frost (MagWpnSpcAb)|frost]] greatsword* sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0Â° F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.

A *[[Frost (MagWpnSpcAb)|frost]] brand* extinguishes all nonmagical fires in a 20-foot radius. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects. You must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.
