**Description**

This weapon usually appears to be a particularly frightening-looking iron or steel mace. On command, this *+2 heavy mace* causes the wielder’s clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become [[Panicked|panicked]] as if by a *[[Fear (Spell)|fear]]* spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who fail take a –2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.

**Construction**
