# Flame Extinguishing
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rodâ€™s charges.

Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* weapon or a *[[Burning Hands (Spell)|burning hands]]* spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.

When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]], [[Flame Strike (Spell)|flame strike]],* or *[[Wall of Fire (Spell)|wall of fire]],* extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.

If a *rod of flame extinguishing* is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.

A *rod of flame extinguishing* has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Rod (Feat)|Craft Rod]], *[[Pyrotechnics (Spell)|pyrotechnics]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp
