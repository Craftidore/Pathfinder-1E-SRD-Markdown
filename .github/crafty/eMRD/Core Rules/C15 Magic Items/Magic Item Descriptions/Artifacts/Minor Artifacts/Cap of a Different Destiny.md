# Cap of a Different Destiny
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 18

**Slot** head

**Price** â€”

**Weight** 1 lb

**Description**

This apparently normal hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance as with a *[[Disguise Self (Spell)|disguise self]]* spell. As part of the disguise, the hat can be changed to appear as a comb, ribbon, headband, cap, coif, hood, helmet, or other headwear. 

After it has been in the possession of its new owner for 24 hours continuously, the wearer is able to assume the role of a different character class in addition to that he or she actually follows. The class taken cannot be the same the wearer's existing class nor can it be a variant or hybrid of the existing class (for example a rogue could not take the ninja class). After possessing the cap for 24 hours, the owner will have a dream of living a different life (ie., a different class) and choose his different destiny upon waking.

This magical headgear only empowers the assumption of 1st-level class abilities, but as long as it is worn, the possessor is able to act as a member of the named class. This class is fixed and can only be changed if the cap is discarded, lost or stolen, or not within a one-mile radius of its owner for any 24-hour period, at which time it losses all experience gained and resets itself. Any experience thus gained is divided between the wearer's actual class and the assumed class evenly, but it is cumulative, so if in several wearings the individual actually advances to 2nd level, then he or she will retain that level whenever adorned with the cap and desiring to use the abilities of the assumed class. Such progress may continue indefinitely, but if the cap is discarded, lost or stolen, or not within a one-mile radius of its owner for any 24-hour period, then all experience in the different class is likewise lost.

The wearer may only advance a single level at a time in his new class, no matter how much experience might be gained after dividing any experience gained. However should the wearer have several encounters in one day each encounter might result in the alternate class leveling.

A *cap of a different destiny* bestows the base attack bonus, saving throws, and class abilities, but does not grant additional hit points. In cases where the granted abilities are better than the character's actual class abilities, use the better of the two.
