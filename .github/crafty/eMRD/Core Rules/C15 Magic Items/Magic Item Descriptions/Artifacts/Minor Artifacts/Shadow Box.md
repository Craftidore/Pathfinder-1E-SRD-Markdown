# Shadow Box
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** —

**Price** 300,000 gp

**Weight** 4 oz.

**Description**

This black metal cube is small (1 inch per side) and has strange otherworldly glyphs on it. When activated by forcely rubbing a finger against the glyph shaped like an inverted Y (causing 1 hp of damage), it manifests a jet black emptiness that is 12 feet high and 8 feet wide in 1 round, facing the device’s owner and a step away. This opening opens and closes instantly at the owner's command and can only be seen by them*;* though it can be detected using *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]* or *[[Arcane Sight, Greater (Spell)|greater arcane sight]]* and leads into the *Shadow Box* (a demiplane adjacent to the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]]).

The *Shadow Box* can be opened no more then 3 times per day; closing it does not count against this total. Many users in the past have opened the *Shadow Box* only once and then immediately closed it; thereafter using one of the spells listed below to gain access or depart it.

On the other side of the shadowy opening is a dimly lit space that corresponds to a 50 foot (per side) cube. When a new owner takes possession of the *Shadow Box* this space is empty but construction materials may be brought within and interior construction done. From the interior the shadowy opening's outline glows with a faint radiance equal to candle light. It should be noted that when a new owner attunes themself to the *Shadow Box* everything within is randomly scattered across the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]]. 

The walls of the *Shadow Box* are created from the very stuff of the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]] and have 120 hit points and hardness 30. This material blocks all teleportation into and out of the *Shadow Box.* A *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* spell may be used to exit but only a *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]**, greater plane shift,* *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]**,* *[[Portal (Domain)|portal]]**,* *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]**,* or *[[Word of Recall (Spell)|word of recall]]* spell can used to enter it from the outside other than through its opening. Ethereal and incorporeal creatures cannot pass through its walls. Should the *Shadow Box* take damage it cannot be repaired except by a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, which restores 10 points of damage taken and the spell used must be cast on the [[Shadow, Plane of|Plane of Shadow]].

The *Shadow Box* is attuned to a new owner by having it in contact with them for 48 hours.

Several spells have been tried (some without success) within the *Shadow Box* after it has been attuned*.* Here are some of the successes:

Casting the *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* spell in the *Shadow Box* adds an *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* to the *Shadow Box's* interior.

Casting *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]*, *[[Alarm, Greater (Spell)|greater alarm]]**, [[Portal Alarm (Spell)|portal alarm]], [[Portal Alarm, Improved|improved portal alarm]]* spell in the *Shadow Box* wards the interior as that spell.

Casting the *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell in the *Shadow Box* wards the interior as that spell.

Casting the in the *Shadow Box* wards the interior as the spell used.

Casting the *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* or *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* spell in the *Shadow Box* provides an *servant* to assist with chores in the interior of the *Shadow Box* which it may not leave.

Casting the *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell in the *Shadow Box* provides an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *Shadow Box* .

The opening into the *Shadow Box* is deactivated by its owner stepping out of it and then rubbing a finger against the glyph shaped like a capital R lying upon its side (this causes 1 hp of damage). All damage caused using the *Shadow Box* can only be healed through normal rest. Creatures that cannot rest cannot heal this damage.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Create Minor Artifact (Feat)|Create Minor Artifact]], *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage’s magnificent mansion]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*

**Cost** 150,000 gp
