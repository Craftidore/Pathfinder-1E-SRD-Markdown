# Decanter of Black Breath (Artifact)
## Overview
**Decanter of Black Breath**

*There was a time when genies would send their emissaries to the mortal world accompanied by enchanted diamond decanters or jeweled lamps, for within, mortal rulers would find pleasures beyond belief: belled houris, miraculous baths, fountains flowing with rosewater or lemon ice, lush gardens, the freshest figs, and the sweetest wines. Here, genies would treat with mortals, shared delights smoothing the path to harmony. Yet beware, oh pasha! The sparkling vessel that arrives unbidden, unaccompanied by mortal guard, gifts, or royal greeting, might hold not wonders, but horrors. For darkness, evil, and betrayal stalk even such immortals as us.*

*—from Sirr al-Asrar, the Book of Science and Statecraft*

Millennia ago, there lived Alras, the potent Stone Sorcerer, a harsh wizard well practiced in the dangerous arts of elementalism and genie binding. Throughout Katapesh he was known for crafting wonders from rock, commanding creatures of living stone, and carving a labyrinthine palace beneath the desert sands. Within, it was said, stood an army of genies with skin like stone and weapons of sharpest obsidian, who meted out their master’s will and sought to bring order to the wild dunes above. Many of these genies were not slaves to the wizard, but willing servants awed by the great mage who was so much like the best of them. For his most favored genie allies, Alras crafted miniature demiplanes and hid them away within fabulous gifts, gemstone statuettes, lavish chests, and precious bottles, granting his companions miniature realms customized to their whims. Tales say the Stone Sorcerer crafted 300 planes in his time, each a realm of splendor and fantastic wealth, and stored them each in safety within his underground palace so his allies might rest between their forays into the harsh land above. Yet one day Alras vanished, and his servants stopped patrolling the desert depths. As no reason for the mage’s disappearance—nor any trace of his palace, the Sanctum in Sand—ever emerged, the tale of the Stone Sorcerer became one of the most fascinating mysteries in Katapesh. 

Yet nothing so wondrous as Alras and his hidden castle ever vanishes without a trace. Whispers tell of a cloaked figure with square feet who appeared in the markets of Katapesh 60 years ago. With him he carried a strange bottle of black-veined lapis lazuli, a treasure that came to be known as the *Decanter of Black Breath.* Many say that this vessel is the last remnant of the Stone Sorcerer, one of the fantastic portable planes of his favored guests, yet all who have possessed and sought to study the decanter have met with terrible misfortune or vanished as completely as the ancient wizard. Thus, the relic has been bartered and traded, lost and found dozens of times in the past decades, leaving behind it a trail of sorrow, ill fate, and rumors that something from the terrible past lingers on within its cerulean curves.

“The Decanter of Black Breath” is an adventure for four 14th-level characters. In addition to working as a standalone, this Set Piece easily supplements this month’s Adventure Path installment, “The Final Wish,” or any other adventure that includes genies or magical treasure. 

**In the Adventure Path**

Incorporating “The Decanter of Black Breath” into this month’s adventure, “The Final Wish,” should prove a simple task, as GMs might add the mysterious bottle to any treasure found in the adventure. Alternatively, a leprous lamp-seller, swathed in linen, might sell the party a lamp from his old and battered cart, or perhaps an important personage might reward PCs with the treasure, either unwitting or fully aware of his gift’s curse.

The decanter is made from basalt and lapis lazuli, stands 1-1/2 feet tall, and emanates an aura of strong conjuration magic. The bottle alone is finely made and worth 380 gp, though should one realize its magical and historical significance, it might sell for upward of 17,000 gp. A great, looping handle protrudes from its squat, bulbous body, and a stone stopper plugs its short, wide neck. Wide runes etched in Terran circle the decanter’s base with the phrase, “Remove my stopper, speak *adra hadra*, and the palace of Quasayr Mahambra shall be yours.” Reciting the words “adra hadra” instantly draws the speaker and any creature in contact with him into the bottle, where they appear in area **1**.

While many PCs might find a powerful magical item with its activation words laid plain before them irresistible, some groups might require something more convincing to find their way into the hidden demiplane. While the evil that lurks within the bottle is subtle and might easily be shunned by groups who have ventured into enough hidden worlds in their recent adventures, knowledge should prove a tempting prod to those interested in learning more about their treasure. Should the PCs lack the interest or resources to seek out the decanter’s storied past, an ally might volunteer such details. A [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history), or Gather Information check might reveal the following. Each check notes which skill uncovers the related information.

## The Palace Within
**The Palace Within**

Within the *Decanter of Black Breath* lies the palace of the genie Umad al-Waliyya. Once a great shaitan warrior in the service of the Stone Sorcerer, the centuries that have passed since Alras’s disappearance have not been kind. Whatever foul magic or brazen attack that caused the wizard to vanish and locked away the Sanctum in Sand trapped all of the mage’s genie allies in their palaces, leaving the hidden fortress a tomb of magical jars, bottles, arks, and chests, each the prison of a forgotten genie hero. For long centuries, Umad languished, frustrated and bored within his prison, until one day less than a hundred years ago a figure in black entered through the magical passage that had so long been barred to the shaitan. The cloaked figure spoke to the warrior of freedom, telling him of the terrible magic that had sealed him within his palace, a spell the traveler might be able to undo, though it would exact a terrible price. Having undergone centuries of loneliness, Umad welcomed any escape and eagerly agreed. The traveler lashed out with ferocious energies, leaving the noble shaitan a burning husk upon the floor of his empty throne room. When the genie awoke—against all reason—he found himself alone again, his noble emerald skin shattered and blackened, twisted by the transformation into a greater ghul.

Corrupted and no more able to escape his prison than in ages past, Umad al-Waliyya went completely insane. In the years since, numerous well-meaning travelers have borne the brunt of his wrath, while other, darker creatures have been attracted to the notorious legend of his palace, seeking to serve him. Now the Palace of Umad al-Waliyya within the *Decanter of Black Breath* is but a shadow of its former splendor, its halls and its masters transformed to horrors beyond speaking.

The demiplane bound within the *Decanter of Black Breath* resembles the interior of a Qadiran palace. No doors or windows peer from the palace’s highly polished sandstone walls, and only the building’s central dome shines with bright color, blaring defiant blue and shimmering silver. Beyond the 5-foot-thick walls lies the endless expanse of the Ethereal Plane.

Upon entering the demiplane, characters find themselves unceremoniously deposited in area **1**.

## 1. The Grand Arcade (EL 12)
**1. The Grand Arcade (EL 12)**

Lit by soft flickers from torches set along the sparkling sandstone walls, a shadowy, arched arcade stretches south. Past each archway, a massive iron cage squats on stubby legs. To the east, gentle, blue-tinged light gleams through three open passages spaced evenly along the wall. Drapes of sheer muslin billow lazily across these exits, obscuring the view beyond. To the north stands an archway filled with what appears to be swirling quicksilver. 

This arcade once served as a lavish entry hall welcoming all visitors to Umad al-Waliyya’s palace. Now, however, it holds the source of the ghul’s frustrations and remnants of past visitors.

Each of the six sub-rooms in the arcade contains one unlocked, bloodstained iron cage. These 10-foot-square cages sit on 2-foot-tall legs, each enclosure bearing the remains of one or more past prisoners—broken bones, tattered rags, and other ominous debris. Each of the cages is slightly ajar, but locks if fully closed, requiring a DC 25 Open Locks check to open.

The pool of quicksilver to the north is a sealed portal, leading from the demiplane to the area just outside the *Decanter of Black Breath*. The portal functions at the whim of Umad al-Waliyya, but only for other creatures. A centuriesold magic prevents the former genie from traveling through the planar passage, even though the decanter itself grants him control over the portal. Although he might open the passage for other creatures, in most cases, the hateful ghul keeps the passage shut. Should Umad al-Waliyya be slain, the *Decanter of Black Breath* grants control over the portal to a new master (see Concluding the Adventure).

**Creatures**: Three spirit nagas lurk to the south of this room, waiting to prey upon intruders. Upon the first PC’s entry, all three turn invisible and remain stationary, waiting for their victims to draw nearer before attacking or attempting to trap them within any of the nearby cages. If the PCs leave the area, the nagas stealthily follow. 

**Spirit Naga (3) CR 9**

**hp** 80 each (MM 192)

**Treasure**: PCs who make a DC 25 Search check in this area discover a *strand of lesser prayer beads* and a pouch holding 18 platinum pieces beneath two of the cages.

## 2. Figs and Fountains (EL 11)
**2. Figs and Fountains (EL 11)**

Beyond narrow pillars, under a vaulted color-shifting dome, lies a water garden surrounded by lush fig trees. Its clear pond ripples beneath the gentle splash of three fountains that run the length of the room, two small and one large, together carved to resemble a pride of desert lions, water streaming from their yawning marble jaws. To the south, a waterfall careens from a balcony, forming a stream that flows into the sparkling pool. A pair of curving staircases extends up to this higher level, while a wooden footbridge crosses the stream. Embedded in the far eastern wall are two ornate double doors, a patterned ogee arching above.

This central fountain and bath fills the main hall of the palace, being the most lavish entertainment the palace has to offer. The waters here are 3 feet deep, with submerged benches allowing guests to recline comfortably. The trees are constantly fruiting with plump figs, and the cool waters always teem with flowering lilies. Above, the scintillating dome rises 30 feet high.

**Creatures**: Four beautiful Katapeshi maidens frolic in the fountain at the room’s center. Congenial and chaste, these flirtatious women claim to be servants of the palace and entreat the PCs to rest and refresh themselves in preparation to meet the master of the house, a virtuous genie lord named Umad al-Waliyya. In truth, though, these beauties are actually pairaka divs in disguise. Cunning creatures, even if their fiendish forms are revealed, they keep up the facade of being servants bound to the house, claiming that they only uphold their disguises so not to distress visitors, and compliment the PCs on seeing through their facades. Regardless of whether or not their true forms are revealed, the pairakas try to keep the PCs from entering areas **3** or **4**, claiming that they’re under orders from their lord to show guests the full hospitality of the palace here. If they’re able to gain a measure of the PCs trust by providing them with wine and freshly picked dates, they offer to help bathe the PCs. As prudence dictates, though, men and women should wash separately, so the divs try to separate the group, taking a small number off to area **3** before attempting to use their *charm monster* ability and ambushing the PCs along with the mohrgs there.

**Pairaka (4) CR 7**

**hp** 60 each (*Pathfinder* #20)

## 3. The Boiling Bath (EL 11)
**3. The Boiling Bath (EL 11)**

Smooth stone stairs curve ten feet up to a landing below a delicate mosaic of capering sea spirits. On this landing, a hot bath steams and bubbles, releasing the scent of exotic spices and lavender into the humid air. At its center rises a sculpture-fountain of an elegant flower with a water-spurting stamen. Potted plants and flowering shrubs line the platform’s northern edge, screening the bath, and an open door to the west reveals a small changing chamber.

This section of the baths once offered guests the opportunity to soak and relax in these magically heated waters. Now, though, the 4-1/2-foot-deep pool has become a disgusting stew. PCs who succeed at a DC 20 Spot check notice viscera and other body parts bobbing in the waters, barely hidden by the foam. Those whose Spot checks exceed the Hide checks of the mohrgs in the pool realize that some viscera and bones move independently.

**Creatures**: Three mohrgs partially float within the roiling bath along with parts of shredded victims. If the PCs enter this landing unaccompanied by the pairakas from area **2**, the undead leap forth and attack.

**Mohrg (3) CR 8**

**hp** 90 each (MM 189)

**Treasure**: Any PC who succeeds at a DC 25 Search check notices a shredded arm floating atop the bath’s roiling waters that bears a *ring of swimming*.

## 4. Throne of a Fallen Hero (EL 16)
**4. Throne of a Fallen Hero (EL 16)**

This cavernous, columned hall echoes with every step. Once obviously an impressive audience chamber, an elegant wooden throne etched with the images of a powerful mountain and stately snakes stands against the eastern wall. Blazing torches hang in regular intervals around the room, revealing an ornately patterned vaulted ceiling and four rounded alcoves. In stark contrast to the room’s opulence, four crude tables—little more than stained planks bolted to sawhorses—crouch in these alcoves. On one lies a hairless mass of flesh barely recognizable as a corpse, its mottled skin mostly flensed away and its ribcage cracked open.

For many centuries this hall served as the lonely throne room of the shaitan hero Umad al-Waliyya. While the genie once enjoyed great feasts and sparring sessions here, for an untold age the hall lay mute as he sat resigned to his fate, consumed by memories of freedom and better times. It was here that the shaitan was slain by a mysterious stranger and resurrected as a ghul. Ever since, the thing that was once Umad al-Waliyya has proven more active, either letting fate or his pairaka servants coax victims into his realm, where he takes vengeance on the mortals who summoned him to the Material Plane long centuries ago.

Those who investigate the alcoves find each table has obviously aided in terrible tortures, their lengths smeared with blood, marred by chains, and scarred by hopelessly grasping fingernails. Each has a pair of manacles affixed to one end.

**Creatures**: Far too proud to hide in his own domain, Umad al-Waliyya sits in the throne here, gripping a lordly scepther shaped like a serpent. Robed in black rags shredded by his shattered, rocky skin, with a face like a crudely sculpted skull, he waits for the PCs to enter before demanding to know why they have intruded upon his realm. The ghul is thoroughly insane, and regardless of the PCs’ answer decides they are enemies of the Stone Sorcerer that his servants have captured. He interrogates them about their plots, why they would perpetrate raids upon the good people of the desert, and where their conspirators lie, peppering his circular, half-remembered questions with the names of allies and villains that may or may not have ever existed. Once the ghul grows frustrated with the PCs’ apparent lack of cooperation, he decides he’ll have to torture the truth from them and demands they each shackle themselves to one of the tables in the alcoves. Should they resist, or prove hostile at any point before this, he attacks.

**Combat Gear** *earth elemental gem;* **Gear** *+3 breastplate, +2 shock falchion, ring of protection +2, cloak of resistance +3, gauntlets of ogre power,* gold scepter (worth 350 gp)

**Special Abilities**

**Bleed (Ex)** Any living creature damaged by Umad’s claws continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. A critical hit does not multiply this bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check.

**Change Shape (Su)** Umad’s natural form is that of a donkey-hoofed undead shaitan. He can also assume the form of a hyena or any humanoid. Umad remains in one form until he chooses to assume another. A *true seeing* spell, however, always reveals his undead form. See *Dark Markets, A Guide to Katapesh* for complete details.

**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoid slain by Umad becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise. Likewise, a slain janni or genie becomes a ghul. Blessing or destroying the body (such as with acid or fire) prevents this reanimation.

**Cursed Claws (Ex)** Umad’s wickedly curved claws are as hard as steel and count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

**Genie-Kin (Ex)** For all effects related to race, Umad is considered a genie even though he is no longer an outsider.

**Metalmorph (Su)** As a standard action, Umad may warp and deform any one metal object within 20 feet. This functions like *warp wood*, but affects only metal objects that fail a DC 26 Fortitude save (attended objects use their wielder’s saves). Armor or shields lose half their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are rendered useless except as improvised clubs. The transformation lasts 1 minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. The save DC is Charisma based.

**Rend (Ex)** If Umad hits with both claw attacks, he latches onto his opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This automatically deals an extra 2d6+6 points of damage.

**Unholy Fortitude (Ex)** Umad gains bonus hit points equal to his Charisma modifier times his Hit Dice, and a bonus to his Fortitude saves equal to his Charisma modifier.

**Skills** Umad has a +4 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when following tracks. Umad has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 while climbing, even if rushed or threatened.

**Exceptional Stats** Umad is a hero of a past age. His ability scores were generated using 32 points, rather than the standard 25-point elite array. Additionally, his gear was determined as if he were a PC to account for his history and ancient victories. These advantages increase his total CR by 1.

**Treasure**: A DC 26 Search check also reveals a secret compartment hidden behind the throne. Within lies 6,000 gp in assorted gems, ranging from 50 gp garnets to 1,000 gp diamonds. Here also is an ancient and poorly penned series of letters written in Terran to “Galistypheit, Most Splendorous of Diamonds.” Anyone who spends a day reading these ancient letters learns of Umad’s heroics in the service of the Stone Sorcerer and his unexplained imprisonment within his palace—and his undying adoration for the letters’ would-be recipient, Galistypheit.

**Concluding the Adventure**

Once Umad is destroyed, his control over the portal in area **1** ends, and the *Decanter of Black Breath* chooses a new master, whatever creature remaining in the demiplane has the highest Hit Dice. This is likely one of the PCs. Roll randomly to determine who gains control of the portal if several PCs have the same number of Hit Dice. Whomever the *Decanter* chooses as its new master is acknowledged by the momentary appearance of a halo of illusory gems. The character immediately knows the portal in the grand arcade is closed, but can be reopened with a thought. Upon returning to the portal, the PCs can pass through and return to wherever they left the *Decanter of Black Breath*, and keep or dispose of the relic as they see fit.

If the PCs found the correspondence in area **4** and choose to seek out Galistypheit, the addressee of Umad al-Waliyya’s letters, a magic-aided investigation should reveal that she lives still in the Opaline Vault on the Elemental Plane of Earth. Should these letters be delivered to this very grateful shaitan matron, she rewards the PCs with a sword and shield that once belonged to her beloved, a *+2 thundering scimitar* and a *+2 fire-resistant heavy steel shield.* In addition, grant the PCs experience for an additional EL 15 encounter.

Now bearing one of the only artifacts of the lost Sanctum of Sand, the PCs might become interested in this hidden dungeon, or the dark robed figure who brought the *Decanter of Black Breath* back into the world. GMs are free to have the tale of Alras and his mysterious sanctuary be as real or fictitious as they please, though there have always been rumors of a hidden valley deep within the Trackless Storm of southern Katapesh...
