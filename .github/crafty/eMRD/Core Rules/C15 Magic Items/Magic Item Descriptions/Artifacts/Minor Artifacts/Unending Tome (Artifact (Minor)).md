# Unending Tome (Artifact (Minor))
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 16th

**Slot** —

**Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

The first *unending tomes* were said to have been crafted by a dragon in the service of a great emperor. Each of these books has a unique appearance, and hold an infinite number of pages for spellcasters to inscribe spells upon.

Any wizard who prepares spells from an *unending tome*, which potentially holds libraries worth of arcane knowledge, may prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. The original *unending tomes* contains all sorcerer/wizard spells (save for those of the schools of Enchantment and Illusion)—at the GM’s discretion, it can certainly hold more spells.

**Destruction**

A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy the specific and particular *unending tome* into which it is inscribed. This spell, which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on the Unending Tome by its owner.
