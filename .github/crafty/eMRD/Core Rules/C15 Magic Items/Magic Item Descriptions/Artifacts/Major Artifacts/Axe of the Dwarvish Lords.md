**Axe of the Dwarvish Lords**

**Aura** strong conjuration and transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 12 lbs.

**DESCRIPTION**

The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* is a *+6 [[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]] [[Throwing (MagWpnSpcAb)|throwing]] goblinoid [[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]] dwarven waraxe*. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his darkvision. Any non-dwarf who grasps the axe takes 4 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the axe is held. The current owner of the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* gains a +10 bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (armor, jewelry, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons) checks. Additionally, the wielder can summon an elder earth elemental (as *[[Summon Monster IX (Spell)|summon monster IX]]*; duration 20 rounds) once per week.

**DESTRUCTION**

The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords rusts away to nothing if it is ever used by a goblin to behead a dwarven king.

**History**

In –4987 AR, the great dwarf king Taargick fulfilled his promise to his people and the prophecy set down by Torag in deep ages past, leading the dwarves into the light of the surface world and completing the perilous, generations-old Quest for Sky. Yet this first step into sun was not the glorious moment so often depicted in dwarven sculpture. Many dwarves feared the all-revealing light, the exposure to tempestuous weather, the unfathomable looming sea of the open sky, and the countless weird shapes and creatures of the alien surface. For thousands of dwarves, reaching the surface only convinced them that they should have stayed in the dark of the deep earth.

Awed himself, Taargick heard his people’s plight, and in a hidden cavern remembered as the Conclave of the Final Deep, he gathered the leaders of his people—his siblings, advisors, and greatest priests of Torag—and together they constructed a simple forge. With both ore brought from the depths of their ancient homeland and strange new metals discovered on the surface, these leaders of the dwarves crafted a symbol of their people, and poured into it their strength, resolve, legends, and memories, as well as the blessings of Torag. When it was done, Taargick addressed his followers, emboldening them to face the challenges of the surface, and raising a marvelous axe as evidence that the traditions of the old nations might forge wonders from the riches of the new world. So the weapon was dubbed the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*, and it was said that so long as it remained keen the dwarves would never forget nor turn from the virtues of their ancient homeland.

The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* passed through the hands of many kings and rulers, eventually coming to the Five Kings Mountains, but was stolen by unknown parties during the chaos of the Five Kings War. It briefly resurfaced in the hands of General Eurad Dberryl, but was claimed by Theocrat Ordrick’s followers during the Forge War. Many dwarves believe that the worshipers of Droskar knew the axe represented a threat to their rising regime and hid it away deep beneath Droskar’s Crag. Despite such tales and centuries of searching, no one has yet recovered the ancient symbol, and the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* remains lost.

**Ramifications**

Few items are as linked to the pride of a people as the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. Those who claim it should consider the following.

**Emblem of a People:** The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* is a symbol of the pride and heritage of an entire people. What’s more, it’s also a priceless historical artifact—though the dwarves have made efforts to keep their great Sky Citadels in repair, there can be no question that dwarves lose a little more of their ancestral ways with each generation born on the surface. Many dwarves among the Five Kings Mountains and beyond believe reclaiming the axe is vital to uniting their people and beginning a new age of dwarven ingenuity. Most dwarven lords would pay any price to recover the axe, as doing so would win them instant esteem and authority among their people, and just as many would do all that it takes to wrest the artifact from non-dwarf hands. By the same token, should the axe ever reappear, the worshipers of Droskar would do all in their power to hide it away again and continue their people’s slide toward drudgery and despair.

**Hands of the Maker:** The *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* seeks dwarf hands to wield it, and should it not find such a bearer, legend claims it reshapes its owner as it prefers. Those who wield the axe for an extended period of time find themselves becoming increasingly hirsute, growing more accustomed to the dark, and potentially changing height by up to an inch per week. Anyone who possesses the *Axe of the Dwarvish Lords* for more than a week transforms into a dwarf 1d4 weeks later as if affected by the spell *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]*. This effect can only be reversed by a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell.
