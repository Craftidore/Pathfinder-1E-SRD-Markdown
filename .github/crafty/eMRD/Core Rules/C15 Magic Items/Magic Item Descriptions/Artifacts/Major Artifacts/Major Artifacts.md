# Major Artifacts
## Overview
Major artifacts are unique itemsâ€”only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign. Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.
