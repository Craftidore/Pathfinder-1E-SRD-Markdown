# Exalted (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
The wearer of this pristine armor, if good, takes only half of the extra damage dealt by an unholy weapon (+1d6 instead of +2d6) and gains the benefits of a constant *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]* spell. Furthermore, the armor negates the vile damage dealt by a vile melee, ranged, or natural weapon (described in the *Book of Vile Darkness*).

Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]*, creator must be good; Price +3 bonus.
