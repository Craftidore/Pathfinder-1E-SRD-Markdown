# Amorphous (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
Armor with this special ability grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers. Additionally, once per day on command, the wearer (along with any gear she is wearing) can take the form of viscous liquid that can pass through any space through which thick mud could reasonably flow. While using this ability, the wearerâ€™s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and she can take only move actions. The wearer can take this form for 1 minute or until she spends a move action to return to her normal form. *Amorphous* armor must be made primarily of leather, fabric, or another flexible, organic material.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *fluid form*, ; Price +4,500 gp.
