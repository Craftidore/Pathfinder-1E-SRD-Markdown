# Undead Controlling (Arm/ShldSpcAb)
## Overview
*Undead controlling* armor or shields often have skeletal or other grisly decorations or flourishes to their decor. They let the user control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]* spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Control Undead (Spell)|control undead]]*; Price +49,000 gp.
