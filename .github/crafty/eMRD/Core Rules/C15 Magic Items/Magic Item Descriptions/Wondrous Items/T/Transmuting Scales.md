# Transmuting Scales
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 20,000 gp

**Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

These delicate mithral scales stand almost 4 feet high and have a pan on each side side that is 3 feet long, 2 feet wide and a foot deep. These pans are attached to the center of the stand by what appears to be a thin flat balancing arm that runs through the shaft of the stand. Affixed to the front of the stand are two concentric, rotating circles, one inside the other. The inner circle is divided into over two dozen section each of which has a small chip of a semi-precious or precious gem stone and rotates in a clockwise fashion. The larger outer circle is divided into eight sections, each marked with the alchemical symbol for one of the following metals: copper, iron, electrum, silver, gold, platinum, and mithral; it rotates in a counterclockwise manner.

When the left pan is filled with the proper raw material; which is metal (raw or in the form of coinage) of the type indicated by the symbol (for that metal) on the outer ring and that ring has been moved so that the uppermost position has that symbol in place and the inner circle has been moved so that the desired gemstone is in the bottom position and a command word is spoken, the left pan will empty and the right will begin to fill with raw uncut gemstones of the desired type. Initially each gemstone will be of the lowest value possible for that gem. However, if those gems are left in the right side pan and more metal is added to the left side pan and the command word is repeated, then the gems will gradual become larger and finer as the metal is transmuted.

The value of individual types of gems and how they increase are left to the GM but a quick and simple system is: 1 gp, 5 gp, 10 gp, 25 gp, 50 gp, 100 gp, 500 gp, 1,000 gp, 5,000 gp, 10,000 gp, 25,000 gp, 50,000 gp and 100,000 gp. 

Any metal not of the selected type is not consumed and remains in a raw form at the bottom of the left side pan. Any excess value for a given transmutation sequence is consumed in the process and lost.

An example of how the *transmuting scales* works is as follows: Helos is given 400 gp in silver coins, 200 in gold coins, and a heavy gold necklace valued at 750 gp. He takes the silver coins and places enough of them into the left pan to equal 10 gold pieces. He starts the transmutation sequence by uttering the command word and watches as the silver coins fade away and 10 one gp topaz gems appear in the right side pan. Since silver transmutes at a value of 10 to 1, he has 300 gp value left in silver. He decides to repeat the transmutation process again, so he removes the gems on the right and does it three more times, each time removing the resulting gems except for the last time when he uses all of his silver coins and wants a few gems of higher value. He removes all but 5 of the 1 gp topazes and then turns the outer ring to the symbol for gold and begins to convert gold coins first into five 5 gp gems then into five 10 gp gems. Presuming he had enough sources of the proper metals and coins, he could continue to transmute until the value of his gems was much much more.
