# Spool of Endless Rope
## Overview
**Aura** Moderate conjuration (DC 19); **CL** 5th

**Slot** — 

**Price** 1,400 gp gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

*This spool of silk rope comes with a belt loop so that it can be hung conveniently at the user’s side.*

A *spool of endless rope* holds an unlimited amount of the finest silk rope.

To use a *spool of endless rope,* you feed out as little or as much rope as desired, up to a maximum of 500 feet at any one time. When you are fi nished with the rope, you can simply wind it back onto the spool. (Feeding out or rewinding requires 1 full-round action per 50 feet of rope.)


The rope can’t be entirely separated from the spool, though it can be cut or broken like a normal silk rope. Any portion of rope cut away from the spool disappears instantly.


Rope from a *spool of endless rope* can be spliced or knotted together with another rope (including one from a second *spool of endless rope*), but it can’t be wound back into the spool while so attached.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*

**Cost** 700 gp

**Source:** Magic Item Compendium (WotC), pg. 186

**GM Note**

*Note:* This replaces the version from Complete Adventurer.
