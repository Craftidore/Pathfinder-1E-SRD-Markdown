# Quiver of Endless Arrows
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 900 gp

**Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This quiver is a boon to the expert archer, for it magically creates an endless supply of masterwork arrows (of an appropriate size for the wearer). Each arrow exists for only a single round after it is drawn. The arrows don't exist until they are drawn, so they can't receive magical enhancements while still "in the quiver," even by such means as *[[Magic Weapon, Greater (Spell)|greater magic weapon]]* (though such effects can be added after the arrow is drawn).

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Minor Creation (Spell)|minor creation]]*

**Cost** 450 gp

**Source:** Stuff that Holds Stuff (Andy Collins' d20 website), pg. 3
