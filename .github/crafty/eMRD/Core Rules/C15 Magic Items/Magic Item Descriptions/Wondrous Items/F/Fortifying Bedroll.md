# Fortifying Bedroll
## Overview
**Aura:** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot:** —

**Price** 3,000 gp

**Weight:** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This item appears to be a normal, if well made, bedroll. The cushioning is thick, the stitching skilled. It is made of dark green cloth with a dull yellow interior. It smells faintly comforting, a mix of burning firewood and goose down.

**Activation:** To activate the magic of the bedroll, you need merely climb into it (a move action) and spend 1 uninterrupted hour resting. Each bedroll functions once per day.

**Effect:** The* fortifying bedroll* grants you the benefits of a full 8 hours of rest—including the elimination of fatigue or exhaustion, natural healing, and the ability to prepare or ready arcane spells—over the course of a single hour. Spells cast within the last 8 hours still count against your daily limit as normal.

After using the *fortifying bedroll,* you can't gain the same benefit again (either from the same or a different item) until 48 hours have passed.

**Construction**

**Requirements:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*

**Cost:** 1,500 gp

**Source:** Complete Mage (WotC), pg. 132

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* In the world of Greyhawk campaign setting, this item is commonly known as *Heward's fortifying bedroll.*
