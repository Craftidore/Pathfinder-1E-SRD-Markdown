# Figurine of Wondrous Power (Bronze Griffon)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 10,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *figurine of wondrous power* appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a *figurine of wondrous power* is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

**Bronze Griffon:** When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*). The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]*

**Cost** 5,000 gp
