**Slot** —

**Price** 30,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This small earcuff is made of fine silver wire and slips over the wearer's left ear. Upon doing so, the wearer is immediately aware of every other cuff that is linked to his own so long as they are within 50 miles of his own, being worn, and the wearer is awake; additionally the user is made aware of the common name(s) of the wearers of any linked cuffs. Utter the name of the desired target and if they are awake and willing they begin to hear your words, and you theirs. An unwilling target can remove themselves from the conversation or refuse to hear a message. The *earcuff* enables the wearer to have a conversation with one or more individuals from a great distance. In order to speak with all who are linked in, the wearer merely begins by saying 'All'.

An *earcuff of communication* does not provide translation between wearers, though it is rumored that there are some sets of such cuffs that do.

To link two cuffs into a set, they must be touching for 1 minute while the word 'pair' is whispered over them. Additional cuffs may be linked by doing the same with any cuff already linked.

**GM NOTE**

Besides earcuffs that can translate between users, there are also said to be cuffs that provide general translation (as the *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]* spell) to the wearer, cuffs that enhance the wearer's [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], and cuffs that provide detailed knowledge as to the current conditions of other (linked) wearers (as the *[[Status (Spell)|status]]**, [[Status, Greater (Spell)|greater status]], and* *[[Status, Superior (Spell)|superior status]]* spells).
