# Everfull Component Pouch (WondrousItem)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This plain leather belt pouch always contains any spell component or focus (maximum value 1 gp) required by its owner. What's more, the component or focus instantly appears in hand whenever the wearer begins casting a spell. Though this is of little use in most situations, it proves very useful if the caster is grappling or pinned, since he doesn't have to reach the components himself. Any component or focus not used to cast a spell within one round disappears back into the pouch (and thus can't be sold or traded by the owner). If the owner stores his other components or foci in the pouch, it delivers them in the same manner.  

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Locate Object (Spell)|locate object]]*

**Cost** 1,000 gp
