## Overview

**Slot** —

**Price** 33,600 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

Centuries ago, Kurtulmak gave his high priesthood a half-dozen copies of a portable pit trap: the enveloping pit.

This functions like a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*, except that it is 50 feet deep. The enveloping pit covers a 10-foot square when opened fully and shrinks down to a 1-foot hole. It can be picked up and moved when it’s at its smallest, and its owner can open or close it with a command word from anywhere within 60 feet. An *enveloping pit* opens fully only if it has enough flat space to do so; it halts when an edge hits a wall or other obstruction.

A common tactic is to lie in wait until foes are standing nearby a shrunk *enveloping pit*, and then open it fully, dropping enemies into a pit that wasn’t there a moment earlier. Those who find an *enveloping pit* underneath them must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 22) or fall into the pit.

To use this relic, you must worship Kurtulmak and either sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]*, creator must worship Kurtulmak

**Cost** 16,800 gp

**Source:** Complete Divine (WotC), pgs. 96-97

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* There are several things about an *enveloping pit* that might be overlooked; first is that both the activation and creation requirements may be bypassed by [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] checks as follows: 


| **Requirement** | **UMD DC** |
|---|---|
| creator must worship Kurtulmak | 30 |
| sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell slot | 20 |

So, in able to activate an *enveloping pit* and having none of the prerequisites would require a character to roll a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 20).

Secondly, the *enveloping pit* functions as a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]**,* which means it can be placed on any surface and will function. This allows for two possibilities (at the very least). First it can be placed against a wall and will create a tunnel 10 ft. high and wide and 50 ft. deep. If there is not enough depth, it will cause a breach for the depth that is there.

Like a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]*, an *enveloping pit* has a limited supply of air available when closed, however, due to its larger internal area, that air supply is much larger (90 minutes).

Lastly, like almost all magic items, an *enveloping pit* can be further enchanted. Spells of especial use would include *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* and any of several that generate habitable conditions inside.

Enterprising characters have been known to create small, portable safeholds within an *enveloping pit,* either horizontally or vertically. Such *enveloping pits* often have ladders, stairs, and even internal partitioning (ie., floors or walls). A simple lining of lead takes up no real amount of space and would block all but the most powerful divination magics.

There are rumors that at least three powerful spellcasters have replicated the powers of the *enveloping pit* without its many restrictions and in at least one case, have greatly increased its powers.
