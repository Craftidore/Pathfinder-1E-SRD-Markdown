# Caltrop Bead (cold iron)
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 7th 

**Slot** none 

**Price** 80 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

The wielder may throw this small, dense iron sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) or use it as a sling bullet.

A creature directly hit by a *caltrop bead* takes 2d4 points of piercing damage, and adjacent creatures take 1d4 points of damage as the bead suddenly bursts. [[Caltrops]] created by a *caltrop bead* remain for 1 hour before disappearing.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Minor Creation (Spell)|minor creation]]*

**Cost** 40 gp
