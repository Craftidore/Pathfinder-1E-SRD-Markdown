# Champion of the Gilded Host
## Overview
**Aura** strong abjuration and enchantment; **CL** 14th

**Slot** —

**Price** 500,000 gp

**Weight** 600 tons

**Description**

Individually, the component pieces of the Champion of the Gilded Host have the same strong magic aura as the intact construct, but possess no note worthy abilities of their own. Any piece with a joint may flex occasionally, but without any purpose or significant force. When the pieces are brought within 100 feet of one another, they reassemble themselves to create a golden colossus. Long-forgotten command words keyed to each piece are able to shrink it to a fraction of its full size.

**History**

For perhaps a thousand years, the imperial phalanxes of Ninshabur conquered and controlled immense swaths of Casmaron. The independent state of Praramdav, one of many kingdoms that would later consolidate to form Vudra, watched Ninshabur's rise to power with growing discomfort. Its rulers began building its armies to repel the seemingly inevitable invasion, but in -632 AR, the [[Tarrasque (Bestiary PF1)|Tarrasque]] emerged from the Pit of Gormuz in central Casmaron and laid waste to Ninshabur.

Rather than rejoicing at the news of his rival's demise, the rajah of Praramdav feared that a Spawn of [[Rovagug]] might visit the same cataclysm upon his kingdom. He issued incentives of wealth and power to lure the brightest minds to his capitol; hundreds of sages answered his call and concluded that only a comparably large guardian could repel a Spawn's attack. Pointing to [[Rovagug]]'s destructive power, the scholars informed the rajah that only the purest, most infallible and incorruptible material would do: gold.

With study and divination revealing no weakness to the [[Tarrasque (Bestiary PF1)|Tarrasque]], the rajah desperately clung to the idea of a powerful golden guardian and turned his powerful army against his other neighbors in order to fund this ambitious construct. Within 5 years, the form of the colossus was complete, a dozen kingdoms were under the rajah's control, and a great army-known as the Gilded Host-stood ready to fight alongside its golden champion. Despite the construct's tremendous might, further divination determined that the Champion ef the Gilded Host was still incapable of defeating a Spawn of [[Rovagug]]. The rajah continued to spend money to improve the construct, unwilling to abandon a weapon that had already consumed such vast resources. However, the [[Tarrasque (Bestiary PF1)|Tarrasque]] never came.

Without a great victory to justify its leader's aggressive policies and reckless spending, Praramdav was unable to hold onto its new territory. It collapsed into bankruptcy, and its vassal kingdoms attempted in vain to melt down the colossus but succeeded only in breaking it into five virtually invulnerable sections: two arms, the head, the torso, and its articulated serpentine tail. A different kingdom claimed each one as spoils of Praramdav's folly.

Nearly a millennium later, these same kingdoms had managed to reunite three of the pieces when Unyielding Kothogaz arrived in Vudra, but the Spawn of [[Rovagug]] attacked and scattered the pieces far and wide in its rampage. Ultimately, it was not a golden champion but an army of hero-priests that defeated Kothogaz.

**Legacy**

Although its individual components bear but a fraction of the construct's power, the Champion ef the Gilded Host is a tremendously potent tool of destruction capable of leveling a kingdom.

**Current Location:** Of the three pieces of the Champion of the Gilded Host scattered by Kothogaz, only the left arm has turned up in the millennia since the attack. Local priests built a temple around the partially animate arm, which sometimes responds to questions by tapping its fingers in strange patterns that these priests claim to have deciphered and now use to predict the future. Of the two pieces untouched by Kothogaz, the head resides in one of the maharajah's palaces in Vudra, though this component seems lifeless.

**Interested Parties:** The rajahs of any of Vudra's many mahajanapadas would pay a considerable sum to secure one or more pieces of the golden colossus, for they could in turn give it as a gift to the maharajah and earn favor, boons, and wealth. Were the maharajah to unite all of the pieces and return the colossus to life, he would wield an incredible weapon that he could use to conquer any one of his neighbors.

**Perilous Servant:** The fully assembled golden colossus has never seen combat, and no original documentation of its creation has survived the ages. Once awakened, it's unclear whom the construct might consider its master-it might simply lash out randomly at anything in sight. Worse yet, the colossus's devotion to defeating the Spawn of [[Rovagug]] may be so strong that it would find and awaken one of the hibernating beasts, which would then destroy whole nations before it could be defeated.

**Ramifications of Destruction:** When Praramdav built the colossus, it sealed an enormous quantity of gold into an unbreakable construct, increasing the material's rarity and raising the value of gold across Casmaron and beyond. Were the champion destroyed, the gold that makes up its body could be turned into enough coins to finance an empire for years, eventually devaluing the price of gold to the point of crashing other countries' economies.

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**

**Alternate Form (Ex):** As a full-round action, a gold colossus can take the form of an immense war monument. Its DR in this form increases to 20/epic, and its aura of blazing courage’s radius increases to 1,000 feet. While in this form, it can’t attack.

**Aura of Blazing Courage (Su):** A gold colossus constantly radiates a warm aura of bravery. Allies within 30 feet of a gold colossus gain the benefits of bless and remove fear.

**Blessing of the Gilded Host (Su):** Once per week, a gold colossus can bless an army using the rules for mass combat, granting the army a +2 bonus to its Offensive Modifier and on Morale checks until the end of its next battle or for 1 week, whichever comes first.

**Selective Antimagic Aura (Su):** Spells with the compulsion or teleportation descriptor are unaffected by this field.

**Suppressing Stomp (Su):** Whenever a gold colossus deals stomp damage to a target, it reduces the target’s damage reduction and spell resistance by 2 for 1 minute.

Each stomp thereafter increases the reduction by 2 (maximum reduction of 10) and resets the duration.

**ECOLOGY**

Environment any land

Organization solitary or legion (1 plus 10–100 human fighters of 5th–8th level)

Treasure none

**Gold Colossus Construction:** Although the Champion of the Gilded Host is made almost entirely of gold, most gold colossi are alloys of gold and less precious metals that cost 100,000 gp to build. Such lesser constructs lack the Champion of the Gilded Host’s suppressing stomp ability (which was added after the colossus’s initial completion) though they retain the stomp attack and pinning stomp special attack. Gold colossi are MR 6.
