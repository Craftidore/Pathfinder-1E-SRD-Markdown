# City in a Bottle
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration (increases); **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Contents Limit** 250 lbs.

**Contents Volume Limit** 30 cubic ft.

**Price** \*

**Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This bottle is sized about right for a half-gallon of whatever drink you happen to like, with an open mouth an inch across. Clearly visible through the glass sides, though, is a city. When viewed extremely closely, such as under a magnifying glass, what appears to be tiny people walk through the streets, conducting their daily lives. No matter how the bottle is moved or tilted, those within don’t seem disturbed.

**Requirements**

**Skills:** At least 7 ranks total in [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills, [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] skills, and/or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]].

**Special:** Must have personally sold goods you either bought or made totalling over 500 gold pieces.

\* The City in a Bottle does not have a Price column, unlike others here. This is because its worth varies to an extreme degree depending on the party and the nature of the campaign, and is thus meant more as a tool for GMs to allow their players to adventure without being anchored to a city or town for their resources. After all, they’re carrying it with them. 


| | **Wielder** |  |
|---|---|---|
| **Item** | **Minimum** |  |
| **Level** | **Level** | **Abilities** |
| 1 | — | *[[Bag of Holding Type I\|bag of holding type I]]* |
| 2 | 5 | [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]], Bottled Village |
| 3 | 10 | Bottled Town, *[[Bag of Holding Type II\|bag of holding type II]]* |
| 4 | 15 | Bottled City |
| 5 | 20 | Bottled Metropolis, City Seed, *[[Bag of Holding Type III\|bag of holding type III]]* |

**Bag of Holding:** When found, the City in a Bottle acts as a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding type I]]*. Although the opening only appears about an inch wide, anything which could fit into a *bag of holding* will fit into it. At third item level, it upgrades to a *[[Bag of Holding Type II|bag of holding type II]]*, and at fifth it upgrades to a *[[Bag of Holding Type III|bag of holding type III]]*. Unlike a normal *bag of holding*, it has a hardness of 15 and 50 hit points, and will not rupture from a sharp object placed inside. It is still an [[Extradimensional Spaces|extradimensional space]], and will react as any other *bag of holding* to being placed inside of a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]].*

**Leadership:** Once bonded, the City in a Bottle grants its owner the benefits of the [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] feat, with the following modifications. The cohort and all followers are confined to the city within the bottle. While within the city, any of them can communicate telepathically with the owner. The cohort in particular acts as the owner’s representative within the city, able to interact with the residents to perform crafting, research, and even buy or sell equipment and supplies as appropriate to the size of the city. Although he cannot leave the city, the cohort can exchange items through the *bag of holding* effect (which opens into a small storage shed in the City).

**Bottled Village:** Upon revealing its abilities, the City in a Bottle is revealed to be a village of about 100 people. It contains basic facilities for just about any craft, as well as a small research library and a small market. Where the goods there come from before being bought, or where they go after being sold there, is unknown.  The village is an autocracy, consisting primarily of the owner’s own race (though there are significant numbers of other races) and aligned to the owner’s alignment.The residents speak any one language the owner does, typically Common. The owner of the City in a Bottle cannot enter the village yet.

**Bottled Town:** The city has grown to about 2,500 people and is a large town. The facilities have improved and are now well-equipped, granting +2 to any [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skill checks or research attempts made by the cohort. In addition, the owner of the city can call forth one follower from the city to assist him in the real world. The follower appears next to the bottle, and serves to the best of his ability. Only one such can be out of the city at a time. Should the follower die, or should the owner want to switch which is out, he can be returned by touching the bottle to him.

**Bottled City:** The city has grown to about 12,500 people and is a large city. At this point, the owner gains the ability to enter the city as a standard action by merely willing it so while in contact with the bottle. All of their equipment goes with them, as well as any willing creature touching them. Those not native to the city can leave by walking or riding out the front gate  ~~The bottle remains where it was, though, and characters leaving the city could find themselves in trouble if enemies have found it, or if it has ended up in a dangerous location.~~ The bottle is included in the owner's equipment when they enter the City in a Bottle demiplane; though while in the demiplane it is opaque and only functions as a *bag of holding.*

**Bottled Metropolis:** The city has grown to about 30,000 people and is a metropolis.The cohort is now available as an option to call forth from the City.

**City Seed:** The City in a Bottle can now be planted like a seed, anywhere there exists at least twenty square miles not already within the boundaries of another city or town. Over the course of a week, buildings spring up and their residents with them, surrounded by farms and pastures as appropriate to the region. The owner of the City in a Bottle is its rightful ruler, with a small castle in the center of the city, fully staffed. The residents are loyal, and include the cohort and all of the followers gained from [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]]. They are no longer limited to the city’s borders and can come and go as desired. Typically, the city will grow rapidly up from its current population when this happens unless surrounding circumstances prevent it.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]], [[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|lesser create demiplane]]*

**Cost** 1,250 gp

**Source:** Steelforge, Book 2 (Dreamscarred Press), pgs. 3-4

**GM Note** 

Not every item is great because of what it is. For some, they become great according to the weight of history behind them, the stories which have been told only feeding their might. These grow with their wielders, becoming greater as the character does.

These represent what some hold to be the ideal of a magic item. That is, one that remains with the character, not one that is disposed of. They cannot be intentionally crafted, the values given are just for reference, see Chapter 6 for more details.

As a reminder, a given character can only have one legendary item attuned to them, and a given legendary item will only show its true capabilities for one person at a time.

*House Rule:* Added *[[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|lesser create demiplane]]* feat using this item (at 5th level), they may substitute their [[Leadership (Feat)|Leadership]] score for the Wielder Minimum Level with the GM's approval.

Normally a City in a Bottle must be found and cannot be made; however, it is possible to create on using the Legacy rules. Using the Least, Lesser, and Greater Legacy feats allows the creator of a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding type I]]* to create a City in a Bottle. The *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding type I]]* must be in the shape of a half-gallon bottle and the requirements for the item are [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]], [[Create Demiplane, Lesser (Spell)|lesser create demiplane]]* as well as the Least Legacy feat. The item may be crafted at any time but remains a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding type I]]* until the creator is 5th (character) level. Unlike most legacy items, the City in a Bottle does not extract personal costs save in the form of the Legacy feats needed nor does it provide other abilities save those listed in the table below:


| | **Wielder** |  |
|---|---|---|
| **Item** | **Minimum** |  |
| **Level** | **Level** | **Abilities** |
| 1 | — | *[[Bag of Holding Type I\|bag of holding type I]]* |
| 2 | 5 | [[Leadership (Feat)\|Leadership]], Bottled Village, *[[Bag of Holding Type II\|bag of holding type II]]* |
| 3 | 10 | Bottled Town, *[[Bag of Holding Type III\|bag of holding type III]]* |
| 4 | 15 | Bottled City, *[[Bag of Holding Type IV\|bag of holding type IV]]* |
| 5 | 20 | Bottled Metropolis, City Seed, *[[Bag of Holding Type V\|bag of holding type V]]* |

Note that the above table replaces the one for a legendary City in a Bottle.

The Bottled Village, Town, City, and Metropolis should all have a settlement stat block generated and once Bottled Metropolis is reached, it may continue to grow in population past 30,000 people. At each stage the City in a Bottle should be treated as a demiplane and may be modified accordingly using the proper spells and magicks. It is possible for the City in a Bottle to have lands surrounding it, its own weather, etc.

'The bottle remains where it was, though, and characters leaving the city could find themselves in trouble if enemies have found it, or if it has ended up in a dangerous location.' is changed to 'The bottle is included in the owner's equipment when they enter the City in a Bottle demiplane; though while in the demiplane it is opaque and only functions as a *bag of holding.'*

Should the owner of the City in a Bottle take the [[Landlord (Feat)|Landlord]] feat, then the funds gained may be transferred to the City in a Bottle in the form of Goods and/or Magic and used to support the residents or to focus on specific construction within a particular building in the City; typically the stronghold of the owner.
