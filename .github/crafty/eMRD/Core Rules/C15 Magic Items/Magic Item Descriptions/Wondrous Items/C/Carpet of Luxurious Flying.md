# Carpet of Luxurious Flying
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** —

**Price** 110,000 gp

**Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

This 10 ft. by 10 ft. rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* spell of unlimited duration. Expertly handcrafted from silk and wool, this carpet has a carrying capacity of 800 lbs. and can fly at a speed of 40 ft. The carpet has its own command word to activate it — if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions. When the carpet is activated, a canopy in the likeness of the rug appears 10 ft. overhead, and transparent cloth drapes down from the canopy creating an extradimensional space within the area encapsulated by the rug, canopy and cloth (30 ft. x 30 ft.). The rug is not hidden though it appears to be unoccupied. Within this space, creatures do not age, and natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see through the transparent cloth surrounding it. The transparent cloth is invisible, and even creatures that can see the transparent cloth cannot see through it. The carpet can continuously maintain this extradimensional space up to 30 days divided by the number of creatures affected by it. It must then recharge for at least 24 hours before it can be activated again.

A *carpet of luxurious flying* can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. A *carpet of luxurious flying* can hover without making a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] checks. Ownership of this carpet is considered to be the ultimate status symbol among desert peoples.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]**,* *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]**,* *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]*

**Cost** 55,000 gp

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The area of the extradimensional space was not defined by the orginal article; that area is now defined as 30 ft. x 30 ft. Also, note that the carrying capacity of the carpet is only measured against the outside of the dimensional space; the weight of objects or creatures within the extradimensional space does not affect the capacity of the carpet. The extradimensional space moves with the carpet (note this is an exception to the rule regarding extradimensional spaces not moving with vehicles.
