# Carpet of Flying, 10 ft. by 10 ft.
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; CL 10th

**Slot** —

**Price** 60,000 gp

**Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the carpet of flying is shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.


| **Size** | **Capacity** | **Speed** | **Weight** | **Market Price** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 ft. by 10 ft. | 800 lbs. | 40 ft. | 15 lbs. | 60,000 gp |

A *carpet of flying* can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. A *carpet of flying* can hover without making a [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] checks.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]*

**Cost** 30,000 gp
