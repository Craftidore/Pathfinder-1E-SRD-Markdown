# Carpet of Vexing Imprisonment
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 45,000 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

A heavy carpet woven with a labyrinthine design, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is often laid out across an entryway or similar traffic bottleneck. Once per day, after the command word is spoken, the carpet causes the next creature to cross it to be affected by a *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]* spell. Those initially trapped in the carpet may make a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape after 10 minutes. Unlike the spell, this item only permits one Intelligence check to escape per day, and all creatures within the effect occupy the same labyrinth. Subsequent checks to escape are made at sunrise each day.

Occupants cannot die of starvation or dehydration while in the *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]* effect, and may be freed from the carpet with a command word. Those trapped within the carpet become represented by a small figure woven in the pattern of the fabric.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]*

**Cost** 22,500 gp.
