# Captain's Chest
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Weight** 50 lb.

**Description**

*Although this item appears to be an ordinary and weathered sea chest, it has an unusual locking mechanism on its face. It’s carved to resemble a twisted pirates face with the keyhole as its mouth.*

A cursory examination of a *captain’s chest* reveals the usual sundries and personal effects one expects to find in a sea chest. However, when you speak the command word, the lid splits in the middle and pushes out to the sides before folding down. From the gap created, a full-sized wardrobe rises up from an extradimensional space, standing eight feet tall, four feet wide, and three feet deep. Opening the wardrobe requires a second command word. The wardrobe has hardness 5, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 25. The wardrobe holds up to 96 cubic feet of supplies and also contains a locked steel chest ([[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] DC 40) mounted in the floor (hardness 10, 60 hit points, break DC 28), which can hold up to 1 cubic foot.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*

**Cost** 1,650 gp
