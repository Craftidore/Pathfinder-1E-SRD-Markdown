### Simple Vardo

**Description**

The *vardo of the wandering wizard* looks like a small wooden box about 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a vardo (heavy wagon) 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet in height. The *folding wagon* cannot unfold if there isn’t enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside it.

In its wagon form, it is shaped like a vardo (a covered heavy wagon). A vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the eaves. Beyond this characteristic, the various types of vardos can differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, depending upon where it was made, and by whom. The roof is made wood. A vardo frequently has a door in the front as well as one in the rear.

A small cast-iron cooking stove is a common fixture of the vardo. A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A caravan's chimney is always on its right side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the right side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position. The stove rests in a small metal fireplace.

The wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, and a chest of drawers. There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have clerestories (skylights which let in light and air). A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table. Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colors, and sheathed in places with gold leaf.

Saying the word of command in reverse causes the wagon to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.

The exterior of the *vardo of the wandering wizard* is finely carved darkwood which show the adventures of its creator.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Several modifications have been tried (some without success) to the *vardo*; each successful modification adds +1 to the *vardo's* caster level (remember this is not a construction requirement (save for increasting the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] DC) but rather provides the *vardo's* caster level for *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* checks*.* The costs here for such modifications is the same whether they are incorporated into the *vardo's* construction or added later on. Any of these costs may be reduced by certain of the [[Item Creation Feats|item creation feats]] that reduce cost (cf. [[Extraordinary Artisan (Feat)|Extraordinary Artisan]]). Here are some of the successes:

Adding the *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but adds an *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* to the *vardo's* interior.

Adding the *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Attentive Alarm (Spell)|attentive alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Attuned Alarm (Spell)|attuned alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Ethereal Alarm (Spell)|ethereal alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Alarm, Greater (Spell)|greater alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Anchor (Spell)|anchor]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but renders it immobile so that it cannot be moved except by the strongest of forces when its brake is set..

Adding the *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but doubles its hardness and hit points and adds +20 to the break DC (hardness) of the *vardo*.

\* Adding the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but stabilizes its interior (to include the addtional rooms) so that items that use an extradimensional space as a part of their function (cf. *bag of holding)* function normally.

Adding the *[[Disguise Caravan (Spell)|disguise caravan]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but it appears as a completely different vehicle allowing it to seamlessly blend in with the culture and environment around it. Remember it does not disguise those driving or riding in it.

Adding the *[[Ghost Ward (Spell)|ghost ward]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Glamerwall (Spell)|glamerwall]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but wards two of its walls as that spell.

Adding the *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 1 point per 2 caster levels of the *vardo's* caster level.

\* Adding the *[[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but prevents it from being detected by all but magical means.

\* Adding the *[[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but increases its interior, changing the right side additional room into a 30 x 30 foot chamber with a sturdy door and a small fireplace. It is furnished with eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. If this spell is added to the *vardo's* construction a second time, the left side chamber is altered to mirror the right side one. The addition of this spell removes the restriction that the vardo be unoccupied before shrinking it back into its box form. This addition requires the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell addition as a prerequisite for its addition.

Flavor text for this:

When the wagon returns to its box form, whether due to hit point damage or its spoken command word, everything inside the wagon (including its cargo and all creatures other than the bearer) enters an extradimensional space shaped like the wagon's interior. The bearer is safely ejected during this shrinking, occupying the same space as the small box.

Adding the *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *vardo*, as well as around the exterior so long as it remains within 60 feet of the *vardo*.

\* Adding the *[[Instant Summons (Spell)|instant summons]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 14,000 gp and requires that the *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* spell is also added to the construction requirements; doing so causes the *vardo* to shrink to its box or model form (if it is not already in that form) and brings it to the owner's hand.

Adding the *[[Invisibility Alarm (Spell)|invisibility alarm]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 10 and gives it fire resistance 10.

Adding the *[[Ironwood, Greater (Spell)|greater ironwood]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but increases its hardness by 20 and gives it DR 20/adamantine and immunity to fire.

Adding the *[[Mage's Faithful Hound (Spell)|mage's faithful hound]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the exterior of the *vardo* within 30 feet when it is not moving as that spell.

\* Adding the *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 20,000 gp but changes the interior so the the inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Two additional rooms equivalent in size to the first (10 feet wide by 20 feet long) are accessible from the interior of the wagon and are treated as extradimensional spaces. The atmosphere in these adjoining rooms is clean, fresh, and warm regardless of outside conditions. Each has a capacity of 5,000 pounds and 2,000 cubic feet (10 feet wide by 20 feet long). Subsequent castings (each of which increases the *vardo's* price by 20,000 gp) cause one of these extradimensional spaces to double in size. 

Adding the *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the interior as that spell.

\* Adding the *[[Mirror Hideaway (Spell)|mirror hideaway]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but creates a 10 feet by 20 feet extradimensional space. This modification and the space it creates can only be used if a mirror at least 2 feet by 4 feet is present (and remains at all times) in the *vardo.* (Multiple spaces could be chained together or could be linked from a single space holding multiple mirrors. This modification can be used multiple times.)

The first addition of the *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but causes it to gain the ability so that when an animal animated from a *figurine of wondrous powe*r is harnessed to the wagon it does not encumber these creatures, provided they are at least large size. Moreover, if the animated animal takes flight, the wagon can accompany the creature without hindrance. A *vardo of the wandering wizard* can even follow an *[[Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Steed)|obsidian steed]]* during its *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* and *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]* powers.

Adding a second casting of the *[[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but causes it to gain a fly speed of 30.

\* Adding the *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but gives it a driver that makes all driver skill checks (no matter what skills are needed to drive the vehicle) as your caster level + your Intelligence modifier at the time you created the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but give it the additional powers and capabilities of that spell (for any improvement in an ability, capability, or power, use the better of the two).

Adding the *[[Phantom Worker (Spell)|phantom worker]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but creates a phantom to perform certain tasks for you. When you cast this spell, choose either phantom craftsman or phantom researcher. 

If you choose phantom craftsman, you can instruct it to work on a single crafting project. The phantom craftsman makes a [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] or [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (in the case of magical crafting) check of the appropriate type using your bonus (maximum +10) for the day’s work. The phantom craftsman is treated as having any item creation feats you possess, and you can expend spells to create the item for the phantom craftsman, allowing you to pursue other activities or aid the phantom craftsman in producing the item. 

The phantom craftsman can also make repairs to the vardo so long as its current owner has one rank in [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (wainwright) and the materials and tools needed are at hand.

If you choose the phantom researcher, you can instruct it to work on a single spell research project and it is treated as having any research related feats or abilities you possess, and you can expend spells to assist in that research (even if the spells in question have a target of personal). The phantom researcher makes the [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks just as if it were you. Subsequent castings at the same cost allow the vardo to have multiple *phantom workers* working on separate projects but each casting cannot work on the same project unless the owner of the vardo possess either the [[Cooperative Crafting (Feat)|Cooperative Crafting]] or [[Cooperative Research (Feat)|Cooperative Research]] feats.

Adding the *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 18,000 gp but allows it to move from plane to plane as if a *[[Plane Shift, Greater (Spell)|greater plane shift]]* were cast upon it.

\* Adding the *[[Power Craft (Spell)|power craft]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but causes it to move at a speed of 50 feet as that spell.

Adding the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but creates an extradimensional space that is accessible through a trapdoor in one of the *vardo's* rooms. This vault is equal in size to 10 cubic feet per CL of the *vardo.* Once the location of this trapdoor is decided upon, it cannot be changed.

\* Adding the *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]* *spell* to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but gives it the additional power to shrink down to a tiny six inch wooden model of itself upon command. Saying the same command word in reverse causes the *vardo* to return to its original size. If the *vardo* also has the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* modification, then any materials or persons within it remain inside, otherwise they are ejected when it transforms.

Adding the *[[Sign of Sealing (Spell)|sign of sealing]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but wards each of its doors (exterior and interior) as that spell.

Adding the *[[Sign of Sealing, Greater (Spell)|greater sign of sealing]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but wards each of its doors (exterior and interior) as that spell.

Adding the *[[Smoke Conduit (Spell)|smoke conduit]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but removes the need for a chimney as all harmful gases are whisked to the outside of the *vardo* via magical means.

Adding the *unseen attendant* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *unseen attendant* to act as your valet while in the interior of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* to assist in any crafting (magical or mundane) while in the interior of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Zone of Respite (Spell)|zone of respite]]* spell to the *vardo's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but adds the effects of that ward (spell) the *vardo's* interior. Note that individual area's within the *vardo* must be warded separately.

\* Substituting [[Darkwood|darkwood]] for the more common woods usually used in a wagon's construction results in the following: 

HP/inch 10; Hardness 5; Cost To determine the price of a [[Darkwood|darkwood]] item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.

This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light.

Any wooden or mostly wooden item made from [[Darkwood|darkwood]] is considered a masterwork (+1 AC if relevent) item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.

**Description**

This drab colored wagon appears to made from some light colored wood; in fact is made from magically hardened glass that has been even further reinforced through the use of the *[[Glassteel|glassteel]]* spell. 10 feet wide by 20 feet long, the* vardo* functions as a magically treated Heavy Wagon (hardness 20 and 480 hit points). However, the inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Two additional rooms equivalent in size to the first are accessible from the interior of the wagon and are treated as extradimensional spaces which have been stabilized using *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]].* The atmosphere in these adjoining rooms is clean, fresh, and warm regardless of outside conditions. Each has a capacity of 10,000 pounds and 2,000 cubic feet.

A greater boon is revealed when an animal animated from a *figurine of wondrous powe*r is harnessed to the wagon. The* vardo* does not encumber these creatures, provided they are at least large size. Moreover, if the animated animal takes flight, the wagon can accompany the creature without hindrance. A *[[Night Monarch Vardo|night monarch vardo]]* can even follow an *[[Figurine of Wondrous Power (Obsidian Steed)|obsidian steed]]* during its *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* and *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]* powers.

Upon word of command, the vardo vanishes from the sight, sound and smell of those more than 30 feet away from it. 

The vardo has been magically hardened and its structure augmented; add +20 to the DC to break it. Its interior is warded as if by a *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell.

Upon word of command, a *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* appears as does a team of four quasi-real horse-like creatures (cf. *[[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]]*). These pull the vardo effortlessly over any hindering terrain and even allow it to fly. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]], [[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]], [[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]], [[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]], [[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]], [[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]], [[Overland Flight (Spell)|overland flight]],* *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]], [[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]], [[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]],* creator must have 6 ranks in the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (carpentry) or [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (wainwright) skill

**Cost** 49,375 gp
