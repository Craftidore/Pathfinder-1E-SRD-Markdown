# Mirror of Timely Retraining
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; CL 13th

**Slot** none

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Appearance**

This gleaming crystal mirror (hardness 20, hp 20/inch, break DC 30) is a 1/2 inch thick, 3 feet wide and 6 feet high and is set in a gilded darkwood frame which has tiny carved scenes of various figures fighting, studying, resting and such.

**Description**

**Description**

Touching the mirror's surface while tracing a magical symbol (the same as the creator's *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]*) causes the one doing so to be drawn into an extradimensional space (a move action). The space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures (10 ft. by 20 ft.). Creatures that enter this space are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time, however creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside. 

The interior of the mirror contains a single almost bare room, with a fireplace in one wall and murals showing various individuals training at various skills. The walls look like mortared stone but feel like carved wood to the touch. Sleeping in this room refreshes the body and mind, so that its owner needs only sleep 4 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. Anyone sleeping for 4 hours discovers upon awakening that they dreamed of retraining a desired ability score, archetype, class feature, class level, feat, hit points, new level, racial trait, skill ranks or spells known and it is just as if they had spent 8 hours doing so.  

Should they wish to, they can immediately return to sleep for an additional 4 hours and gain the benefits of another 8 hours of retraining. They may only do this once per day.

**History**

DC 10: Bardic tales tell how it was used by the wizard Shadow and allowed her to constantly retrain her skills so that anyone attacking her could never be certain as to what they faced.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Glasteel (Spell)|glasteel]],* *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**, [[Mirror, Hideaway|mirror hideaway]],* *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp

**GM Note**

For an additional 2,000 gp of construction cost at the time you can alter the mirror’s aura so that it registers to *detect* spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were non-magical.

**General Properties of Extradimensional Spaces**

Unless otherwise stated in an extradimensional space's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a extradimensional space is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The extradimensional space blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a extradimensional space, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a extradimensional space, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the mirror automatically deactivates (if active) and becomes non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the item's crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
- If the extradimensional space allows an additional item to be crafted that crafting is done in the same 8 hour block as the first one. The second item does not have to be same as the first one.
