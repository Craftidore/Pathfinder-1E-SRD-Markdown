# Mirror, Hideaway
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Weight** 20 lbs.

**Appearance**

This gleaming crystal mirror (hardness 20, hp 20/inch, break DC 30) is a 1/2 inch thick, 3 feet wide and 6 feet high and is set in an unadorned, steel frame. 

**Description**

Touching the mirror's surface while tracing a magical symbol (the same as the creator's *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]*) causes the one doing so to be drawn into an extradimensional space (a move action). The space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures (10 ft. by 20 ft.). Creatures that enter this space are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the space can see and hear through it as if looking through an open window the same size as the mirror. Creatures outside the extradimensional space see only what is normally reflected in the mirror. Any creature in the space can make itself visible in the reflection of the mirror for 1 round at a time, however creatures outside the space cannot hear any sounds that originate inside. 

This mirror is actually a wondrous item that must be in the possession of the owner for 24 hours before it is attuned to him. Once attuned, no one but the attuned user can use this item.

Only the attuned user, his familiar(s), animal companion and up to eight others designated by him can occupy this space. Unlike other magical mirrors that open onto extradimensional spaces the storage of items or materials is allowed in this space.

Due to their construct nature, homunculi (including dedicated wrights) and other constructs, do not count against the total number of creatures which can occupy this space and may remain in an extradimensional space even after it has been closed.

This space can (at the user's desire) be connected to other extradimensional spaces (that are active) so long as they are attuned to the same user.

Extradimensional items brought within this extradimensional space function normally and have no chance of rupturing due to the use of the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell used as a part of its construction.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]]*,* *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]**,* *[[Glasteel (Spell)|glasteel]]*, *[[Mirror Hideaway (Spell)|mirror hideaway]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

This item is functionally equal to a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* so why the given cost (50% increase in cost for 100% in available storage space? It is due to the fact that it is severely limited in its usage. Much more difficult to access and accessibility is limited due to its attunement. Additionally, a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* relies upon a *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* spell.

For an additional 2,000 gp of construction cost at the time you can alter the mirror’s aura so that it registers to *detect* spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were non-magical.

**General Properties of Extradimensional Spaces**

Unless otherwise stated in an extradimensional space's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a extradimensional space is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The extradimensional space blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a extradimensional space, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a extradimensional space, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the extradimensional space automatically deactivates (if active) and it becomes non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the item's crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
- If the extradimensional space allows an additional item to be crafted that crafting is done in the same 8 hour block as the first one. The second item does not have to be same as the first one.
