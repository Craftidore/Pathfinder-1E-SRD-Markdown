# Mantle of Second Chances
## Overview
**Aura** Moderate divination (DC 20); **CL** 13th

**Slot** —

**Price** 12,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

*This mantle is made of brilliant blue cloth that is smooth to the touch, like silk. Symbols representing various elements of good fortune are embroidered along its hem in white and silver.*

Once per day you can tap into the power of good fortune. When you do so, you can reroll one roll that you have just made before the DM declares whether it resulted in success or failure. You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. You can access the mantle’s power even if you already have a similar ability from a class feature (such as the granted power of the [[Luck (Domain)|Luck]] domain).

**Lore:** A human bard named Elva, who had a knack for getting herself into tight situations, designed the original *mantle of second chances* ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history]

DC 15).

A *mantle of second chances* makes you lucky and allows you second chances when none should be possible ([[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[history] DC 20).

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Luck (Domain)|Luck]] domain

**Cost** 6,000 gp
