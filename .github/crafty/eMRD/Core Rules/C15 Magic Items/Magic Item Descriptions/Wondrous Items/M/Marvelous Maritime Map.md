# Marvelous Maritime Map
## Overview
**Aura** strong divination; **CL** 15th

**Slot** —

**Price** 81,000 gp

**Weight** 150 lb.

**Description**

This large (10x10 feet) gem-encrusted wooden board contains an inlay made of a pale blue metal, upon which are inscribed all manner of lines and compass points. Characters possessing [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) or similar skills immediately recognize the markings as navigation lines used by sailors to plot their course and direction on a map. If the map is placed on a flat surface with the blue inlay facing upwards on a seagoing vessel of any size and the command word is spoken, the magic item activates. The inlay comes alive with magical energies and produces a moving representation of every large object and creature (10 feet or longer) within 30 miles of the map’s current location. The map is centered on its current location and depicts anything it can detect that is either on the surface of the water or within 25 feet of the surface. The map does not label the objects and creatures it depicts, but it does use a standard set of symbols that differentiate classes of objects and creatures from one another. Thus, a boat appears different from a whale or an island. The map may operate continuously for up to six hours, after which time it must be left unused for 24 hours before it can be used again.
