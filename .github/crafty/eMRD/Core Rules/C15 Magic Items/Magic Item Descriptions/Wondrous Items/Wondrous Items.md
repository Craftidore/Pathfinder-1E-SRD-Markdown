# Wondrous Items
## Overview
This is a catch all category for anything that doesn’t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).

**Physical Description:** Varies.

**Activation:** Usually use-activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.

**Special Qualities:** Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.

**Creating Wondrous Architecture**

To create wondrous architecture (stationary or bulky versions of wondrous items), the character needs the proper tools and equipment to work on the item in question, whatever it may be. She also needs a supply of certain materials. The first and foremost of these is the item to be enchanted.

Unlike with other magic items, the cost of an architectural item is not subsumed into the cost of creating the item. Any other materials needed are covered in this basic cost, but the item itself must be purchased or obtained separately.

If the item has a permanent spell effect, the costs are simple to determine. They depend only on one factor: whether the item in question is removable or an embedded part of the stronghold.

If the item is bulky but technically removable—like a statue, a tapestry, or a rug—the cost to imbue it with a permanent spell effect is 1,000 gp × the spell level × the caster level.

For example, a *[[Guardian Statue (WondArch)|guardian statue]]* is a normal statue that has had the *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell permanently infused into it. Since *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* is a 1st-level spell and can be cast by a 1st-level caster, the cost for giving the statue this ability is (1,000 ×1 ×1) = 1,000 gp. The cost of the statue is entirely separate. In this way, the character can give this magic ability to any statue that she likes, no matter how artistic or mundane, and pay the original cost. If the item is not movable at all—if it’s actually a part of the stronghold and would be damaged or destroyed if removed—then the cost is 500 gp × the spell level × the caster level.

For example, an *[[Ambassador's Chamber (WondArch)|ambassador’s chamber]]* is a room in which everyone inside is affected by *friendship*, as listed under the *emotion* spell. Since *emotion* is a 3rd-level bard spell and can be cast by a 7th-level bard, the cost for giving the room this ability is (500 ×3 ×7 =) 10,500 gp. Building the room, of course, is paid for normally.

If the prerequisites for making the item include one or more spells, the creator must have the spells prepared ahead of time or, in the case of a sorcerer or a bard, at least know the spells. She does not have to provide any material components or focuses the spell requires, nor are any XP costs inherent in any of these spells incurred in the creation of the item. The act of working on the spell triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting on any of the days that the creator is working on the item. Those spell slots are expended from the creator’s currently prepared or known spells, just as if they had been cast in the course of an adventure.

Creating some items may involve meeting other prerequisites than simply being able and available to cast the spells in question. See the individual descriptions of the various magic items for full details.

Crafting wondrous architecture requires one day for each 1,000 gp of the worth of the created item. Creating the *[[Ambassador's Chamber (WondArch)|ambassador’s chamber]]* described above, for instance, would require eleven days of work on the part of the creator.

**Disabling Wondrous Architecture**

As a stationary magic item, wondrous architecture is essentially identical to a magic trap (even though some have beneficial rather than harmful effects), such items can be discovered by a rogue (or other character capable of finding traps) and deactivated with a [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill check. The DC for both Search and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] checks is equal to 25 + the spell level of the highest-level spell used in the construction of the wondrous architecture.

A successful [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] check against an item of wondrous architecture suppresses its magic properties for 1d4 rounds (just as if you had successfully cast *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* against the item). If you beat the check by 10 or more, you suppress its magic properties for 1d4 minutes instead.
