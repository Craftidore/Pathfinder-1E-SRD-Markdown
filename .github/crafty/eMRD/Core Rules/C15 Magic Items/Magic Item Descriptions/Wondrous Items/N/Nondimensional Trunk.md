**Source:** Dragon 294, pg. 51

**GM Note**

*House Rule:*  The original article does not give any dimensions for the trunk itself only a maximum weight for what it can hold. It does reference the fact that anything with dimensions less than 10 feet in any direction fits within. However, since several items that are actually extra-dimensional spaces also allow for objects to fit within that would not normally pass through the given opening. It is recommended that GMs use the following dimensions for the *nondimensional trunk:* 3 feet across by 5 feet long by 3 feet high.
