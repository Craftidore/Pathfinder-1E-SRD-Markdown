This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head.

Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone grants resist energy 1 against electrical attacks (doesn't stack), while orbiting.
