# Ioun Stone, sky blue sphere
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 27,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

A valuable protective item and a masterpiece of magical engineering, this item protects its wearer from elemental magic by absorbing it until the owner can take measures to protect herself.

When the user of this stone takes any amount of magical acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, the stone absorbs up to 50 hp of that damage. The character takes this damage 1d4+1 rounds later, giving her time to take defensive measures: for example, she might cast *resist elements* or drink a  potion of *[[Cure Serious Wounds (Spell)|cure serious wounds]]*. If this item is removed from orbit around the user’s head while it still contains stored damage, the full amount of damage stored is immediately dealt to the *ioun stone* itself. If this damage destroys the stone, the excess damage discharges harmlessly.

Only damage from a magical source such as a spell or spell-like effect is prevented by this *ioun stone*. For example, it would protect against an *[[Acid Arrow (Spell)|acid arrow]]* spell or the extra fire damage from a *[[Flaming (MagWpnSpcAb)|flaming]]* weapon, but not damage from falling into lava or nonmagical acid.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 13,500 gp
