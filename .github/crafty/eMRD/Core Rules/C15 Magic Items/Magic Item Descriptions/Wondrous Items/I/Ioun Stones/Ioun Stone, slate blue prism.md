# Ioun Stone, slate blue prism
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 20,600 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

Divine wisdom infuses this stone, which is finely inlaid in gold. The user of this stone has access to a daily reservoir of divine energy, which she can use to empower her existing class abilities. Once per day, the energy in this stone can be used to make an extra smite attempt (such as smite evil) or an extra use of channel energy. Alternatively, it may be used to prepare an extra divine spell of 2nd level or lower. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 10,300 gp
