# Ioun Stone, silver dodecahedron
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 12,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This silver ioun stone is unusually bright for its kind. Each day at dawn, the stone grants the owner 20 temporary hit points which last until the next dawn. These temporary hit points do not stack with those from other ioun stones.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[False Life (Spell)|false life]]*, creator must be 12th level

**Cost** 6,000 gp

**Source:** 365 Magic Items (Zenith Games), pg. 56

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Renamed from silver spindle to silver dodecahedron to avoid duplication.
