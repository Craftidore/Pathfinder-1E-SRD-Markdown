# Incense of Meditation
## Overview
**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 4,900 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This small rectangular block of sweet-smelling incense is visually indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check.

When a divine spellcaster lights a block of *incense of meditation* and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the [[Maximize Spell (Feat)|Maximize Spell]] feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat). Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Maximize Spell (Feat)|Maximize Spell]], *[[Bless (Spell)|bless]]*

**Cost** 2,450 gp
