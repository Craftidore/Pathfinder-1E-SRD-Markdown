# Ioun Stone, vermilion sphere
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th

**Slot** —

**Price** 6,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires this stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This fiery-looking stone is constantly warm. Up to three times per day as a move action, but no more than once per round, its user may direct it to fire a crimson ray as a ranged touch attack at a creature within 30 feet, dealing 1d6+2 fire damage. A *vermilion sphere* requires 24 hours to attune with a new owner before use, though it need not be circling their head the entire time, and an owner may be attuned to no more than one such stone at a time.
