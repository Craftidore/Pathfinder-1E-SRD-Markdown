This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use.

Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner.

Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone stores one spell level, as a *[[Spell Storing, Minor (Ring)|ring of spell storing (minor)]],* while orbiting.
