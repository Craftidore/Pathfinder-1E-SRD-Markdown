This crystalline stone always floats in the air and must be within 3 feet of its owner to be of any use.

Thereafter, the stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow the stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

This ioun stone grants *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, as per the spell (CL 17), while orbiting.
