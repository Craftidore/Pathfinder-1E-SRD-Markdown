# Instant Fortress
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 13th

**Slot** —

**Price** 55,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even *[[Knock (Spell)|knock]]* spells can’t open the door.

The [[Adamantine|adamantine]] walls of an *instant fortress* have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, which restores 50 points of damage taken.

The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device’s owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress’s sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage’s magnificent mansion]]*

**Cost** 27,500 gp

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* To activate the *instant fortress,* the owner drops it to the ground IMMEDIATELY in front of himself while uttering the command word. The *instant fortress* can be used (activated/deactiated) no more then 3 times per day.

*House Rule:* The interior of the *instant fortress* is comprised of 3 floors and a basement, each of which 20 ft. square and 9 ft. high. The player should provide the GM with a map of its interior; otherwise the GM provides one to the player. In either case, once the interior layout is settled upon, it is fixed (for that cube) permanently.

*House Rule:* The restriction that the *instant fortress* must be empty before deactivation is removed with regards to objects and nonliving creatures (constructs and undead should be decided by GM after talking with the player. This allows the player to have a semi-secure place for storage and can provide the GM with some interesting game hooks (for example, player finds an *instant fortress* as treasure without realizing its lich occupant is still in residence).

*House Rule:* The [[Adamantine|adamantine]] walls' hit points and hardness are per 10 foot section.

*House Rule:* An *instant fortress* or some other structures may be further enchanted using the following rules.

*House Rule:* Several modifications have been tried (some without success) to the *fortress*; each successful modification adds +1 to the structure's caster level (remember this is not a construction requirement but rather provides the structure's caster level for *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* checks*.* Here are some of the successes:

Adding the *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but adds an *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* to the structure's interior.

Adding the *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but doubles its hardness and hit points and adds +20 to the break DC of the structure.

Adding the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell to the structure*'*s construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but stabilizes its interior (to include the addtional rooms) so that items that use an extradimensional space as a part of their function (cf. *bag of holding)* function normally.

Adding the *[[Disguise Caravan (Spell)|disguise caravan]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but it appears as a completely different structure allowing it to seamlessly blend in with the culture and environment around it. Remember it does not disguise those within in it.

Adding the *[[Alarm, Greater (Spell)|greater alarm]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 1 point per 2 caster levels of the structure's caster level.

Adding the *[[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but prevents it from being detected by all but magical means.

Adding the *[[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but increases its interior, adding an additional space to the right side in the form of a  30 x 30 foot chamber with a sturdy door and a small fireplace. It is furnished with eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. If this spell is added to the *fortress'* construction twice, the left side chamber is altered to mirror the right side one.

Adding the *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the structure.

Adding the *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the interior as that spell

Adding the *[[Phantom Wagon (Spell)|phantom wagon]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but give it the additional powers and capabilities of that spell (any improvement in an ability, capability, or power, use the better of the two).

Adding the *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 18,000 gp but allows it to move from plane to plane as if a *[[Plane Shift, Greater (Spell)|greater plane shift]]* were cast upon it.

Adding the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but creates an extradimensional space that is accessible through a trapdoor in one of the *fortress'* three rooms. This vault is equal in size to 10 cubic feet per CL of the *fortress.* Once the location of this trapdoor is decided upon, it cannot be changed.

Adding the *unseen attendant* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *unseen attendant* to act as your valet while in the interior of the structure.

Adding the *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* to assist in any crafting (magical or mundane) while in the interior of the structure.

Adding the *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell to the structure's construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the structure.
