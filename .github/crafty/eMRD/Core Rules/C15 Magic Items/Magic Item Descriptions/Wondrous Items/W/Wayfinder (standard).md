# Wayfinder (standard)
## Overview
**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none

**Price** 500 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A small magical device patterned off ancient relics of the Azlanti, a *wayfinder* is typically made from silver and bears gold accents. With a command word, you can use a *wayfinder* to shine (as the *[[Light (Spell)|light]]* spell). The *wayfinder* also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks to avoid becoming lost. All *wayfinders* include a small indentation designed to hold a single *ioun stone*. An *ioun stone* slotted in this manner grants you its normal benefits (as if it were orbiting your head), but frequently reveals entirely new powers due to the magic of the *wayfinder* itself.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Light (Spell)|light]]*

**Cost** 250 gp

**Source:** Seeker of Secrets, pg. 50
