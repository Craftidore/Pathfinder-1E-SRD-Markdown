**Description**

Crafted from the finest materials, the Golden Carriage of Gaspar Longfellow is a vehicle fit for royalty. Larger than an average carriage, the Golden Carriage can accommodate six occupants in the interior, as well as two drivers and a footman on the exterior. The interior is lavishly furnished and magically maintained-occupants are protected from extreme heat and cold as if under the effects of *[[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]]*, and are treated as acclimated creatures for altitudes up to 15,000 feet (see altitude zones, *Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook* 430). Both doors of the carriage are secured against intruders with *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* and *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]* spells, and an invisible driver can control the reins as *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* if no living driver is controlling the carriage. The most prominent features of the Golden Carriage are the four spectral steeds that pull it. Adorned in beautiful scarlet leather harnesses, these gray horses pull the carriage tirelessly over nearly any terrain . These horses function as *[[Phantom Steed (Spell)|phantom steed]]* cast by a 12th-level caster, and grant their *[[Air Walk (Spell)|air walk]]**,* *[[Water Walk (Spell)|water walk]]**,* and other abilities to the carriage.

**History**

Gaspar Longfellow was born Gaspar Harfast, a member of the Gahan nobility long before the Red Revolution. An impetuous young man, Gaspar asked for his portion of his inheritance early and-against his family's warnings used the funds to commission a fine coach in which to travel across Golarion. The carriage was a shining example of Galt's artistry, and splendid to behold as its four gray horses whisked young Gaspar out on his first adventure.

Time soon proved that Gaspar had more enthusiasm than sense. While traveling through the River Kingdoms, the carriage was waylaid by bandits, who stripped Gaspar of all that he had and slew his faithful team of horses. Abandoned by his driver and gravely injured, Gaspar was rescued by a small group of travelers, and it was then that his true journey began. During his travels with his new companions, the young noble took a new name and studied the arcane arts under many masters, applying the fruits of his labor to recreating his beloved carriage. Finally, after much trial and error, his carriage was finally reborn, pulled by phantom steeds in the image of his ill-fated grays. Now the coach could move across rough ground, marshy paths, and even across water and through thin air with equal ease.

With Gaspar at their head, the adventuring group (which eventually became known as the Longfellow Irregulars) used the carriage's unparalleled ability to cover hazardous terrain to explore previously unreachable areas and ancient sites. Eventually, the group became accomplished Pathfinders, and when Gaspar finally returned to his beloved Galt, he was given a hero's welcome. Upon his retirement, Gaspar, now known more for his discoveries than his noble pedigree, gifted his Golden Carriage to the country itself, saying that it represented Galt's skill, ingenuity, and spirit of adventure.

The carriage left the country only once more-to carry King Regus of Galt through the River Kingdoms on his own fantastic journey-before it was given over to the Pathfinder Lodge to preserve and protect. The fanatics of the Red Revolution had other ideas, however, and the Golden Carriage vanished in the chaos of the revolution.

**Legacy**

As an ostentatious and well-known national treasure, the Golden Carriage ef Gaspar Longfellow manages to attract attention wherever it is taken.

**Sought by the Society:** To the Pathfinders, the carriage is not only a powerful magic item, but a piece of history. Perhaps more importantly, it was officially under their protection when it was lost. Their honor sullied, the Pathfinders have a vested interest in finding and retrieving it. 

**Symbol of a Country:** The Golden Carriage is well known throughout Galt, and serves as the subject of many a children's tale. It also represents the ideals of a people concerned with art and beauty rather than false justice and bloodshed. While revolutionaries felt that it represented the decadence of corrupt nobles, others see it as a reminder of a bygone golden age.
