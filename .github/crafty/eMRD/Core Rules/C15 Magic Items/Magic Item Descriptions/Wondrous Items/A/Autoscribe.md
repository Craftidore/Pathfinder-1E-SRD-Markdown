# Autoscribe
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 55,000 gp

**Weight** 20 lbs.

**Description**

The autoscribe is an arcane caster's dream: a writing device that can make spell scrolls day and night. Like all devices seemingly too good to be true, though, it comes at a price in materials.

**Appearance**

The autoscribe resembles a scribe's writing desk. It's taller than it is wide, with three pewter inkpots built into the top, a sloping writing surface, and a metal-nib attached to a series of writing arms and levers. When in operation, it hums and scratches while moving the nib slowly across the paper. It can make use of gold illumination, magical inks, and even special colors and waxes to create the perfect arcane scroll. Its three arms are attached to the top and side of the writing surface and can reach a set of interchangeable quills and inkpots in its interior.

**Use and Powers**

To use an autoscribe, a spellcaster must use the attached metal quill to write out a fair copy of a spell scroll in the usual way, and make a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (3.5 Concentration) check (DC 20 + spell level) while doing so. If successful, this process "teaches" the autoscribe that spell. An autoscribe can contain 10 spells in its internal collection at any time; if it already has 10 spells, it cannot learn more until one or more spells are removed. It can be taught arcane or divine spells, but not both at the same time. A divine caster wishing to teach it divine spells must clear out the entire collection if there are arcane spells in the machine's collection. Casting an *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* spell on an autoscribe removes one spell from its collection, while casting a *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]* on it removes all spells from its collection.

Once taught a spell, the autoscribe knows how to make additional copies of that scroll. Any spellcaster who has that spell on her class spell list can command the autoscribe to make usable scrolls of it. The copies take 1 hour per spell level to create instead of the usual 1 day per 1,000 gp value of the scroll, and the user must spend one additional hour loading the autoscribe with the appropriate materials. The materials cost half the gp value of the scroll, as usual for making scrolls, and the autoscribe can hold enough materials to make 10 copies of all 10 of the spells in its collection before needing to be reloaded. Spell scrolls are created at the minimum caster level for the spell in question, and the autoscribe can only put one spell on a scroll.

An autoscribe can be commanded by non-spellcasters using [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] with a successful check DC (20 + caster level of the scroll to be produced). If the check fails, the autoscribe jams or otherwise becomes damaged by the attempt and must be repaired by an artificer. The cost in XP for non-casters is twice the cost that a legitimate spellcaster pays, and the non-caster must still supply the materials if the autoscribe is out.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]], [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]], *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]**,* *[[Secret Page (Spell)|secret page]]**,* *[[Arcane Mark (Spell)|arcane mark]]**,* *[[Amanuensis (Spell)|amanuensis]]*

**Cost** 27,500 gp

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The autoscribe must be loaded with any special materials with a value over 50 gp. It can hold enough materials for 10 copies of each spell it is loaded with.

**Campaign Hooks**

Someone has taught an autoscribe to write *[[Charm Person (Spell)|charm person]]* scrolls, and is using them in a series of charmed robberies. The victims only discover later that someone has enchanted them into giving away their wealth.

The local scribe's guild has gone bankrupt trying to compete with an autoscribe-powered shop in the local capitol. The head scribe asks the party to either steal the autoscribe or find a way to make it forget the spells it knows.
