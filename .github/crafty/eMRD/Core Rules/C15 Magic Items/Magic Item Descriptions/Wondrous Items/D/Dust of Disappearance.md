# Dust of Disappearance
## Overview
**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 7th

**Slot** —

**Price** 3,500 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This dust looks like *[[Dust of Appearance|dust of appearance]]* and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]*). Normal vision can’t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including *[[See Invisibility (Spell)|see invisibility]]* or *[[Invisibility Purge (Spell)|invisibility purge]]*. *[[Dust of Appearance|Dust of appearance]]*, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by *dust of disappearance*. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]* bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn’t know when the duration will end.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Invisibility, Greater (Spell)|greater invisibility]]*

**Cost** 1,750 gp
