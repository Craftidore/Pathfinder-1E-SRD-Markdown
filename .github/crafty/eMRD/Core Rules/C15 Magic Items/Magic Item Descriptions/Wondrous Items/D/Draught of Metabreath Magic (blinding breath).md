# Draught of Metabreath Magic (blinding breath)
## Overview
**Aura** varies; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 750 gp

**Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This draught is a thick liquid, similar to a potion, that bestows a magical effect on a creature drinking it. The magical effect duplicates the metabreath spell named, but the drinker must supply the breath component for the effect to take place. Drinking a draught is a standard action, and activates the magic of the draught for just over 1 round. After drinking, the drinker must use its breath weapon before the end of the next round. This use of the drinker’s breath weapon is enhanced as if the drinker had cast the appropriate metabreath spell on itself.

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Blinding Breath (Spell)|blinding breath]]*

**Cost** 375 gp
