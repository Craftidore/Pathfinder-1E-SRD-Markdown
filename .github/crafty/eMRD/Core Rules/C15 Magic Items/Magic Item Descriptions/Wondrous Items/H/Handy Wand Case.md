# Handy Wand Case
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 4th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

Like the *[[Handy Scroll Tube|handy scroll tube]]*, this six-pocket cloth sheath is a boon to spellcasters. Each pocket of the case can hold a single magic wand. With the merest thought (a free action), the wearer can summon any wand from the case into his hand. At the end of the round--or when the caster finishes activating the wand, for spells with a longer casting time--the wand magically disappears back into the case.  

If the case's power is suppressed or dispelled, the wands remain within, but cannot be accessed until the item functions once again.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]*

**Cost** 1,000 gp
