# Handy Hideout
## Overview
**Aura** monderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 40,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This 4-sided pyramid is small (1 inch high) and each of its sides is comprised of a different element (stone, sand, unmelting ice, and wood), but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a house that is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It might appear as a house-sized boulder in a rocky or mountainous area, as a sand dune in the desert, as a densely tangled thicket, a grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The hideout also obscures all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within.

At any distance of more than 30 feet, the hideout is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 30 feet is entitled to a DC 30 [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] check to spot the *handy hideout* as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape. 

The floor is level, clean, and dry. The hideout resembles a normal house (30' x 30' x 10'), with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

The hideout is heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The hideout does, however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The hideout resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane lock]]* and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell. Finally, an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.

The *handy hideout* contains crude furnishings—eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. A small trapdoor under the writing desk leads down into a stone cellar also 30' x 30' ft in size.

The hideout springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device’s owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the hideout’s sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).

The hideout is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Hidden Lodge (Spell)|hidden lodge]]*

**Cost** 20,000 gp

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* To activate the *handy hideout,* the owner drops it to the ground IMMEDIATELY in front of himself while uttering the command word. The *handy hideout* can be used (activated/deactivated) no more then 3 times per day.

*House Rule:* The restriction that the *handy hideout* must be empty before deactivation is removed with regards to objects and nonliving creatures (constructs and undead should be decided by GM after talking with the player). This allows the player to have a semi-secure place for storage and can provide the GM with some interesting game hooks (for example, player finds an *handy hideout* as treasure without realizing its lich occupant is still in residence).

*House Rule:* A *handy hideout* may be further enchanted using the normal rules for altering magical items. Another possibility is using the [[C02 Stronghold Components|Stonghold Components]] from the Advanced Construction rules.

*House Rule:* Several modifications have been tried (some without success) to the *hideout*; each successful modification adds +1 to the *hideout's* caster level (remember this is not a construction requirement but rather provides the *hideout's* caster level for *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* checks*.* Here are some of the successes:

Adding the *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but adds an *[[Aeonian Lantern (Spell)|aeonian lantern]]* to the *hideout's* interior.

Adding the *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Augment Object (Spell)|augment object]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but doubles its hardness and hit points and adds +20 to the break DC of the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but stabilizes its interior (to include the addtional rooms) so that items that use an extradimensional space as a part of their function (cf. *bag of holding)* function normally.

Adding the *[[Disguise Caravan (Spell)|disguise caravan]]* spell to the hideout's construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but it appears as a completely different structure allowing it to seamlessly blend in with the culture and environment around it. Remember it does not disguise those within in it.

Adding the *[[Alarm, Greater (Spell)|greater alarm]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but wards it as that spell.

Adding the *[[Hardening (Spell)|hardening]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 1 point per 2 caster levels of the *hideout's* caster level.

Adding the *[[Hidden Caravan (Spell)|hidden caravan]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 8,000 gp but prevents it from being detected by all but magical means.

Adding the *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Improved Unseen Servant (Spell)|improved unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *hideout*.

Adding the *[[Ironwood (Spell)|ironwood]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 12,000 gp but increases its hardness by 10 to a total of 20 and gives it fire resistance 10.

Adding the *[[Ironwood, Greater (Spell)|greater ironwood]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but gives it DR 5/[[Adamantine|adamantine]] and immunity to fire.

Adding the *[[Mage's Private Sanctum (Spell)|mage's private sanctum]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 10,000 gp but wards the interior as that spell

Adding the *[[Phantom Driver (Spell)|phantom driver]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 6,000 gp but gives it a driver that makes all driver skill checks (no matter what skills are needed to drive the vehicle) as your caster level + your Intelligence modifier at the time you created the *vardo*.

Adding the *[[Planar Navigation (Spell)|planar navigation]]* spell to the hideout's construction requirements increases its price by 18,000 gp but allows it to move from plane to plane as if a *[[Plane Shift, Greater (Spell)|greater plane shift]]* were cast upon it.

Adding the *[[Secret Vault (Spell)|secret vault]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 16,000 gp but creates an extradimensional space that is accessible through a trapdoor in one of the *hideout's* three rooms. This vault is equal in size to 10 cubic feet per CL of the *hideout.* Once the location of this trapdoor is decided upon, it cannot be changed.

Adding the *unseen attendant* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *unseen attendant* to act as your valet while in the interior of the *hideout*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 4,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Crafter (Spell)|unseen crafter]]* to assist in any crafting (magical or mundane) while in the interior of the *hideout*.

Adding the *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell to the *hideout's* construction requirements increases its price by 2,000 gp but provides an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* to assist with chores in the interior of the *hideout*.
