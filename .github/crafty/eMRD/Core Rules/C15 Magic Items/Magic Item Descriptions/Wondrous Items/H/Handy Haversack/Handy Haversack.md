# Handy Haversack
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a *bag of holding* and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*

**Cost** 1,000 gp

**Horrific Haversack**

**Aura:** major conjuration; **CL:** 12th

**Price:** +20,000 gp

**Weight:** +20 lbs.

**Description**

A horrific haversack is larger and heavier than a typical haversack, because it’s main compartment is actually a small wooden chest. A command word must be spoken for anyone other than its owner to put on the haversack safely, carry it, or to remove anything from it when it is not worn. A second command word makes a character the haversack’s current owner. If a character other than its owner attempts to put on, move, or remove something from the horrific haversack without speaking the command word, it swells up to be a Medium humanoid form of wood and leather, and defends itself. If it sees its owner in this form, it moves toward him and obeys his commands. This form of the haversack acts as a wood golem, though it also still contains storage (and can get items out of itself).

The owner can return the golem to its haversack state with a command word. If the golem is destroyed, it converts back to its haversack state and repairs itself in 30 days. (It cannot become a golem during this time.) If the haversack state is destroyed, the entire item is destroyed.

**Description**

Homogenous haversacks are a set of handy haversacks that share a common set of extradimensional spaces. One haversack in each set is the primary haversack, and the true container of all items placed in any of the homogenous haversacks in a set. Every other haversack within the set can add item to or remove them from the primary haversack as long as they are within 10 miles and on the same plane of existence.
