# Horn of Fog
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** â€”

**Price** 2,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an *[[Obscuring Mist (Spell)|obscuring mist]]* spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Obscuring Mist (Spell)|obscuring mist]]*

**Cost** 1,000 gp
