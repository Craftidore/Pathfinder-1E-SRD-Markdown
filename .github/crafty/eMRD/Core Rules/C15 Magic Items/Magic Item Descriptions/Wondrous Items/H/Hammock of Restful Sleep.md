# Hammock of Restful Sleep
## Overview
**Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 14,000 gp

**Description**

This extremely comfortable hammock is a must-have item on ships with diminished crew numbers. Those who sleep in the *hammock of restful sleep* gain all the benefits of full rest in only half the time. For example, a human who sleeps in the *hammock of restful sleep* gains the benefits of 8 hours of sleep in 4 hours — they heal damage at the rate of 1 hit point per level, the [[Fatigued|fatigued]] condition is removed, and so forth. The only exception is that arcane spell casters must still sleep for a full 8 hours prior to preparing spells or regaining spell slots.

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]*

**Cost** 7,000 gp
