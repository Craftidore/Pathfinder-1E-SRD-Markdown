# Headband of Mental Prowess +6
## Overview
**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** headband

**Price** 90,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This simple copper headband has a small yellow gem set so that when it rests upon the forehead of the wearer, the yellow gem sits perched on the wearer’s brow as if it were a third eye in the middle of his forehead. Often, the headband contains additional designs to further accentuate the appearance of a third, crystal eye.

The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to two mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. These bonuses are chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a *headband of vast intelligence*.
