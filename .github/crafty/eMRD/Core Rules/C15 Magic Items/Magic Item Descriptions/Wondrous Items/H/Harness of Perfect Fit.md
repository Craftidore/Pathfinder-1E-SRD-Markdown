# Harness of Perfect Fit
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** –

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 26 lbs. (including saddle)

**Description**

When not in use, a *harness of perfect fit* appears to be an ordinary, finely made, leather horse harness (bit, bridle, a saddle, and pack straps). When placed on any mount, it adjusts to mold to the shape of the animal; for instance, the bit changes shape to fit a hippogriff’s beak instead of a horse’s mouth, extra straps appear to accommodate a dragon’s wings, and the saddle widens to conform to a riding bear’s back.

If a *secure saddle* is attached to the *harness of perfect fit* before the harness is placed on an animal, the saddle will transform along with the rest of the harness.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]*

**Cost** 900 gp

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 120
