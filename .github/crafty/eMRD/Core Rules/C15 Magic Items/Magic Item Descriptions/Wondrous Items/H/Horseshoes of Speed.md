# Horseshoes of Speed
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** feet

**Price** 3,000 gp

**Weight** 12 lbs. (for four)

**Description**

These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal’s hooves, they increase the animal’s base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally (see Chapter 4 of the *PFRG Core Rulebook*). All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*

**Cost** 1,500 gp

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 520
