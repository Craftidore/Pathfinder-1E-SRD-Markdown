# Bag of Endless Caltrops
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,300 gp gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This nondescript leather pouch creates an endless supply of caltrops. The owner can reach into the pouch and pull out handful after handful. It takes one standard action to fill a 5-foot square by hand. If the pouch is dumped out (as a partial action), it produces the equivalent of a 2-pound unit, but does not produce any more caltrops at all for 2 whole rounds.

The caltrops produced are not magical and follow all the rules for normal caltrops.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*

**Cost** 1,650 gp
