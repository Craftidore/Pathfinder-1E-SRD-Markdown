# Boat, Folding
## Overview
**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** —

**Price** 7,200 gp

**Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

A *folding boat* looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The *folding boat* cannot unfold if there isn’t enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]*, creator must have 2 ranks in the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) skill

**Cost** 3,600 gp

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 502

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The command words for such vessels is often some variant of their name and can be frequently found carved onto the box somewhere.  A favorite of some GMs is to use *[[Illusory Script (Spell)|illusory script]]* for the command words; doing so adds that spell to the requirements for construction and increases the price to 7,500 gp. Another often used is to make the command words invisible and/or to place them on the underside of a sliding lid. 

*House Rule:* There are rumored to be other, larger variants of the *folding boat*; some of which use the *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]* spell as a part of their construction. Such a folding boat would have increased storage capacity, even when folded.
