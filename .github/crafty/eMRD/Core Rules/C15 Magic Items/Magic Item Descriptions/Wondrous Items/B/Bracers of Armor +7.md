# Bracers of Armor +7
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** wrists

**Price** 49,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These items appear to be wrist or arm guards. They surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +7, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Alternatively, *bracers of armor* can be enchanted with armor special abilities. See Table 15–4 (of the *PF Core Rulebook)* for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. *Bracers of armor* cannot have a modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +8. *Bracers of armor* must have at least a +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability. *Bracers of armor* cannot have any armor special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost. *Bracers of armor* and ordinary armor do not stack. If a creature receives a larger armor bonus from another source, the *bracers of armor* cease functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor special abilities. If the *bracers of armor* grant a larger armor bonus, the other source of armor ceases functioning.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]*, creator’s caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed in the bracers, plus any requirements of the armor special abilities

**Cost** 24,500 gp
