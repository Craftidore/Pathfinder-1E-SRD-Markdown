# Bag of Holding Type V
## Overview
**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Contents Limit** 2,500 lbs.

**Contents Volume Limit** 450 cubic ft.

**Price** 12,500 gp

**Weight** 100 lbs.

**Description**

This appears to be a common cloth sack about 4 feet by 6 feet in size. The *bag of holding* opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag’s contents, depend on the bag’s type.

Because of the larger volume of a giant-sized bag of holding, retrieving a specific item from it is always a full-round action.

Type V and Type VI *bags of holding* are most commonly found in use by giants and other Large creatures, but giants of Huge size or larger sometimes use even greater *bags of holding*.

If a *bag of holding* is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a *bag of holding* is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a *bag of holding* is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. 

If a *bag of holding* is placed within a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]**,* a rift to the [[Astral Plane]] is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* is placed within a *bag of holding,* it opens a gate to the [[Astral Plane]]: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* and *bag of holding* in the process.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secret Chest (Spell)|secret chest]]*

**Cost** 6,250 gp
