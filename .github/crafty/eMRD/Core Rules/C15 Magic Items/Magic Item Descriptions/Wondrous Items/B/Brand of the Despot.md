# Brand of the Despot
## Overview
**Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 5,500 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The demon-face glyph of the Ruby Sea sits prominently at the end of blacked branding iron—a few also feature a Captain’s rune or symbol. Its wielder can make a touch attack as she utters the command word. Any creature touched by the brand takes 1 hp nonlethal damage and must obey the wielder to the best of the creature’s ability for one minute. A successful Will save (DC 12) negates the nonlethal damage and the target can act normally. The brand can be heated in a fire of at least torch-size for one minute. Once the brand is heated, it deals 1 hp fire damage in addition to its other effects for one minute. If a creature takes fire damage from the brand, it suffers a −2 penalty on its Will save to resist the brand’s effects.

The slave keepers of the Despotate are issued these brands to control willful or valued slaves. More powerful versions of this item exist, heirlooms from the earliest days of the Despotate.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Bleed (Spell)|bleed]], [[Command (Spell)|command]], forbid action*

**Cost** 2,750 gp
