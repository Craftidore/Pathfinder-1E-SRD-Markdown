# Bracers of Wands
## Overview
**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** wrist

**Price** 60,000 gp

**Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

*Bracers of wands* are magical leather armbands that extend from wrist to elbow. On the undersides of each, leather straps binds them onto the wearer's arm, while the back of each bracer holds three thin leather tubes, each just big enough to hold a standard (sized) magic wand.

*Bracers of wands* can be 'attuned' to different wands. Immediately after being placed in one of the slots of the bracers, a charge is harmlessly drained from the wand. The wand is then attuned to the slot and remains so until removed. Wands in a bracer slot can be used without the need to draw them and without the need to hold the wand in a hand.

Wands can be removed and replaced from slots in *bracers of wands,* but each time a wand is attuned to a slot on a bracer, it loses another charge. Both bracers must be worn for the *bracers of wands* to function.

Wands in the *bracers of wands* can be attacked and broken, and characters using the bracers can be disarmed of wands. In such cases, treat the wands as though they were held by the wearer.

The *bracers of wands* do not grant a character the ability to use a wand if the character is not normally able to do so. Rogues attempting to use a wand in *bracers of wands* with their [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] skill must first make a skill check to use the bracers (DC 20) and then a second check to use the wand.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]*

**Cost** 30,000 gp

**Source:** Dragon 291, pg. 51

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* For purposes of the [[Wand Parry (Feat)|Wand Parry]] feat and any of its subsequent higher tier feats, a character wearing a *bracers of wands* is considered able to parry and is not considered unarmed while doing so.
