**Description**

*Telkiiras* (greater lore gems) are powerful lore-gems worn by the leaders of the mightiest elf clans. Each *telkiira* holds the knowledge, skills, and sometimes even a fragment of personality from each of the elves who previously wore it*.* Only a few of these devices survived the destruction of Myth Drannor and the other fallen elven realms, and most of those that remain are jealously guarded by their houses. At least a few have made their way into the hands of other creatures over the millennia.

When placed on the forehead of an elf, a *telkiira* confers the following benefits.

- The wearer gains a +4 insight bonus on Will saves.
- The wearer gains a +6 insight bonus to Intelligence.
- A *telkiira* contains 10 ranks in each of four different Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skills. Among the most common skills available from a *telkiira* are [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (history), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]. When making a check involving one of the *telkiira*’s skills, the wearer can use either the device’s ranks in that skill or his own, whichever is higher. He uses his own ability modifier for any skill check using the *telkiira*’s ranks.
- A *telkiira* functions as a spellbook that can hold up to 1,000 spells. A wizard can “write” a spell into a *telkiira* without paying the usual material costs, although he still must take the normal time to do so. A *telkiira* is fully erasable, so its owner can remove spells and replace them with new ones as he sees fit.
- A *telkiira* can hold up to ten distinct memories, each up to 1 hour in length, with perfect clarity. A wearer who accesses one of these memories experiences it as if she were the person who recorded it. Writing a memory requires 1 full round, regardless of its length. *Telkiiras* often hold important or treasured memories of their previous owners.

Only an elf or a creature with elf blood (a half-elf, for example) can wear a *telkiira* safely. Any other creature that places the gem on its forehead gains two negative levels and cannot use any of its abilities. These negative levels remain as long as the *telkiira* is worn and disappear as soon as it is removed.

*Telkiiras* are often locked to prevent unauthorized elves from enjoying their full benefits. An elf wearing a locked *telkiira* gains none of the benefits described above except the bonuses to Intelligence and on Will saves. Any member of the house, clan, or family that owns a given *telkiira* can lock or unlock it as a free action. Any other wearer can attempt a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check or Charisma check (DC 20 for either) to open a locked *telkiira.* Failure means the wearer must wait until he attains his next level before trying again. 

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]]*,* *[[Fox's Cunning (Spell)|fox’s cunning]]**,* *[[Protection From Spells (Spell)|protection from spells]]**,* *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]**,* *[[Vision (Spell)|vision]]**,* creator must be an elf

**Cost** 50,000 gp

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Changed text from '200 pages of spells' to '1,000 spells' and 'without paying the usual material cost of 25 gp per page,' to 'without paying the usual material costs'. This change is to make it more powerful than the much less expensive *[[Blessed Book|blessed book]].*

*House Rule:* Changed text from 'gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence' to 'gains a +6 insight bonus to Intelligence'.

The racial restrictions on wearing a *telkiira* can bypassed with a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 45, not the usual DC 25 to emulate a race). This must be done each time the *telkiira* is removed and then placed back on. There are at least 3 non-elves known to have possessed and worn *telkiiras* in the World of Greyhawk (cf. Tanith Nehli) and one from the Forgotten Realms (Elminster Aumar, Prince of Athalantar \[Lost Empires of Faerun, pg 130]).

*Telkiira* may be further enchanted using the normal rules.
