# Portable Room (Belt of Winding Paths)
## Overview
**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 7th

**Slot** —

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Appearance**

This black leather belt (hardness 8, hp 15, break DC 23) bears two lines of star-shaped studs winding down its length. If coiled and tossed into the air, it expands into a 2 1/2 ft. wide spiral ramp climbing to a grey wooden door. Behind the door is a domed observatory with two telescopes; one of pale golden birch designed for direct observation and one of dark red mahogany with a crystal ball fixed where the eyepiece would normally be.

**Description**

Looking through the birch telescope causes the viewer to see flashes of random scenes from her past or future, causing the viewer to make a Will save (DC 11) to avoid being [[Confused|confused]] for 1 round. If the viewer saves successfully, she gains a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check taken in the next 24 hours. She must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.

Looking in the crystal ball attached to the mahogany telescope gives a glimpse of a random plane, identifiable with a DC 15 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) check. A DC 25 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) check allows the viewer to tune the telescope to a plane of her choice. For each hour of studying the planes, she may add a +1 circumstance bonus to the next [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) check that she makes, to a maximum of +4 after four hours. Additional study after the four hours are up has no effect until 24 hours after the check has been made.

**History**

DC 10: According to legend it was stolen from under the noses of two rival factions (both claiming that they were the only ones with a right to it) by a lone amateur collector and secured in a private library under guard. The collector vanished into obscurity a few years later.

DC 20: Wyrist made this originally for a paranoid prince who wished to see everything that would happen to him. On testing it out, he saw a glimpse of himself, handing over the belt of winding paths and being killed by the prince so that he couldn’t recreate it for anyone else. Wyrist quietly took it with him on his travels, and left before the prince could discover what he had done or

where he had gone.

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Guidance (Spell)|guidance]], [[Scrying (Spell)|scrying]]*

**General Properties of Portable Rooms**

Unless otherwise stated in a room's description, it has the following properties:

- Activating a *portable room* is a standard action, as is deactivating one. Deactivation must take place from outside the room being deactivated. Objects and creatures inside a room at the time of deactivation are harmlessly expelled to the nearest unoccupied space (with the except of homunculi).
- Any creature that encounters an activated entrance may enter. Entrances easily accommodate creatures up to Large size. Huge creatures may enter, but are considered to be squeezing the whole time that they are within the room or entrance.
- The *portable room* blocks sight and sound from travelling between the exterior and interior. If outside a *portable room*, only the entrance is visible, and it must be entered to see any activities or occupants. If within a *portable room*, the only view through the entrance is that of a thick, silvery fog.
- If viewed or interacted with from behind, an entrance has the appearance of a sheet of slick, polished, obsidian, and acts like a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*. Spells (including divination spells), gaze attacks, and breath weapons do not pass through the entrance in either direction.
- Rooms left activated automatically deactivate after 12 hours. (*House Rule:* This means the portal to the extradimensional space closes; the room itself continues to exist.)
- If subjected to antimagic of any kind or *[[Dimensional Lock (Spell)|dimensional lock]]*, the rooms automatically deactivate (if active) and the items become non-functional for the duration of the effect.
- An item can be stored in an extradimensional space with no ill effects, but cannot be activated within one. Likewise, items (including other *portable rooms*) using extradimensional space may safely be brought into a room, but do not function there.
- If the *[[Dimensional Stability (Spell)|dimensional stability]]* spell is used in the items crafting the above property is not used.
- If an item is destroyed, the room is also destroyed, and its contents spill out into a random location in the [[Astral Plane|Astral plane]].
