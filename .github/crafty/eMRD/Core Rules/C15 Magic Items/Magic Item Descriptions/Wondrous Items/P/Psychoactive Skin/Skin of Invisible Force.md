# Skin of Invisible Force
## Overview
**Aura** Moderate; (DC 19) evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 8,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

*This transparent skin surrounds you in an invisible second skin of force.*

This skin grants you a +6 shield bonus. The skin has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6, no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. It can be activated and deactivated at will as a free action.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]*

**Cost** 4,000 gp

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

Initially this item looks quite overpowered for the price but closer examination shows it to be just slightly worse than masterwork half plate, though without its penalties and at an increased cost. Also, the bonus on the item is an shield bonus, so it can be enhanced using the normal methods for adding an enhancement bonus to an item; any other bonuses added to it must be either armor AND shield or shield only enhancements.
