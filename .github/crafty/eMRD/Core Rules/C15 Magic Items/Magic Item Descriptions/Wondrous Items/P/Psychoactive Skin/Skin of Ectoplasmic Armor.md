# Skin of Ectoplasmic Armor
## Overview
**Aura** Moderate; (DC 19) conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** —

**Price** 6,000 gp

**Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

*This silvery, translucent skin appears to surround you in a suit of crystalline plates.*

This skin grants you a +8 armor bonus. The skin has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, a –6 armor check penalty, and a 25% arcane spell failure chance. It is treated as light armor for the purpose of affecting class features and movement.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]* or *inertial armor*

**Cost** 3,000 gp

**Source:** Magic Item Compendium (WotC), pg. 170

**GM Note**

Initially this item looks quite overpowered for the price but closer examination shows it to be just slightly better than masterwork half plate. Also, the bonus on the item is an armor bonus, so it can be enhanced using the normal methods for adding an enhancement bonus to an item.
