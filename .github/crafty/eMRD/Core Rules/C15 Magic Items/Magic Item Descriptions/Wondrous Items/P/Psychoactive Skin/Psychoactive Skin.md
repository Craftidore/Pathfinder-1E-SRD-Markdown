# Psychoactive Skin
## Overview
*This fist-sized blob of murky ectoplasm shimmers faintly in the light.*

Once a psychoactive skin is donned, the ball unfolds, extends, and surrounds a Medium or smaller wearerâ€™s entire body in a variegated second skin, granting the wearer access to a particular array of abilities (see below). Donning a psychoatcive skin requires a mental command as a standard action.

A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his equipment, but allows him to see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered up.

Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the powers of the hidden skins cannot be activated or accessed). Skin layers can be changed as a standard (mental) action, which causes the desired lower-layer skin to come to the surface.
