# Pipes of the Sewers
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 2nd

**Slot** —

**Price** 1,150 gp

**Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these pipes to attract 1d3 rat swarms if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper’s telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.

If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Charm Animal (Spell)|charm animal]], [[Summon Nature's Ally I (Spell)|summon nature’s ally I]]*, wild empathy ability

**Cost** 575 gp
