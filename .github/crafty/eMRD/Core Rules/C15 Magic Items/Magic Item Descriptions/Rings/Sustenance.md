# Sustenance
## Overview
**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** ring

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Weight** â€”

**Description**

This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Forge Ring (Feat)|Forge Ring]], *[[Create Food and Water (Spell)|create food and water]]*

**Cost** 1,250 gp

**Source:** Core Rulebook, pg. 483
