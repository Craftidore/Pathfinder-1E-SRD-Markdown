# Spell-Battle (Ring)
## Overview
**Aura** strong divination; **CL** 14th

**Slot** ring

**Price** 67,600 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

This potent ring is typically made of gold and set with small spheres of silver. The wearer becomes cognizant of all spellcasting that occurs within 60 feet, and she can identify the spell being cast (even if she can’t see its casting or effect) on a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC 15 + spell level). If this identification succeeds, the wearer can choose once per day to have the ring counterspell (without readying a counterspell action or making a dispel check) or can change the target or the point of effect of the spell to any target or point within 60 feet (including herself if she chooses to redirect a potentially beneficial spell). If the wearer chooses an illegal target (an animal for a humanoid-affecting spell, for instance, or a point of effect outside the spell’s range as measured from the original caster), the spell functions normally and the redirection is wasted. If the wearer ends up in the area of a retargeted spell, she experiences the effect of the spell as normal.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Forge Ring (Feat)|Forge Ring]], *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**,* *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]**,* *[[Spell Turning|spell turning]]**,* creator must have 10 ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]

**Cost** 33,800 gp
