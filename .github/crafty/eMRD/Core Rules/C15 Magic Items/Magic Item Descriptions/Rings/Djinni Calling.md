# Djinni Calling
## Overview
**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** ring

**Price** 125,000 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is useful indeed. It serves as a special *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]* by means of which a specific djinni (see the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*) can be called from the Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Forge Ring (Feat)|Forge Ring]], *[[Gate (Spell)|gate]]*

**Cost** 62,500 gp

**Source:** Core Rulebook, pg. 479
