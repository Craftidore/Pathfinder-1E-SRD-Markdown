# Ioun Ring
## Overview
**Aura** faint illusion (glamer); **CL** 1st

**Slot** ring

**Price** 500 gp

**Weight** —

**Description**

A simple and elegant ring, with an empty mounting spot for a stone. The setting appears to be malleable enough that any small gemstone can be mounted. Placing an ioun stone of any shape into the ring’s setting, causes it to slightly alter in shape perfectly accommodating the gem as if made just for it.

Any ioun stone mounted within an ioun ring, continues to provide its benefits to the wearer as if orbiting his head, however the ring and stone register to detect spells as non-magical.

Once mounted, an Ioun stone cannot be removed without destroying the ioun stone and ring.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Forge Ring (Feat)|Forge Ring]] or Ring Apprentice, *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]*

**Cost** 250 gp
