# Cursed Items
## Overview
Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices. Cursed items are almost never made intentionally. Instead they are the result of rushed work, inexperienced crafters, or a lack of proper components. While many of these items still have functions, they either do not work as intended or come with serious drawbacks. When a magic item creation skill check fails by 5 or more, roll on Table 15–27 to determine the type of curse possessed by the item.

**Identifying Cursed Items**: Cursed items are identified like any other magic item with one exception: unless the check made to identify the item exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the curse is not detected. If the check is not made by 10 or more, but still succeeds, all that is revealed is the magic item’s original intent. If the item is known to be cursed, the nature of the curse can be determined using the standard DC to identify the item.

**Removing Cursed Items**: While some cursed items can be simply discarded, others force a compulsion upon the user to keep the item, no matter the costs. Others reappear even if discarded or are impossible to throw away. These items can only be discarded after the character or item is targeted by a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* or similar magic. The DC of the caster level check to undo the curse is equal to 10 + the item’s caster level. If the spell is successful, the item can be discarded on the following round, but the curse reasserts itself if the item is used again.

## Common Cursed Item Effects
**Common Cursed Item Effects**

The following are some of the most common cursed item

effects. GMs should feel free to invent new cursed item effects

to fit specific items.

**Table 15–27: Common Item Curses**

**d% Curse**

01–15 Delusion

16–35 Opposite effect or target

36–45 Intermittent functioning

46–60 Requirement

61–75 Drawback

76–90 Completely different effect

91–100 Substitute specific cursed item on Table 15–28

**Delusion**: The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without the casting of *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]*.

**Opposite Effect or Target**: These cursed items malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren’t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn’t necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn’t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.

**Intermittent Functioning**: The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function perfectly as intended—at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.

*Unreliable*: Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01–05 on d%) that it does not function.

*Dependent*: The item only functions in certain situations. To determine the situation, select or roll on the following table.


| **d%** | **Situation** |
|---|---|
| 01–03 | Temperature below freezing |
| 04–05 | Temperature above freezing |
| 06–10 | During the day |
| 11–15 | During the night |
| 16–20 | In direct sunlight |
| 21–25 | Out of direct sunlight |
| 26–34 | Underwater |
| 35–37 | Out of water |
| 38–45 | Underground |
| 46–55 | Aboveground |
| 56–60 | Within 10 feet of a random creature type |
| 61–64 | Within 10 feet of a random race or kind of creature |
| 65–72 | Within 10 feet of an arcane spellcaster |
| 73–80 | Within 10 feet of a divine spellcaster |
| 81–85 | In the hands of a nonspellcaster |
| 86–90 | In the hands of a spellcaster |
| 91–95 | In the hands of a creature of a particular alignment |
| 96 | In the hands of a creature of a particular gender |
| 97–99 | On holy days or during particular astrological events 100 More than 100 miles from a particular site |

*Uncontrolled*: An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. Roll d% every day. On a result of 01–05 the item activates at some random point during that day.

**Requirement**: Some items have stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.

- Character must eat twice as much as normal.
- Character must sleep twice as much as normal.
- Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and the item functions normally thereafter).
- Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp in valuables per day.
- Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.
- Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or to his entire family.
- Character must discard all other magic items.
- Character must worship a particular deity.
- Character must change her name to a specific name. The item only works for characters of that name.
- Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.
- Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.
- Character must sacrif ice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]* spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]],* or the use of a magic item.)
- Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.
- Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.
- Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.
- Item must be used at least once a day, or it won’t function again for its current possessor.
- Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can’t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it has scored a hit.
- Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as *[[Bless (Spell)|bless]], [[Atonement (Spell)|atonement]],* or *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]*).

Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An intelligent item with a requirement often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).

**Drawback**: Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.

Unless otherwise indicated, drawbacks remain in effect as long as the item is possessed. The DC to save against any of these effects is usually equal to 10 + the item’s caster level.


| **d%** | **Drawback** |
|---|---|
| 01–04 | Character’s hair grows 1 inch longer every hour. |
| 05–09 | Character either shrinks 6 inches (01–50 on d%) or grows that much taller (51–100). Only happens once. |
| 10–13 | Temperature around item is 10° F cooler than normal. |
| 14–17 | Temperature around item is 10° F warmer than normal. |
| 18–21 | Character’s hair color changes. |
| 22–25 | Character’s skin color changes. |
| 26–29 | Character now bears some identifying mark (tattoo, weird glow, or the like). |
| 30–32 | Character’s gender changes. |
| 33–34 | Character’s race or kind changes. |
| 35 | Character is afflicted with a random disease that cannot be cured. |
| 36–39 | Item continually emits a disturbing sound (moaning, weeping, screaming, cursing, insults). |
| 40 | Item looks ridiculous (garishly colored, silly shape, glows bright pink). |
| 41–45 | Character becomes selfishly possessive. |
| 46–49 | Character becomes paranoid about losing the item and afraid of damage occurring to it. |
| 50–51 | Character’s alignment changes. |
| 52–54 | Character must attack nearest creature (5% chance \[01–05 on d%] each day). |
| 55–57 | Character is [[Stunned\|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds once item function is finished (or randomly, 1/day). |
| 58–60 | Character’s vision is blurry (–2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks requiring vision). |
| 61–64 | Character gains one negative level. |
| 65 | Character gains two negative levels. |
| 66–70 | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Intelligence damage. |
| 71–75 | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Wisdom damage. |
| 76–80 | Character must make a Will save each day or take 1 point of Charisma damage. |
| 81–85 | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Constitution damage. |
| 86–90 | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Strength damage. |
| 91–95 | Character must make a Fortitude save each day or take 1 point of Dexterity damage. |
| 96 | Character is polymorphed into a specific creature (5% chance \[01–05 on d%] each day). |
| 97 | Character cannot cast arcane spells. |
| 98 | Character cannot cast divine spells. |
| 99 | Character cannot cast any spells. |
| 100 | Either pick one of the above that’s appropriate or create a drawback specifically for that item. |

## Specific Cursed Items
**SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS**

Perhaps the most dangerous and insidious of all cursed items are those whose intended functions are completely replaced by a curse. Yet even these items can have their uses, particularly as traps or weapons. The following are provided as specific examples of cursed items. Instead of prerequisites, each cursed item is associated with one or more ordinary magic items whose creation might result in the cursed item. Cursed items can be sold, if the curse is not known to the buyer, as if they were the item they appear to be.

Cursed suits of armor and weapons can come in many forms, and the examples listed here are merely the most common. For example, a *cursed –2 sword*, might appear as a *+3 shortsword* or a *+1 dagger*, with a similar negative instead of the listed –2.

**Amulet of Inescapable Location**

**Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This device appears to prevent location, scrying and detection, or influence by *[[Detect Thoughts (Spell)|detect thoughts]]* or telepathy, as per an *[[Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location|amulet of proof against detection and location]]*. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a –10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location|amulet of proof against detection and location]]*

**Armor of Arrow Attraction**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 16th

**Slot** body; **Weight** 50 lbs.

**Description**

Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of *+3 full plate.* The armor works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually attracts ranged weapons. The wearer takes a –15 penalty to AC against ranged weapons. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *+3 full plate*

**Armor of Rage**

**Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 16th

**Slot** body; **Weight** 50 lbs.

**Description**

This armor is similar in appearance to *armor of command* and functions as a suit of *+1 full plate*. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a –4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *armor of command, +1 full plate*

**Bag of Devouring**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a *bag of holding*. The sack is, however, something entirely different and more insidious. It is—in fact, one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing’’ if thrust within the bag. The *bag of devouring* is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls them inside as a free action. The bag has CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.

The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a *[[Bag of Holding Type I|bag of holding type I]]*, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim’s body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*, *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]*, or *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *bag of holding* (any type)

**Boots of Dancing**

**Aura** strong enchantment; **CL** 16th

**Slot** feet; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These boots appear and function as one of the other kinds of magic boots. When the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, *boots of dancing* impede movement, making him behave as if *[[Irresistible Dance (Spell)|irresistible dance]]* had been cast upon him. Only a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Boots of Elvenkind|boots of elvenkind]], [[Boots of Levitation|boots of levitation]], [[Boots of Speed|boots of speed]], [[Boots of Striding and Springing|boots of striding and springing]], [[Boots of Teleportation|boots of teleportation]], [[Boots of the Winterlands|boots of the winterlands]], winged boots*

**Bracers of Defenselessness**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 16th

**Slot** arms; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These bejeweled and shining bracers initially appear to be *[[Bracers of Armor +5|bracers of armor +5]]* and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers cause a –5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, *bracers of defenselessness* can be removed only by means of a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Bracers of Armor +5|bracers of armor +5]]*

**Broom of Animated Attack**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a *[[Broom of Flying|broom of flying]]* by all tests short of attempted use.

If a creature attempts to fly using the broom, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the victim’s face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end. The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, CMD 17, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Broom of Flying|broom of flying]]*

**Crystal Hypnosis Ball**

**Aura** strong divination; **CL** 17th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 7 lbs.

**Description**

This cursed scrying device is indistinguishable, at first glance, from a normal *[[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]].* However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes [[Fascinated|fascinated]] for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).

The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the *crystal hypnosis ball* gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Crystal Ball|crystal ball]]*

**Dust of Sneezing and Choking**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

This fine dust appears to be *[[Dust of Appearance|dust of appearance]].* If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20-foot spread to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save take 3d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. Those who succeed on this saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking (treat as [[Stunned|stunned]]) for 5d4 rounds.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Dust of Appearance|dust of appearance]], [[Dust of Tracelessness|dust of tracelessness]]*

**Flask of Curses**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the flask is first unstoppered, all within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be cursed, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell is cast upon them.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Decanter of Endless Water|decanter of endless water]], [[Efreeti Bottle|efreeti bottle]], [[Eversmoking Bottle|eversmoking bottle]], [[Iron Flask|iron flask]]*

**Gauntlets of Fumbling**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** hands; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

These gauntlets perform according to their appearance until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell, a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]],* or a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]].*

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Gauntlet of Rust|gauntlet of rust]], gloves of arrow snatching, [[Glove of Storing|glove of storing]], [[Gloves of Swimming and Climbing|gloves of swimming and climbing]]*

**Helm of Opposite Alignment**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** head; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

When placed upon the head, this item’s curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment—good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required.

Only a *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* or a *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* can restore a character’s former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an *[[Atonement (Spell)|atonement]]* spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a *helm of opposite alignment* has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Hat of Disguise|hat of disguise]], [[Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic|helm of comprehend languages and read magic]], [[Helm of Telepathy|helm of telepathy]]*

**Incense of Obsession**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 6th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

These blocks of incense appear to be *[[Incense of Meditation|incense of meditation]].* If meditation is conducted while *incense of obsession* is burning, the user becomes totally confident that her spell ability is superior due to the magic incense. She uses her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Incense of Meditation|incense of meditation]]*

**Mace of Blood**

**Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 8th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 8 lbs.

**Description**

This *+3 heavy mace* must be coated in blood every day, or else its bonus fades away until the mace is coated again. The character using this mace must make a DC 13 Will save every day it is within his possession or become chaotic evil.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *+3 heavy mace*

**Medallion of Thought Projection**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 7th

**Slot** neck; **Weight** —

**Description**

This device seems like a *[[Medallion of Thoughts|medallion of thoughts]]*, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort them out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What’s worse, unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Medallion of Thoughts|medallion of thoughts]]*

**Necklace of Strangulation**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 18th

**Slot** neck; **Weight** —

**Description**

A *necklace of strangulation* appears to be a wondrous piece of magical jewelry. When placed on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a *[[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]], [[Wish (Spell)|wish]],* or *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* and remains clasped around the victim’s throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Necklace of Adaptation|necklace of adaptation]], necklace of fireballs, [[Periapt of Health|periapt of health]], [[Periapt of Proof against Poison|periapt of proof against poison]], [[Periapt of Wound Closure|periapt of wound closure]]*

**Net of Snaring**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 8th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 6 lbs.

**Description**

This net provides a +3 bonus on attack rolls but can only be used underwater. Underwater, it can be commanded to shoot forth up to 30 feet to trap a creature. If thrown on land, it changes course to target the creature that threw it.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *+3 net*

**Periapt of Foul Rotting**

**Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck; **Weight** —

**Description**

This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell followed by a *cure disease* and then a *[[Heal (Skill)|heal]], [[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]], [[Limited Wish (Spell)|limited wish]]*, or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]* spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a *[[Periapt of Health|periapt of health]]* and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the *periapt of foul rotting* likewise crumbles to dust.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Periapt of Health|periapt of health]], [[Periapt of Proof against Poison|periapt of proof against poison]], [[Periapt of Wound Closure|periapt of wound closure]]*

**Poisonous Cloak**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 15th

**Slot** shoulders; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This cloak is usually made of a wool, although it can be made of leather. A *[[Detect Poison (Spell)|detect poison]]* spell can reveal the presence of poison in the cloak’s fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer takes 4d6 points of Constitution damage unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.

Once donned, a *poisonous cloak* can be removed only with a *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a *[[Neutralize Poison (Spell)|neutralize poison]]* spell is then used, it is possible to revive a dead victim with a *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* or *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]] spell*.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[[Cloak of Arachnida|cloak of arachnida]], [[Cloak of the Bat|cloak of the bat]], [[Cloak of Etherealness|cloak of etherealness]], [[Cloak of Resistance +5|cloak of resistance +5]], major cloak of displacement*

**Potion of Poison**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

This potion has lost its beneficial abilities and become a potent poison. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. A poisoned creature can make a DC 14 Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** any potion

**Robe of Powerlessness**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 13th

**Slot** body; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *robe of powerlessness* appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a –10 penalty to Strength, as well as to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character’s primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a *remove curse* spell followed by *heal*.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *robe of the archmagi, robe of blending, robe of bones, robe of eyes, robe of scintillating colors, robe of stars, robe of useful items*

**Robe of Vermin**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 13th

**Slot** body; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, and it functions normally. However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: the wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.

The wearer takes a –5 penalty on initiative checks and a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *robe of the archmagi, robe of blending, robe of bones, robe of eyes, robe of scintillating colors, robe of stars, robe of useful items*

**Ring of Clumsiness**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** ring; **Weight** —

**Description**

This ring operates exactly like a *ring of feather falling*. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity and has a 20% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure chances.)

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *ring of feather falling*

**Scarab of Death**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 19th

**Slot** neck; **Weight** —

**Description**

If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or carried in a living creature’s possessions for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetle-like creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim’s heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.

**Creation**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This is a *+2 shortspear,* but each time it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to the hurler is doubled.

**Magic Items** *+2 shortspear*, any magic weapon

**Stone of Weight (Loadstone)**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This dark, polished stone reduces the possessor’s base land speed to half of normal. Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means—if it is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere upon the possessor’s person. If a *remove curse* spell is cast upon a *loadstone,* the item may be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual.

**Magic Items** *ioun stone, stone of alarm, stone of controlling earth elementals, stone of good luck*

**Sword , –2 Cursed**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used in combat its wielder takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls. All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. The sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword’s owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon.

**Magic Items** *+2 longsword*, any magic weapon

**Sword , Berserking**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 8th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 12 lbs.

**Description**

This sword appears to be a *+2 greatsword.* However, whenever it is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian’s rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.

**Magic Items** *+2 greatsword*, any magic weapon

**Vacuous Grimoire**

**Aura** strong enchantment; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence and Charisma drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, it must be burned while *remove curse* is being cast. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *blessed book, manual of bodily health, manual of gainful exercise, manual of quickness of action, tome of clear thoughts, tome of leadership and influence, tome of understanding*
