# The Special Project
## Overview
The Special Project rule is intended to allow builders, crafters and other sorts of player character entrepeneurs to earn the immense wealth that is possible while not breaking the GM's game. Simply stated, whenever a PC generates income in excess of twice or more (GMs decision) his character wealth per level, he must decide on a special project such as a secret headquarters, a unique magical construction, etc . and then spend at least 90% of that income each month towards the completion of that project. Note that is income and not plunder and loot from adventuring.

This project should be discussed with the GM and the details worked out between GM and player.
