# Daring Bravo Package
## Overview
The daring bravo is equally adept in social situations and combat, with the right equipment to move fluidly from one to the other. Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo’s equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch. 

**Armor:** Masterwork [[Chain Shirt|chain shirt]]. 

**Weapons:** Light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork rapier, sap, alchemical silver dagger. 

**Combat Gear:** Acid (2), alchemist’s kindness, potions of *[[Cure Light Wounds (Spell)|cure light wounds]]* (2), sunrods (3). 

**Other Gear:** Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, bottle of fine wine, chalk (5 pieces), courtier’s outfit with 50 gp in jewelry, flask, flint and steel, grooming kit, masterwork musical instrument, mess kit, mirror, perfume or cologne, sack, signet ring, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, whetstone, 5 gp. 

**Total Weight:** 76-1/2 lbs. (40-1/2 lbs. for a Small character).
