# Adventuring Kits
## Overview
This section includes several kits of preselected gear for each character class or for specific adventuring purposes (dungeoneering, spelunking, and so on). GMs can use these kits to quickly round out an NPC’s gear. Players can use them to equip new PCs in a hurry or as a shorthand for providing gear for cohorts, followers, minions, and hirelings. The listed price for the kit includes a small discount for purchasing these items as a group. Items in a kit that are used up, destroyed, or lost cost the full price to replace.
