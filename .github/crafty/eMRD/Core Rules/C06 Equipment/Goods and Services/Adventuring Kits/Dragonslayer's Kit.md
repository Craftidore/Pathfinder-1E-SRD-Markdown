# Dragonslayer's Kit
## Overview
Aimed more at hired blades than seasoned adventurers, this kit provides supplemental equipment for outfitting hirelings to hunt dragons. It includes a *potion of [[Cure Moderate Wounds (Spell)|cure moderate wounds]]*, *oil of [[Bless Weapon (Spell)|bless weapon]]* (1 application), a longspear, a backpack, three large sacks, a sunrod, a tower shield, and 5 vials of alchemist’s fire. For hunting dragons that are immune to fire, the alchemist’s fire can be replaced with acid at the time of purchase, for a savings of 50 gp.

**Price** 485 gp; **Weight** 64 lbs.
