# Campsite Kit
## Overview
This kit is actually four bundles of gear, designed so four individuals can share the load. It consists of four bedrolls, four blankets, a dayâ€™s worth of firewood, a flint and steel, a tindertwig, four mess kits, a cooking kit, and 8 days of trail rations (with the expectation that adventurers will supplement the rations with a little hunting as they travel). Adventurers expecting inclement weather should also purchase one or more tents.

**Price** 12 gp; **Weight** 80 lbs.
