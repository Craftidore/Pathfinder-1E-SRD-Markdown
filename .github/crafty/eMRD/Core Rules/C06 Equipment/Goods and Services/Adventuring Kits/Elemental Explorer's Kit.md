# Elemental Explorer's Kit
## Overview
This waterproof and flame-resistant case contains items useful to a spellcaster traveling the Elemental Planes, either intentionally or due to some mishap. The kit includes durable guides to each of the four Elemental Planes, describing a few common creatures and hazards found on each plane and pointing out major landmarks. Each guide grants a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) checks and [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks for its plane. This kit also contains 3 *scrolls of [[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]]*, 2 s*crolls of planar adaptation*, and a *scroll of [[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]* attuned to the Material Plane so the kitâ€™s owner can return home. The price reflects a kit with divine scrolls; a kit containing arcane scrolls instead costs an additional 2,000 gp

**Price** 2,700 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.
