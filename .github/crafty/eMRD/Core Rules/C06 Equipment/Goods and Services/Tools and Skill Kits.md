**Alchemist’s Lab**: This lab is used for making alchemical items, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.

**Artisan’s Tools**: These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (–2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.

**Artisan’s Tools, Masterwork**: These tools serve the same purpose as artisan’s tools, but masterwork artisan’s tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made with them.

**Climber’s Kit**: These crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools give you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.

**Disguise Kit**: The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after 10 uses.

**Healer’s Kit**: This collection of bandages and herbs provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. A healer’s kit is exhausted after 10 uses.

**Holly and Mistletoe**: Druids commonly use these plants as divine focuses when casting spells.

**Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden**: A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. 

*Unholy Symbols*: An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or channel negative energy).

**Magnifying Glass**: This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for f lint an dsteel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action.

A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.

**Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork**: A masterwork instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks involving its use.

**Scale, Merchant’s**: A merchant’s scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.

**Spell Component Pouch**: A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn’t fit in a pouch.

**Spellbook, Wizard’s**: A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).

**Thieves’ Tools**: This kit contains lockpicks and other tools you need to use the Disable Device skill. Without these tools, you must use improvised tools, and you take a –2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device checks.

**Thieves’ Tools, Masterwork**: This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device checks.

**Tool, Masterwork**: This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items do not stack.
