# Scroll Organizer
## Overview
This long strip of leather has an overlapping series of fifteen pockets sewn along one side, each large enough to hold a scroll of a single spell. When slipped into a pocket, only the top of a scroll shows, allowing you to scan all the titles. The outside is fitted with a clip and a sewn-in pouch so that the organizer can be rolled up into a cylinder, slipped in its own pouch, and sealed against the elements.

**Cost:** 5 gp, **Weight**: 1/2 lbs 

**Source:** Tome and Blood (WotC), pg. 71

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Normally drawing a scroll from a backpack is a move action; drawing a scroll from the scroll organizer makes it a free action.
