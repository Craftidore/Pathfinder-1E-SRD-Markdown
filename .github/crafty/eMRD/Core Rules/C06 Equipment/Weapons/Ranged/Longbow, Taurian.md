# Longbow, Taurian
## Overview
**Longbow, Taurian:** These 7- or 8-foot long, recurved bows are meant for use by centaurs; no one else can make them, and finding one anywhere but in centaur hands is cause for a fight. They are made of layered woods, sinew, and horn and have a draw of at least 200 pounds. For this reason, their 4 foot-long arrows have exceptional range and penetrating power, able to punch through even the thickest armor. You must be over 6 ft. tall and at Strength 16 or higher to wield a taurian longbow.

**Taurian Strength Bows**

These masterwork compound recurved longbows are between five and a half and six and a half feet tall when strung. They are the specialty weapon of centaur and minotaur archers, made with a combination of bone, yew, horn and sinew. The arrows themselves can be over three feet long and weigh a pound each. One must be at least six feet tall and have a Strength 12 or higher to wield these exotic weapons. These heirloom weapons are handed down from one generation of warriors to the next, and the most famous have name names, histories and magical powers acquired over many years.

**Benefit:** Each bow has a minimum Strength rating (12, 14, 16, 18 and so forth), or “pull,” and adds the damage modifier associated with its Strength rating to all damage rolls, unlike normal bows. For example, a Rothenian centaur archer with a Strength score of 21 using an 18 Pull longbow would do +4 damage. If the bow had a 20 Pull rating, he would do +5 damage. If the archer only had a 16 Strength he could not use the bow at all. Nonweapon proficiency penalties with this exotic weapon apply normally.

**Special:** Unlike normal masterwork enhancement bonuses, these damage modifiers can stack with magical bonuses and be multiplied by critical or feat effects.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Longbow, Taurian | 250 gp | 1d10 | 2d6 | ×3 | 130 ft. | 6 lbs. | P |
