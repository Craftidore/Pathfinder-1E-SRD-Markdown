# Footbow
## Overview
This exotic weapon resembles a composite long bow but is designed to be used in flight, with the archer holding the bow in her feet and drawing it with one or both hands. Like a composite longbow, all footbows are made with a particular strength rating. If a character’s Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the footbow, she can’t effectively use it, so she takes a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default footbow requires a Strength bonus of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A footbow can be made with a high strength rating just as a composite longbow can; each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

The wielder of a footbow can choose to use both hands to draw it back; in this case she may add 1-1/2 her Strength bonus to damage (up to a maximum of 1-1/2 the strength rating of the bow), as long as she is strong enough to use it without penalty.

A footbow can be used on the ground, but the archer must be prone to do so and takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll.

For raptorans and [[Strix|strix]], the footbow is a martial weapon rather than an exotic weapon.
