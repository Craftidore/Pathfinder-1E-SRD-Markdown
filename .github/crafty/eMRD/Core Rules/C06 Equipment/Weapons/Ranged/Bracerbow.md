# Bracerbow
## Overview
This masterwork hand crossbow is built within a metal (usually steel) bracer, which is treated as a buckler. Due to the gearing and the hand crossbow being built within, it only provides a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. An intricate clockwork mechanism and springs are used to power the modified hand crossbow. 

Five bolts (magical or mundane) are contained in a magazine. To load the bracerbow a simple cover is opened and the magazine is inserted. Once loaded, the user then presses a small detent and a small wheel pops up; turning this wheel charges the clockwork mechanism. It takes a full minute to load and charge it.

As a move action the user can fire one bolt by flexing his fist and the muscles of his forearm.

The masterwork nature of the bracerbow provides a +1 enhancement to hit.

A bracerbow has the following stats:
