# Greataxe, Nordmansch
## Overview
The Nordmansch greataxe likely originated with the foresters and lumberjacks of the Ordenn forest, who found a secret way of making axe heads they continue to keep secret. The Nordmansch make more axes than their woodsmen actually need.

The Nordmansch greataxe is a two-handed weapon built to sunder other weapons. Its edge is hardened especially for this purpose, and its haft is likewise set with trapping prongs to catch and hold a foe’s weapon.

If you have the Improved Sunder feat, the Nordmansch greataxe provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all sunder attempts, in addition to the usual +4 for using a two-handed slashing weapon in a sunder attempt.
