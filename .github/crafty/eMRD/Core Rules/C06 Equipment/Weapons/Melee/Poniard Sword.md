# Poniard Sword
## Overview
This standard looking longsword or rapier has a spring-loaded poniard concealed in the hilt, which quickly extends out when the hilt is gripped in a particular way. When the poniard is revealed in a combat round, it can be used for a rogue’s sneak attack in that same round. The sword can be used as a one-handed double weapon once extended, with all the usual restrictions and penalties. The poniard can be used against a grappling opponent. Kariv of a crueler bent have been known to poison the secondary blade.
