# Scorpion Chain, Drow
## Overview
A drow scorpion chain resembles a regular [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] in many respects, but is both slightly longer than a normal [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] and features a dagger-like blade at each end. The drow of Xen’drik have perfected the use of this weapon to harass larger enemies such as giants, or as a poison-delivery system against less hearty foes. The weapon takes its name from the technique of holding a length of chain behind the back and then flipping it over the head to strike a foe; drow warriors often open combat with this maneuver.

A drow scorpion chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.

Because the chain can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.

When using a drow scorpion chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can use the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a drow scorpion chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon.

Most drow who wield the drow scorpion chain will take the Drow Skirmisher feat (*Races of Eberron* 109), but other characters who take [[Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Feat)|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], or [[Weapon Specialization (Feat)|Weapon Specialization]] for either the [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]] or drow scorpion chain may apply the effects of those feats to attacks with either weapon.
