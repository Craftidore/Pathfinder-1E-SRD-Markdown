# Light spear, elven (MeleeWpn)
## Overview
Essentially a [[Shortspear|shortspear]] with a longer, thinner blade, the elven light spear is quick and deadly in the hands of a skilled wielder, but those not trained in its use find the weapon unbalanced and encumbering. Although most elven spearfighters prefer the standard [[Longspear|longspear]] or the bladespear, a few speardancers favor this weapon because they can use all of their expertise with a spear and still carry a shield in their off hands.

You can use the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an elven light spear sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.
