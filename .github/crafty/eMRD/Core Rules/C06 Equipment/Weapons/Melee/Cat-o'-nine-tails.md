# Cat-o'-nine-tails
## Overview
A cat-o’-nine-tails, also known as the “captain’s daughter,” is a short whip made of nine knotted thongs about 3 feet in length, designed to lacerate and inflict great pain without doing serious permanent damage.

A cat-o’-nine-tails deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher.
