# Chain, Spiked
## Overview
A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length, covered in wicked barbs. You can use the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon.
