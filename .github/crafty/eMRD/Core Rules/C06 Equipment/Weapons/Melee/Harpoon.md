# Harpoon
## Overview
A harpoon is a barbed spear with an attached rope 50 feet or less in length. If you are proficient in the harpoon, it is a grappling weapon. On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. You can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered [[Grappled|grappled]], though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon’s reach, the grapple ends.

The harpoon appears in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat as a Bronze Age weapon; it uses the same stats here, but is made out of steel. A harpoon’s weight includes the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope—it can be lightened by using shorter or lighter rope.
