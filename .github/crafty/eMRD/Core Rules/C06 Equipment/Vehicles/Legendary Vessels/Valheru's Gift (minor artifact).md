(draft 5 ft.); Complement 15; Watch 1; Cargo 30 tons (Speed wind (per 10 mph) × 20 ft. if 15 tons or more); Cost 4,500,000 gp. 

## **Description**
The Gift is constructed from a strange, dark blue (almost black) material that resembles some form of baked ceramic more than it does metal or wood. The hull, mast and decks are a single piece, almost as if the ship were cast (or perhaps grown). While the decks have the roughness of rough sandstone, providing unparalleled footing, the exterior of the hull is as smooth as a piece of glass (+25 to the DC of any [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks made to scale them). So smooth is this material that no form of algae or barnacle is able to gain purchase upon it or grow there. It increases the Gift's speed in the water (or under it) by 15 ft (from 30 ft. to 45 ft). 

The ship's wheel is located on the sterncastle and controls not only the ship's rudder, but also its wings. Additionally whoever is grasping the ship's wheel can use it to activate or deactivate its many magical abilities. Doing so requires a Concentration check (DC 25) and then a full round action to do so. Each ability may only be used if the ship's arcane furnace is fueled or if the person using the wheel is prepared to pay a cost in either spellcasting power, psionic power or their very life force. 

The ship's forecastle rises only 5' feet higher than the main deck while the stern castle rises a full 10 feet above the main deck. 

Two retractable 50' ft wings (one on each side) adjoin the hull below the waterline of the hull. These wings always retract when the keel of the Gift touchs the surface of a body of water be it river, lake, or ocean. When the Gift takes to the sky, they extend to their full 50 ft. span and enable the ship to move (90 ft./round) even if there is no wind whatsoever. The wings are made of the same material as the rest of the ship save that the material between the spars of the wings is translucent and seems almost leathery to the touch. The wings' orientation is controlled by tilting the wheel mast. If the Gift needs to land on something other than the water, the wings can be fully extended downward, acting as stabilizers for the keel. 

The Gift's twin masts rise to a height of 55 ft. (stern) and 35 ft (fore) respectively and like the deck surfaces, the material of the masts is roughened to facilitate climbing (+10 to [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] checks). 

### **Arcane Furnace**
The Valheru's Gift is powered by a minor artifact known as an arcane furnace. This device appears to be a small  (3 ft tall x 4 ft wide by 5 ft long) crystalline locker inlaid with arcane runes made of precious metals. The top of the furnace opens, allowing magical objects to be placed inside. Once the lid is closed, the inlays begin to glow and the furnace utterly destroys whatever magical item was placed inside. For every 50,000 gp worth of magical items placed within, enough energy is generated to power the *Valheru's Gift* for one month. 

With the arcane furnace fueled, the following powers may be activated by grasping two handles of the Gift's wheel: 

The *Cloak Ship*, *Detect Ship*, and *Disguise Ship* abilities may be used 3 times daily without cost (using power generated by the Arcane Furnace). The *Power Craft, Adaptation,* and *Submerge Ship* abilities can be used 2 times daily. 

#### **CLOAK SHIP**
Illusion (glamer); Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with); Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 2nd-level power or spell or 20 hp 

You make the area around your ship invisible (cf *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]* spell). Creatures more than 30 feet from your ship cannot sense any activity going on inside the area—they cannot smell cooking food, they cannot hear conversation, loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of wind coming from the area. Those onboard your ship can see out normally. Once a creature comes within 30 feet of your ship, it can sense everything in and around the ship normally. Unlike *[[Invisibility (Spell)|invisibility]]*, a *cloaked* ship is not given away by the appearance of apparently displaced water since the power makes the area occupied by the ship appear as its surroundings. The Cloak Ship power does not prevent detection by magical means such as *[[Arcane Sight (Spell)|arcane sight]]*, *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]*, or *[[True Seeing (Spell)|true seeing]]*. 

#### **DETECT SHIP**
Divination; Duration: 1 day (D);  Saving Throw: None; Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 3rd-level power or spell or 30 hp 

You gain the ability to discern the presence of ships around you while grasping the Gift's wheel. You perceive ships located within a distance of 20 miles, regardless of current visibility (or even whether or not they are beyond the horizon). You need not be seeking them to become aware that they are there. Exactly what can be ascertained depends on whether the ships in question are within sight or not yet visible. 

*Not Visible:* You sense only the presence of ships other than your own in the area. A DC 15 [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check allows you to determine the number, direction, and range to each new ship you sense. If you sense a ship’s direction and range, you continue to be aware of this information until the other ship is no longer in range of the effect. 

*Within Sight:* If a ship is actually within sight, you can gain additional information by studying the vessel for 1 round. You need not be able to see the vessel clearly—a spot on the horizon is sufficient. A [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) check gives you information about the ship or ships: 


| **Check Result** | **Information** |
|---|---|
| 10 | Type of ship |
| 12 | Course, speed, and time to intercept (if possible) |
| 15 | What kind of weaponry the ship is carrying |
| 18 | Ship’s name |
| 20 | Any signs of allegiance (pirate flags, symbols of nation of origin, etc.) |
| 25 | Port of call of the sighted ship |

This power cannot penetrate illusions. 

#### **DISGUISE SHIP**
Illusion (Glamer); Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with); Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 4th-level power or spell or 40 hp 

You cloak the ship in illusion, making it appear as a ship of another type of your choice. You can choose what it appears as down to small details such as what weaponry it bears and what flags it is flying. You can make the ship to be any other water-going vessel, though it cannot seem to be more than 50% smaller or larger. Creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance, nor are their possessions. 

#### **POWER CRAFT**
Transmutation; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None; Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 5th-level power or spell or 50 hp 

You provide a source of locomotion for your ship. The ship can move at any speed up to its normal maximum speed as if it had a natural source of locomotion. Thus, your ship moves as if powered by a favorable wind. Prevailing conditions—wind, currents, and so on—affect movement normally. Thus, this power cannot move your ship against a gale-force wind. 

#### **ADAPTATION**
Transmutation; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None; Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 6th-level power or spell or 60 hp 

Upon activating this power you must select a plane. The ship now grants immunity to the selected plane's negative or harmful environmental effects, including such things as toxic air, temperature extremes, lack of air, or any other planar trait otherwise harmful to anyone in contact with the ship. This ability has no effect when used on the native Plane of the person activating it. 

#### **SUBMERGE SHIP**
Evocation \[Water]; Duration: 1 day (D); Saving Throw: None; Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 7th-level power or spell or 70 hp 

Grasping the Gift's wheel, you invoke this power and immediately you feel connected to it, knowing the intricate details of its construction. You sense an invisible aura surrounding the ship and permeating its every space. Although it seems to be riding lower in the water than its weight would suggest, you instinctively know that you can control its every movement. You grant the ship touched a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to move beneath the surface of the water. You can control the ship’s speed and direction as a free action. All interior spaces of the ship remain dry even if a doorway or porthole is open while the ship is underwater. Any creature aboard the ship when the spell is cast can move about the ship with ease (including climbing and jumping) as if it were afloat on a calm sea. Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement. 

You can transfer control of the ship to another individual by having that individual take over the ship's wheel. Someone must have control of the ship's wheel at all times or the magic ends. 

Once the magic ends (either because the duration expired, the wheel becomes unattended, or the magic was successfully dispelled), the magic lingers for 10 rounds. During this time, the ship ascends toward the water’s surface at a rate of 60 feet per round. If the ship is still underwater when this additional time runs out, it immediately sinks, and its passengers risk drowning. 

#### **PLANAR NAVIGATION**
Conjuration (Teleportation); Duration: Instantaneous; Saving Throw: Will negates; Cost when the arcane furnace is not fueled: One 9th-level power or spell or 90 hp
Spell Resistance: Yes 

You move yourself and the contents of your entire ship to another plane of existence. When you begin using this ability, a fog descends about the vessel, and clears within a minute. The ship always appears on a body of water large enough for the ship to sit in safely, unless the destination plane has no body of water large enough to hold the ship, in which case the ship simply materializes right side up, lying on the ground unless it has some other method of stabilizing itself, such as flight or the spell *[[Mageship (Spell)|mageship]]*. If the destination plane is one that possesses an ocean, the ship automatically appears there. 

Note that this ability does not grant the ship or its inhabitants any ability to survive on the destination plane—the ship simply appears in the plane upon a body of water (or, in the case of planes that are made up of nothing but water, in the water). 

Any characters or creatures aboard unwilling to move to the new plane are entitled to a Will saving throw to resist the effect, but might find themselves floating in the water when the ship vanishes from around them.

### Valheru's Gift

[[Valheru's_Gift.jpg|open outside]]

## **History**
Created in CY 615 (of the common Greyhawk calendar) by the Dreadlord Ahzul fan Cerul for the [[Goliath|goliath]] adventurer G'Terran Steelgrip in payment for freeing him; Valheru's Gift is a marvelous magical ship constructed after the pattern used by the Suel Empire at the height of its power. It was captured shortly after its construction by [[11 - Cloud Giants|cloud giants]] and not recovered by G'Terran Steelgrip until several months later. While traveling back from the Hellfurnaces mountain range where he had recovered it, G'Terran and his cohort Lhor were attacked by a group of adventurers belonging to the [[Seekers of the Arcane]]. 

G'Terran was able to slay one of the band but Lhor (his cohort) was killed also. Valuing the life of his friend over his ship, he fled with Lhor's body back to Greyhawk City where he had previously arranged with members of the Church of [[Pelor]] there to provide resurrection services should they be required. Gathering his retainers and sundry magical potions, scrolls and items, G'Terran paid for a *[[Teleport Transfer (Spell)|teleport transfer]]* spell (to be used later aboard the Gift) as well as a *[[Teleport, Greater (Spell)|greater teleport]]* spell at the [Wayfarer's Union](http://localhost/wiki/index.php?title=Organization:_Wayfarer%27s_Union&action=edit&redlink=1) hall in [Greyhawk City](http://localhost/wiki/index.php/Location:_Greyhawk,_Free_City_of).

Returning within 3 hours of the initial attack, G'Terran and his followers were able to slay all but one of the attackers who fled with much of the gear of his companions and two of their bodies. Interrogatoring the remaining three bodies through the use of *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* spells, G'Terran realized that the Seekers would be returning in force very shortly. G'Terran consulted with a wise former companion and decided to set an ambush for the Seekers.

G'Terran decided to take the Gift and submerge it in the depths of the Solonor Sea where the Seekers would be at a severe disadvantage.
