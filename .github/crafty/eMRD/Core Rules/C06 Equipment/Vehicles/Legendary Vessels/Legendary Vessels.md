# Legendary Vessels
## Overview
There are ships which have become famous in their own right--legends of the sea. Blackbeard始s *Queen Anne始s Revenge*. *The Adventure Galley* of Captain Kidd. The ghostly *Flying Dutchman*. All of these vessels have taken on a life of their own. 

In **Corsair**, these vessels have become NPCs, and gain levels and feats as they advance in legendary power.

To become a legendary vessel, a ship must meet the following critieria:

1) Have a crew with a quality of Average or better.

2) Have a Captain with a Cha bonus of at least +3 or fame/repute/infamy +3.

3) Have all players aboard agree to donate 10% of their future experience awards directly to the ship.

4) Fly a flag of unique design, which clearly identifies the vessel.

Once these criteria are met, the ship becomes a 1st level Legendary Vessel (**Lgv**), and from that point onward, draws 10% of its PC crew始s experience as its own. As the ship gains levels, it gains bonuses to Armor Class, Base Attack Bonus and Structure Points (note that these bonuses are not cumulative).At 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, a Ship Feat may be chosen. A list of Ship Feats (and full details on the feats) can be found starting on the next page.

A legendary vessel that comes under the control of a new captain and crew will retain the benefits of the NPC class, as long as the new owners maintain the tithe of 10% of their experience awards, and the ship keeps its name and unique flag. Changing the name of a sailing vessel is generally considered to be unlucky...and in this case, that始s true--the benefits of Legendary Ship status would be lost.
