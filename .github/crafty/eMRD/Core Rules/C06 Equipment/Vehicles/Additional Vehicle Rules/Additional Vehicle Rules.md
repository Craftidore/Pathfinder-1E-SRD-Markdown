# Additional Vehicle Rules
## Overview
**Ship for Hire**

If the party just needs a ride somewhere the ship’s already going, typically they can buy passage for 1 sp per person per mile, or 2 sp for horses and other larger creatures.

Chartering a ship for a route it would not normally take is much more expensive. Merchant ships need to sell goods to pay for crew and maintenance. The prices here can vary wildly, but the minimum price is typically 1/100 the cost of the ship (*Admiral o' the High Seas 62*) for each day of the journey. Price is usually negotiated up front, and the captain will usually give a high estimate of the time it will take..

This presumes the ship’s captain doesn’t view the party as a particular annoyance, in which case the captain might charge 10 times as much, or simply refuse. Likewise, if the journey itself would be hazardous, or lead to a dangerous location, the captain will try to gauge how much trouble he’s getting into, and price accordingly.

## Hazard Pay
**Hazard Pay**

The table below has prices listed by “level,” meaning what level encounter is likely to befall the ship during the trip. This represents an abstraction of the captain’s best guess of the dangers entailed. While character levels and Challenge Ratings aren’t real, a captain would know to charge more for sailing past the lair of the Dread Serpent Vindicus than for simply going past waters controlled by hostile natives in canoes.

This price can vary wildly by circumstance, such as if the party is trusted by the captain, if he endorses their mission, if the party looks desperate, and so on. For instance, if the captain has an inaccurate sense of the danger (such as if the party has misled him), he might work for a much lower price.

Add the price below to the cost for chartering the ship, using the perceived threat level. In some cases, it might be cheaper to buy their own boat than to try to drag another crew into danger.

**Hazard Pay Rates**


| **Level** | **Cost** |  | **Level** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 360 gp |  | 11 | 9,000 gp |
| 2 | 520 gp |  | 12 | 13,000 gp |
| 3 | 680 gp |  | 13 | 17,000 gp |
| 4 | 840 gp |  | 14 | 21,000 gp |
| 5 | 1,000 gp |  | 15 | 25,000 gp |
| 6 | 1,800 gp |  | 16 | 45,000 gp |
| 7 | 2,600 gp |  | 17 | 65,000 gp |
| 8 | 3,400 gp |  | 18 | 85,000 gp |
| 9 | 4,200 gp |  | 19 | 105,000 gp |
| 10 | 5,000 gp |  | 20 | 125,000 gp |

## Owning a Ship
**Owning a Ship**

Ships have prices based on their hull, maneuverability and speed, their armaments, and any special traits they have (as detailed in Chapter Three: Port Register *Admiral o' the High Seas 28*). Most merchant ships are paid for by groups of investors who share the profits, but it’s possible wealthy adventurers could afford a ship of their own.

From a metagame standpoint, if the DM wants to run a game with ships as a focus, it might be easiest to simply supply the party with a vessel and let them trade up occasionally, so that they aren’t behind the rules’ expected “character wealth” for personal gear. In a more sandbox style game, it can be a choice for the PCs whether to invest in a ship. If they’re poor but ambitious, they might decide to try to capture one instead.
