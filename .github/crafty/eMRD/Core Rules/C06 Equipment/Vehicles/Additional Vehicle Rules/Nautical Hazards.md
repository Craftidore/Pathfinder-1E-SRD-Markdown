# Nautical Hazards
## Overview
Often encountering a hazard will be accompanied by some additional threat, like monsters or pirate ships. More detailed rules are presented in Chapter Two for the use of hazards in naval combat, but sometimes a ship simply steers into bad weather or dangerous terrain.

If a hazard is fairly small, just make the ship roll once to avoid it. If a large swath of the trip is hazardous, like if the ship is trying to navigate a frozen sea in winter, the ship has to make a check for every day it spends in the hazardous area.

## Catch Hazard
**Catch Hazard**

Ice, sandbars, kelp, water bubbling with gaseous upwelling, and swarms of animals can catch a ship and stop it from moving. Make a Command check and add the ship’s maneuverability rating. Sparse hazards might be DC 15 and dense hazards DC 20; if there are only a handful of safe paths, the DC might rise as high as 25.

If the hazard is something that can be pushed aside (like an ice floe), add +2 to the roll for each size category the ship is above Tiny, to a maximum of +10 for a Gargantuan ship. If the hazard would be worse for larger ships (like sandbars, since bigger ships tend to have deeper drafts), instead apply this as a penalty.

Success means the ship avoids being trapped. Failure means the ship is briefly snagged, and a few hours must be added to the journey as the crew frees the ship from the hazard. Fail by 5 or more, and the ship is trapped sufficiently well that freeing it requires a day of work.

## Chop
**Chop**

Choppy seas, whirlpools, or turbulence for airships can slow vessels, knock crew overboard, or even capsize a boat. Make a Command check with a +2 bonus for each size category the ship is larger than Tiny, to a maximum of +10 for a Gargantuan ship. The DC for light chop is 15, for heavy chop is 20, and for severe chop is 25.

Success means the ship escapes any dangers from the chop. Failure means a wave crashes across the maindeck, and each crewman there must make a Dexterity check (DC 8) to avoid being washed overboard.

Failure by 5 or more is as above, plus the ship lists (*Admiral o' the High Seas 21*) from an impact. Make an additional Command check to see if the crew keeps the situation from getting worse (taking into account that many might be overboard, leading to Minimum or Skeleton Crew). If this second check fails by 5 or more, the ship capsizes.

## Crash Hazard
**Crash Hazard**

Small rocky islets, wrecked ships, partially-submerged towers, or even the legs of a titanic beast are a steering danger. These hazards seldom are a threat outside of combat, because they can be spoteed from afar. But if the ship intentionally takes a dangerous route as a shortcut, or if visibility is impeded by darkness or storms, the ship might crash.

Make a Command check and add the ship’s maneuverability rating, but take a –2 penalty for each size category the ship is above Tiny. A few scattered obstacles might be DC 15, copious obstacles DC 20, and narrow straits or a fleet of ships DC 25.

Success means the ship avoids crashing. Failure means the ship takes 1 point of Hull Integrity damage.

Fail by 5 or more, and the ship collides hard. It takes 2 points of Hull Integrity damage, and is briefly snagged, requiring minutes or hours to get the ship to a spot where it can sail again.

## Strike HazardUnnamed
**Strike Hazard**

Some terrain can damage anywhere on the ship, such as sails or decks full of crew, not just the hull. Make a Command check and add the ship’s maneuverability rating. A single hazard like a blasting geyser might be DC 15, cloudy banks of searing embers might be DC 20, and an active sea battle with huge crossfires DC 25.

Success means the ship avoids damage. On a failure, roll a random location for a strike, just as if another ship’s attack had hit. Fail by 5 or more, and roll for two strikes instead. Based on the damage type, the component struck might be burning instead of taking immediate damage.

## Visibility
**Visibility**

Be it by fog, darkness, intense rain, or swarms of locusts, limited visibility impairs the ability to maneuver relative to your opponent, often forcing you to guess. If there is limited visibility, whenever you would roll a Command check, instead roll two and take the worse result.

Ships whose crew can ignore the poor visibility, like a crew of drow on a sunless sea, don’t suffer this penalty. A ship’s look-out can make a [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to let the ship ignore the penalty. Thin fog might be DC 15, thick fog or starlight DC 20, and complete black-out DC 30, though factors like ambient noise and reference points could adjust the DC.

## Line of Sight
**Line of Sight**

The distance at which an object disappears below the horizon is approximated by the formula D = 1.22 × *√* H, where D is the distance to the horizon in miles, and *√* H is the square root of the viewer’s elevation in feet.

To determine whether an object is in line of sight over the horizon, use the formula for that object, and add the distance to the horizon for both the viewer and the object. So a 6 ft. tall person can see the horizon from 2.98 miles away, and has line of sight to another 6 ft. tall person from 5.96 miles away. Two look-outs who are 150 ft. up in the crow’s nests of ships have line of sight to each other at about 30 miles away.

Of course, atmospheric conditions can alter this greatly. Generally, if a ship gets more than 30 miles away, you won’t be catching up anyway.
