# Extended Keel
## Overview
**Extended Keel**

The ship’s keel is longer than usual for a vessel of its type.

**Benefit:** The ship’s measurements from bow to stern are 10% longer than normal, though cargo capacity is not appreciably affected. The ship is more stable, granting the pilot a +1 bonus on all sailing checks. This improvement must be installed at the time of the ship’s construction and cannot be added later.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 19; Cost: 10% of base ship cost
