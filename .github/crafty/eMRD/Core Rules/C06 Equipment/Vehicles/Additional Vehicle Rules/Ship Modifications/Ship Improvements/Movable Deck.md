# Movable Deck
## Overview
**Movable Deck**

The features of the ship’s decks are designed to be moved in order to disguise the ship as an altogether different vessel.

**Benefit:** After pulling up dozens of kingpins, the crew can slide the sterncastle forward on hidden rails, rearrange the position of the masts, extend the gunwales, lower the poop deck, transfer the ship’s wheel, and make other cosmetic changes such as a new figurehead and different-colored sails. The secret pins, levers, and tracks can only be found with a DC 20 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check during a close examination of the ship.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 28; Cost: 40% of base ship cost
