# Concealed Weapon Port
## Overview
**Concealed Weapon Port**

The ship can disguise its cruel intentions with hidden armaments.

**Benefit:** The ship’s belowdecks area undergoes major reconstruction in order to house Large direct-fire siege engines, such as light ballistae or cannons, if they are in use in the campaign. A concealed weapon port can only be recognized on a successful DC 15 [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check. Each concealed port reduces a ship’s cargo capacity by 5 tons, in addition to the space required by the weapon itself.

**Requirements:** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (ships) DC 16; Cost: 100 gp per port (in addition to the cost of the weapons)
