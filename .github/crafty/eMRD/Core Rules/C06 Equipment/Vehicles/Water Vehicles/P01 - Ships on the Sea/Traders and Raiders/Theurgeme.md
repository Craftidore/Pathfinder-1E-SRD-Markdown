# Theurgeme
## Overview
The theurgeme is a vessel powered by magic. Without sails or rowers it moves swiftly and tirelessly across the water. Theurgemes can be powered in a variety of ways, but the most common design is a simple paddlewheel or set of mechanical oars turned or driven by a magical construct, mindless undead, or even a bound elemental. Many theurgemes are luxuriously appointed with comfortable cabins and exotic décor, as befits the wealthy wizards who most likely own such vessels.
