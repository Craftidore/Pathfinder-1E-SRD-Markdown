## Background and History
*“Ah, you have a fine eye for gems! That is no ordinary jade you look at. They say that when the dragons of Tian Xia first saw Goka, the City of Wonders, they wept at its beauty, and their tears became this very jade. It is the purest, most powerful jade you will ever find.“No? Perhaps some fine Lingshenese porcelain, then. You see the detail, the beautiful blue color of the enamel? You will not find work such as that anywhere here in Avistan! Do you want to know the secret? In Lingshen, they put the souls of their soldiers into terra-cotta warriors, but where do you think they put the souls of the poets, the singers? The rough souls become simple clay, but the beautiful, pure souls become fine white porcelain, and their spirits protect your house and family.“No? Then let me show you these spices from Sarusan…”*

*—Zheng, merchant sailor aboard the Hu-Hazhong*

Ever since the Resplendent Phoenix first arrived in Absalom some 3,000 years ago, the people of the Inner Sea have been fascinated with the strange and wondrous goods produced in the far-off Dragon Empires of Tian Xia. The first glimpse of a Tian junk in the distance thrills merchants, their wealthy clients, and pirates alike, for all know that when those distinctive sails appear on the horizon, fine silks, exotic spices, and untold treasures are sure to follow. The Hu-Hazhong may deliver all these things and more, provided it can survive its arduous journey.

**Background**

Long before they became business partners on the Hu-Hazhong, a kitsune alchemist named Sironu and a samsaran druid named Narava served together in the court of Lord Yaobai, a powerful Lingshenese noble. Sironu was the court alchemist, while Narava’s wind magic ensured safe passage through her lord’s ports. Although they were competent in their fields, their non-human status relegated them to the lowest ranks of the court. Both were deeply dissatisfied with their stations, and though the reserved and aloof samsaran was nothing at all like the hot-headed and bombastic kitsune, the two found that their contrasting personalities complemented each other, and they soon became fast friends. They passed evenings with one another, speaking of their hopes and dreams. For Sironu, this involved amassing wealth and power enough to live in comfort for the rest of his days. Narava sought instead to follow in the footsteps of her past lives and explore the world, particularly the strange lands on the other side.

The opportunity for both to fulfill their dreams came when Lord Yaobai commissioned a set of seven trading vessels as gifts for his seven children. Sironu knew that Hu, the lord’s youngest son, had no taste for sea travel, instead preferring to spend his days rolling dice, drinking, and carousing with courtesans. Sironu also knew that Hu had accrued some gambling debts, and that he might be willing to part with his fine new ship at a deep discount. Sironu and Narava pooled their savings and made Hu an offer he eagerly accepted. At last, the two had the means to pursue their goals: the Hu-Hazhong. Since they had invested equal shares into purchasing the ship, they tossed a coin to decide who would become captain. Sironu won, and appointed Narava as his first mate and sailing master.

The new business partners had precious little money to invest in skilled sailors after purchasing the vessel, so Narava rounded out the crew with people other captains in the area were likely to overlook, hoping that gratitude would make them quick learners.

The Hu-Hazhong spent a year trading goods around the Lake of Eels, breaking in its inexperienced crew and collecting trade goods for its ultimate journey. Narava had, in a past life as the explorer Sayala, charted a course from Tian Xia to the distant continents of Avistan and Garund. This course would take the ship through dangerous waters, but delivering the treasures of Tian Xia to the Inner Sea and vice versa would surely reap a tremendous bounty for the merchant vessel.

The journey was more difficult than either could have imagined, yet Narava’s guidance from her past lives has carried them through. Though the ship has suffered casualties—eight crew members in all—it has successfully navigated its way to the Inner Sea and is now poised to make landfall within a day.

## Ship Description
### Hu-Hazhong
![[Hu-Hazhong.jpg|Hu-Hazhong|300]]
[[Hu-Hazhong.jpg|open outside]]

**Ship Description**

The Hu-Hazhong is a three-masted junk in the Tian style. It measures 75 feet from bow to stern and 25 feet abeam, and is constructed of the finest of Tian teak.

### 1. Poop Deck
**1. Poop Deck** 

A rocket springal is mounted behind the rudder, which sits in the middle of this raised deck. During the day, Narava and Kurobu are stationed here, and they alternate shifts steering the ship and supervising the crew. At night, a single Tian merchant sailor armed with a crossbow patrols this deck and serves as the lookout. In combat, Balao and three assistant gunners operate the rocket springal from this deck.

### 2. Main Deck
**2. Main Deck**

A single firedrake carved to resemble a stylized lion is mounted on the fore end of this deck.

During the day, this deck is crewed by 14 Tian merchant sailors and the boatswain, Balao. At night, three Tian merchant sailors armed with crossbows patrol this deck. Lanterns hanging from both the mainmast and the foremast provide normal light on the deck, while four lanterns hanging from the gunwales provide normal light out to a distance of 60 feet over the water to the port and starboard.

### 3. Captain's Cabin
**3. Captain’s Cabin** 

The captain’s cabin is sumptuously decorated with fine silks and darkwood furniture, including a full bed in the aft corner of the room. Sironu can be found here in the evening. The cabinets in this room contain logbooks written in Senzar detailing the contents of the ship’s hold, along with records of all transactions made over the past year. A chest at the foot of the bed contains four potions of cure light wounds, two courtier’s outfits, a lacquered fan depicting a seascape and decorated with lapis lazuli stones worth 75 gp, and a formula alembic (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 299).

### 3. Sailing Master's Cabin
4** Sailing Master’s Cabin**

This moderately sized cabin is sparsely appointed, with much of its contents stored in tightly shut cabinets secured to the hull. A large table attached to the deck occupies the center of the room, and a sleeping pad lies rolled up against a wall. Narava can be found in this cabin sleeping or studying her charts when not actively piloting the ship. PCs searching this room find an astrolabe, a compass, a spyglass, numerous mundane star and sea charts, and Sayala’s samsaran prayer charts. These special charts are decorated with samsaran names and prayers, and function as a samsaran life wheel (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 199), except they grant a bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks to follow routes taken by a samsaran in her past life.

### 5. Alchemical Lab
**5. Alchemical Lab**

This cluttered chamber holds all of Sironu’s alchemical equipment, which functions as an alchemy lab, granting a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. If combat takes place in this room, there is a cumulative 5% chance each round that Sironu’s sensitive experiments are agitated to the point of reaction, filling the room with foul smelling smoke (as stinking cloud, DC 15) for 1 minute. Sironu can be found here during the day, crafting fireworks to sell upon arriving in Avistan. In the evening, the doors to this room are locked with good locks (Disable Device DC 30), to which only the captain holds the key.

### 6. Galley
**6. Galley**

This compartment features a large iron stove connected to a chimney leading to the starboard exterior of the ship. Cabinets filled with cooking utensils line the exterior wall of the compartment, while the aft half of this room holds the ship’s supplies of food and water. Rongfeng, the ship’s surgeon and cook, works here during the day, often assisted by his sister Junfeng.

### 7. Crew Bunks
**7. Crew Bunks**

The majority of the Hu-Hazhong’s crew bunks in this cabin, which is crowded with hammocks and small wooden footlockers.

### 8. Aft Cargo Hold
**8. Aft Cargo Hold**

This large cargo hold stores the majority of the ship’s mundane sailing supplies, including rope, spare sails and timber, and various pieces of rigging equipment.

### 8a. Aft Cargo Compartments
**8a. Aft Cargo Compartments**

These compartments contain six crated jade statues of famous heroes from Quain, a dozen casks of fine wine from Tianjing, and a chest of colorful silken garments in the style currently fashionable in Hwanggot. Together, these are worth 1 point of plunder.

### 8b. Flooded Cargo Compartment
**8b. Flooded Cargo Compartment**

This cargo chamber flooded when the ship was blown into a reef during a storm along the southern coast of Casmaron. The damage to the hull was minor, and the flooding was confined to this bulkhead. The hull has since been patched and the water pumped out, but the exotic spices stored here have been ruined by seawater. The PCs can, however, recover a crate of ceremonial Minkai weaponry worth 1 point of plunder.

### 8c. Smuggler's Compartments
**8c. Smuggler’s Compartments**

These cargo compartments seem full of nothing but mundane sailing supplies. A successful DC 25 Perception check allows a PC to detect a hidden trap door in the raised keel floor of each compartment, which collectively contain jade jewelry, porcelain wares, gold and silver cutlery, fine silk and gold embroidery thread, coffee from Nagajor, Minkai tea, and masterwork armor and weapons from across the Dragon Empires. These goods are worth 3 points of plunder.

### 9. Armory
**9. Armory**

This cabin provides access to the main deck (area 2) via a steep set of stairs. Lockers here hold the ship’s complement of personal weapons, including 15 light crossbows, 20 short spears, 200 bolts, and 24 sets of lamellar leather armor. The armory lockers are secured with average locks (Disable Device DC 25), which can be opened by keys held by all of the ship’s officers.

### 9a. Forward Cargo Compartments
**9a. Forward Cargo Compartments**

These holds collectively carry 14 crates of expertly crafted Lingshenese ceramics and a dozen bolts of fine silk worth a total 900 gp.

### 10. Magazine
**10. Magazine**

This starboard cargo compartment stores the ammunition for the ship’s two siege weapons, and its interior is sealed with a thick layer of wax that prevents water from leaking in and spoiling the ammunition. The magazine currently holds 10 uses of ammunition for the firedrake and 5 uses of ammunition for the rocket springal. In addition, Captain Sironu stores any fireworks that he has completed and that are ready for use here. If the PCs make a brief search of the magazine, they find 30 paper candles (Ultimate Equipment 108), eight star candles (Ultimate Equipment 109), four coughing dragons (see page 29), two skyrockets (Ultimate Equipment 109), and two flashing fiends.

### 11. Officers' Cabin
**11. Officers’ Cabin**

The ship’s officers bunk in the four hammocks strung across this cabin. When not actively running the ship, Kurobu, Balao, Junfeng, and Rongfeng can all be found here. The door to this room is locked at night with an average lock (Disable Device DC 25), with keys held by each of the officers, the captain, and the first mate.

### 11a. Officer's Storage
**11a. Officer’s Storage**

This room contains stout wooden lockers that hold the personal effects of the ship’s officers. The lockers are secured with average locks (Disable Device DC 25), and they contain three sets of courtier’s clothes, a silver-and-pearl holy symbol of Qi Zhong worth 50 gp, and a tengu drinking jug (Advanced Race Guide 167), among other mundane personal effects.

## Ship's Crew
**Ship’s Crew** 

The Hu-Hazhong originally set out with a crew of 30, though casualties sustained in the journey from Tian Xia to Avistan have reduced its complement to a mere 22. The 16 regular crew members (see page 30) are merchant sailors recruited for their skill at trade as much as their sailing experience. The rigors of their journey have toughened them considerably, however. The ship’s officers are as follows.

**Boatswain and Master Gunner Balao:** Balao, who presents a stark contrast to the stoic Hatoshi Kurobu, secreted a tengu drinking jug aboard ship, and spends most nights slovenly drunk, proclaiming the virtues of his “bird god.” Though the other officers resent his shameful behavior, Balao proved himself a capable gunner numerous times on the journey, and his jug helps keep the ship provisioned with fresh water when no natural sources can be found. 

**Captain Sironu:** Captain in title only, the kitsune Sironu shares most command decisions with his first mate. Sironu often masquerades as a Minkai man in port to avoid humans’ prejudice.

**First Mate and Sailing Master Narava:** Longtime companion of Captain Sironu, Narava serves as both first mate and sailing master. She offers her counsel on seafaring based on experience from her past lives whenever she is called upon to do so.

**Junfeng and Rongfeng:** These jovial twins serve as the Hu-Hazhong’s carpenter and its cook and surgeon, respectively. The two were trained as assassins in service to Lingshen, but could not stomach the acts of violence and cruelty their masters demanded of them. Though the twins now refuse to deal lethal damage to any humanoid in combat, their ability to strike as a team makes them dangerous opponents.

**Master-at-Arms Hatoshi Kurobu:** Kurobu, a disgraced ronin from Shokuro, maintains discipline aboard the Hu-Hazhong. Though stern and unforgiving, he drills the crew in fighting shape, and many credit the ship’s survival to his guidance.

### Key NPCs

The following NPCs are among the many that can be found aboard the *Hu-Hazhong*.

**SQ** alchemy (alchemy crafting +8, identify potions), change shape (Medium humanoid; *alter self*), discoveries (concussive bomb \[4d4+2 sonic plus deafness], fast bombs, infusion, precise bombs \[2 squares]), fast shifter, mutagen (+4/–2, +2 natural, 80 minutes), poison use, swift alchemy, swift poisoning

Where his samsaran friend seeks adventure, Sironu seeks profit. The kitsune was born the son of a poor merchant, and spent most of his youth hawking cheap wares on the street. Eventually he scraped together enough money to buy his first formula book, and taught himself alchemy in order to market elixirs of youth and love potions to the nobility. His skill at making fireworks drew the attention of Lord Yaobai, earning him a place in the nobleman’s court. Sironu got a taste of the sweet life in Yaobai’s court, and swore from that day on he’d never be poor again. 

Sironu’s latest venture looks to be his most profitable, but the cost may be too great for the kitsune. Though he has no qualms with risking his own life, Sironu has never before felt so acutely responsible for the lives of others, and is wracked by guilt over the death of the eight crew members during the ship’s passage to the Inner Sea. He increasingly turns to his work in the ship’s alchemy lab to distract him from his worries. 

When he’s ashore marketing the ship’s goods, Sironu often takes the form of his human persona—a Minkai man with bushy gray eyebrows and a balding pate— since he has little trust that strangers will treat him with respect. He may also take on this guise when negotiating at sea if enemies haven’t yet seen his kitsune form.

## Ship's Tactics
**Ship’s Tactics**

Though armed with an array of alchemical weaponry, the Hu-Hazhong is first and foremost a trading vessel, and so does its best to avoid any threats it faces on the high seas. Narava uses a combination of full ahead and make way maneuvers, relying on her lifetimes of sailing experience to outrun and outmaneuver enemy vessels. So long as they are not engaged in combat, Sironu and Kurobu both spend their turns aiding the sailing master’s piloting checks.

Though the captain can craft additional ammunition for the ship’s siege engines if supplied with the right materials, such resources are hard to come by on the open seas. For this reason, the Hu-Hazhong’s gunners avoid firing on enemy vessels unless they are fired upon first. Led by Balao, the gunners preferentially target a ship’s sails and control device, hoping to set the enemy vessel on fire. The gunners cease firing once the enemy ship has caught aflame, attempting to use the distraction of the fire to escape rather than seeking to destroy the enemy ship.

The crew of the Hu-Hazhong shows less compassion when faced with sea monsters and other such inhuman threats, as most of the ship’s casualties have come at the hands of such creatures. The gunners attack with full force, and do not cease firing until the attacking creature is dead or the ship’s magazines have run dry. The ship does not pursue sea creatures, however, as its fire-based weaponry is less effective at combating aquatic enemies.

## Adventure Hooks
**Adventure Hooks** 

The Hu-Hazhong is about to make landfall in Avistan, and has not yet had the chance to empty its hold of exotic treasures. This makes the vessel a tempting target for pirate PCs. If the party isn’t interested in piracy, the following hooks provide GMs a way to introduce the Hu-Hazhong into their campaigns.

**Fox’s Bounty:** Lord Yaobai is enraged upon discovering that his son, Hu, sold the Hu-Hazhong, and doubly enraged that he accepted such a pittance for the fine vessel. He swears to recover the ship and seize its cargo as payment for the effrontery of his two former vassals. To this end, one of his agents in the Inner Sea region hires the PCs to capture the ship and return it with Sironu and Narava alive so they might face justice.

**Stowaway:** After selling its bounty in Avistan and taking on new cargo, the Hu-Hazhong departs on the dangerous return journey to Tian Xia. However, a child from an Avistani noble family stowed away on the ship shortly before it departed, and is now hiding in one of the ship’s smuggling compartments. Convinced the foreigners kidnapped their child, her parents hire the PCs to pursue the Hu-Hazhong and rescue their scion.

**Uneasy Allies:** The PCs discover a clue that might lead them to a powerful artifact of the ancient Azlanti empire, but the only person ever known to have navigated the treacherous waters of the shattered continent where the artifact resides is the long-dead samsaran explorer, Sayala.

The PCs learn that Narava is a reincarnation of Sayala and retains some knowledge of this route. Thus, they must convince her to help them find the artifact. If successful, they must also be on their guard lest Sironu should decide he wants to keep the treasure for himself.
