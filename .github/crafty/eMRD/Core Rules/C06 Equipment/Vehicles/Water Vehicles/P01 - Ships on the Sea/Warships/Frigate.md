# Frigate
## Overview
**Frigate:** Three-masted and square-rigged, frigates are the smallest of the “rated” ships—those commanded by an officer of captain rank. They’re fast and heavily armed, with one or two decks of ballistae and a bow-mounted catapult. Frigates can hoist a huge number of sails, require large crews, and are often manned with specially trained fighting marines for boarding actions.
