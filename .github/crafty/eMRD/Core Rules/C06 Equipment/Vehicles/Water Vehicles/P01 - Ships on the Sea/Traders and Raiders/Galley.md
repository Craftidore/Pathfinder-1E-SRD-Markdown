# Galley
## Overview
**Galley:** A galley is propelled mainly by one to three tiers of oars, but also sports lateen sails. Galleys are often used by slavers, though theyâ€™re occasionally employed as short-range warships. They are heavily armed with ballistae, catapults, and even bow rams. With a shallow draft, galleys are especially useful in shoal waters and rivers, and can move quickly using their powerful banks of oars. Galleys do not handle high seas well due to their low profile, and can founder in rough conditions.
