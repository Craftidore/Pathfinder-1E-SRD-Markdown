## Background and History
*“I heard the muffled voice of a lookout saying a ship had suddenly sailed out of a fog. It was upon us in moments, faster than anyone thought possible. Above, we could hear weapons firing, the sounds of battle, the screams of the dying. The noises all died with them. We huddled silently in the darkness, not knowing what would become of us. Perhaps our captors had repelled the invaders. Perhaps both crews had been slain, leaving the ship to drift on the waves with us chained below. Then she opened the door to the hold and found us. She broke my chains, pulled me up into the light, and handed me a sword, still wet with slavers’ blood. Her crew taught us to sail the ship that was once our prison, and offered to escort us back home. We said to them, ‘Now we are free. Now we will take our ship and sail with you into battle against those who would take our freedom. And together we will prevail.’”*

*—Otenfi Etzene, Battle of Ijo, 4713 ar*

Named after the merfolk-like agathions, the *Cetaceal* serves as a symbol of the Andoren tenet of freedom and defends that principle aggressively at sea. The Gray Corsairs who crew the *Cetaceal* are more than a match for all but the most powerful pirates and slavers. 

**Background** 

While sea stories claim the *Cetaceal* was crafted by the hands of celestials on a river in the Great Beyond, the truth is that its keel was laid in 4699 ar in the Outcast Fishery in Magnimar. Through a series of strange events, both fortunate and foul, the vessel—originally known as the *Bountiful Harvest*—passed from captain to captain until it finally came into the possession of an overconfident pirate who made the mistake of attacking the Gray Corsair ship *Lavieton* off the coast of Cape Erebus. The pirate lost the ship and his life in a matter of moments. 

The Corsairs commandeered the vessel and offered its command to Mindirra Ethraikien, a promising young paladin, who renamed it after the celestial beings who serve her patron, the empyreal lord Ylimancha. The Steel Falcons then ordered Captain Ethraikien to take her ship south to Yanimere Island, where a small fleet secretly gathered to disrupt the flow of slaves moving north from Okeno. 

Despite many successful raids on slave ships along the Scorpion Coast, Ethraikien felt that her patron was calling her west. In 4711, after sending multiple requests to her superiors, she received permission to take the *Cetaceal* through the Arch of Aroden and attack pirates and slavers in the Arcadian Ocean. 

Captain Ethraikien and her crew spent 2 years in the western waters, attacking dozens of ships and freeing hundreds of slaves. The *Cetaceal* became a thorn in the side of the Shackles pirates and Ombo slavers, and earned the respect of the city council of the abolitionist Mwangi city of Senghor. While this respect has not created an official alliance with Andoran, the friendly relations make Senghor a safe port for the *Cetaceal* and any crew of whom Ethraikien speaks well. 

In Rova 4713, after a 4-month campaign resulting in the formation of a small fleet of ships crewed by freed slaves, the *Cetaceal* led that fleet in a sea battle between liberated slaves and their Ombo persecutors in the waters near the fishing village of Ijo. Though little more than a skirmish, the event became known to Senghori historians as the Battle of Ijo. 

Shortly after the battle, Ethraikien and her crew sailed back to Augustana to take some crew members home, report on their exploits to the admiralty and the People’s Council, and deliver various Mwangi artifacts to Jalus Ebincott at the University of Almas. 

Captain Ethraikien is anxious to return to Senghor, however. She believes that the key to Andoran’s rise to dominance in the Inner Sea lies in developing stronger ties with the settlements of the Mwangi Expanse, seeing such arrangements as ways to influence the local governments to give up slavery in favor of other forms of trade. A stronger Andoren presence and rising anti-slavery sentiment would also weaken Chelish power in the region. 

The *Cetaceal* has not yet faced a Chelish ship, but some among the crew are eager to take aim at such a powerful target. If this small faction of the crew is able to persuade Captain Ethraikien to embrace this plan, the results could be explosive.

## Ship Description
### Cetaceal
![[Cetaceal.jpg|Cetaceal|300]]
[[Cetaceal.jpg|open outside]]

**Ship Description**

The *Cetaceal* is a two-masted brigantine that measures 85 feet from bow to stern with a beam of 20 feet. Originally crafted as a swift smuggling or merchant’s vessel, it has been retrofitted by Andoran’s Eagle Knights as a covert vessel of war and espionage. The preexisting smugglers’ compartments aid the ship’s crew in disguising the *Cetaceal* as a non-military vessel on short notice should they encounter a Chelish patrol, an Okeno harbormaster, or another suspicious party.

### 1. Poop Deck
**1. Poop Deck** 

The poop deck occupies about one third of the *Cetaceal*’s overall length. When the ship is underway, two sailors—a helmsman and an aft lookout—stand on duty at all times. Captain Ethraikien can often be found here as well, especially when directing the ship’s maneuvers during combat or when pursuing a slave ship.

### 2. Waist Deck
**2. Waist Deck** 

This sizable weather deck is crowded and bustling. The ship’s boatswain drives his sailors to constantly improve their skills. During daylight hours, there are usually 15 sailors topside, tending the sails, making rope, or performing any of the myriad tasks required to maintain a ship at sea. At night, one sailor stands watch, roving fore and aft and maintaining communication with the aft lookout on the poop deck and the forward lookout on the forecastle deck, and five or six members of the ship’s crew sleep on the deck, except in inclement weather. 

Forward of the foremast, the whole deck is occupied by a springal that launches a shower of arrows over the decks of enemy ships. A box is fastened to the deck on the starboard side of the mast and holds 4 packs of springal ammunition. The crew can cover the weapon with a special canvas that makes the contraption appear to be nothing more than boxes or other cargo stored topside (Perception DC 30 to discern its true nature by sight). In combat, the springal is crewed by three sailors, while two others make trips down to the hold and back to maintain the supply of ammunition.

### 3. Wardroom/Officers' Quarters
**3. Wardroom/Officers’ Quarters** 

This large cabin within the sterncastle serves both as the dining and meeting area for the *Cetaceal*’s four officers: Captain Ethraikien, Commander Oldarin, Balion Ghor, and Valentio Crelton. On each side of the room, two racks fold down into beds. A table and four chairs stand in the middle of the room, and a cabinet beside the door on the aft bulkhead holds plates, cups, and utensils for meals (slightly finer than those used by the rest of the crew). On the other side of the door is a bookshelf, which holds the ship’s logs, navigational charts, and other nautical paraphernalia. 

Anyone studying the collection of charts who succeeds on a DC 20 Perception check notes that one of them is drawn on a strange, light green hide or parchment material. A successful DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check reveals that the chart describes a location on the coast of the Sodden Lands, between the Frogmarch and Crab Rivers. The labels on the chart are written in a cypher incorporating characters from Aklo, which can be deciphered with a successful DC 30 Linguistics check to reveal that the chart points to a place called the “House of Hungry Winds.” 

Captain Ethraikien believes this location to be the base of operations for a slaving ring acting as intermediaries between the pirates of the Shackles, Bekyar slavers from the Mwangi Expanse, and Cheliax’s slave markets in the port of Corentyn. 

The spaces beneath the ladders leading up to the forecastle deck (area **5**) hold well-concealed smuggling compartments, accessible from area **3**, which the Gray Corsairs use to hide important materials or people if the *Cetaceal* is ever boarded and searched (Perception DC 20).

### 4. Captain's Stateroom
**4. Captain’s Stateroom** 

This narrow cabin holds a hammock, a water basin, and a small foldaway writing desk with a stool. Here, Captain Ethraikien takes her rest and updates the ship’s log. She also uses this private space to carry out her daily prayers to her patron. While cramped and lacking any decorative flair, the room provides a sanctuary for the paladin that most ships would not afford her. 

She keeps the current volume of the log, as well as any sensitive pages of previous logs, stored in an ironbound chest below her hammock. The chest also contains an ivory statue of a bird-headed woman and a fine robe crafted of feathers from a variety of sea birds. This is the robe in which Ethraikien carries out her obedience to Ylimancha, so it has a thin rime of salt from being repeatedly soaked in seawater and dried. 

The chest has a superior lock (Disable Device DC 40) and was trapped by a high-ranking priest of Ylimancha to ensure its contents would never fall into the wrong hands. Any creature attempting to open the box without Ethraikien’s unique key triggers the trap’s effect. 

**THIEF’S GUILT TRAP CR 9** 

**Type** magic; **Perception** DC 33; **Disable Device** DC 33 

**EFFECTS** 

**Trigger** touch; **Reset** none; **Bypass** key 

**Effect** spell effect (heightened *geas/quest* \[CL 15th]; target is commanded to leave all contents of the chest untouched and to turn himself over to the captain for disciplinary action for accessing her personal effects)

### 5. Forecastle Deck
**5. Forecastle Deck** 

The forecastle deck is always crewed by at least one lookout. This is also where Balion Ghor likes to sleep, unless the seas are so rough that he risks being thrown over the side in doing so. At such times, he lashes himself to the mizzenmast and enjoys the weather. This somewhat eccentric behavior inspires many among the crew to avoid the forecastle deck when the druid is present, but never to the extent that they fail to carry out their shipboard duties.

### 6. Firing Deck
**6. Firing Deck** 

A ladder down from the waist deck (area **2**) leads to this cramped compartment filled with four large ballistae. Racks on either side of the ship hold 16 bolts each, allowing the eight ballista crew members to fire up to eight shots from either side before having to reload from the bilge (area **9**), which is reached through a door in the deck. Master-at-Arms Tolevar directs the maintenance and firing of these weapons, and two additional sailors are responsible for assisting the siege weapon crews and retrieving more bolts from the bilge in times of conflict. 

When the crew is attempting to pass as a non-military vessel to assuage enemy suspicion or infiltrate a noted slaver port, these ballistae can be disassembled and disguised under a series of tarps designed to make them appear to be simple stacks of lumber. Characters searching the hold must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check to see through the ruse, though the disguise holds up only against visual inspection.

### 7. Aft Crew Quarters and Galley
**7. Aft Crew Quarters and Galley** 

This compartment serves as sleeping quarters for several crew members, but is primarily used as the space where the cook prepares and serves meals and where crew members gather to socialize when not working or on watch. At least four sailors can be found here at all times, except in cases of emergency.

### 8. Forward Crew Quarters and Stowage
**8. Forward Crew Quarters and Stowage** 

The majority of the crew sleeps and stores their belongings in this space, which is hung with several hammocks and folding racks. Racks along the bulkhead also hold the crew’s weapons until combat is imminent. 

Eagle Knight crew members (who constitute most of the crew) store their distinctive uniforms in secret compartments within their footlockers (Perception DC 20) so their allegiance to Andoran can be hidden from harbor officials in cases of a thorough ship search.

### 9. Bilge
**9. Bilge** 

The lowest level of the ship, the bilge is the area below the firing deck, and is tightly packed and very dark. Somehow, the crew manage to cram all of their vital supplies into this space and locate what they need when the time comes to retrieve it. Most of the bilge’s contents are mundane and are intended to keep the ship afloat and its crew healthy. Sail cloth, wood, glue, nails, tools, cleaning supplies, and similar materials are kept in the forward part of the ship, while food, water, wine, ale, and a few cases of spirits are stored aft along with an impressive array of healing herbs and other ingredients, some of which are quite rare. Valentio uses these to care for the crew both before and after battles. 

The middle of the bilge, closest to its access stairs, contains racks of spare weapons, 68 extra ballista bolts, and crates containing 16 packs of ammunition for the arrow springal (area **2**). The total value of the mundane cargo here is equivalent to 4 points of plunder. 

The *Cetaceal*’s lower smuggler’s compartment (see area **3**) is also accessible from this portion of the ship. The narrow compartment runs beneath the deck along the keel, disguised as part of the ship’s hull. Here the crew keep any military equipment they fear will reveal them as Eagle Knights if the ship is searched. A successful DC 20 Perception check reveals this compartment (a successful DC 20 Craft \[ships] check grants a +4 bonus on this Perception check).

## Ship's Crew
**Ship’s Crew** 

The *Cetaceal*’s crew consists of 60 men and women, most of whom are Gray Corsair sailors (see page 22). Some of the more prominent members of the crew are described below. 

**Balion Ghor**: Born to Qadiran parents in Augustana, Balion grew to love both the sea and his adopted homeland. He eventually joined the Gray Corsairs to protect the ideals of the new home. 

**Boatswain Rais Fennin**: Rais was raised by pirates of the Shackles, becoming a talented sailor and teacher. Many ship captains sought him out until he defied the orders of the wrong one. Forced to flee the ship and the Shackles, he traveled to Andoran and joined the Gray Corsairs. He hopes to overcome his past and eventually enlist in the Golden Legion.

**Captain Mindirra Ethraikien**: Ethraikien’s exquisite appearance often makes her seem more like a child of Ylimancha than just a follower. She is serious and focused, but cares almost too deeply for her shipmates, a fact that could be used against her if it became known to Andoran’s enemies. For more information, see page 23. 

**Commander Jedra Oldarin**: The *Cetaceal*’s second-in-command is a powerful woman whose admiration for her captain is second only to her dedication to Andoran. 

**Master-at-Arms “Three-Knots” Tolevar**: The Gray Corsairs recruited “Three-Knots” Tolevar because of his carpentry skills and his raw talent with siege weapons. While his seamanship is not equal to that of the best of his shipmates, his training as a Gray Corsair puts him far above an average sailor. 

**Valentio Crelton**: Valentio serves ably as the ship’s surgeon; his talents exceed those of a simple sawbones.

The Eagle Knights are a staunchly good organization tasked with abolishing slavery and spreading freedom and democracy throughout the Inner Sea. It is this dedication to improving the world and protecting the weak that attracted Mindirra Ethraikien to the organization. 

Raised in the Andoren fishing village of Tasaroa on the shores of the Inner Sea, Mindirra had always venerated the empyreal lord Ylimancha, who watches over coastlines and fisherfolk, yet she never felt the call to actively serve the Harborwing until one fateful day in her sixteenth year. A brazen slave ship from Okeno raided the defenseless village, and the desperate cleric in the Ylimanchan temple sent a plea for help with a seagull to any ship in the vicinity. 

Just as Mindirra and her family were being placed in manacles by their would-be captors, a Gray Corsair ship arrived, and a squadron of well-trained Steel Falcons quickly dispatched the slavers, sparing the villagers from a terrible fate. Ylimancha had answered her people’s call, and Mindirra decided then that she would return the blessing. 

Now in her fifth year as captain of the *Cetaceal*, Mindirra sometimes finds the subterfuge required of her crew at odds with her lawful nature, but she understands that such actions are necessary to do the greater good, ensuring no vulnerable village like Tasaroa ever faces the same fate. Captain Ethraikien believes that all creatures deserve freedom and is committed to using every resource at her disposal to ensure that comes to pass.

## Ship's Tactics
**Ship’s Tactics** 

Fast and light, the *Cetaceal* is neither built nor armed for direct assaults on larger ships. The vessel’s strengths lie in its maneuverability and in the talents of its crew. Captain Ethraikien’s sailing skills and Boatswain Fennin’s tutelage of the crew make this vessel an effective hit-and-run fighter. 

Offensively, the *Cetaceal* first relies on subterfuge, hiding its identity and using natural or magical fog to get close without being seen. Balion Ghor employs his magic to control the winds, gaining the advantage and propelling the ship toward its target. The deck crew leads with volleys from the arrow springal, softening up enemy crew members topside before the Gray Corsairs grapple their foe and climb aboard. 

If attacked, the *Cetaceal* first runs away, using speed and druidic magic to gain distance and time. If she cannot escape, Captain Ethraikien turns to set up for a counterattack. Failing that, the crew members take to their battle stations and prepare to repel boarders. 

On the first round, boarders face up to 10 Gray Corsair sailors on the waist deck, supported by ranged attacks from above by Captain Ethraikien, Boatswain Fennin, and Balion Ghor. One sailor lifts the cover from the ladder to the main deck. Sailors below fire ballistae into the attacking vessel, hoping to destroy weapons and reduce the enemy crew’s numbers. 

The following round, with the ladder uncovered, Valentio throws bombs at anyone standing near the opening on the deck above, making room for more sailors to climb up safely. If his fellow Corsairs are nearby, he throws healing bombs instead. 

If the *Cetaceal* is currently sheltering any freed slaves, the crew do everything in their power to keep boarders away from areas **3** and **6**, where the escapees are hidden, and fight to the death.

## Adventure Hooks
**Adventure Hooks** 

As a part of Andoran’s navy, the *Cetaceal*’s primary mission is to defend and spread the principles of freedom and liberty. Given that noble cause and the fact that the ship is commanded by a paladin, it is more likely that PCs will be working with the *Cetaceal* than against it. However, there may be good reasons that even heroes would clash with this famous vessel. 

**Averting Disaster**: Andoren Navy officials have received a message from the *Cetaceal* informing them that the vessel is en route to intercept and attack a Chelish warship. Cheliax would likely respond to an unprovoked assault with overwhelming, devastating force. The PCs are the only ones close enough—and powerful enough—to reach the *Cetaceal* and stop the captain from carrying out her ill-conceived plan before it’s too late. 

**Hidden Cargo**: The *Cetaceal*’s boatswain, Rais Fennin, departed his last ship on less than favorable terms. Although he has turned away from the life of a pirate, he brought a piece of that old life with him. He had thought to sell the strange golden statue he “acquired,” but has found no buyers yet. Fennin’s former captain learned that the freebooter has been trying to sell the statue and wants the PCs to get onboard to recover her property, preferably without directly implicating the pirate captain in the process. 

**Mistaken Identity**: The PCs are attacked in the night by a fast, deadly ship that flies no flag. In the darkness, the *Cetaceal*’s crew has mistaken the PCs’ ship for a slaver or infamous pirate vessel. The *Cetaceal* won’t identify itself, so the PCs must survive long enough to establish their own identities if they hope
