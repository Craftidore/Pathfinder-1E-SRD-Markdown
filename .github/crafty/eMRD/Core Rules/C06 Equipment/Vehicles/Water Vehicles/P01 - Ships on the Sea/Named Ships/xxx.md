## Background and History
*“I heard the muffled voice of a lookout saying a ship had suddenly sailed out of a fog. It was upon us in moments, faster than anyone thought possible. Above, we could hear weapons firing, the sounds of battle, the screams of the dying. The noises all died with them. We huddled silently in the darkness, not knowing what would become of us. Perhaps our captors had repelled the invaders. Perhaps both crews had been slain, leaving the ship to drift on the waves with us chained below. Then she opened the door to the hold and found us. She broke my chains, pulled me up into the light, and handed me a sword, still wet with slavers’ blood. Her crew taught us to sail the ship that was once our prison, and offered to escort us back home. We said to them, ‘Now we are free. Now we will take our ship and sail with you into battle against those who would take our freedom. And together we will prevail.’”*

*—Otenfi Etzene, Battle of Ijo, 4713 ar*

Named after the merfolk-like agathions, the *Cetaceal* serves as a symbol of the Andoren tenet of freedom and defends that principle aggressively at sea. The Gray Corsairs who crew the *Cetaceal* are more than a match for all but the most powerful pirates and slavers.

### 1. Poop Deck
**1. Poop Deck** 

The poop deck occupies about one third of the *Cetaceal*’s overall length. When the ship is underway, two sailors—a helmsman and an aft lookout—stand on duty at all times. Captain Ethraikien can often be found here as well, especially when directing the ship’s maneuvers during combat or when pursuing a slave ship.
