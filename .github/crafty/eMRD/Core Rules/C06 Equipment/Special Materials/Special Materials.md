# Special Materials
## Overview
Weapons and armor can be crafted using materials that possess innate special properties. If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.

Each of the special materials has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction making them resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the types of creatures they most commonly encounter.

Angelskin

HP/inch 5; Hardness 5; Cost see table

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Light armor	+1,000 gp

Medium armor	+2,000 gp

The preserved skin of an angel retains a portion of celestial grace and can be crafted into leather, hide, or studded leather armor. Angelskin radiates a moderate good aura that masks malign auras. Any evil aura radiated by the wearer is reduced in strength by 10 Hit Dice. Auras reduced below 1 Hit Die can’t be detected by means such as detect evil; the creature doesn’t detect as evil, though this has no effect on other aspects of the creature’s alignment. For example, a weak chaotic creature wearing angelskin armor detects as chaotic, but not evil.

Spells and supernatural abilities that have special effects when cast on or used against creatures with evil alignments (even beneficial effects) have a 20% chance of treating an evil wearer as neutral instead. Ongoing effects such as smite evil make this roll the first time they are used against the creature; if the effect treats the target as neutral, it does so for the remainder of the effect’s duration. If the ongoing effect applies to an area and the wearer leaves that area, the percentage chance should be rolled again. Permanent magic items such as holy weapons always treat the wearer as evil. Armor constructed from angelskin is always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.

Aszite

Type of Aszite-Veined Item	Item Price Modifier

Light armor	+750 gp

Medium armor	+750 gp

Heavy armor	+1,000 gp

The twin ores of aszite and druchite are found only on the Shadow Plane. These ores are highly sought after for structural construction, as well as for their use in enhancing armor and weapons.

The navy-blue ore known as aszite is often used to reinforce buildings. While aszite cannot be properly worked into weapons, it can be added in the form of veinlike reinforcements to armor, where it absorbs and amplifies certain unique magical properties.

Adding aszite veins to armor increases the item’s weight by 10%. The added veins are capable of absorbing extra power from spells with the darkness descriptor. The wearer of aszite-veined armor gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks when affected by a spell with the darkness descriptor. In addition, spells with the darkness descriptor that last multiple rounds last 1 round longer when affecting a creature with aszite-veined armor. If the spell affects an object (such as a darkness spell) then targeting a piece of aszite-veined armor instead increases the spell’s duration by 50%.

Aszite has hardness 15 and has 20 hit points per inch of thickness.

Basalt, Magic Bridge

Value 5 sp/lb.; HP/inch 30\*; Hardness 10 (assumed to have same HP/inch as Iron since it has the same Hardness. Will update after double-checking source soon)

The stones are infused with a unique variant of ancient preservative magic. Scholars suspect that these features have grown in the stones of the bridge over the ages since an even older time, and were not originally intended or even anticipated by the structure’s architects. Bridge stones harvested from underwater rubble or mined from offshore pilings are not only of great value to builders and sculptors, but also of particular interest to those seeking to create stone constructs.

Physical Properties: Magic bridge basalt is as hard as iron, while retaining its other stony features for carving and building. It has hardness 10 and typically fetches a price of about 5 sp per pound.

Building Constructs: When a construct’s materials consist entirely of the stone, its Craft DC increases by +5 , but the required Caster Level decreases by 1. In addition, stone constructs crafted from Magic Bridge Basalt gain a +2 bonus to Strength and gain twice as many bonus hit points as normal from the construct type.

Blight Quartz

Deposits of solidified negative energy, formed by the precipitation of the plane’s substance in regions oversaturated by raw entropy, can be found throughout the Negative Energy Plane. Known as blight quartz (although the crystals are not a form of traditional elemental material), these crystals appear as black or smoky gray gemstones that periodically shimmer or crackle with eerie, dark purple energy.

The majority of blight quartz deposits are no larger than the size of a human fist. The process of crystallization diffuses the negative energy inherent in the material somewhat, but in large quantities the stuff can be debilitating. As long as a creature carries a pound or more of blight quartz or is within 5 feet of a deposit of blight quartz of a minimum of 10 pounds, that creature incurs 1 negative level. This negative level remains as long as the proximity to blight quartz continues, and disappears when these conditions end. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way (including via restoration) while proximity to the quartz continues. This is a negative energy effect.

While blight quartz cannot be worked into armor, the material can be used to augment melee weapons, as well as arrowheads, spear tips, and similar ammunition. Doing so costs an additional 200 gp per piece of ammunition or an additional 2,500 gp for a weapon. A creature hit with a blight quartz weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1 negative level. A negative level imparted by a blight quartz weapon or ammunition lasts for 1 minute before fading and never results in permanent level loss. Negative levels imparted by multiple hits reset the duration but do not otherwise stack, nor do they stack with any other negative levels the weapon may otherwise impart, or with any negative levels the creature struck may already have. This is a negative energy effect.

Blight quartz has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10, but the material decays rapidly when taken from the Negative Material Plane, taking 2d6 points of damage that bypasses its hardness each round until it crumbles away into nothingness.

Bulette Armor

Dwarves have long treasured bulettes for their thick hides and armor plating. In fact, some dwarf clans require their young to travel on long pilgrimages to areas thick with land sharks to hunt the reclusive and vicious beasts, intent on harvesting their plates for armor. A single adult male bulette has enough armor plating and hide to produce two sets of Medium bulette plate mail and four sets of Medium leather or studded leather armor. These armor sets are more often than not imbued with the delving armor quality, and veteran dwarf bulette hunters are rarely seen without their +1 delving bulette full plate while on the hunt. Creating bulette armor from the creature’s hide requires a skilled armorer; crafted bulette armor may be normal or masterwork quality.

A set of bulette plate is functionally similar to metal full plate, but is prized by wealthy collectors and military commanders the world over, and tends to sell for up to 10 times more than a normal set. Bulette full plate is slightly heavier (65 pounds) than regular steel plate, but is more flexible and durable (max Dex bonus +2, hardness 12).

A suit of bulette leather armor weighs 20 pounds, and its appearance matches the coloration of the landshark from which it was made. It sells for 50 gp, but has the same statistics as studded leather.

Aquatic Armors

Coral: Armor made of coral is grown, not made. Special corals are shaped and molded while growing, and then harvested and hardened to be worn as armor. Coral armor often has a bizarre organic look to it.

Clamshell: Clamshell armor is made by connecting together various sized shells harvested from giant clams.

Chitin: Chitin armor is constructed from the exoskeletons of giant aquatic vermin, such as giant crabs and lobsters. It is full-body armor.

Cryptstone

Cryptstone is a dense gray stone scavenged from mausoleums that often appears ancient and pitted.

A weapon made of cryptstone grants a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against undead creatures; this damage is multiplied on a critical hit.

Additionally, any non-magical weapon made of cryptstone affects incorporeal undead as if it were a magic weapon, and weapons made of cryptstone that have the disruption special ability increase the DC of that ability by +1.

Cryptstone can be used to craft bludgeoning melee weapons and ammunition that deals bludgeoning damage. Weapons made of cryptstone are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices. Items not primarily made from stone are not meaningfully affected by being partially made from cryptstone.

Cryptstone has the same hit points and hardness as steel.

Type of Cryptstone Item	Item Price Modifier

Ammunition	+10 gp per item

Weapon	+500 gp

Source: The Dead Roads (Tyrant’s Grasp AP 1 )

Crystal, Blood

HP/inch 10; Hardness 10; Cost see table

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Ammunition	+30 gp per item

Weapon	+1,500 gp

Mysterious radiation deep below the surface of the earth warps once-ordinary quartz into bloodcraving stone. If an attack with a piercing or slashing blood crystal weapon hits a target suffering from a bleed effect, the creature takes 1 additional point of damage from the attack as the blood crystal drains blood from the wound. This applies even if the creature was taking bleed damage before the attack with the blood crystal weapon. This does not increase the amount of the bleed effect.

Unfed blood crystal has a pale pink hue, darkening toward deep crimson as it becomes saturated with blood. Piercing or slashing weapons composed entirely or partially of metal can be made from blood crystal. Unworked blood crystal has a value of 500 gp per pound. Weapons made with blood crystal have one-half the normal hit points. Armor and shields cannot be made of blood crystal, as they would feed on the wearer’s own wounds.

Djezet

One of the strangest of skymetals, rust-red djezet is liquid at all temperatures. This makes the metal relatively useless for crafting objects, but most who seek out this substance intend to use it instead as an additional component for spellcasting, as it possesses an ability to enhance magic. When used as an additional material component, a dose of djezet increases the effective spell level by 1, which stacks with a heightened spell. To function as an additional material component, the spellcaster must use a number of doses of djezet equal to the spell’s original level—additional djezet doses have no effect. Djezet costs 200 gp per dose.

Dragonhide

Source: PPC:Dragonslayer’s

HP/inch 10 (hide of a dragon is typically between 1/2 inch and 1 inch thick); Hardness 10; Cost Dragonhide armor costs twice as much as masterwork armor of the same type, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type (double all Craft results). If the armor or shield is later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.

A classic status symbol for adventurers, dragonhide armor is coveted for its toughness. Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality.

One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does not confer any protection to the wearer.

Because dragonhide armor isn’t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.

Though smiths have been making dragonhide armor for centuries without the benefit of dragoncrafting, those with the Dragoncrafting feat are able to improve upon an already excellent product.

Normally, if a suit of dragonhide armor has energy immunity, one may enhance such a suit with additional energy protection for the wearer at a 25% reduced cost. However, only effects with the same elemental type as the armor’s immunity are eligible for this discount. An artisan with the Dragoncrafting feat may add 1 additional elemental protection to a suit of dragonhide armor at the same 25% discount, even if this energy resistance is not normally associated with the type of dragonhide being used.

Dragonskin

Source: PPC:Dragonslayer’s

The choicest, most malleable skin from a dragon’s underbelly can be added to any weapon with a hilt or handle. Dragonskin grips may be added to an existing weapon, or incorporated into a new weapon during crafting. The skin provides extra grip, granting the wielder a +2 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts. Producing a dragonskin grip requires the Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 15 Craft (bows or weapons) check.

Druchite

Source: PCS:DR

Type of Druchite-Veined Item	Item Price Modifier

Ammunition	+12 gp per item

Light armor	+1,000 gp

Medium armor	+1,500 gp

Heavy armor	+2,000 gp

Weapon	+1,200 gp

The twin ores of aszite and druchite are found only on the Shadow Plane. These ores are highly sought after for structural construction, as well as for their use in enhancing armor and weapons.

The black-and-violet ore known as druchite is so dark that even creatures that are adapted to see in lightless conditions can have extreme difficulty perceiving it.

Druchite ore can be worked into armor and weapons by applying it in delicate veins or inlaid patterns across the equipment.

Druchite-veined armor grants the wearer additional defenses against creatures with darkvision.

The wearer always benefits from a 10% miss chance while in an area of dim light or darkness, even if she is perceived by a creature using darkvision. Other sensory abilities, such as blindsense or true seeing, bypass this effect entirely. Druchite-veined weapons grant their wielder a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls against creatures perceiving them with darkvision.

The wielder receives no bonus when attacking creatures using other senses, such as blindsense, or benefiting from true seeing.

Druchite has hardness 10 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness.

Eel Hide

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch as leather; Hardness as leather; Cost Armor crafted from eel hide is always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices.

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Light armor	+1,200 gp

Medium armor	+1,800 gp

This supple material offers as much protection as leather, but is more flexible and resistant to electricity. Leather, hide, or studded leather armor can be produced with eel hide. The armor check penalty of such armor is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus of the armor is increased by 1. Additionally, wearing eel hide grants the wearer electricity resistance 2.

Elysian Bronze

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch as steel; Hardness as steel; Cost n/a

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Ammunition	+20 gp per item

Light armor	+1,000 gp

Medium armor	+2,000 gp

Heavy armor	+3,000 gp

Weapon	+1,000 gp

First crafted in the deeps of time by the titans and bestowed as gifts to monster-slaying heroes among the lesser races, Elysian bronze retains the brazen coloration of its namesake but is as hard as steel. A weapon made of Elysian bronze adds a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against magical beasts and monstrous humanoids; this damage is multiplied on a critical hit. After a creature uses an Elysian bronze weapon to deal damage to a magical beast or monstrous humanoid, the wielder gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against that specific creature type (for example, against chimeras, not all magical beasts) for the next 24 hours, or until the weapon deals damage to a different kind of magical beast or monstrous humanoid.

Armor made of Elysian bronze also protects its wearer against the natural weapons or unarmed strikes of magical beasts and monstrous humanoids, providing damage reduction as if it were adamantine (1/— for light armor, 2/— for medium armor, or 3/— for heavy armor). It does not provide this protection against creatures of other types.

Gold

Source: PZO1118

Typically only used for ceremonial weapons and armor, metal equipment made from gold is fragile, heavy, and expensive. Often golden armor is gold-plated rather than constructed entirely from gold.

The rules shown are for the rare item constructed entirely of gold rather than being gold-plated. Gold-plated items triple the base cost of weapons and armor and have the same properties as the item the gold is plating. Items constructed purely of gold cost 10 times the normal cost for items of their type. Gold items weigh 50% more than typical weapons or armor of their type.

Weapons Gold is often too soft to hold a decent edge, but light weapons that do piercing or slashing damage can be constructed of gold or some nearly gold alloy. They take a –2 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 damage). Gold weapons have a hardness of half their base weapons’ and also have the fragile quality.

Armor Gold can be fashioned into light or medium metal armor. The softness and the weight of the metal decrease the armor/shield bonus by 2, and increase the armor check penalty by 2. Gold armor has a hardness 5 and the fragile quality.

Greenwood

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch as wood; Hardness as wood; Cost To determine the price of a greenwood item, use the original weight but add 50 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item. Items made from darkwood cannot be made into greenwood.

The secret of greenwood lies in its harvesting. Each length is taken, with leaves still attached, from a tree animated by a treant and cut with care to avoid the death of the tree. A dryad then speaks to and shapes the wood, coaxing the living green of the leaves into the grain of the wood itself. The resulting wood remains alive as long as it is doused with at least one gallon of water (plus 1 gallon for every 10 pounds of the item’s weight) once per week and allowed to rest for an hour in contact with fertile soil. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow or spear) made from greenwood is considered a masterwork item. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from greenwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of greenwood.

When damp and in contact with fertile soil, living greenwood heals damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point per hour, even repairing breaks and regrowing missing pieces. If the weapon has the broken condition, it is repaired during the first hour of contact with fertile soil. Greenwood items take only one-quarter damage from fire.

Greenwood can be altered or enhanced with wood-shaping magic such as ironwood, shape wood, and warp wood. The duration of any such effect on a greenwood item is doubled.

Griffon Mane

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch as normal cloth x2; Hardness 1; Cost see table

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Light armor	+200 gp

Other items	+50 gp/lb.

This rough-spun cloth, ranging in color from golden-brown to brown-black, is woven from the mane of leonine magical beasts, primarily griffons but also chimeras and manticores, and is exceptionally strong and light. Wearing a cloak, robe, clothing outfit, or padded or quilted armor made from griffon mane grants a +2 competence bonus on Fly checks. If an item made of griffon mane is magically given the ability to fly, the cost to add that specific magical property is reduced by 10%, though this does not reduce the cost of any other abilities the item has.

Horacalcum

Source: PAP61

The rarest of the known skymetals, this dull, coppery substance warps time around it, making things seem to speed up or slow down. Almost never found in amounts greater than a pound, horacalcum is the same weight and density as steel, but is much more durable. A weapon made of horacalcum gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls (ammunition can be made of horacalcum, but doesn’t grant any bonus on attack rolls). An entire suit of armor made from this metal is fantastically expensive, but since a suit of horacalcum armor simultaneously allows its wearer to perceive time at a slower rate (and thus react more quickly), some consider the cost justifiable. A suit of light horacalcum armor grants a +1 bonus on Initiative checks, medium horacalcum armor grants a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and heavy horacalcum armor grants a +3 bonus on Initiative checks. Weapons and armor made of horacalcum are always of masterwork quality—the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.

Weapons and armor made of horacalcum have one-quarter more hit points than normal. Horacalcum has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15. Horacalcum increases a weapon’s costs by 6,000 gp, light armor by 10,000 gp, medium armor by 30,000 gp, and heavy armor by 60,000 gp.

Inubrix

Source: PAP61

This metal’s structure allows it to pass through iron and steel without touching them, seeming to shift in and out of phase with reality. Inubrix is the softest of the solid skymetals, being only slightly less malleable than lead. As a result, it doesn’t function well for crafting armor. Though inubrix weapons can penetrate most metal armors with relative ease, the weapons tend to break easily. Inubrix has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.

An inubrix weapon deals damage as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size, and is always treated as if it had the broken condition. It ignores all armor or shield bonuses granted by iron or steel armor or shields. Inubrix weapons cannot damage these materials at all (and, by extension, cannot harm iron golems or similar creatures). Inubrix increases a weapon’s costs by 5,000 gp.

Iron, Cold

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch 30; Hardness 10; Cost Weapons x2 normal. Add magic enhancement +2,000 gp.

This iron, mined deep underground and known for its effectiveness against demons and fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.

Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not.

A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.

Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added. A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.

Mindglass

Source: PZO90126

Mindglass is a special material as strong as steel that also provides the bearer with protection against an opponent’s psychic abilities. When a creature wielding a melee weapon made of mindglass succeeds at a saving throw against a psychic or mind-affecting effect from a creature, the weapon stores some of that energy and holds it for a future attack. A mindglass weapon can store this energy for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell, or half the creature’s CR if the effect wasn’t a spell or spell-like ability. If the weapon hits a creature while still holding this energy, it suffuses the target with a disruptive field for 1 round. On a critical hit, the disruptive field effect instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s critical multiplier.

While affected by this field, a target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell’s level) to cast any spell or spell-like ability (in addition to any other required concentration checks). If the check is failed, the affected creature’s spell or spell-like ability is wasted. A Small or Medium weapon made of mindglass costs an additional 13,000 gp.

Mithral

Source: PZO1110

HP/inch 30; Hardness 15; Cost Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.; Weight 1/2 normal; Weight (Longer Wording) An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon’s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). (see FAQ below.)

Type of Item	Item Cost Modifier

Light armor	+1,000 gp

Medium armor	+4,000 gp

Heavy armor	+9,000 gp

Shield	+1,000 gp

Other items	+500 gp/lb.

Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard.

When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor, and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor’s check penalty to all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).

Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot.) Mithral weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

FAQ

What weight do I use to determine the price of a mithral weapon or non-armor item?

To determine the additional price for the mithral (as compared to the normal item’s price), use the non-mithral item’s original weight and multiply that by 500 gp per pound.

For example, a steel dagger for a Medium creature weighs 1 pound. For its mithral equivalent, multiply that weight (1 lb.) times 500 gp/pound, or +500 gp. When added to the original item’s cost (2 gp), the mithral dagger’s total price is 502 gp.

There are likely some inconsistent mithral item prices in print, and these will be addressed in future printings of these books, as appropriate.

Noqual

Source: PAP61

Noqual looks like a pale green crystal to the untrained eye, but can be worked as iron despite its appearance. Noqual is light—half as heavy as iron, yet just as strong. More importantly, noqual is strangely resistant to magic. An object made of noqual gains a +4 bonus on any saving throw made against a magical source.

Weapons made of noqual weigh half as much as normal, and gain a +1 enhancement bonus on damage rolls against constructs and undead created by feats or spells. Noqual armor weighs half as much as other armors of its type. For the purposes of movement and other limitations, heavy noqual armor is treated as medium armor, and medium noqual armor is treated as light armor. The armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2, and armor check penalties are reduced by 3. The armor’s spell failure chance increases by 20% and applies to all magic cast while wearing the armor, regardless of the magic’s source or the wearer’s class abilities. The wearer of a suit of noqual armor gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities.

Noqual has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. Noqual ore is worth 50 gp per pound. Noqual increases the cost of light armor by 4,000 gp, medium armor by 8,000 gp, heavy armor by 12,000 gp, a shield by 2,000 gp, and a weapon or other item by 500 gp. Creating a magic item that incorporates any amount of noqual into it increases the price of creation by 5,000 gp, as costly reagents and alchemical supplies must be used to treat the metal during the process.

Obsidian

Source: PZO1118

Cost 1/2 normal.; Weight 3/4 normal.; Cost/Weight (Longer Wording) “Obsidian weapons cost half of what base items of their type do, and weigh 75% of what base items of their type do.”

This black volcanic glass is extremely sharp, and can be shaped into a variety of weapons that do piercing and slashing damage. Bits of obsidian inserted into a length of tempered wood create effective swords called terbutjes.

Weapons Obsidian can be used to craft light and one-handed weapons that do piercing or slashing damage, as well as spear tips and arrowheads. Obsidian weapons have half the hardness of their base weapon and have the fragile quality.

Armor The fragile glass nature of obsidian is perfect for creating sharp points and blades, but those same qualities make it unsuitable for creating armor. Armor cannot be constructed from obsidian.

SerpentStone

Source: PAP:41

Serpentstone is a strange substance unique to the precursor alchemies of the ancient serpentfolk. Its ancient name is lost to time, but modern explorers have dubbed it “serpentstone” after its ophidian creators.

Exceptionally resilient, all serpentstone is magically treated stone. When properly worked and treated through eldritch means known only to ancient serpentfolk wizards and sorcerers, serpentstone can be programmed to emit sound and light in a variety of ways, shifting at predetermined times from color to color and tone to tone, from brightness equal to that of daylight to a dim, shadowy glimmer like that of a candle. In addition, serpentstone can be set to radiate heat or cold, or produce illusory smoke, roiling forth thin streams of scented, incense-like fumes designed to delight, enlighten, or otherwise inform serpentfolk in the vicinity. All of these effects function as major image (caster level 18th).

Siccatite

Source: PAP61

This shining silver metal is either incredibly hot or freezing cold when found. As of yet, scholars have not determined whether siccatite is actually two similarly hued metals or a single type that determines its own temperature via some unknown process. When raw siccatite is found, it has a 50% chance of being hot siccatite; otherwise, it’s cold siccatite. Physical contact with siccatite deals 1 point of fire (for hot siccatite) or cold (for cold siccatite) damage each round. Hot siccatite can eventually ignite objects, and cold siccatite in water quickly surrounds itself with a 1-foot-thick shell of ice. A weapon made of siccatite deals 1 additional point of damage of the appropriate energy type each time it strikes a foe, but also deals 1 point of the same energy damage to the wielder each round it is used in combat.

Siccatite armor deals 1 point of energy damage (fire or cold) per round to a creature wearing it, and deals 1 point of the same energy damage each full round a creature is grappled by someone wearing siccatite armor. Cold siccatite armor grants fire resistance 5, while hot siccatite armor grants cold resistance 5. (The type of armor does not alter the amount of resistance granted.) Siccatite increases the cost of a weapon by 1,000 gp and armor by 6,000 gp (regardless of the armor’s type).

Ammunition	+2 gp

One-handed weapon, or one head of a double weapon	+90 gp

Two-handed weapon, or both heads of a double weapon	+180 gp

A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes.

On a successful attack with a silvered slashing or piercing weapon, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on the damage roll (with a minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn’t work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.

Blades made of this special metal count as alchemical silver weapons and are immune to rust, including that of rust monsters, the rusting grasp spell, and so on.

Blades made of silversheen are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the price given. A blade made of silversheen has its price increased by 750 gp. Crafting a silversheen blade requires Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks and Craft (weaponsmithing) 5 ranks.

Skymetal Alloys

Source: PAP61

Both ancient and modern metallurgists have devised numerous alloys that mix skymetals with other materials. Many of these are highly specialized, but one deserves special mention: glaucite. This dull gray metal is an alloy of adamantine and iron. Though it has hardness 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness, glaucite is half again as heavy as iron and difficult to work with. The material of choice for ship hulls and robot frames, but is generally sought after only by collectors and eccentrics as a material for new items or other projects.

Spiresteel

Source PAP139

Philosophers speculate that spiresteel is composed of a condensed form of pure quintessence. This substance, called spiresteel, exhibits an innate attraction for soul energy.

Armor crafted from spiresteel protects the wearer’s essence, applying half of its armor bonus to AC against attacks made by incorporeal creatures. Weapons crafted from spiresteel appear hungry for the very substance of the foes they are wielded against. When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a spiresteel weapon, the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + double the weapon’s enhancement bonus), or be staggered for 1 round as a portion of its soul is carved away.

Spiresteel can be used to craft any armor or weapon that is typically made of steel. Items made of spiresteel are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices.

Spiresteel has the same hit points and hardness as steel.

Dwarves stumbled across the secret of crafting fire-forged steel in an effort to make forge-friendly tools. It didn’t take them long to adapt its unique properties to arms and armor. Fire-forged steel channels heat in one direction to protect its wearer or wielder. When it is crafted into armor, heat is channeled away from the wearer, offering some limited protection. Armor crafted from fire-forged steel grants the wearer fire resistance 2.

Weapons crafted from fire-forged steel similarly channel heat away from the wearer; this does not grant the wielder energy resistance. Instead, the blade absorbs and channels heat to the parts of the weapon that contact enemies. If the weapon is exposed to 10 points or more of fire damage (such as from an opponent’s fireball or by holding it in a campfire for 1 full round), the weapon adds +1d4 points of fire damage to its attacks for the next 2 rounds. If the wielder is wearing fire-forged armor and using a fire-forged weapon, this bonus damage increases to 1d6 points of fire damage and lasts for 4 rounds. This bonus damage does not stack with fire damage from weapon enhancements such as flaming.

Steel, Frost-Forged

Source: PZO1123

HP/inch as steel; Hardness as steel; Cost Armor or weapons made from frost-forged steel are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices.

This material is the same substance as fire-forged steel with a subtle difference in the alignment of the metal during crafting. Instead of channeling heat away from the wearer, it channels heat toward the wearer. Frost-forged steel works similarly to fire-forged steel, except its effects apply to cold damage rather than fire damage. This means frost-forged steel weapons are less useful than their fire-forged counterparts, as there are few non-magical sources of cold that can quickly imbue it with enough cold energy to deal bonus damage.

Some trees suck up potent minerals through their roots the same way others draw water from the ground. Though these trees blunt saws and axes used to hew them and shrug off fire, they eventually succumb to time or the elements. When properly harvested, these fallen trees produce nuggets of a metal called living steel. This glossy green metal slowly repairs itself. An item made from living steel repairs damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points per day, or 1 hit point per day if it has the broken condition. Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of living steel.

Armor and shields made from living steel can damage metal weapons that strike them. Whenever the wielder of a metal weapon rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll against a creature wearing living steel armor or wielding a living steel shield, the item must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it is instead destroyed. Living steel cannot damage adamantine weapons in this way.

Steel, Singing

Source PPZO94102

This lustrous golden metal emits beautiful bell-like tones when struck. An alloy of gold and mithral, singing steel was originally created by the elves.

A weapon made of singing steel counts as alchemical silver for all purposes, including the –1 penalty on damage rolls with singing steel weapons. Most armor made of singing steel is treated as one category lighter (heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light). The armor or shield’s arcane spell failure chance is reduced by 5%, its maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 1, and its armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0).

When wielding a singing steel weapon, shield, or item weighing at least 5 pounds, or wearing medium or heavy singing steel armor, the wielder or wearer can strike the singing steel as part of beginning a bardic performance. If the wielder can normally start a bardic performance as a standard action, he can do so as a move action instead. If the wielder can normally start a bardic performance as a move action, he can do so as a swift action instead. This ability does not function in the area of a silence spell or similar effect. After using the singing steel in this fashion, the steel must be carefully brushed to remove any lingering vibrations, a process that takes 10 minutes.

Singing steel items are always masterwork; this cost is included in the price. Singing steel has 20 hp per inch of thickness and hardness 10. Although formed partially from mithral, singing steel items weigh as much as their normal counterparts.

Stone

Cost 1/4 normal.; Weight 3/4 normal.

Stone Age weapons almost always utilize stone in some way. From rocks lashed to wooden hafts to create early maces and axes, to flint knives and stone arrowheads, these primitive weapons are still deadly.

Weapons Light and one-handed bludgeoning weapons, spears, axes, daggers and arrowheads can all be made of stone. Weapons made of stone have half the hardness of their base weapons, and have the fragile quality.

Armor Armor cannot usually be constructed from stone, but advanced, often alchemically enhanced stone armor made by dwarves or other stone-working cultures does exist (see stone coat).

Cost/Weight (Longer Wording) “Stone weapons cost a quarter of what base items of their type do, and weigh 75% of what base items of their type do.”

Sunsilver

Source PPZO94102

A weapon made of sunsilver counts as alchemical silver for all purposes. Items not primarily made of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of sunsilver. (For example, a scimitar or breastplate can be made of sunsilver, while a quarterstaff or hide armor cannot.) In addition, items made of sunsilver are immune to rust effects (such as rusting grasp). While in an area of bright light, a shield or suit of armor made of sunsilver shines brightly, allowing the wearer to reflect light at nearby foes as a move action. When she does so, creatures adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round.

Armor and weapons made of sunsilver are always masterwork. To determine the price of a sunsilver item, add 25 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item. Sunsilver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.

Viridium

Type of Item	Price Modifier

Ammunition	+20 gp per item

Weapon	+200 gp

This deep green volcanic glass is similar to obsidian but is formed when molten rock is tainted with anomalous trace minerals from deep beneath the earth whose emanations are toxic to living things. It can be fragmented to razor sharpness, but even a tiny amount of viridium contacting the bloodstream can pass on a wasting sickness.

Any successful hit with a viridium weapon causes the target to contract leprosy (Fortitude DC 12 negates). On a successful critical hit, a tiny fragment of viridium breaks off within the target, affecting it as though with greenblood oil (Fortitude DC 13 negates).

A creature carrying a viridium weapon must save every 24 hours or contract leprosy unless the weapon is kept inside an extradimensional space (such as an efficient quiver) or a scabbard lined with lead.

Oozes, plants, and outsiders are immune to the deadly emanations of viridium.

Viridium weapons have half the hardness of their base weapon and have the fragile quality. Viridium can be magically strengthened at an additional cost of +1,000 gp for a weapon or +20 gp for ammunition. This removes the fragile quality from the item but does not otherwise affect its abilities.

Light armor	+1,000 gp

Heavy armor	+4,500 gp

Slashing/piercing weapon	+1,000 gp

Grioths wield weapons fashioned from a strange sort of transparent material called voidglass. This material is as hard as steel, but made of crystals that voidglass shapers on unknown worlds grow into the desired shapes.

Voidglass resonates with a creature’s mind, bolstering thought and mental defenses. Any suit of armor normally made from metal can be made of voidglass. A suit of light voidglass armor grants a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting magic. This bonus increases to +2 for medium voidglass armor, and +3 for heavy voidglass armor. Voidglass armor isn’t often worn by grioths, but voidglass weapons are another story. The creatures (and perhaps other strange beings with similar psychic capabilities) can funnel violent bursts of psychic energy through these weapons on a hit. In the hands of any creature, a voidglass piercing or slashing weapon deals 1 additional damage on a hit—bludgeoning weapons gain no benefit.

Voidglass has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A pound of raw, unworked voidglass is worth 100 gp.

Whipwood

Source: PZO1121

HP/inch 10; Hardness 8; Cost +500 gp.

Vanara woodworkers craft this extremely flexible material in a time-consuming process. Whipwood is actually a composite of several bendable wooden fibers woven and fused together to form a flexible but sturdy unit. Only wooden weapons or weapons with wooden hafts (such as axes and spears) can be made out of whipwood.

A creature wielding a whipwood weapon treats its CMD as +2 higher for the purpose of avoiding sunder attempts against that weapon. A whipwood weapon’s hit points increase by +5. Whipwood loses its special qualities if under the effect of an ironwood spell.

Wyroot

Source: PZO1121

The root of the wyrwood tree has a peculiar quality. When a weapon constructed of wyroot confirms a critical hit, it absorbs some of the life force of the creature hit. The creature hit is unharmed and the wyroot weapon gains 1 life point. As a swift action, a wielder with a ki pool or an arcane pool can absorb 1 life point from the wyrwood weapon and convert it into either 1 ki point or 1 arcane pool point. A wyroot weapon can gain at most 1 life point per day and hold up to 1 life point at a time. More powerful wyroot weapons can gain up to 3 life points per day and hold up to 3 life points at a time. Any unspent life points dissipate at dusk. A creature can convert life points from only one wyroot weapon per day.

Wyroot can be used to construct any melee weapon made entirely of wood or with a wooden haft. Constructing a weapon that can hold 1 life point increases the cost by 1,000 gp, constructing one that can hold up to 2 life points increases the cost by 2,000 gp, and constructing one that can hold up to 3 life points increases the cost by 4,000 gp.

What is a Power Component?

Source: 101 Special Materials and Power Components

It is an item or object often alchemical in nature used as a material component or focus for a spell in order to alter or augment the spell’s normal effects. Those listed in this product are all material components (and as such are consumed in the casting) as we found though playtesting that power components that function as foci tend to be unbalancing, since foci end up working like unlimited metamagic rods. You can only use one power component to alter or augment the casting of a single spell at a time.

Power Components and Magic items: Power component affected magic items do not function like metamagic rods; they instead apply their benefit to a single spell effect the item can produce. You can only apply one power component to one effect on an item at a time.

Special Materials from other Publishers

Asbestos Cloth (3pp)

Source: PSCS (3pp)

Asbestos cloth will not catch on fire and armor constructed from asbestos cloth provides resistance to fire and heat. Asbestos clothing and cloth armor composed primarily of asbestos is immune to fire damage and is never at risk of catching on fire. However, this property only imparts fire resistance 5 to the wearer.

Objects constructed from asbestos cloth cost twice as much as their normal counterparts, but they take no longer to make than ordinary objects of that type (double all successful Craft results). Asbestos cloth has the same statistics as normal cloth.

Black Seaweed (3pp)

Source: Treasures of Freeport (3pp)

Value 2 gp/lb.; HP/inch 3; Hardness 1

Growing in underwater forests in shallow waters, black seaweed is a relatively common commodity in coastal areas. When wet, it is inky black with slightly lighter veins. When dried, it looks almost like tobacco only darker and much more fibrous. Black seaweed is often used as a rope substitute by aquatic races, especially in construction of nets, due to its strength and resistance to seawater.

Black seaweed must be kept moist at all times. The moment it is removed from salt water it begins to deteriorate and lose its strength. Removal from water for more than 8 hours begins to dry it out (hardness 0, 2 hp/in.) and causes it to lose its elasticity. Before this point the seaweed can be brought back to its normal state by submersion for one hour in salt water. Once 8 hours have past the deterioration is irreversible and after 24 hours out of water it is dry and brittle (hardness 0, 1 hp) and easily broken apart like any other dried plant. Storing black seaweed in any liquid other than seawater slows the process to one-fourth its normal time (32 hours to begin drying out, 96 hours to become brittle) but does not completely prevent it.

Blood Iron (3pp)

Source: LG:LS

Price: +1,500 gp (weapon), +750 gp (armor) or +30 gp (ammunition)

This rust-red metal is a special form of steel (despite the name) that is infused with blood in the forging process, usually that of a ritualistically- sacrificed and oftentimes sacred animal such as a rooster or bull; in evil societies or particularly- desperate situations, a human sacrifice might be used.

This ritual involves both costly materials (such as special incense to burn during the entirety of the process) and a skilled craftsman, hence the high price f or such a weapon. The end result is a metal that always seems to be slick with blood and has a distinctive iron-and-copper scent, no matter how much it is cleaned. A weapon made of blood-iron is always considered masterwork.

As long as an individual is wielding a weapon made of blood-iron (merely carrying one is not enough), they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate checks; multiple wielded weapons grant multiple instances of this bonus. On any turn where the wielder has drawn the weapon from its sheath (or has otherwise drawn their weapon from an unready position), the bonus to Intimidate that wielding that weapon grants is increased by +1; the light plays off a blade in a sinister manner, a hammer drips blood as if it had recently crushed a skull, and so forth. In addition, whenever the weapon would threaten a critical hit, the wielder gains a +4 circumstance bonus to confirm the critical (which stacks with effects such as Critical Focus). Finally, the weapon gains the deadly quality; if the weapon would already have the deadly quality, the benefits stack.

Any armor primarily made of metal (such as a chain shirt or breastplate) can also be made out of blood-iron. Armor that is made of blood-iron grants a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate while worn, and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that would cause the wearer to take hit point damage from bleeding. It also grants a +2 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks made to stabilize.

Unlike other special materials, the process of creating blood-iron allows a weapon to be formed from it even after its initial creation. A masterwork weapon that is primarily made of metal (including the heads of arrows or spears, or other wooden-hafted but metal-tipped weapons) and is not otherwise a special material (such as bronze, cold iron, or silver) can be converted into a blood-iron weapon by paying the additional cost and using the normal rules for crafting mundane equipment. As fresh blood must be provided in order to create such a weapon, the character must either find a noteworthy sacrifice (which may prove more difficult than first assumed) or give some of their own blood; 3 hit points per character level is enough.

Bone (3pp)

Value 1 sp/lb.; HP/inch 10; Hardness 5

Dried bone is as tough as wood and in many ways almost as versatile, being used for weapons as well as for the art of scrimshaw. Bone can be sharpened much like some stones can.

Brill (3pp)

Source: Cerulean Seas Undersea Campaign Setting (3pp)

This unusual and extremely rare material has a few secrets that those uninitiated to psionic sciences are typically unaware of. First, all brill radiates a faint psychokinetic aura. Second, the material can be tapped for power points, though doing so can be very dangerous and it may even destroy the stone. To tap into the power of a brillstone, the own must place it in his mouth and expend psionic focus as a standard action. The owner then gains 1d6 temporary power points.

On a roll of a 6, the owner gains another 1d6 point points. On subsequent rolls of 6, another d6 is rolled and that many power points are gained until something other than a 6 is rolled. Any time the owner gains more than 9 power points from a brillstone, the stone is utterly destroyed.

If the stone is not destroyed, it cannot be tapped for power points again until 24 hours has passed.

Immediately upon receiving power points, regardless of the number of times a d6 was rolled, the owner then takes energy damage equal to the total number of temporary power points he has gained (no save). The type of energy is determined by the last roll of the d6: 1: cold, 2: steam, 3: electricity, 4: sonic, 5: acid.

Copper-Plated (3pp)

Source: PSCS (3pp)

Copper-plated objects take half damage from acid effects. Armor composed primarily of metal that is plated in copper confers to its wearer acid resistance 1 for light armor, 3 for medium armor and shields, and 5 for heavy armor. Copper-plated armor or shields render the wearer more vulnerable to electricity attacks, however, either granting any attack against the wearer that deals electricity damage a +2 bonus to attack rolls or increases the DC to reduce the electricity damage by +1.

Copper-plated weapons that channel or that deal electricity damage deal 1 extra point of electricity damage per electricity damage die on a successful hit (this extra damage is multiplied on a critical hit). For example, a magus channeling a 3d6 shocking grasp spell through his copper-plated longsword via the spellstrike class feature, would deal 3 extra electricity damage on a hit.

Copper-plated steel has the same statistics as normal steel.

Coral, Chitin, and Sea Shells (3pp)

Items made from coral, chitin, or sea shells are refined and shaped through various alchemical processes. They are relatively cheap, but not particularly strong compared to objects constructed of metal. Items or objects constructed from these materials gain the broken condition after 7 days out of water and gain the destroyed condition after 7+(1d6) days out of water.

Type of Weapon	Cost Modifier	Weight	Benefit

Common Crystalline	x50	Normal	Ignore half of armor bonus; +1d6 sunder damage

True Crystalline	x200	Normal	Ignores armor and deflection bonuses

Using precious stones to line the edge of bladed weapons, crystalline weapons are capable of slicing through the toughest of hides. A weapon edged in crystal ignores half of the armor bonus granted by armor (round up). Against magical armor, this applies only to the armor, but not the enhancement bonus of the armor. This also applies to shields. The weapon itself must be enchanted to at least the same level as the armor to enjoy this effect, otherwise it’s treated as a normal weapon. Furthermore, if used to sunder a weapon or strike an inanimate object the weapon deals an additional +1d6 points of damage.

True crystalline weaponry is rare in the extreme. These weapons are made entirely from a precious crystal or gem and are fragile but very lethal weapons used only in the times of greatest need. A true crystalline blade is typically made of diamond. It ignores armor bonuses of armor, as well as deflection bonuses from magical items. Against magical armor, the weapon needs to have an enhancement bonus equal to or greater than that of the armor in order to have any special effect; otherwise, it is treated as a normal weapon.

These weapons are extremely fragile, despite their incredible hardness. A weapon that is true crystalline shatters on a natural attack roll of a 1; its hardness is 20 but it only has 5 hp. Only slashing and piercing weapons may be crystalline.

Dreamstone looks almost like a pale green crystal to the untrained eye, but can be worked as iron despite its appearance. It is associated with abjuration magic, dreamers, and musicians.

Dreamstone is light—half as heavy as iron, yet just as strong. More importantly, dreamstone is strangely resistant to magic. An object made of dreamstone gains a +4 bonus on any saving throw made against a magical source. Creating a magic item that incorporates any amount of dreamstone into it increases the price of creation by +5,000 gp, as costly reagents and alchemical supplies must be used to treat the metal during the process.

Weapons made of dreamstone weigh half as much as normal, and gain a +1 enhancement bonus on damage rolls against constructs, magically created undead, and summoned creatures. Dreamstone armor weighs half as much as other armors of its type, and is treated as one category lighter than normal for the purposes of movement and other limitations (light armor is still treated as light armor, though). The armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2, and armor check penalties are reduced by 3. The armor’s spell failure chance increases by 20% and applies to all magic cast while wearing the armor, regardless of the magic’s source or class abilities possessed by the wearer. The wearer of a suit of dreamtime armor gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. A shield of dreamstone does not add a resistance bonus to saving throws or reduce spell failure but it adds a +2 deflection bonus from spells and spell-like abilities that require a ranged touch attack.

Dreamstone has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. Dreamstone ore is worth 50 gp per pound.

This dull, coppery substance warps time around it, making things seem to speed up or slow down. Geranite is associated with illusion magic, humility, and valor. Almost never found in amounts greater than a pound, geranite is the same weight and density as steel, but is much more durable. A weapon, such as a warhammer, made of geranite gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls (ammunition can be made of geranite, but does not grant any bonus on attack rolls). An entire suit of armor made from this rare metal is fantastically expensive, but since a suit of geranite armor simultaneously allows its wearer to react more quickly while perceiving time more slowly, some consider the cost justifiable.

A suit of light geranite armor grants a +1 bonus on Initiative checks, medium geranite armor grants a +2 bonus on Initiative checks, and heavy geranite armor grants a +3 bonus on Initiative checks. Weapons and armor made of geranite are always of masterwork quality—the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Ammunition made from geranite does not get a circumstance bonus, but acts as masterwork durable ammunition.

Weapons and armor made of geranite have one-fourth more hit points than normal. Geranite has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.

This material has the strength and durability of steel while being as transparent as glass. Spellcasters and alchemists, via transmutation, have developed the ability to give glass the properties of steel, and steel the properties of glass.

Items can be made via Craft (armor), Craft (weapons), Craft (blacksmithing), or Craft (glassblowing) check, appropriate to the type of item.

Finished products must be masterwork quality if possible (included in the cost above). The resulting material is transparent and the color of the caster’s choice (though is most often colorless), appearing much like clear volcanic glass. The weight of the item is as normal for an item of that type. This material is subject to neither magnetism nor rust. The market price of light armor is increased by 2,000 gp, medium armor by 5,000 gp, heavy armor by 10,000 gp, shields by 500 gp, ammunition by 50 gp, light weapons by 500 gp, one-handed weapons, or one head of a double weapon by 1,500 gp, two-handed weapons, or both heads of a double weapon by 2,500 gp, and other items by 500 gp/lb.

Armor	+300 gp

This metal is blue-green and glows with great power that can poison those who sample of its might for too long or too directly. Hellstone is associated with conjuration magic and artistic passion. Hellstone functions as steel when used to craft weapons and armor, but anyone who carries or wears hellstone arms or armor becomes sickened for as long as the gear is carried or worn, plus an additional 1d4 hours after it is removed. Likewise, a character in an area with heavy concentrations of hellstone becomes sickened as long as he remains in the area. This is a poison effect.

Weapons and armor made from hellstone glow with an intensity equal to that of a candle. Scholars have long debated where the glow and associated sickening effect come from. Hellstone weapons are treated as masterwork weapons and are able to bypass the damage reduction of azatas. Armor are considered masterwork as well.

Hellstone can also be powdered and alchemically distilled with other rare catalysts and chemicals to form a much more potent toxin. A pound of Hellstone is enough to make 1 dose of hellstone powder.

Hellstone Powder: Poison—ingested; save Fortitude DC 18; onset 10 minutes; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d4 Con plus nausea; cure 2 saves; Cost 900 gp.

Ice (3pp)

Type of Item	Item Cost Modifier

Weapon/shield	x1/4

Though largely unknown outside of arctic and sub-arctic regions, ice can be used to manufacture weapons and shields. The manufacturing process is very different than the normal process for constructing such items, instead relying on the Craft (ice carving) skill (but with the same DCs for creating weapons and shields). Ice weapons can only exist in areas where the temperature remains below the freezing point – if the temperature rises even one degree above freezing, ice weapons and shields begin to melt, losing 2 hp per minute until the item melts away. Ice weapons and shields can be made permanent, capable of surviving temperatures above freezing, by magic and with some alchemical concoctions. Unless so treated, ice weapons and shields suffer 50% more damage from heat and flame (such as a dragon’s breath or a fireball spell).

Ice weapons are virtually ineffective against metal armor, dealing a maximum of 1 hp damage on strikes against foes clad in any type of metal armor. Ice weapons must also make a DC 15 Fortitude save every time they strike metal armor. Failing the save results in the ice weapon shattering. Though ice swords are manufactured, the nature of ice does not allow for a cutting edge, so any ice weapon that normally does slashing damage will do bludgeoning instead (though the amount of damage does not change). Piercing weapons can still pierce effectively. In addition to the normal damage, ice weapons deal an extra 1d3 points of cold damage with each blow and count as cold weapons for purposes of overcoming energy resistance or for purposes of vulnerability.

Ice shields are very effective against non-metal weapons, performing as a light or heavy wooden shield. However, against metal weapons, an ice shield has only a +0 (light) or +1 (heavy) shield bonus. Also, with each blow from a metal weapon, an ice shield must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Failure to save results in the ice shield shattering into worthless shards. An ice shield grants the wielder a +2 bonus to any saving throw against cold-based spells or attacks targeted at the wielder. The bonus does not apply to area-effect spells, nor does it apply to ranged touch attacks.

GM’s Suggestion

Ice shields and weapons are perfect examples of items for which the GM needs to use their discretion. For all but the harshest of campaign settings, even permanent ice shields and weapons will be seasonal items at best, sold only during the coldest months of winter.

Iron, Primal (3pp)

Source: 101 Special Materials and Power Components (3pp)

HP/inch: 30 (weapons and shields made from primal iron have half the normal hp, and suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws); Hardness: 10; Cost: weapon x3 normal, add magic enhancement +3,000 gp.

This dark grey, almost black, iron is non-reflective and lets off a constant smell of freshly spilt blood; its touch gives off a feeling of security. It has a violent effect against creatures vulnerable to cold iron. The tales of the elder druids tell of its creation by the “creator-beings” when their blood mingled with portals into the plane of dreams and filtered down to iron ore deposits in the deep places of the earth.

Primal iron weapons count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, affecting regeneration, and concerning vulnerability to cold iron. Creatures whose damage reduction is overcome by cold iron, or whose regeneration stops functioning due to a cold iron attack, or who are vulnerable to cold iron take half again as much damage (+50%) from a primal iron weapon (additional dice damage is not increased such as that from a burst special ability or sneak attack damage) as normal.

Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of this special material.

Weapons made of primal iron cost three times as much to make as their normal counterparts. In addition, adding any magical enhancements to a primal iron weapon increases its price by 3,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added; a double weapon with one primal iron half costs 150% more than normal.

Lead-Lined (3pp)

Source: PSCS (3pp)

Lead-lined weapons hit with greater impact, gaining a +1 bonus to damage rolls when dealing bludgeoning or slashing damage (this extra damage is multiplied on a critical hit). This bonus to damage is doubled for two-handed weapons. Lead-lined clothing and armor grants its wearer negative energy resistance 1 for light armor and clothing, 3 for medium armor, and 5 for heavy armor. However, the wearer takes a -1 penalty to all Dexterity– and Strength-based skill checks due to the unusual weight.

Lead-lined objects weigh 1.5 times as much as their normal counterparts. Otherwise, lead-lined steel has the same statistics as normal steel.

Linite (3pp)

Source: Godmetals of Porphyra (3pp)

Type of Item	Item Item Cost Modifier

Armor	+6,000 gp

Weapons	+1,000 gp

This shining silver metal is either incredibly hot or freezing cold when found. Linite is associated with evocation magic, artifice, and order. Forgewrights debate as to whether linite is a single substance or two similarly tinctured metals. When raw linite is found, it has a 50% chance of being hot linite or cold linite.

Physical contact with linite deals 1 point of energy damage (either fire or cold, as appropriate). Hot linite can eventually ignite objects, and cold linite in water quickly surrounds itself with a 1-foot-thick shell of ice. A weapon made of linite deals +1 point of damage of the appropriate energy type each time it strikes a foe, but also deals 1 point of the same energy damage to the wielder each round it is used in combat.

Likewise, linite armor deals 1 point of energy damage per round to a creature wearing it, and deals 1 point of energy damage each full round a creature is grappled by someone wearing linite armor. Cold linite armor grants fire resistance 5, while hot linite armor grants cold resistance 5. (The type of armor does not alter the amount of resistance granted.) Typically only creatures with natural resistance to fire or cold seek to use linite weapons or armor.

Mawine (3pp)

Source: Godmetals of Porphyra (3pp)

This metal’s structure allows it to pass through iron and steel without touching them, seemingly shifting in and out of phase with reality. Mawine is associated with necromancy magic, prophecies of doom, and assassins. Mawine is the softest of the solid godmetals, being only slightly less malleable than lead. It doesn’t function well for crafting armor as a result, and though mawine weapons can penetrate most metal armors with relative ease, the weapons tend to break easily.

Mawine has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5. A mawine weapon deals damage as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size, and is always treated as if it had the broken condition. It ignores all armor or shield bonuses granted by iron or steel armor or shields. Mawine weapons cannot damage these materials at all (and, by extension, cannot harm iron golems or similar creatures). A mawine weapon costs +5,000 gp.

Mithral, Celestial (3pp)

Source: 101 Special Materials and Power Components (3pp)

HP/inch: 30; Hardness: 15; Cost: weapons +3000 gp, add magic enhancement +3,000 gp

Celestial mithral is a form of mithral blessed by the divine power of the dwarven gods. It is a silvery, luminescent metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard.

Celestial mithral has all the properties of mithral but celestial mithral weapons count as silver and good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, affecting regeneration, and vulnerability to silver and good. If a creature’s damage reduction can be overcome by silver and/or good, regeneration stops functioning due to a silver/good attack, and/or those vulnerable to silver/good takes half again as much damage (+50%) from a celestial mithral weapon (additional dice damage, such as that from a burst special ability or sneak attack damage, is not increased). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of this special material (a longsword can be a celestial mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot). Weapons made from this special material have an increased market price of 2,000 gp. In addition, adding any magical enhancements to a celestial mithral weapon increases its price by 3,000 gp, and they can only be added by a divine caster of a dwarven deity. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.

Shark Skin (3pp)

Source: Treasures of Freeport (3pp)

Value 5 gp/lb.; HP/inch 5; Hardness 2

The properly cured hide of a shark (or ray) is an excellent substitute for leather. Because of its relative rarity, due mostly to the difficulty in obtaining it, shark skin is used primarily as a decorative component of larger pieces, such as lining the grip of a weapon or to make smaller items such as purses. Of course, as a leather substitute it can appear in any item ordinarily made of leather including armor and saddles. If used on the handle of a weapon, disarm combat maneuvers made against such items suffer a -2 circumstance penalty. Other items crafted of shark skin generally grant the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks involving the use of these items. For example, gloves made of shark skin would grant the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics and Climb checks. A saddle crafted of or lined with shark skin would grant a rider a +2 circumstance bonus to Ride checks made to remain in the saddle. The exact nature and extend of these bonuses is up to the GMs discretion but generally should not exceed +2 and should not affect more than one or two types of skills.

Silk, Aranea (3pp)

Source: 101 Special Materials and Power Components (3pp)

HP/inch: 5; Hardness: 0; Cost: tunic +1,150 gp

This long silk is spun by the aranea. It is most often transformed into a shirt, made from the alchemically treated silk. This silk is woven in layers specifically designed to trap piercing weapons, snagging them so they fail to harm the wearer.

After being treated alchemically, this material is almost always woven into a masterwork silk tunic (included in the cost). This is considered padded armor but it can be worn under any other type of armor adding no weight and offering DR 3/slashing and bludgeoning. The price of items crafted of aranea silk is increased by +1,150 gp.

Silkweave (3pp)

Source Underdark Adventure Guide (3pp)

Material	Cost Modifier	Weight Modifier

Silkweave	x2	x1/2

Drow and some duergar have mastered the craft of weaving giant spider silk. Incredibly lightweight and durable, it is used to create various goods including clothes, light armor and utilitarian products such as sidepacks, pouches and the like. Silkweave garments and items are 50% lighter than their regular counterparts and are double the price. Silkweave is often shaped and soaked repeatedly in pools rich with lime and other hard minerals to create calcified pots, urns and other crafts of remarkable hardness.

Starstone (3pp)

Source Underdark Adventure Guide (3pp)

Material	Cost Modifier	Benefit

Starstone (1 ounce cube)	6 gp	Gives off light as if a torch

Starstone is a mineral that appears underground in small cubical formations near sulfur springs and volcanically active areas. Growing in small clumps no larger than a person’s fist, it has an oily feel despite being dry, and leaves no residue. If it is hit by anything hard, this ordinary-looking material immediately begins to glow and give off mild heat.

Starstone is often powdered and mixed with sulfur and other ingredients to manufacture the flash powder used in flashglobes. Its strong illuminative qualities affect darkvision and low-light vision in particular, making it useful for decoration and as a diversion.

Steel, Chthonic (3pp)

Source: 101 Special Materials and Power Components (3pp)

HP/inch: 25; Hardness: 15; Cost: ammunition +15 gp per missile, armor and shields +2,500 gp, weapon +750 gp, other items +500 gp/lb.

A scarce metal, the secret of its creation is guarded with a fatal zealousness. This material is primarily mixed with iron and is found as a natural red-orange ore amidst veins of mosaic glass. Naturally brittle, it is hardened by dousing it in a true dragon’s blood during its forging. The finished metal has a gold-red hue with an orange, reflective shine.

Chthonic steel has several valuable qualities, including ease of enchantment, its natural sharpness, and the power to absorb magic missiles. Chthonic steel always retains its edge, even when abused, granting it a +2 bonus to the critical conformation roll of any slashing or piercing weapon it is forged into. Chthonic armor and shields negate magic missile spells that target the wearer in a manner similar to the shield spell. Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of this special material. Ammunition made from this special material has an increased market price of 15 gp per missile, armor and shields 2,500 gp, weapons 750 gp, and all other items by +500 gp per pound. Chthonic steel reduces the creation cost of magic arms and armor made with it by 10%.

Steel, Stainless (3pp)

Source: PSCS (3pp)

Stainless steel is both rust resistant and splendidly shiny. Steel objects electroplated with chromium are immune to rusting effects, such as the rusting grasp spell or from a rust monster’s touch. To determine the price of a stainless steel item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of that item. Stainless steel has the same statistics as normal steel.

Uliun (3pp)

Source: Godmetals of Porphyra (3pp)

This rust-red metal is a liquid at all temperatures. All attempts to force this metal to behave like a traditional forging metal have led all those that have attempted into madness. As most smiths are unable to forge anything from its swirling form, users of uliun favor it as a supplementary magical component. Uliun is associated with enchantment magic and reckless love.

Used as an additional material component, a dose of uliun increases the effective level of a spell by +1, as if it were being modified by the Heighten Spell feat. In order to function as an additional material component, the spellcaster must use a number of doses of uliun equal to the spell’s level—additional uliun used beyond this amount does nothing. The use of uliun is not without price. Each dose of uliun requires a DC 12 Fort save, adding +1 to the save DC for multiple doses. Failing the save does either 1 point of Con or Wis damage, a 50% chance of each.

As a martial application, uliun can be used as a holy water that damages creatures of the lawful subtype. Uliun is also detected by detect chaos spell as having a faint chaotic aura.

Uliun costs 200 gp per dose.

Umbrite (3pp)

Source Underdark Adventure Guide (3pp)

Material	Cost Modifier	Benefit

Umbrite	x300	+3 Stealth bonus

Umbrite is a dark, dense metal of surprising hardness. While umbrite is no match for the hardness of mithral or adamantine, it is stronger than steel and easily among the most durable metals known. Beyond its capable performance as a metal, umbrite is remarkable for its light-absorbing qualities.

Umbrite seemingly absorbs light at a slow rate, causing shadows around it to deepen considerably. In fact, veins of umbrite are often located by noting areas incurring a sudden loss of light.

Strangely, umbrite is a relatively new discovery, having first been written about within the last 200 years. When the first reports of this material were made, they were dismissed as hallucinations produced by the subterranean gases. This may be one reason umbrite has remained unknown for so long. Umbrite is only found during mining operations for other ores or rare gems, and even more curiously, only in the deepest and darkest locales where few civilized folk venture. One drow archmage has theorized that umbrite may well be a new material. Its appearance and location may be linked with the little-known fact that it only appears near large concentrations of the strange radiations that are said to power many of the enchantments of the drow. Other learned folk have speculated that umbrite might be seepage from the plane of shadow. Many agree with this theory, since umbrite is only found in places of deepest darkness.

Miners have long maintained that umbrite is an unlucky material and bodes ill. Stories abound of miners disappearing frequently after a vein of umbrite has been uncovered. Miners have considered it a nuisance material for decades, since until recently it was impossible to forge umbrite into any useful product.

Duergar apparently possess a process that allows the forging of umbrite. The underdark races have begun vying to learn this secret and, more importantly, to gain control of umbrite mines of their own. Umbrite-forged items are immensely expensive. A forged umbrite item weighing 1 pound or more retains much of its light-absorbing properties. While wielding any umbrite item of 1 pound or more, the user gains a +3 circumstance bonus to all Hide checks. Shadows around him seem to be deeper and darker. This affects a 5-foot area around the wielder and does not extend to others.

Vulcanized Rubber (3pp)

Source: PSCS (3pp)

Vulcanized Rubber has numerous uses in contemporary arms and armor fabrication. Objects wholly constructed from or objects completely coated in vulcanized rubber are immune to electricity damage.

Against a target wearing rubber-coated armor or rubber clothing, electricity effects either receive a -10 penalty to attack rolls, or the DC to resist or reduce the effects of electricity attacks is lowered by 10. If an electricity effect would deal reduced damage on a successful save, the target wearing rubber-coated armor instead takes no electricity damage. If an electricity effect would deal electricity damage to a target wearing rubber-coated armor, the armor confers to its wearer electricity resistance 10. Shields coated in vulcanized rubber confer no additional protection to its wielder.

When using vulcanized rubber ammunition, a ranged weapon inflicts nonlethal damage. Bludgeoning weapons made primarily of vulcanized rubber also deal nonlethal damage and are sometimes flexible enough to wrap beneath clothes (+1 on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the weapon). Typically, vulcanized rubber ammunition and weapons deal no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher.

Objects constructed primarily of vulcanized rubber weigh half as much as their normal counterparts, have 10 hit points per inch of thickness, and hardness 3. Objects coated in vulcanized rubber weigh 1.2 times as much as their normal counterparts, but otherwise have the same hit points and hardness of their base material.

Waterwood (3pp)

Source: Treasures of Freeport (3pp)

HP/inch 10; Hardness 5; Cost: 50 gp/lb.

The dark brown wood of the cypress-like waterwood tree that grows in groves in saltwater pools and at the sea’s edge is a valuable commodity. Although no stronger than normal wood, its ability to withstand the corrosive effects of seawater make it a prized possession of aquatic races. Waterwood is not subject to the normal rotting effects of other wood when submerged in seawater. Out of seawater, however, it begins to dry out, losing its elasticity and becoming more brittle. Unless placed into seawater for at least 1 hour every 24 hours, waterwood will dry out irreversibly (hardness 2, hp 5/in. when dry). Many aquatic races make use of waterwood and claim sea shore groves as part of their lands. This, plus the fact that the wood must be submerged in water every 24 hours, has kept waterwood from becoming a more common commodity. Although one would think it to be ideal for sea-going vessels, the extra expense and danger of obtaining the wood plus the fact that it is no more resistant to barnacles than ordinary wood has kept it from finding widespread use.

Whale Sinew (3pp)

HP/inch 3; Hardness 1; Cost: 2 gp/lb.

Harvested from slain whales, whale sinew is often used as a rope substitute in northern or arctic regions. Whale sinew deteriorates over time in water and thus is no better in that environment than ordinary rope.
