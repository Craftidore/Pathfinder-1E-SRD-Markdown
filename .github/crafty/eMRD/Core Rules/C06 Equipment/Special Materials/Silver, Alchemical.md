# Silver, Alchemical
## Overview
A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes.

On a successful attack with a silvered slashing or piercing weapon, the wielder takes a –1 penalty on the damage roll (with a minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn’t work on rare metals such as [[Adamantine|adamantine]], [[Iron, Cold|cold iron]], and [[Mithral|mithral]].

Alchemical silver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.


| **Type of Alchemical Silver Item** | **Item Cost Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Ammunition | +2 gp |
| Light weapon | +20 gp |
| One-handed weapon, or one head of a double weapon | +90 gp |
| Two-handed weapon, or both heads of a double weapon | +180 gp |
