# Soarwood
## Overview
Rare even in the abundant forests of Aerenal of Eberron, soarwood possesses a magical buoyancy. Ships made from soarwood skim effortlessly over the surface of the water. Soarwood is a necessary component of the airships and elemental galleons manufactured by House Orien and House Cannith of Eberron.

The speed of a boat or ship made from soarwood is double that of an equivalent boat made from ordinary wood, and the cost is four times normal.

Soarwood has the same physical characteristics as normal wood (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness), but weighs only 75% as much.

**Hardness:** Soarwood has a hardness of 5 and 10 hp/inch of thickness.

**Price:** Anything made of soarwood costs 4x as much as normal.

| Soarwood galley | 120,000 gp | — |
| Soarwood keelboat | 12,000 gp | — |
