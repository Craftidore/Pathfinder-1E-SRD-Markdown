# Obdurium
## Overview
Obdurium is a pale violet metal which is harder than [[Adamantine|adamantine]]. This incredibly rare metal represents the pinnacle of nonmagical metal strength. It is also extraordinarily expensive, costing ten times as much as carving stone walls and sixty times what a normal wooden wall would cost to build. 

Treat weapons and armor crafted from obdurium as [[Adamantine|adamantine]], except for hardness (30), hit points (60 per inch of thickness, or twice as many hit points as a typical item), and price (twice the listed price for [[Adamantine|adamantine]]).

HP: 60 per inch of thickness; Break DC: 48 + 4 per inch of thickness.
