# Glassteel
## Overview
**Glassteel:** Made by elves in an alchemical process requiring extensive knowledge of both metallurgy and glassblowing, glassteel combines strength beyond iron with the transparency of glass. Mostly used as a building material in fantastic castles, glassteel can also be fashioned into weapons and armor. Glassteel is stronger and lighter than iron—but it’s fantastically expensive.

Just as does [[Adamantine|adamantine]], glassteel grants a nonmagical enhancement (alchemical material) bonus to weapons and armor made with it. And like [[Mithral|mithral]], glassteel armor counts as one category lighter (although light armor is still light), spell failure chance is decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3. Nonweapon and nonarmor items made of glassteel weigh half what they otherwise would.

Glassteel weapons and armor are hard to spot at a distance (–4 penalty on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks), but just because armor is transparent doesn’t mean that the person underneath the armor is likewise concealed. In combat, glassteel’s transparency is mostly a decorative curiosity rather than a tactical advantage.

Glassteel has a hardness of 20 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness. Weapons and armor fashioned from glassteel are treated as masterwork items with regard to creation times, but the masterwork quality does not affect the enhancement bonus of weapons nor the armor check penalty of armor.
