# Tactical Feats
## Overview
**Tactical Feats**

Feats with the tactical descriptor allow characters to perform a number of powerful maneuvers.

If you're playing a character who wants to use a tactical feat, it's your responsibility to keep track of the actions you're performing as you set up the situation that the feat enables you to benefit from.
