# Reserve Feats
## Overview
**Reserve Feats**

Complete Mage presents a new category of feat: reserve feats. These feats are usable only by spellcasters, and they employ an unusual form of prerequisite. Reserve feats draw upon the magic inherent in a caster's body and soul, utilizing (but not consuming) energy from available spells to augment the character's already prodigious magical talents.

Each reserve feat's primary benefit is a supernatural ability usable at will. Unless stated otherwise, it requires a standard action to activate and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a saving throw is allowed, the DC is equal to 10 + the level of the spell allowing the ability's use + the ability modifier you would apply to that spell's save DC. For example, if a wizard with a +3 Intelligence modifier and a reserved 3rd-level sonic spell succeeds on a touch attack using the [[Clap of Thunder (Feat)|Clap of Thunder]] reserve feat, she causes the target to make a successful DC 16 Fortitude save or be [[Deafened|deafened]].

In addition, each feat provides a caster level boost to a certain category of spells that applies at all times, regardless of whether the character has any spells left to cast.

The primary benefit can only be activated if the caster has a spell of an appropriate variety (of a particular school, subschool, or descriptor) available to cast. The definition of “available to cast” depends on whether the character prepares spells or casts spontaneously from a list of spells known.

A spellcaster who prepares spells each day (such as a wizard) must have an appropriate spell prepared and not yet cast that day. If the character has more than one appropriate spell prepared and uncast, she gains the benefit only from the highest-level spell; she can't gain multiple benefits, or stack benefits, by preparing more than one appropriate spell.

A spellcaster who does not need to prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) must know an appropriate spell and must have at least one unused spell slot of that spell's level or higher. If the character has more than one appropriate spell known, he gains the benefit only from the highest-level spell for which he has an unused spell slot of that level or higher.

If a spellcaster has spells from more than one class, only spell slots that could actually be used to cast the appropriate spell count toward granting this benefit. A bard/sorcerer who knows the appropriate spell only as a bard spell can't use his sorcerer spell slots to qualify for the reserve feat's primary benefit.

Once the spellcaster no longer has an appropriate spell available—either because of casting it, exhausting the appropriate spell slots, or a daily spell selection that does not include that spell—she can't use the feat's primary benefit until she once again has an appropriate spell available for casting. She retains the secondary benefit of the feat, however.

Only actual spells or spell slots allow the character to use the primary benefit of a reserve feat. Spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and extraordinary abilities—even if they mimic or duplicate an appropriate spell—do not qualify. Spells that do not have a descriptor until cast (such as the *summon monster* spells) can't be used to gain the primary benefit of a reserve feat.

A spellcaster can key two or more reserve feats off a single spell. For example, if a wizard had the Sickening Grasp and Winter's Blast feats, she could use both primary benefits of those feats if she had a single 3rd-level (or higher) necromancy cold spell prepared and not yet cast. The secondary boosts likewise stack; a spellcaster who has the [[Aquatic Breath (Feat)|Aquatic Breath]] and [[Drowning Glance (Feat)|Drowning Glance]] feats gains a +2 competence bonus when casting water spells.

Example: Consider the feat Mystic Backlash. In order to use the feat's primary benefit, a wizard must have an abjuration spell of at least 5th level prepared and not yet cast. As soon as she casts her last abjuration spell of 5th level or higher, or if she prepares no abjuration spells of 5th level or higher on a given day, she loses the primary benefit of the feat until she once again prepares an appropriate spell.

A sorcerer, on the other hand, need merely have an abjuration spell of 5th level or higher on his spells known list and at least one spell slot of the same level or higher unused for the day. As soon as he casts his last sorcerer spell of 5th level or higher, he loses the primary benefit of the feat until he readies his spells for the next day (or otherwise regains a spell slot of 5th level or higher).

A wizard can take a reserve feat as her bonus feat at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level, in place of a metamagic or item creation feat.

**Using Reserve Feats**

Reserve feats are designed to allow spellcasters to stretch their resources over a greater number of encounters. As long as you retain the appropriate spell or spells, you have unlimited access to one or more special abilities, many of which are useful in combat.

Effectively trading a single spell or spell slot for an at-will ability represents an entirely new direction for feats. At a glance the benefit appears extremely potent, and it is. The important distinction is that these feats, in general, don’t directly make you more powerful; instead, they allow you to extend your power over more encounters. This in turn allows the party to continue adventuring (rather than call it a day after your spell allotment is [[Exhausted|exhausted]]), which translates into the players having more fun.

A reserve feat shouldn’t make you appreciably more powerful in a single encounter, and it doesn’t make your most potent spells much better. In most cases, a reserve feat’s benefit compares to spells two or three levels below the spell kept in reserve. In essence, you get an unlimited low-level spell effect as long as you keep your “big gun” in reserve. This situation encourages tactical use of spell resources—for example, the decision whether to cast *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* now or save it for the next fight—without preventing you from doing something interesting every round. 

At higher levels, even if the power level of the feat’s benefit doesn’t compare well to your other spells, <u>don’t forget the other advantages that it offers. As supernatural abilities, these benefits don’t use components, so you can activate them even while bound or gagged. They can’t be countered or dispelled. Arcane spell failure chance does not apply, making the feats attractive to multiclass spellcasters who normally wear armor. Most important, they are unaffected by spell resistance.</u> All told, while a 9d6 burst of fire might not appear to measure up to the average 17th-level wizard’s spell complement, it might prove quite useful in any number of situations.
