# Vile Feats
## Overview
Vile feats were first introduced in the *Book of Vile Darkness*. Only intelligent characters of evil alignment can use vile feats. Vile feats are granted to characters at the behest of a powerful evil agency—a god, demon, or something similar. As such, vile feats are supernatural abilities rather than extraordinary abilities. Some DMs might also want to require a character who seeks a vile feat to perform a special ritual or make an actual bargain with a powerful creature of evil. The patron creature could even (at the DM’s discretion) have the ability to revoke the feat should the character displease it.
