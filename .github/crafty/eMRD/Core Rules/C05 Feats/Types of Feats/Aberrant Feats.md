# Aberrant Feats
## Overview
Unlike typical feats, aberrant feats manifest as physical changes to your character’s features (or as additions to your character’s appearance). These feats twist and reshape your form, and you become alien in appearance.

A character who has selected at least one aberrant feat gains an inhuman, unsettling presence. You take a –1 penalty on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]], Gather Information, [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], and wild empathy checks for every aberrant feat you possess (–2 with two feats, –3 with three feats, and so on).

Some aberrant feats have an additional cumulative effect based on your total number of aberrant feats. This accumulation increases as you gain additional aberrant feats. For example, a character with Aberration Blood who selects Durable Form gains 4 hit points (two for each aberrant feat he possesses). If he later selects Bestial Hide, he gains another 2 hit points (in addition to the normal benefit of Bestial Hide).
