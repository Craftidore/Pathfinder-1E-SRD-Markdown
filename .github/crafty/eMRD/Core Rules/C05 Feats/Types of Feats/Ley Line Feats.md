# Ley Line Feats
## Overview
**Ley Line Feats**

Eight feats are known to be specific to ley line use. Many of them are referred to as Nurian magic or Nurian feats, because ancient Nurian wizards were the first to understand ley line magic.

There has long been a suspicion that Nurian mages are somehow more in tune with the nature of raw magical power than others, and to a certain extent this suspicion is true. Some believe that the reason is their peculiar language, which is in some ways similar to Enochian, the celestial language. Others believe it has more to do with the way Nurian casters use ley lines in everyday spells, rather than merely in major ritual castings—this use of ley lines weakens the ley lines themselves while strengthening the caster’s spells.
