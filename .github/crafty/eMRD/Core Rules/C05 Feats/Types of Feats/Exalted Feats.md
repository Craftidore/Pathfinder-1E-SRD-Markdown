# Exalted Feats
## Overview
**Exalted Feats**

A character must have the DM’s permission to take an exalted feat. In many cases, a ritual must be performed; often this simply amounts to a character swearing a sacred vow, for example, in the presence of a celestial being. A character who willingly and willfully commits an evil act loses all benefits from all his exalted feats. She regains these benefits if she atones for her violations (see Sin and Atonement in Chapter 1 of the Book of Exalted Deeds ).

**Aura of Good:** A character with at least one exalted feat radiates an aura of good with a power equal to her character level (see the *[[Detect Good (Spell)|detect good]]* spell), as if she were a paladin or a cleric of a good deity.
