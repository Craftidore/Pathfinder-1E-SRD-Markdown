# Extra Finesse (Feat)
## Overview
You deal extra damage with light weapons because you know where to put the blade.

**Prerequisites:** [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]].

**Benefits:** You may apply your Dex modifier instead of applying your Str modifier when inflicting damage with a small  or light weapon or fencing blade that you use with the [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] feat.
