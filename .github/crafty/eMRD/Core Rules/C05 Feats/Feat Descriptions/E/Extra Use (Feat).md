# Extra Use (Feat)
## Overview
You can use any class ability one extra time per day.

**Prerequisite:** — 

**Benefit:** Once per day, you may use one of your class abilities without that use counting towards its daily limit of uses.

**Source:** Advanced Feats: Visions of the Oracle (Open Design), pg. 6

**GM Note**

*Author's Commentary*—When working on feats for a new class, one of the first things I look for are abilities that grant extra or extended uses. The oracle is chock full of limited abilities, but they are choices buried in choices, so addressing them individually would give you a feat with narrow appeal and utility. When faced with such a choice, I look for the broadest application possible.
