# Evolved Summoned Monster (Feat)
## Overview
The creatures you summon have evolved to have even greater abilities.

**Prerequisites**: Augmented Summoning, [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] (conjuration), ability to cast *[[Summon Monster I (Spell)|summon monster I]]*.

**Benefit**: Each time you cast a *summon monster* spell, you can select a 1-point evolution from those available to a summoner’s eidolon. Your summoned creature gains this evolution. The summoned creature must conform to any limitations of the evolution. (For instance, only a creature with a reach of 10 feet or more can have the pull evolution.) Evolutions that grant additional attacks or enhance existing attacks can be applied only to Medium or larger summoned creatures.

If you summon more than one creature with a single spell, only one creature gains this evolution.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional 1–point evolution for one of your summoned creatures. If you summon more than one creature, you can choose to apply all the evolutions to a single summoned creature, or split them between the creatures summoned.
