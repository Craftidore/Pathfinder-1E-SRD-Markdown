# Expert Aim (Feat)
## Overview
Years of practice have honed your skills with ranged weapons. You may attack with exacting precision.

**Prerequisites:** [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], base attack bonus +4 or higher.

**Benefit:** If you take the full attack action when using a device missile weapon (e.g. bow, crossbow), you may choose to make a single attack up to 30 ft. away using your Expert Aim. In addition to all other damage modifiers, apply your Dexterity bonus (if any) to damage.

This feat is ineffective against creatures immune to critical hits (e.g. constructs, elementals, oozes, plants and undead).

**Normal:** Your Dexterity bonus applies only to your attack roll.
