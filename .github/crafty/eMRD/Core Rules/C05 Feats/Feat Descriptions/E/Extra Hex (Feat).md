# Extra Hex (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned the secrets of a new hex.

**Prerequisite**: Hex class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain one additional hex. You must meet all of the prerequisites for this hex. If you are a shaman, it must

be a hex granted by your spirit rather than one from a wandering spirit.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another hex.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 147

**GM Note**

This version supercedes the Extra Hex feat from the Advanced Player's Guide
