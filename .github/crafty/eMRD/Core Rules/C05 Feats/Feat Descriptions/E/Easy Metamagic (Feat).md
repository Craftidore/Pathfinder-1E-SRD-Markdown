# Easy Metamagic (Feat)
## Overview
One of your metamagic feats is easier to use.

**Prerequisite:** Any other metamagic feat.

**Benefit:** Choose a metamagic feat you already have. When preparing or casting a spell modified by that feat, lower the spell-slot cost by one. You can never reduce the spell-slot cost below one level higher than the spell's actual level. For example, taking this feat for the [[Quicken Spell (Feat)|Quicken Spell]] feat reduces the spell slot cost of a quickened spell from four levels higher than the spell's actual level to three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat , you must choose a new metamagic feat.

**Source:** Dragon 325, pg. 62

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The feat specifically precludes using it to lower the spell-slot cost below one level higher than the spell's actual level; however, using other metamagic feats in conjunction with this feat to lower the spell-slot cost to the same level as the spell's actual level (metamagic adjustment +0) is not precluded. 

This ruling was taken from the WotC forums but unfortunately those cannot be linked.
