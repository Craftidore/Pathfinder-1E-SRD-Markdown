# Elfmarked (Feat)
## Overview
You have elven blood and can always access elven magic and bypass elven wards.

**Prerequisite: [[Elves and the Elfmarked of Midgard (Race)|Elfmarked]]**

**Benefit:** You count as both human and elf for any effects related to race. That is, you are considered both a human and an elf for the purpose of taking traits, feats, how spells and magic items affect you, and so on.
