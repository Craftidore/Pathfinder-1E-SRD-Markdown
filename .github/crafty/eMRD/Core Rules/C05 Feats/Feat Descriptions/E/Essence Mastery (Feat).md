# Essence Mastery (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the art of spell study and casting, learning whatever you can and making it your own.

**Prerequisites:** No ability score below 10, 15+ ranks in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) skill, 8+ ranks in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature), 8+ ranks in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion), 15+ ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] skill, any three metamagic feats, non-specialist wizard only.

**Benefit:** When learning a new spell, you may draw from any spell list, arcane, divine, or otherwise. No spell is beyond your abilities, so long as you have access to the scroll or spellbook. In the case of divine spells, a cleric or similar caster must transcribe the spell for you to learn from. If a spell is available to more than one spellcasting class, you may now learn it at the lowest level (with the exception of domain levels).

**Special:** The DM must approve any character taking this feat. Because of the tendency to violate the tenets of arcane and divine magic, this is a *very* powerful feat and should be taken with care.
