# Extra Panache (Feat)
## Overview
You have more panache than the ordinary swashbuckler.

**Prerequisite**: [[Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)|Amateur Swashbuckler]] or panache class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain two more panache points at the start of each day, and your maximum panache increases by two.
