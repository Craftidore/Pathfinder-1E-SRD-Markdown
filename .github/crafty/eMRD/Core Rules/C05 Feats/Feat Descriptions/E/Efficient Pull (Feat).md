# Efficient Pull (Feat)
## Overview
You can draw a composite bow with a heavier pull than you should be able to.

**Prerequisite:** [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]]

**Benefit:** When using a composite bow with a Strength rating, treat your Strength as if it were 2 points higher.

For example, you have a 15 Strength but a composite longbow with a +3 Strength rating. With this feat, you may use that bow without taking the usual -2 penalty on attack rolls and you gain the bow's full +3 bonus on damage rolls.

**Special:** A fighter may select Efficient Pull as one of his fighter bonus feats.
