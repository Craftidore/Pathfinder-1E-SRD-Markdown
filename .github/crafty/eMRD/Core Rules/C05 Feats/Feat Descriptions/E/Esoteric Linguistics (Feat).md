# Esoteric Linguistics (Feat)
## Overview
You can decipher even the most exotic of writings, including those that contain magic.

**Prerequisite**: [[Skill Focus (Feat)|Skill Focus]] ([[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]]).

**Benefit**: You can attempt a [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] check in place of a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check to activate a scroll, or in place of a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check to identify a scroll. You must still have (or emulate) the ability score required to cast a spell of the desired level, and you cannot use [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]] on the check to emulate the required ability score.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 146
