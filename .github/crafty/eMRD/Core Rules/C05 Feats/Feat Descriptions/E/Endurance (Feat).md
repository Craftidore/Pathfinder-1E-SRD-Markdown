# Endurance (Feat)
## Overview
Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you.

**Benefit**: You gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal damage from exhaustion; Constitution checks made to continue running; Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march; Constitution checks made to hold your breath; Constitution checks made to avoid nonlethal damage from starvation or thirst; Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments; and Fortitude saves made to resist damage from suffocation.

You may sleep in light or medium armor without becoming [[Fatigued|fatigued]].

**Normal**: A character without this feat who sleeps in medium or heavier armor is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] the next day.
