# Unarmored Specialist (Combat) (Feat)
## Overview
You are so well-trained at fighting without armor that you find yourself better protected without it.

**Benefit:** As long as you do not have any armor bonus to AC (such as from wearing armor, or from the spell *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]*) you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +4.
