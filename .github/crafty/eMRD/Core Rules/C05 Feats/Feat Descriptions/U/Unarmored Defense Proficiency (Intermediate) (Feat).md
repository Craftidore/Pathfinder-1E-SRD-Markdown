# Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Intermediate) (Feat)
## Overview
Your ability to defend yourself when unarmored has further improved.

**Prerequisites:** [[Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Beginner) (Feat)|Unarmored Defense Proficiency (Beginner)]]

**Benefits:** The bonus to your character's AC granted by the beginner version of this feat is replaced with the following chart:


| **Level** | **Bonus** |  | **Level** | **Bonus** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | +5 |  | 11 | +9 |
| 2 | +6 |  | 12 | +10 |
| 3 | +6 |  | 13 | +10 |
| 4 | +6 |  | 14 | +10 |
| 5 | +7 |  | 15 | +11 |
| 6 | +7 |  | 16 | +11 |
| 7 | +8 |  | 17 | +12 |
| 8 | +8 |  | 18 | +12 |
| 9 | +8 |  | 19 | +12 |
| 10 | +9 |  | 20 | +13 |

**Special:** This bonus is applied even when your character is caught [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] or is denied his Dex modifier to his AC.

This bonus is an increase to the character's base AC and thus is not named.
