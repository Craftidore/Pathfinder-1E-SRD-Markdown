# Research Anywhere (Feat)
## Overview
You are always thinking about  spells and how they can be crafted; this enables you to work in nearly any environment.

**Prerequisite:** [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 3 ranks, [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) 3 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can put in 4 hours/day of magical research while adventuring as if you were working in a comfortable and distraction free environment and receive 4 hours progress towards a research project.

**Normal:** While adventuring, you can dedicate only 4 hours to research and receive only 1 hour of progress from it.

*Commentary*â€”Having a character that wishes to do spell research in a campaign that involves back to back adventures can be frustrating since the research rules make it very impractical to do so on the road. I think this would be an essential feat for anyone who really wants to get the most out for their spellcasting characters (especially wizards).
