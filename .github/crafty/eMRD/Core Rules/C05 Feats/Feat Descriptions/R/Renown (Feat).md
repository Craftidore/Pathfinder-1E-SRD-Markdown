# Renown (Feat)
## Overview
Word of your pre-Pathfinder accomplishments precedes you, and you know how to make the most of your previous reputation.

**Benefit:** When in a settlement of 5,000 people or more, treat your Fame score as 2 higher for the purposes of qualifying for Prestige Awards or purchasing equipment. This feat doesnâ€™t grant you any additional Prestige Points.

**Normal:** Your Fame score is determined by the total number of Prestige Points earned over the course of your career.
