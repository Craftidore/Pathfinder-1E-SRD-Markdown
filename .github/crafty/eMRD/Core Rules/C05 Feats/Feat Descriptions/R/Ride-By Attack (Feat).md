# Ride-By Attack (Feat)
## Overview
While mounted and charging, you can move, strike at a foe, and then continue moving.

**Prerequisites**: [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] 1 rank, [[Mounted Combat (Feat)|Mounted Combat]].

**Benefit**: When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round canâ€™t exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.
