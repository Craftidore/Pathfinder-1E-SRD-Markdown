# Raging Blood (Feat)
## Overview
Your blood boils with latent energy, filling you with an intense fury.

**Prerequisite**: Eldritch Heritage or sorcerer bloodline class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain the 1st-level bloodrager bloodline power for your bloodline. In addition, you gain the ability to enter a state similar to (but less powerful than) a bloodragerâ€™s bloodrage. You can enter this lesser bloodrage twice per day, for up to 4 rounds. During this lesser bloodrage, you gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, and no morale bonus on Will saving throws. Otherwise, this benefit is the same as the bloodrage class feature.

If you have more than one bloodline, you choose the bloodline this applies to upon taking the feat.
