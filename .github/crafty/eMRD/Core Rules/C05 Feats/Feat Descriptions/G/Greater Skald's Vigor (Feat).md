# Greater Skald's Vigor (Feat)
## Overview
Your song and your enthusiasm invigorate your allies.

**Prerequisites**: [[Skald's Vigor (Feat)|Skald’s Vigor]], [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (song) 10 ranks.

**Benefit**: Your allies share in the fast healing granted by your [[Skald's Vigor (Feat)|Skald’s Vigor]], starting in the round when you begin your performance. They must be able to hear the performance. If you stop maintaining the song, the fast healing ends immediately, even if other effects of your song linger.
