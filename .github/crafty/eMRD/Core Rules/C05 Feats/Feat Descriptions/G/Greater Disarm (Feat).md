# Greater Disarm (Feat)
## Overview
You can knock weapons far from an enemyâ€™s grasp.

**Prerequisites**: [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]], base attack bonus +6, Int 13.

**Benefit**: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to disarm a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]]. Whenever you successfully disarm an opponent, the weapon lands 15 feet away from its previous wielder, in a random direction.

**Normal**: Disarmed weapons and gear land at the feet of the disarmed creature.
