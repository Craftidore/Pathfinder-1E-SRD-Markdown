# Greater Spell Focus (Feat)
## Overview
Choose a school of magic to which you have already applied the [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] feat. Any spells you cast of this school are very hard to resist.

**Prerequisite**: [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]].

**Benefit**: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select. This bonus stacks with the bonus from [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]].

**Special**: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school to which you already have applied the [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] feat.
