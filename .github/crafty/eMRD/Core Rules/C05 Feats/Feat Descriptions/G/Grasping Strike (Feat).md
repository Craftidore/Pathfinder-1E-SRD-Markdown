# Grasping Strike (Feat)
## Overview
The surrounding foliage lurches forth at your enemies in concert with your strikes.

**Prerequisites**: Nature Magic or the ability to cast druid or ranger spells; [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you use [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]] (or [[Improved Vital Strike (Feat)|Improved Vital Strike]] or [[Greater Vital Strike (Feat)|Greater Vital Strike]]), you cause the foliage in the area to reach out and entangle your foe (as the condition) if it fails a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier). The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the enemy breaks free with a successful Strength check or an [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check (DC = the effectâ€™s saving throw DC), whichever comes first.

You can use this benefit a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can choose to use this ability as a free action after you hit the enemy with the attack. This is a supernatural ability.
