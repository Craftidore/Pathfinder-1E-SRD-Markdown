# Greater Sunder (Feat)
## Overview
Your devastating strikes cleave through weapons and armor and into their wielders, damaging both item and wielder alike in a single terrific strike.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]], [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

**Benefit**: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to sunder an item. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Improved Sunder (Feat)|Improved Sunder]]. Whenever you sunder to destroy a weapon, shield, or suit of armor, any excess damage is applied to the item’s wielder. No damage is transferred if you decide to leave the item with 1 hit point.
