# Greater Combat Reflexes (Feat)
## Overview
You react to any drop in your opponents' guard with blinding speed.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15+, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Improved Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Improved Combat Reflexes]], base attack bonus +11

**Benefit:** For any given opportunity in melee combat, you can make three attacks of opportunity. The second attack is a -5 penalty, just like your second normal attack in any given round. The third attack is at a -10 penalty, just like your third normal attack in any given round. You still cannot exceed your normal maximum number of attacks of opportunity in a round.
