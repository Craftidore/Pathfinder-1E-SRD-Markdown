# Arcane Flourish (Feat)
## Overview
You use your magical abilities to improve your performance talents. By bleeding magical energy into your singing, oratory, or other abilities, you enhance the pitch and sound, project your voice with a more commanding tone, and so forth.

**Prerequisites:** [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] 4 ranks, arcane caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can expend a prepared spell or spell slot to grant your next [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check a competence bonus equal to 1 + the level of the spell or slot. You must make a check within 1 minute of using this feat, or the energy you expend dissipates with no effect.
