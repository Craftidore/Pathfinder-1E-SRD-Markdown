# Abbreviated Spellscript (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned an alternate method for recording your spells.

**Prerequisites:** Must record spells in a spellbook, Caster level 1+.

**Benefit:** Using a more efficient and compact script when writing spells into your spellbook, you record an entire spell on a single page. Doing so requires double the time it normally would.

**Normal:** A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level. Even a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. The process takes 1 hour per spell level. Cantrips (0 levels spells) take 30 minutes to record.

**Source:** The Mage's Tower
