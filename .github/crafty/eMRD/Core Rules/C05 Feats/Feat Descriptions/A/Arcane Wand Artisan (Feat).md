# Arcane Wand Artisan (Feat)
## Overview
You excel at the creation of magical wands.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], [[Exceptional Artisan (Feat)|Exceptional Artisan]], [[Extraordinary Artisan (Feat)|Extraordinary Artisan]], [[Legendary Artisan (Feat)|Legendary Artisan]], caster level 12th.

**Benefit:** You can create any wand whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.

Some wand sincur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the wand's base price.

Because you excel in the creation of magical wands, once you have calculated the final cost (to include the cost(s) of any special or costly material components and or XP cost) you divide it by half; this includes the time it takes to create it.

**Normal:** You can create any wand whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price.

Some wands incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the wand's base price.

**GM Note**
