# Advanced Homunculus (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at improving your [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]]. Whenever you increase the Hit Dice your [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]], you also instill within it special supernatural abilities.

.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]], [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) 4 ranks.

**Benefit:** As your [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] gains HD, its natural armor increases and it gains special abilities (see chart). Using the [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] feat to create a [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] causes it to gain these increases when you create it should you initially add more than just the base HD. Alternatively, you can improve an existing [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] of your creation (not one crafted by another using your blood) by performing a brief alchemical procedure. To do so, the crafter must purchase or create the necessary alchemical reagents and make a successful [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (DC equal to the DC of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check necessary to create such a [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] from scratch) if an alchemist or make a successful [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check (DC equal to the DC of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check necessary to create such a [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] from scratch) if an arcane caster such as a sorcerer or wizard.

All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specified, an ability can only be taken once.

Each time the [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. Doing so requires the expenditure of the necessary alchemical reagents and the necessary check. For example, an alchemist with a 6-HD [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] that has the clever special ability could change that to the evasion special ability when the [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]]’s Hit Dice were increased to 7.

A dangerous side effect of increasing the power and abilities of a master's [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] is that the damage the master sustains if the [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] is destroyed also increases; each special ability increases the damage by +1d10.

This feat applies to the character’s [[Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)|homunculus]] regardless of its type.

<sup>    3</sup> Does not include the value of the original scroll.

  <sup>4</sup> Per the Universal Monster Rules in PF Bestiary.

**Share Senses:** Unlike the spell *[[Share Senses (Spell)|share senses]],* this special ability allows for the simultaneous use of all all the homunculus senses including augmented ones it may possess by other means (cf. Advanced  Homunculus feat).

**Store Potion:** At the beginning of each day, the master of the homunculus can store a potion within the homunculus. This potion can be any potion usuable by the master or another. This potion does not take effect when it is first stored. Instead, the homunculus can use a standard action to deliver the effects of the potion to another. No homunculus can store more than one infusion at a time.

**Vessel:** Master retains Int, Wis and Cha scores, all class level abilities including weapon proficiencies  and spell-casting abilitiy, provided the homunculus has the Voice special ability. The master may return to his own body at will (to the range of the telepathic link). If his body is killed, he becomes the proud owner of a construct body, but he must roll a Will save (DC 10 + caster level + 1 per  homunculus special ability possessed) every month to keep his life force bound to it.

**Weapon Ability:** When this ability is granted, choose a weapon special ability, the homunculus’s natural weapons are treated as if they had this special ability. Must have Magic Fang or Greater Magic Fang ability as a prerequisite.

Increasing the HD of a homunculus also grants it an additional feat for every 2 HD of advancement.

**GM Note**

**Improved Homunculus (v3.5)**

You are adept at improving and modifying your homunculus. Whenever you advance your homunculus’s Hit Dice, you can also imbue it with special supernatural abilities

.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] or craft homunculus class feature, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (any) 6 ranks.

**Benefit:** Your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its HD (see chart). If you use the [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]] feat to construct a homunculus, it gets these abilities when you create it. If you use the craft homunculus class feature of the artificer class, your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its current HD, and additional natural armor or special abilities if you later increase its HD.

All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specified, an ability can only be taken once.

Each time the homunculus gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. For example, an artificer with a 4-HD homunculus that has the climber special ability could choose to give it sneak attack instead if the homunculus’s Hit Dice were increased to 5.

This feat applies to the character’s homunculus regardless of its type. For new types of homunculi, see Chapter 6 (of the *Magic of Eberron)*.

**Store Infusion:** At the beginning of each day, the artificer can store one infusion of up to 3rd level in the homunculus. This infusion must be one that the artificer could normally imbue the homunculus with. This infusion does not take effect when it is fi rst stored. Instead, the homunculus can use a standard action to imbue itself with the infusion. No homunculus can store more than one infusion at a time.

**Weapon Ability:** When this ability is granted, choose a weapon special ability with a base price modifier of “+1 bonus,” such as *[[Ghost Touch (MagWpnSpcAb)|ghost touch]]**,* *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]*, or *[[Shock (MagWpnSpcAb)|shock]]*. The homunculus’s natural weapons are treated as if they had this special ability.
