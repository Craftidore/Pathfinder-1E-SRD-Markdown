# Agile Shield Fighter (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled in combining your shield bash attack with an armed strike. When you use your shield in unison with a weapon, your training allows you to score telling blows with both.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with shields, [[Improved Shield Bash (Feat)|Improved Shield Bash]], [[Shield Specialization (Feat)|Shield Specialization]].

**Benefit:** When making a shield bash and armed strike attack as part of a full attack action, you take a â€“2 penalty on each attack. These penalties replace the normal ones you incur for fighting with two weapons.

**Special:** A fighter can select Agile Shield Fighter as one of his fighter bonus feats.
