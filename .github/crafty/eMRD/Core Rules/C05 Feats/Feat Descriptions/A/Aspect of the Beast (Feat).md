# Aspect of the Beast (Feat)
## Overview
Whether by magic or a curse of your blood, some part of you is more beast than man.

**Prerequisite**: wild shape class feature, see Special.

**Benefit**: Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the feat, and then you cannot change it.

*Night Senses (Ex)*: If your base race has normal vision, you gain low-light vision. If your base race has low-light vision, you gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If your base race has darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.

*Claws of the Beast (Ex)*: You grow a pair of claws. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you are Small).

*Predatorâ€™s Leap (Ex)*: You can make a running jump without needing to run 10 feet before you jump. 

*Wild Instinct (Ex)*: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill checks.

**Special**: A character that has contracted lycanthropy can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites. A ranger who selects the natural weapon combat style can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites (even if he does not select Aspect of the Beast as a bonus feat).
