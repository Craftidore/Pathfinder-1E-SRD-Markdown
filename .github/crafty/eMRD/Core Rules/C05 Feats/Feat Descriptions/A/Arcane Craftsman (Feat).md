# Arcane Craftsman (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled in the crafting of magic items.

**Prerequisites:** Any item creation feat, arcane caster level 5+.

**Benefit:** When determining either the cost or time you need to craft any item, reduce it by 25%. At the time of this feat's selection, choose whether it will be applied to either the cost of the item's creation or how long it takes to complete it. 

**Special:** You may gain Arcane Artisan up to two times. The second time it is taken, it applies to the other option; it cannot be taken twice for the same benefit.
