# Animal Soul (Feat)
## Overview
Your close bond with an animal allows you to use magic that targets animals on yourself.

**Prerequisite**: Animal companion or mount class feature.

**Benefit**: You can allow spells and effects that affect animals, animal companions, and special mounts to affect you, even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of your type. For example, you could cast *[[Animal Growth (Spell)|animal growth]]* or *[[Reduce Animal (Spell)|reduce animal]]* on yourself, even though those spells normally affect only animals. An ally could cast *raise animal companion* on you to bring you back from the dead. An opponent could not cast *[[Charm Animal (Spell)|charm animal]]* or *[[Dominate Animal (Spell)|dominate animal]]* on you unless you chose to allow the spell to affect you as if you were an animal.
