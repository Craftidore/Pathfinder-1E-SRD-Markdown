# Allied Spellcaster (Feat)
## Overview
With the aid of an ally, you are skilled at piercing the protections of other creatures with your spells.

**Prerequisite**: Caster level 1st.

**Benefit**: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on level checks made to overcome spell resistance. If your ally has the same spell prepared (or known with a slot available if they are spontaneous spellcasters), this bonus increases to +4 and you receive a +1 bonus to the caster level for all leveldependent variables, such as duration, range, and effect.
