# Arcane Builder (Feat)
## Overview
You have an exceptional understanding of the theory behind creating magical items. 

**Prerequisites:** None

**Benefit:** Select one type of magic item (potions, wondrous items, and so on). You create items of this type 25% faster than normal, and gain a +4 bonus on [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks (or other checks, as appropriate) to craft items of this type. 

**Special:** You may select this feat multiple times; its effects do not stack. Each time you select this feat, it applies to a different type of magic item.

This feat is modeled after the [[Arcane Builder]] discovery from  Ultimate Magic, pg. 86,

**Source:** The Mage's Tower
