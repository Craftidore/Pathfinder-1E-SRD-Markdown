# Arcane Disciple (Feat)
## Overview
Choose a deity, and then select a domain available to clerics of that deity. You can learn to cast the spells associated with that domain as arcane spells.

**Prerequisites:** [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (religion) 4 ranks, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 4 ranks, able to cast arcane spells, alignment matches your deity’s alignment.

**Benefit:** Add the chosen domain’s spells to your class list of arcane spells. If you have arcane spellcasting ability from more than one class, you must pick which arcane spellcasting ability this feat applies to. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed for that feat.

You may learn these spells as normal for your class; however, you use Wisdom (rather than the normal ability for your spellcasting) when determining the save DC for the spell. In addition, you must have a Wisdom score equal to 10 + the spell’s level in order to prepare or cast a spell gained from this feat.

Each day, you may prepare (or cast, if you cast spells without preparation) a maximum of one of these domains spells of each level.

**Special:** You can take this feat more than once. Each time, you must select a different domain available to the same deity you chose the first time you selected the feat. For example, a character who chose [[Heironeous]] and the Good domain with his first selection could choose Law or War with successive selections of the same feat. He couldn’t choose Protection, since that domain isn’t available to clerics of [[Heironeous]].

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat fulfills the Domain: Magic requirement for the [[Dweomerkeeper (PrC)|Dweomerkeeper]] prestige class when you chose the Magic domain and a deity associated with it.
