# Arcane Tuning (Feat)
## Overview
Magical aptitude and skill allow you to subtly alter the power of certain magic items, such as wands or scrolls, to be more powerful.

**Prerequisite:** [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Whenever you use a magic item that uses spell completion or spell trigger activation (such as a scroll, staff, or wand), you increase any saving throw DCs associated with that item by +1.
