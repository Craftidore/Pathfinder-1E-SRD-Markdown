# Arcane Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You draw upon your arcane power to enhance your weapons with magical energy.

**Prerequisite**: Ability to cast arcane spells.

**Benefit**: As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons with a fraction of your power. For 1 round, your weapons deal +1 damage and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. For every five caster levels you possess, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

**Note:** This feat can be taken as a fighter bonus feat.
