# Storm Bolt (Feat)
## Overview
The electrical energy contained within your magic rages inside you, begging to be released.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have an electricity spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can fire a 20-foot line of electricity as a standard action. This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per level of the highest-level electricity spell you have available to cast.

A successful Reflex save halves damage.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting electricity spells.
