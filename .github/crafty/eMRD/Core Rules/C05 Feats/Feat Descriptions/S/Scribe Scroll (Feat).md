# Scribe Scroll (Feat)
## Overview
You can create magic scrolls.

**Prerequisite**: Caster level 1st.

**Benefit**: You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise scribing a scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To scribe a scroll, you must use up raw materials costing half of this base price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 of the *PF Core Rulebook* for more information.

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg.
