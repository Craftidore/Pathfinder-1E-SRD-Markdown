# Slashing Grace (Feat)
## Overview
You can stab your enemies with your sword or another slashing weapon.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] with chosen weapon.

**Benefit**: Choose one kind of one-handed slashing weapon (such as the [[Longsword|longsword]]). When wielding your chosen weapon one-handed, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing melee weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a swashbuckler’s or a duelist’s precise strike) and you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon’s damage. The weapon must be one appropriate for your size.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 156

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Feats such as Monkey Grip, which allow the user to wield an oversize weapon, make the oversized weapon wielded count as appropriate sized.
