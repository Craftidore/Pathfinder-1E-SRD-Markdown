# Stunning Critical (Feat)
## Overview
Your critical hits cause opponents to become stunned.

**Prerequisites**: [[Critical Focus (Feat)|Critical Focus]], [[Staggering Critical (Feat)|Staggering Critical]], base attack bonus +17.

**Benefit**: Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes [[Stunned|stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to [[Staggered|staggered]] for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.

**Special**: You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [[Critical Mastery (Feat)|Critical Mastery]].
