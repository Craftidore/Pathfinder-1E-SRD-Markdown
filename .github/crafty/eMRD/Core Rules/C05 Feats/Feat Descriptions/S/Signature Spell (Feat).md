# Signature Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You are so familiar with one spell that you can cast it even when you have other spells prepared.

**Prerequisites**: [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] or access to a cleric domain.

**Benefit**: Pick one spell you have taken [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]] with, or one spell from a domain you have access to, to be your signature spell. You can channel stored spell energy into your signature spell even if you haven’t prepared it ahead of time. You can cast your signature spell by “losing” a prepared spell of the same level or higher.

**Special**: This feat may be taken more than once. Each time it allows you to select a different signature spell.

**Signature Spell (v3.5)**

You are so familiar with a mastered spell that you can convert other prepared spells into that spell.

**Prerequisite:** [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]].

**Benefit:** Each time you take this feat, choose a spell you have mastered with [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]]. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of that spell’s level or higher into that signature spell, just as a good cleric spontaneously casts prepared spells as cure spells.

**Special:** You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new mastered spell.
