# Step Up (Feat)
## Overview
You can close the distance when a foe tries to move away.

**Prerequisite**: Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit**: Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.
