# Spiritual Guardian (Feat)
## Overview
Your spiritual guardians are more powerful than those of most others.

**Prerequisites**: Ability to cast *[[Spiritual Weapon (Spell)|spiritual weapon]]* or *spiritual ally*, spirit magic class feature.

**Benefit**: Whenever you cast *[[Spiritual Weapon (Spell)|spiritual weapon]]*, *spiritual ally*, or a similar spell that grants you a spiritual guardian, that guardian uses your shaman level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance as well as on damage rolls.
