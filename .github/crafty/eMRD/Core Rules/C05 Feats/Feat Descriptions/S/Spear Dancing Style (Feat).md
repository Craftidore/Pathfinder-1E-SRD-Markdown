# Spear Dancing Style (Feat)
## Overview
You can use polearms and spears as double weapons.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] with the chosen weapon.

**Benefit**: Choose one weapon from the polearm or spear fighter weapon groups. While using this style, you grant the chosen weapon the double special weapon feature, using the weaponâ€™s normal statistics for its main-hand end and the statistics of a [[Mace, Light|light mace]] for its off-hand end. A weapon wielded in this way loses the brace and reach special weapon features.

**Special**: A character with the weapon training (polearms or spears) class feature can use Spear Dancing Style with any polearm or spear, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
