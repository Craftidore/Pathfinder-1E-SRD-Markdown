# Silent Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You can cast your spells without making any sound.

**Benefit**: A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spellâ€™s actual level.

**Special**: Bard spells cannot be enhanced by this feat.
