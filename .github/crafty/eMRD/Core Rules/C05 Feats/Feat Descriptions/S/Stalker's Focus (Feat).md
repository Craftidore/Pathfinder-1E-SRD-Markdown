# Stalker's Focus (Feat)
## Overview
Your affinity to the natural world allows you to adopt the focus of a single animal.

**Prerequisites**: [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) 3 ranks, [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] 3 ranks, no levels in a class that has the animal focus class feature.

**Benefit**: Choose a single type of animal to emulate from the hunterâ€™s animal focus class feature. Once per day, you or your animal companion (if you have one) can gain the benefit of that animal focus for 1 minute. Treat your character level as your hunter level for the purpose of determining the benefits granted by your chosen animal focus.

**Special**: If you gain levels in a class that has the animal focus class feature, when you gain that feature you gain 1 additional minute of use each day of your animal focus class feature.
