# Shield Slam (Feat)
## Overview
In the right position, your shield can be used to send opponents flying.

**Prerequisites**: [[Improved Shield Bash (Feat)|Improved Shield Bash]], [[Shield Proficiency (Feat)|Shield Proficiency]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)|Two-Weapon Fighting]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull rush attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Chapter 8 of the *PF Core Rulebook*). This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked prone after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn.
