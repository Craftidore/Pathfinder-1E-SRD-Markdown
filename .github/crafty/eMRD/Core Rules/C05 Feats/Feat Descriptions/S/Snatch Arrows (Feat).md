# Snatch Arrows (Feat)
## Overview
Instead of knocking an arrow or ranged attack aside, you can catch it in mid-flight.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 15, [[Deflect Arrows (Feat)|Deflect Arrows]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]].

**Benefit**: When using the [[Deflect Arrows (Feat)|Deflect Arrows]] feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back as an attack against the original attacker (even though it isnâ€™t your turn) or kept for later use.

You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.
