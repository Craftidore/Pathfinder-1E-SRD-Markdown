# Spirit's Gift (Feat)
## Overview
You commune with a spirit of your choice, and it grants your animal companion or familiar a boon.

**Prerequisite**: Animal companion class feature or familiar class feature.

**Benefit**: At the start of the day, you can choose to commune with a single shaman spirit. (Although a shaman would need an hour of preparation, this takes you no time.) For the next 24 hours, that shaman spirit augments your animal companion or familiar, as its spirit animal ability.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 157
