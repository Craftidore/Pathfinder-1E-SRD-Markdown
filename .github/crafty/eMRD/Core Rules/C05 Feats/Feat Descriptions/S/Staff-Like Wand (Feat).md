# Staff-Like Wand (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned to use your own powers in conjunction with using a wand. 

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Staff (Feat)|Craft Staff]], [[Craft Wand (Feat)|Craft Wand]], wizard 11+

**Benefit:** Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if itâ€™s higher than the caster level of the wand.

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat duplicates the arcane discovery of the same name.
