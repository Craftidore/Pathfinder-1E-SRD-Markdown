# Silent Kill (Feat)
## Overview
You are quite adept at killing your prey without making noise or alerting others.

**Prerequisites**: [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] 12 ranks; assassinate advanced slayer talent or ninja master trick.

**Benefit**: When you kill a creature during a surprise round, you can attempt a [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] check, opposed by the [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks of potential observers, to prevent them from noticing your action and subsequently identifying you as the assailant. 

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 156
