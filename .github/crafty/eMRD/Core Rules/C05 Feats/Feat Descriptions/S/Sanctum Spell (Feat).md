# Sanctum Spell (Feat)
## Overview
Your spells are especially potent on home ground.

**Prerequisite:** Any metamagic feat.

**Benefit:** A sanctum spell has an effective spell level 1 higher than its normal level if cast in your sanctum (see below), but if not cast in the sanctum, the spell has an effective spell level 1 lower than normal. All effects dependent on spell level (including save DCs) are calculated according to the adjusted level.

A sanctum spell uses a spell slot of the spellâ€™s normal level.

**Special:** Your sanctum is a particular site, building, or structure previously designated by you, and no larger than 20 feet/level in diameter. The designated area must be a site where you have spent a cumulative period of at least three months. Though a sanctum can be designated within a larger structure, its special advantages do not apply beyond the maximum area. Once designated, it takes seven days for a site to become a sanctum, and if you designate a new area to be your sanctum, the benefits of the old one immediately fade.

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pg. 82

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* As written, this feat allows a spellcaster to prepare a higher level spell as a lower level spell. This is a very powerful ability! As an example, a wizard could prepare a *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell with diminished capabilities; however, this 4th-level *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]* spell could then be used to create a *wand of teleport.* This is an apparent violation of the rules but should be allowed as it is both a less capable version of the spell and also demonstrates resourcefulness on the part of the player.

*House Rule:* Further rules for creating/enhancing sanctums can be found in *Advanced Arcana Vol. IV* (Necromancers of the Northwest), Appendix 2: [[Places of Power_ Sanctums|Places of Power]].
