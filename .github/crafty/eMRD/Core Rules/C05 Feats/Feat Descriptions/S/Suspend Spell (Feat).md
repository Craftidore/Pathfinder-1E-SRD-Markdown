# Suspend Spell (Feat)
## Overview
Your control over spells that you cast upon yourself is such that you can delay their onset.

**Prerequisites:** 5th level caster.

**Benefit:** A suspended spell is delayed (for up to 24 hours or the next time the spellcaster prepares spells) until the caster uses a swift action to activate it. Upon activation, the duration of the spell begins normally. Only spells that affect the caster can be suspended. A suspended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
