# Synchronized Shot (Feat)
## Overview
You are extraordinarily talented at making ranged attacks past your allies.

**Prerequisite:** [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]].

**Benefit:** When making a ranged attack against a foe who has cover due to the position of your ally or allies, your ranged attacks ignore the Armor Class bonus granted to the target because of that cover. Cover from other sources is unaffected.

**Special:** A fighter can select Synchronized Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats

**Source:**** Heroes of Battle (WotC), pg. 96

.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat is renamed from Coordinated Shot to Synchronized Shot to avoid duplication.
