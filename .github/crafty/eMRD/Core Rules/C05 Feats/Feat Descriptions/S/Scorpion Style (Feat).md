# Scorpion Style (Feat)
## Overview
You can perform an unarmed strike that greatly hampers your target’s movement.

**Prerequisite**: [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]].

**Benefit**: To use this feat, you must make a single unarmed attack as a standard action. If this unarmed attack hits, you deal damage normally, and the target’s base land speed is reduced to 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier).
