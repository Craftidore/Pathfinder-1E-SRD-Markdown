# Strike of the Viper (Feat)
## Overview
You draw your weapon and strike a foe with blinding speed.

**Prerequisites:** Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +5, [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]].

**Benefit:** If you [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] a weapon to attack a [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] opponent, your weapon’s threat range is tripled. For example, using Strike of the Viper with a short sword, you threaten a critical hit on a roll of 15–20 instead of the normal 19–20; with a longbow, you threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18–20 instead of the normal 20.

**Special:** This feat requires drawing the weapon from its sheath in a sudden strike. As such, it cannot be performed more than once in the same encounter. The effect stacks with other feats like [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]], but not with any other effect that expands a weapon’s threat range (such as the *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]* spell).

A fighter may select Strike of the Viper as one of his fighter bonus feats.
