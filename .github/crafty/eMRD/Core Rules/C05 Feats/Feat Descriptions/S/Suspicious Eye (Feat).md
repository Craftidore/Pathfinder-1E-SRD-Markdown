# Suspicious Eye (Feat)
## Overview
You are always on the lookout for treachery and wrongdoing, like many of the other people from [[Cudgel District (Sasserine)|Cudgel District]].

**Region:** [[Cudgel District (Sasserine)|Cudgel District]] of [[Sasserine]].

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill checks. In addition, the DC to take an object from you through the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] skill is increased to 25. You still receive the normal opposed Spot skill check to notice the attempt, and if you make this Spot check, you may immediately make an attack of opportunity on the target who was attempting to pick your pocket. If someone attempts the feint combat maneuver on you, you gain a +4 bonus on your [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] check to avoid the feint.

**Normal:** The DC to take an object from a character through the [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] skill is 20.
