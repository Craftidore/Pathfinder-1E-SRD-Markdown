# Spear Wind (Feat)
## Overview
You have studied the spear wind combat style, allowing you to attack with unusual speed.

**Prerequisites:** Elf, Dex 13, [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (any spear), base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** You can make one extra melee attack per round with one spear for which you have taken [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]]. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in the round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a â€“3 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.

**Special:** A fighter may select Spear Wind as one of his fighter bonus feats.

**Source:** Advanced Race Codex Elves (Green Ronin), pg. 15

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat is known as the Spear Wave feat amongst aquatic races that use it.
