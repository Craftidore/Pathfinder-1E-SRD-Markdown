# Spell Mantle (Feat)
## Overview
You can create a mantle from the contingent spells you carry.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Contingent Spell (Feat)|Craft Contingent Spell]], [[Knowledge (Domain)|Knowledge]] (arcana) 5 ranks, [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) 2 ranks.

**Benefit:** You can use a standard action to activate a particular contingent spell you carry as a spell-like ability, even if the conditions specified for its activation have not been met.

**Normal:** When you create a contingent spell, you must specify a condition or event that will trigger the effect, much like the *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* spell.
