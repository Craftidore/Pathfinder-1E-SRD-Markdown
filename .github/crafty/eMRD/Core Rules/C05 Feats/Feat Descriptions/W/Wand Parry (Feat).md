# Wand Parry (Feat)
## Overview
You can use your wand as a weapon.

**Benefit:** As long as you are holding a wand, you count as wielding a weapon for the purposes of providing allies with flanking. Additionally, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC. Finally, you can draw on the wandâ€™s power in order to allow it to deflect incoming attacks for you. As a move action, you can expend a charge from the wand in order to increase this shield bonus to +4 until the beginning of your next turn.
