# Wand Casting (Feat)
## Overview
You can cast spells with a wand in your hand, augmenting spells of the same school.

**Prerequisite:** Dex 13, 3 ranks in [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]]

**Benefit:** You may perform somatic components with a hand holding a wand. In addition, if you cast a spell of the same school as the wand, you may expend a charge from the wand to add a +1 bonus to the DC of the spell cast.

**Source:** Advanced Feats: Visions of the Oracle (Open Design), pg. 10

**GM Note**

*Author's Commentary*—I’ve always been fond of the notion that staffs and wands could aid casting or even be a means of casting. I felt the convenience of casting with a wand in hand was not quite worth a feat, so I added the more powerful DC bonus option to round it out.
