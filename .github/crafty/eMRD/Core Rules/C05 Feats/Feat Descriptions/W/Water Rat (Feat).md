# Water Rat (Feat)
## Overview
Most of [[Azure District (Sasserine)|Azure District]]â€™s citizens learn to swim at a very early age, and take to the water as easily as land.

**Region:** [[Azure District (Sasserine)|Azure District]] of [[Sasserine]]

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] checks. When wearing light or no armor and not encumbered, [[Fatigued|fatigued]], or [[Exhausted|exhausted]], you can swim at one-half your speed as a move action or your full speed as a full-round action. While swimming, you gain a +2 bonus on Initiative checks.

**Normal:** Without the benefits of this feat, a character swims at one-quarter his speed as a move action or at one-half speed as a full-round action.
