# Wand Adept (Feat)
## Overview
You know how to get the most out of a spell cast from a wand.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 2nd-level spells, or [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you cast a spell from a wand, increase the spell’s caster level by 2, up to a maximum amount equal to your Hit Dice. If you are able to cast 5th-level spells, or have 10 or more ranks in [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]], then increase the spell’s caster level by 4, instead (it still cannot exceed your Hit Dice).
