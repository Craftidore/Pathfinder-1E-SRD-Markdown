# Two-Weapon Fighting (Feat)
## Overview
You can fight with a weapon wielded in each of your hands. You can make one extra attack each round with the secondary weapon.

**Prerequisite**: Dex 15.

**Benefit**: Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6. See Two-Weapon Fighting in Chapter 8 of the *PF Core Rulebook*.

**Normal**: If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a –6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your offhand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light.
