# Turn Undead (Feat)
## Overview
Calling upon higher powers, you cause undead to flee from the might of your unleashed divine energy.

**Prerequisites**: Channel positive energy class feature.

**Benefit**: You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if [[Panicked|panicked]]. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).
