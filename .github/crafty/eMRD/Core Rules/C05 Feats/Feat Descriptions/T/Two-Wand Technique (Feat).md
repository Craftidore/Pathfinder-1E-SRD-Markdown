# Two-Wand Technique (Feat)
## Overview
You can activate one wand in each hand as a single action.

**Prerequisite:** Dex 15, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5+ ranks 

**Benefit:** You may activate up to two wands with a single standard action provided you hold each in a different hand.

**Special:** If one of the wands casts a spell with a casting time longer than 1 action, you activate both wands in the time needed for the longest casting time of the two wands.

**Source:** Complete Advanced Feats (Open Design), pg. 37

**GM Note**

*Author's Commentary*—Keep in mind it takes some actions (usually) to get those wands into your hands in the first place, and with your hands full, you cannot cast spells (normally) with somatic components.
