# Tower Shield Proficiency (Feat)
## Overview
You are trained in how to properly use a tower shield.

**Prerequisite**: [[Shield Proficiency (Feat)|Shield Proficiency]].

**Benefit**: When you use a tower shield, the shield’s armor check penalty only applies to Strength and Dexterity-based skills.

**Normal**: A character using a shield with which he is not proficient takes the shield’s armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all skill checks that involve moving, including [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]].

**Special**: Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
