# Child of the Shadow (Feat)
## Overview
You were raised in the streets and back alleys of [[Shadowshore (Sasserine)|Shadowshore]] and have refined several talents and tricks valuable to survival in this neighborhood.

**Region:** [[Shadowshore (Sasserine)|Shadowshore]] District of [[Sasserine]].

**Benefit:** You know [[Sasserine]]’s black market quite well, and need not make checks to locate its outlets. Further, in other cities, you have a knack for rooting out the underground markets. You gain a +2 bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (and Gather Information in 3.5 games) checks made to learn about a city’s black markets.

Growing up on the filthy streets of [[Shadowshore (Sasserine)|Shadowshore]] has also gifted you with several tricks you can use to ensure survival. You gain a +2 bonus on Initiative checks in urban environments. You are also adept at fighting in confined areas, such as narrow city alleyways or crowded taprooms. Enemies cannot gain cover from you if they are in your reach; you can thus attack someone around a corner without penalty. A creature with total cover from you still recieves all benefits of his cover.
