# Combat Intuition (Feat)
## Overview
Your keen understanding of your opponent’s moves and your instinctive feel for the flow of combat enable you to shrewdly assess your opponent’s combat capabilities.

**Prerequisites:** [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] 4 ranks, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit:** As a free action, you can use [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] to assess the challenge presented by a single opponent in relationship to your own level/Hit Dice (see the assess opponent option under the [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] skill). You gain a +4 bonus on such checks and narrow the result to a single category.

In addition, whenever you make a melee attack against a creature that you made a melee attack against during the previous round, you gain a +1 insight bonus on your melee attack rolls against that creature.

**Special:** A fighter may select Combat Intuition as one of his fighter bonus feats.
