# Collegiate Wizard (Feat)
## Overview
You have undergone extensive training in a formal school for wizards.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, wizard level 1st. 

**Benefit:** You begin play with knowledge of six 1st-level spells plus 1 per point of Intelligence modifier. Each time you gain a wizard level, you may add four spells to your spellbook without additional research. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) checks. 

**Normal:** 1st-level wizards begin play with knowledge of three 1st-level spells, and can add two spells per level to their spellbooks.

**Special:** You can take this feat only as a 1st-level character. 

**Source:** Complete Arcane (WotC), pg. 181

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The special requirement of taking this feat only at 1st level means the first level of wizard, not necessarily the first 'character' level. This would allow a character to begin as a rogue for example, then upon acquiring sufficient wealth, multiclass over to 1st level wizard after attending a magical university.

*House Rule:* This feat does stack with the [[Arcane Understanding (Feat)|Arcane Understanding]] feat with regard to additional 1st-level spells gained per point of Intelligence modifier.
