# Covering Defense (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at protecting yourself and your allies with your shield.

**Prerequisites**: [[Shield Focus (Feat)|Shield Focus]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: When you use the total defense action while using a light, heavy, or tower shield, you can provide a cover bonus to AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or smaller. This cover bonus is equal to your shieldâ€™s shield bonus and lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Your shield does not provide a cover bonus to Reflex saves.
