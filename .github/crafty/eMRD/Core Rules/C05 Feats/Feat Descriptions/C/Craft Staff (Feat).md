# Craft Staff (Feat)
## Overview
You can create magic staves.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 11th.

**Benefit:** You can create any staff whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a staff takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a staff, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price. A newly created staff has 10 charges. See the magic item creation rules in (Chapter 15 of the Core Rulebook 1) for more information.
