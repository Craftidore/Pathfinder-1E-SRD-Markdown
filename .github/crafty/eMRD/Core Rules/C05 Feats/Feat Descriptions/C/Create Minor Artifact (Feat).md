# Create Minor Artifact (Feat)
## Overview
You can create magic items that are imbued with powers beyond that of most crafters.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], any four other item creation feats, caster level 17.

**Benefit:** Minor artifacts are magic items—often but not always wondrous items—that are beyond the ability of most mortals to create. Your penultimate skill in crafting allows you to do so.
