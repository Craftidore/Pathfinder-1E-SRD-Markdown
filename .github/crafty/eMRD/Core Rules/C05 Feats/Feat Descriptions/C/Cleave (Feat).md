# Cleave (Feat)
## Overview
You can strike two adjacent foes with a single swing.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a â€“2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.
