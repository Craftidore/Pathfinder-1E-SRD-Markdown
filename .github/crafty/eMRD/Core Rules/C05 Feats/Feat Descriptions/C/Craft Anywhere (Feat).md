# Craft Anywhere (Feat)
## Overview
You are always tinkering and can work in nearly any environment.

**Prerequisite:** Any item creation feat.

**Benefit:** You can put in a full 8 hours/day of magic item crafting while adventuring as if you were working in a comfortable and distraction free environment.

**Normal:** While adventuring, you can dedicate only 4 hours to crafting and receive only 1 hour of progress from it.

*Commentary*â€”Having a character with crafting feats in a campaign that involves back to back adventures can be frustrating since the crafting rules make it very impractical to craft on the road. I think this would be an essential feat for anyone who really wants to get the most out for their item creation feats.
