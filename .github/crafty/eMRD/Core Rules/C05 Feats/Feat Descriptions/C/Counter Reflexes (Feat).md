# Counter Reflexes (Feat)
## Overview
Your opponentâ€™s advanced training in moving around you is surpassed only by your readiness for it.

**Prerequisites**: [[Anticipate Dodge (Feat)|Anticipate Dodge]], [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]]; base attack bonus +9, brawler level 6th, or monk level 6th.

**Benefit**: Opponents with the [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]] feat do not gain the dodge bonus granted by that feat when they provoke attacks of opportunity by moving out of or within your threatened area.
