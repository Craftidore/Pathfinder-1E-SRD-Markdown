# Childlike (Feat)
## Overview
Your resemblance to a human child tends to make others trust you, perhaps more than they should.

**Prerequisites**: Cha 13, halfling.

**Benefit**: You can take 10 on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks to convince others you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear innocent. You gain a +2 bonus on [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] skill checks to pose as a human child, and ignore the check penalties for disguising yourself as a different race and age category while doing so.

**Source:** Advanced Player's Guide, pg. 156
