# Combat Familiar (Feat)
## Overview
Your familiar is skilled in delivering attack spells against your foes. It flits past their defenses to discharge its spell without leaving itself vulnerable to attack.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane caster level 1st, familiar.

**Benefit:** If your familiar holds the charge for a touch spell, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity for entering an opponentâ€™s square.

**Source:** Player's Handbook II (WotC), pg. 76
