# Craft Construct (Feat)
## Overview
You can create construct creatures like golems.

**Prerequisites**: Caster level 5th, [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]].

**Benefit**: You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
