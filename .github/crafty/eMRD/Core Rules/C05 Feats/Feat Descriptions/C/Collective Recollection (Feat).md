# Collective Recollection (Feat)
## Overview
You and your allies can quickly jog each other’s memories to remember essential facts.

**Benefit:** When an ally who also has this feat attempts a trained [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill check while within 30 feet of you, you may attempt an aid another check as a free action to improve that ally’s skill check. You must have at least 1 rank in the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill to be aided in order to use this feat. If you succeed at the aid another check, you automatically know any information your ally gains from the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check as if you had rolled the [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check. Whether or not your aid another check is successful, you cannot attempt a [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check to determine the same information as your ally after using this feat.
