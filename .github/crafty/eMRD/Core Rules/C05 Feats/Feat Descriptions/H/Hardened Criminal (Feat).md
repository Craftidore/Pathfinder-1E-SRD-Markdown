# Hardened Criminal (Feat)
## Overview
You’ve done hard time on the unforgiving streets. You know how to knuckle down and get the caper done regardless of the obstacles, and your steely gaze can meet anyone’s eye without flinching.

**Prerequisite:** [[Iron Will (Feat)|Iron Will]].

**Benefit:** You cannot be intimidated. (Attempts to use the [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill against you always fail.) In addition, you can take 10 on any checks with one skill chosen at the time you take this feat, even under conditions when taking 10 would normally be impossible.
