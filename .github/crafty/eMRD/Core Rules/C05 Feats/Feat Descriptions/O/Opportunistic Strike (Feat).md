# Opportunistic Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You may strike twice when opportunity presents itself.

**Prerequisite:** Dex 15, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Improved Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Improved Combat Reflexes]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** For any attack of opportunity, you may strike twice with both strikes counting as a single attack of opportunity. The first strike is at a -5 penalty, just like your second normal attack in any given round. You may not use Opportunistic Strike against the same opponent more than once in a round.

**Normal:** You strike once at an opponent during an attack of opportunity.

**Special:** N/A

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat was originally presented in Polyhedron #59 as Improved Combat Reflexes. It has been updated for Pathfinder (and v3.5) and renamed to avoid confusion with an existing feat.
