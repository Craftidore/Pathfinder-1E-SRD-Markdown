# Monument Builder (Feat)
## Overview
Your inspired architecture (and construction skills) shall make your name immortal.

**Prerequisite:** [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) 1 rank, and you must have built a structure (or vehicle) worth at least 5,000 gp.

**Benefit:** When you supervise a construction project or do the construction yourself, reduce your raw material costs by 10%. You gain a +2 bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering), this bonus increases to +4.

**Goal:** Design and construct a building (or vehicle) worth at least 100,000 gp with great personal significance to you. For example, you might construct a new temple for your god on the site where an old temple was destroyed, or an academy for students to unlock the secrets of the universe.

**Completion Benefit:** The value of any past and future buildings (or vehicles) you construct (including the building (or vehicle) constructed to achieve your goal) increases by 10% as your reputation spreads. In addition, you and your workers complete double the normal amount of work in a given time interval when you supervise a construction project.
