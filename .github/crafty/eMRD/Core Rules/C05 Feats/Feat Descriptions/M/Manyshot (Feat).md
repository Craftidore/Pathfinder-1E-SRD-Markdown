# Manyshot (Feat)
## Overview
You can fire multiple arrows at a single target.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 17, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point-Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Shot (Feat)|Rapid Shot]], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger’s favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.
