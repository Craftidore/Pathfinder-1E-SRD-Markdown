# Magical Artisan (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the method of creating a certain kind of magic item.

**Prerequisite:** Any item creation feat.

**Benefit:** Choose one item creation feat that you possess. When you make an item with that feat, you pay only 75% of the normal cost to create the item.

**Special:** You may gain Magical Artisan multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new item creation feat.

**Source:** Player's Guide to Faerun (WotC), pg. 41

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Per WotC forums (and errata) this feat does work in conjunction with other feats that apply a bonus to magical crafting (cf. [[Extraordinary Artisan (Feat)|Extraordinary Artisan]]). The bonus for this feat is applied first then that from the other feat(s).
