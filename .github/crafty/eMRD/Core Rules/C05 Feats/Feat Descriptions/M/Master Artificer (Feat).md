# Master Artificer (Feat)
## Overview
You are a master of magic item creation.

**Prerequisites**: Any two item creation feats, 5 ranks of any craft skill.

**Benefit**: You gain a +4 bonus to any skill check made to complete a magic item you are creating (normally this is a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check, but sometimes other skills are used). You create magic items in half the normal hours per day (4 hours for one day of work, or two hours for a days work if you increase your completion DC by 5). As long as the total time spent on item creation does not exceed 8 hours per day, you can accomplish multiple days work on an item in a single day. See Item Creation in Chapter 15 of the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook* for more details on item creation and the time required.

**Source:** Adventurer's Handbook (Super Genius Games), pg. 65

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* If the crafter has the [[Long Days (Feat)|Long Days]] feat, he may exceed the 8 hours per day rule for crafting by using two 8 hour blocks for crafting per that feat.
