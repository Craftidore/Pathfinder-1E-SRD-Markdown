# Lay of the Land (Feat)
## Overview
Your affinity to nature grants you greater insight into specific biomes.

**Prerequisites**: Animal focus class feature, wild empathy class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain a favored terrain as the ranger ability of the same name, though the favored terrain bonuses you receive do not increase with your level. This ability counts as the favored terrain class feature for the purposes of prerequisites and other effects.

**Special**: You can select this feat up to four times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different terrain. Unlike with the ranger’s favored terrain class feature, the bonuses you gain for previously chosen terrains do not increase.
