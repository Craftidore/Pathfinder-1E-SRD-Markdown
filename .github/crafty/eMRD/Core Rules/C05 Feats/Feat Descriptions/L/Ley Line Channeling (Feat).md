# Ley Line Channeling (Feat)
## Overview
You can tap the power of ley lines to lower the cost of your metamagic.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5 ranks, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may reduce the increase in spell level of any metamagic cost by 1 spell slot. For prepared casters they must be near the line when preparing spells, while spontaneous casters must be near the line while casting them.
