# Leadership (Feat)
## Overview
You attract followers to your cause and a companion to join you on your adventures.

**Prerequisite:** Character level 7th.

**Benefits:** This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table 5–2 for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit.

**Leadership Modifiers:** Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score:


| **Leader’s Reputation** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Great renown | +2 |
| Fairness and generosity | +1 |
| Special power | +1 |
| Failure | –1 |
| Aloofness | –1 |
| Cruelty | –2 |

Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below.


| **The Leader…** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion | –2 |
| Recruits a cohort of a different alignment | –1 |
| Caused the death of a cohort | –2\* |

  \* Cumulative per cohort killed.

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.


| **The Leader…** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. | +2 |
| Moves around a lot | –1 |
| Caused the death of other followers | –1 |

*Leadership Score:* Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above.

| 25 or higher | 17th | 135 | 13 | 7 | 4 | 2 | 2 |

*Cohort Level:* You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see Chapter 14). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a –1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.

A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP. Instead, divide the cohort’s level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort’s total.

If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.

*Number of Followers by Level:* You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they’re generally low-level NPCs. Because they’re usually 5 or more levels behind you, they’re rarely effective in combat.

Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table 5–2 to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.

**Alternate Leadership**

Two options for different ways to handle the Leadership feat, of use to groups who wish to shake things up, feel gaining the use of an entire additional character (a cohort) is unbalancingly powerful for one feat, or think seventy 1st level characters are more annoying than useful.

**Option 1: Allies and Associates**

Rather than gain a single cohort and a slew of followers who go adventuring with you, the Leadership feat gives you access to three skilled characters (an artificer, a healer, and a sage) who are willing allies and associates, but explicitly unable or unwilling to risk their lives on front-line adventuring.

**How It Works:** The character with Leadership is considered to have a small team of supporters supporting him from a safe location (be that a friendly city, a guild hall, a king’s court, a pirate’s ship, a traveler’s caravan, or the character’s own stronghold). Access to these characters allows the character to have spells cast, magic items created, and research performed – but only when he can make it back to their safe location.

When the character is at this safe location, he can gain any of the following benefits:

- Information or services that can be obtained with any Intelligence-based skill (including all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills) with a skill bonus equal to the character’s Leadership score (to a maximum of the character’s level +8). One skill check can be made each day 
- The casting of any spell available to one divine and one arcane spellcasting class (normally a cleric and a wizard) of half the character’s Leadership score or less (to a maximum of half the character’s level), with a caster level equal to the character’s Leadership score (to a maximum of the character’s class level). While there is no cost for the spellcasting itself, the character does have to pay for any expensive material components required, and a maintenance fee equal to 2% of the cost of any expensive focus. A total number of spell levels equal to the character’s Leadership score may be cast each day.
- The creation of magic items that could be created by one divine and one arcane character class (normally a cleric and a wizard) of a level equal to half the character’s Leadership score (to a maximum of half the character’s level). All item creation feats available to a spellcaster of this level are considered to be available. Such items must require a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check with a DC of 10 + the character’s Leadership score or less to create. Items can be created for 75% of the normal cost (allies give the character a discount, but they still must make some profit), but this must be paid in advance. Creation of such items takes the normal enchanting time, but enchanting can continue after the character leaves the safe location (and thus the item may be waiting for the character when he next returns). Only a single item can be on order at a time.

**Benefit for the Character:** While you don’t have the firepower of a cohort standing next to you while adventuring, you do get more between adventures support than a single cohort could provide you. The ability to have questions answered, afflictions removed, and items crafted gives you a significant benefit, without slowing down adventure encounters. Additionally, while your allies may not be able to directly aid you in combat, they also aren’t at risk of being killed (forcing you to spend resources to restore them, or to find a new cohort).

**Benefit for the GM:** You don’t have to deal with a cohort in combat, or track where a slew of followers are. While some notes about these allies will aid with roleplaying encounters with them, they do not require a full set of combat-ready character sheets. The safe location selected as home for the character’s allies becomes a natural base of operations for the PCs, and if an adventure gets derailed it’s easy to use the allies’ connections and lore to put the PCs back on the right track without adding a conspicuous or contrived new source of information.

**Option 2: Patron Country**

Rather than gain a cohort and slew of followers, you are a local hero of a country that does it’s best to support and aid you.

**How It Works:** The character treats the entire country as favored terrain, and treats creatures he knows to be sworn enemies of the country (as defined by the GM) as favored enemies. In both cases these abilities work as the ranger abilities of the same name, except the bonus to appropriate checks and rolls is +1 bonus for every 5 points of his Leadership score. The character also gains this bonus to all [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks made with creatures that are friendly or helpful to his patron country.

The character also makes trips through his patron country more quickly (add Leadership score as a percentile bonus to overland speeds), and buys goods and services more cheaply there (gain a percent discount to prices equal to half Leadership score).

**Benefit to the Player:** Rather than depend on how your GM will interpret the actions of allied NPCs who are supposed to follow you, you gain a set of solid numerical advantages and know exactly when you can depend on them. Also, it may be possible to convince a GM to allow you to gain this feat at lower level, which may fit your character history better than waiting until 7th level.

**Benefit to the GM:** Nothing to keep track of but a few numerical bonuses to the PC, and you gain a strong incentive for the player to stay in or return to a specific geographic location (often useful for starting new adventures and knowing what to prepare for sandbox campaigns). Additionally this version of Leadership isn’t overpowering even at low-levels, so you can safely allow even 1st level characters to take it (which works well for some character histories and campaign backgrounds). Also, this version of the feat can be given out as a roleplaying-based reward if the PCs risk themselves to save a country from a major threat.
