# Lunge (Feat)
## Overview
You can strike foes that would normally be out of reach.

**Prerequisites**: Base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: You can increase the reach of your melee attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn by taking a â€“2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You must decide to use this ability before any attacks are made.
