# Ley Line Override (Feat)
## Overview
You can tap the power of ley lines to lower the cost of your metamagic. 

**Prerequisite:** [[Ley Line Magic (midgardpf)|Ley Line Magic]], [[Ley Line Channeling (midgardpf)|Ley Line Channeling]], [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 9 ranks, Int 15+

**Benefit:** Once per day when you are within one mile of a ley line, you may cast a spell as if it were affected by a single metamagic feat you possess without altering its spell slot or having prepared it as a metamagic spell. You may not use this to alter a spell such that it would be greater than 9th level if the slot increase were applied.
