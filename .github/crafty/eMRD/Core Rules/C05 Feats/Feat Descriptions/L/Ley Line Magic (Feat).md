# Ley Line Magic (Feat)
## Overview
You can see ley lines and draw on their power.

**Prerequisite:** [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 3 ranks, Int 13+

**Benefit:** You can sense the presence of any ley line within one mile of your current location. You can tap ley lines for their inherent powers (see “Using Ley Lines” below for details). Once per day, by making a successful caster level check within one mile of a ley line, you regain one spell or spell slot of your choice.
