# Deadly Stroke (Feat)
## Overview
With a well-placed strike, you can bring a swift and painful end to most foes.

Prerequisites: [[Dazzling Display (Feat)|Dazzling Display]], [[Greater Weapon Focus (Feat)|Greater Weapon Focus]], [[Shatter Defenses (Feat)|Shatter Defenses]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], proficiency with the selected weapon, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have [[Greater Weapon Focus (Feat)|Greater Weapon Focus]] against a [[Stunned|stunned]] or [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] opponent. If you hit, you deal double the normal damage and the target takes 1 point of Constitution bleed (see Appendix 2 of Core Rulebook 1). The additional damage and bleed is not multiplied on a critical hit.
