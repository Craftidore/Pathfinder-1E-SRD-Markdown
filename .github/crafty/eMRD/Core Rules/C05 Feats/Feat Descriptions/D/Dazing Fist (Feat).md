# Dazing Fist (Feat)
## Overview
You know just where to strike to daze your foe.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, Wis 13, [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit**: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Dazing Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is [[Dazed|dazed]] for 1 round, until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Dazing Fist once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.
