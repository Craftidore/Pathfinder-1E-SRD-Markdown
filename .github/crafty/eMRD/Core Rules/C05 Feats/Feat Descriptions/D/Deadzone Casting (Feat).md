# Deadzone Casting (Feat)
## Overview
Such is the attunement to arcane energies and understanding of antimagic spells of a character possessing this feat that they are able to summon the power necessary to cast spells in areas where the flow of arcane energy is suppressed.

**Prerequisites**:  Ability to cast *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*.

**Benefits:** Character can cast spells in any magical deadzone, such as that created by *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, with only a 50% chance of spell failure.

**Source:** St. John's College of Abjuration (Malladin's Gate Press), pg. 23

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat does not allow the caster to affect creatures (other than themselves) who are in an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, merely to cast while they are in one
