# Dead Eye (Feat)
## Overview
Your precision with ranged weapons translates into more telling strikes than you could normally make.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 17, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (any ranged weapon), base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** You may add your Dexterity bonus on damage rolls made with ranged weapons for which you have the [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] feat, so long as the target is within 30 feet.

**Special:** Dead Eye does not increase the damage dealt to creatures immune to critical hits.

A fighter may select Dead Eye as one of his fighter bonus feats.
