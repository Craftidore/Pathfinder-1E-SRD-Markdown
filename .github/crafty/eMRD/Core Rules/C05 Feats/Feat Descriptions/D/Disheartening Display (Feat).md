# Disheartening Display (Feat)
## Overview
Your show of prowess further demoralizes others.

**Prerequisites**: [[Dazzling Display (Feat)|Dazzling Display]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]], base attack bonus +6, proficiency with chosen weapon.

**Benefit**: When you successfully use [[Dazzling Display (Feat)|Dazzling Display]] against any [[Shaken|shaken]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or [[Panicked|panicked]] opponents, their fear increases by one step. An already [[Panicked|panicked]] creature demoralized by this feat cowers. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again (by you or anyone else) for 24 hours.
