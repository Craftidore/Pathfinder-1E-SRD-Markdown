# Disarming Threat Deed (Feat)
## Overview
Even your threats are curiously charming.

**Prerequisites**: [[Amateur Swashbuckler (Feat)|Amateur Swashbuckler]] or panache class feature; [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] 2 ranks, [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] 2 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you succeed at an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to force an opponent to act friendly toward you, you can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to regard you with indifference when the duration of the effect expires. A target influenced in this manner is unlikely to report you to authorities.

**Normal**: An opponent forced to act friendly toward you by [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] becomes unfriendly when the duration expires, and is likely to report you to the authorities.
