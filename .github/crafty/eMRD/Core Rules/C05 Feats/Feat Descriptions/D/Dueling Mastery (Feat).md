# Dueling Mastery (Feat)
## Overview
You have mastered the grueling fighting style perfected by the dueling masters of old.

**Prerequisites:** Weapon Proficiency (dueling sword), [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]], [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] (dueling sword).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on Initiative checks as long as you start combat with a dueling sword in your hand. As long as you wield only a single dueling sword in one hand, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your ACâ€”if you wield the sword in two hands, this bonus drops to a +1 shield bonus to AC.

Although the dueling sword inflicts slashing damage, you treat it as if it were also a piercing weapon when determining the effects of weapons used by a duelist.

**Combat Trick**

**Note:** If using the optional Stamina Pool rules, the following trick may be used with this feat.

**Combat Trick:** You can spend up to 6 stamina points at the start of your turn to increase the shield bonus that you gain from the Dueling Mastery feat by 1 per 2 stamina points spent until the start of your next turn.
