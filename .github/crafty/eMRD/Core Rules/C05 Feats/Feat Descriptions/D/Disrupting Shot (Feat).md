# Disrupting Shot (Feat)
## Overview
With a well-placed shot, you make it harder for a nearby opponent to cast spells.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point-Blank Shot]], fighter level 6th.

**Benefit**: If you ready an action to shoot an opponent casting a spell within 30 feet and successfully hit that opponent with a ranged attack, the concentration DC to successfully cast the spell is increased by +4.
