# Disarming Strike (Feat)
## Overview
Your critical hits can disarm your foes.

**Prerequisites**: Int 13, [[Combat Expertise (Feat)|Combat Expertise]], [[Improved Disarm (Feat)|Improved Disarm]], base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit**: Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponentâ€™s CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal**: You must perform a disarm combat maneuver to disarm an opponent.

**Special**: You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: [[Bull Rush Strike (Feat)|Bull Rush Strike]], Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.
