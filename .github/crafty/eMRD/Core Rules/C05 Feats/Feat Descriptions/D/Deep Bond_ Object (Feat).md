# Deep Bond: Object (Feat)
## Overview
Your arcane bond to an object is stronger and deeper than that of most wizards.

**Prerequisite:** Arcane bond (object)

**Benefit:** Increase the number of times per day you can cast a spell in your spellbook, even if the spell is not prepared, from once to twice per day. The spell is still treated like any other spell cast by you, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from your opposition school.

Because your bond to this object is so strong, if you attempt to cast a spell without the bonded object worn or in hand, in addition to having to make a concentration check or lose the spell, your caster level is reduced by two.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat duplicates the arcane discovery of the same name. This feat and the arcane discovery cannot both be taken.
