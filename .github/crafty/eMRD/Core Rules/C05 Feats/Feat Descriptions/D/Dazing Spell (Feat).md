# Dazing Spell (Feat)
## Overview
You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.

**Benefit**: You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become [[Dazed|dazed]] for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become [[Dazed|dazed]], the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spellâ€™s actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
