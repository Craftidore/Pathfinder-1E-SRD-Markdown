# Dreadful Carnage (Feat)
## Overview
Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.

**Prerequisites**: Str 15, [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], Furious Focus, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit**: Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can make an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action. Enemies that cannot see both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are unaffected.
