# Deadly at Short Distances (Feat)
## Overview
You are so fast and accurate with a ranged weapon that you threaten a greater area around you.

**Prerequisites:** [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Shot (Feat)|Rapid Shot]].

**Benefit:** The character threatens an area up to 30 feet away as if he had reach, being able to flank, sneak attack and deal attacks of opportunity to opponents with in that area with a ranged weapon.

**Special:** A fighter may select Deadly at Short Distances as one of his fighter bonus feats.

**Source:** The Quintessential Elf (Mongoose Publishing), pg. 54

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Name changed from [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]] to Deadly at Short Distances to avoid duplication.

*Note:* This feat is a prime example of not all feats being equal until some detailed examination is made. On the surface, this feat is far superior to [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]]. However, This feat has no expansion whereas [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]] does (cf. [[Improved Ranged Threat (Feat)|Improved Ranged Threat]]). The rationale behind this feat differs also being a quick burst of several arrows at a limited ranged, where [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]] is more deliberate and the range can be extended.
