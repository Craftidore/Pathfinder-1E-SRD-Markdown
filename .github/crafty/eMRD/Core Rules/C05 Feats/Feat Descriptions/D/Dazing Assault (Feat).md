# Dazing Assault (Feat)
## Overview
You can daze foes with wild attacks.

**Prerequisites**: Str 13, [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]], base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit**: You can choose to take a â€“5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to daze opponents you hit with your melee attacks for 1 round, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + your base  attack bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn.
