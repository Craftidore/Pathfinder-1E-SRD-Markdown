# Bind Elemental (Feat)
## Overview
You can craft magic items that use bound elementals for special effects, including weapons, armor, airships, and elemental galleons.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], caster level 9th.

**Benefit:** Crafting an item with a bound elemental is similar to making a wondrous item, except that calling and binding an elemental is an integral part of creating the item. All bound-elemental items have a *[[Planar Binding (Spell)|planar binding]]* spell as a prerequisite, but simply casting the spell as part of the item creation is not sufficient. You must cast the spell normally, using the item that is to hold the elemental and a Khyber dragonshard as a receptacle. The elemental receives its normal saving throw to resist. While the elemental resides in the receptacle, you must compel it to accept bondage in the item by making an opposed Charisma check, as specified in the *[[Planar Binding, Lesser (Spell)|lesser planar binding]]* spell description.

If you are an artificer, this feat allows you to cast a *[[Planar Binding (Spell)|planar binding]]* spell by successfully emulating it with a [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check (DC 20 + caster level), but only when you attempt to craft a bound-elemental item. In this case, your effective caster level equals your [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] check result –20 for the purpose of opposing the elemental’s attempts to escape.
