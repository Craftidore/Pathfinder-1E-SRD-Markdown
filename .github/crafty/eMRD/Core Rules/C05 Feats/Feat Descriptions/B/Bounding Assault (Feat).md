# Bounding Assault (Feat)
## Overview
You can move and attack with superior speed and power.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]], base attack bonus +12.

**Benefit:** When using the [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]] feat, you designate two foes rather than one. Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either of these foes. While using an attack action with the [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]] feat, you can make a second attack with a â€“5 penalty. You can use both attacks against one of the opponents targeted with this feat, or split your attacks between them.
