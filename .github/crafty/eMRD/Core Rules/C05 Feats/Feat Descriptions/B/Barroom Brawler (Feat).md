# Barroom Brawler (Feat)
## Overview
You have learned how to mimic the combat tricks and forms of others.

**Prerequisite**: Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit**: Once per day as a move action, you can gain the benefit of a combat feat that you do not possess for 1 minute. You must otherwise meet the featâ€™s requirements.

**Special**: If you have the martial flexibility class feature, this feat instead grants you one additional use per day of that ability.
