# Improved Dirge of Doom (Feat)
## Overview
The foreboding tone of your dirge is especially effective at unsettling your enemies.

**Prerequisite**: Ability to perform dirge of doom.

**Benefit**: The range of your dirge of doom ability is extended to 60 feet. Additionally, if a creature is [[Shaken|shaken]] from another effect, the effect of your dirge of doom is changed to [[Frightened|frightened]] for that specific creature. This benefit cannot cause a creature to become [[Panicked|panicked]], even if a target is already [[Frightened|frightened]] from another effect.

**Normal**: The range of dirge of doom is 30 feet. A creature that is already [[Shaken|shaken]] cannot become [[Frightened|frightened]] by dirge of doom.
