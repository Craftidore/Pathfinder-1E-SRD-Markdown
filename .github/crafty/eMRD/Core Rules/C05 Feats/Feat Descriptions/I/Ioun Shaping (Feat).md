# Ioun Shaping (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at creating ioun stones.

**Prerequisites:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], caster level 12+

**Benefit:** Your skill at creating ioun stones is such that you may choose one of the following benefits when crafting an ioun stone: when determining the gold piece cost in raw materials you need to craft any item, reduce the base price by 10%; or, when determining the time you need to craft any item, reduce the base time by 10%. You choose the benefit each time you craft an ioun stone. The benefit taken while using this feat stacks with any similar benefit from another crafting feat.
