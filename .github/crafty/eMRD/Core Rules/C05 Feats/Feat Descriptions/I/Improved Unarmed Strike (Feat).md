# Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You are skilled at fighting while unarmed.

**Benefit**: You are considered to be armed even when unarmedâ€”you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you attack foes while unarmed. Your unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage, at your choice.

**Normal**: Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack.
