# Improved Ranged Threat (Feat)
## Overview
You can take advantage of multiple foes who drop their guard near you.

**Prerequisite:** [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Point-Blank Shot (Feat)|Point Blank Shot]], [[Precise Shot (Feat)|Precise Shot]], [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]], base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** When armed with a ranged weapon, you threaten every square within 30 feet. If a target within this threatened area takes an action that provokes an attack of opportunity, you make one ranged attack at your highest attack bonus against that target. Unlike [[Ranged Threat (Feat)|Ranged Threat]], you may use this feat more than once per round, and the benefits of other opportunistic feats also apply.

**Special:** A fighter may selected Improved Ranged Threat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
