# Improved Mounted Archery (Feat)
## Overview
You can make ranged attacks from a mount almost as well as you can from the ground.

**Prerequisites:** [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] 1 rank, [[Mounted Archery (Feat)|Mounted Archery]], [[Mounted Combat (Feat)|Mounted Combat]]. 

**Benefit:** The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon if your mount is taking a double move is eliminated, and the penalty for using a ranged weapon when your mount is running is lessened from –4 to –2. You can attack at any time during your mount’s move.

**Special:** A fighter may select Improved [[Mounted Archery (Feat)|Mounted Archery]] as one of his fighter bonus feats.
