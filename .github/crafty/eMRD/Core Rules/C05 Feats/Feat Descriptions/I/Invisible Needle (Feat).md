# Invisible Needle (Feat)
## Overview
You can create tiny darts of force.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** As long as you have a force spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can use a standard action to hurl a tiny needle-shaped projectile created from pure force. This attack requires a successful ranged attack roll (not a ranged touch attack), and the dart has a range of 5 feet per level of the force spell. The needle deals 1d4 points of damage per level of the highest-level force spell you have available. Because it is composed of force, the needle can strike incorporeal creatures.

As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting force spells.
