# Improved Arcane Bond (Feat)
## Overview
This feat allows you to enhance your arcane bond object, allowing it to grow in magical power as you do.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane caster level 5th, must have an arcane bond object.

**Benefit:** Your arcane bond object gains additional powers as you gain levels in your arcane class, according to the following table. Unless otherwise noted, the wizard must be in physical contact with his bond object in order for these powers to function.

**Improved Arcane Bond Progression**


| **Arcane**<br>**Caster**<br>**Level** | **Arcane Bond Powers** |
|---|---|
| 5th | The wizard may add his INT modifier as a bonus to his CMD vs. attempts to disarm or sunder his bonded object. Bond object grants +2 bonus on concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when casting on the defensive or while [[Grappled\|grappled]]. This bonus stacks with the [[Combat Casting (Feat)\|Combat Casting]] feat. |
| 7th | Bond object grants a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a creatureâ€™s spell resistance. This bonus stacks with the [[Spell Penetration (Feat)\|Spell Penetration]] feat. Bond object imparts magic protection to the wizard in the form of a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 additional arcane caster levels, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level. |
| 9th | The wizard may cast one additional spell per day that he has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. If the wizard specializes in an arcane school, this second spell must come from that school. This additional spell otherwise follows all the rules of the standard arcane bond ability. |
| 11th | Bond object grants *[[Spell Resistance (Spell)\|spell resistance]]*, as the spell of the same name, to the wizard equal to 12 + arcane caster level. |
