# Intimidating Performance (Feat)
## Overview
Your performance strikes fear in the hearts of foes.

**Prerequisites**: Ability to start a performance (or raging song) as a move action, bardic performance or raging song class feature.

**Benefit**: When you start a performance (or a raging song) as a move or swift action, you can use a standard action to demoralize a foe (*Core Rulebook* 99), attempting a [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check appropriate to your performance in place of the [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check. Your performance must be one with an audible component.

If you can start a performance as a swift action and you have the [[Dazzling Display (Feat)|Dazzling Display]] feat, you can gain the benefit of [[Dazzling Display (Feat)|Dazzling Display]] by succeeding at a [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] check in place of an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check.
