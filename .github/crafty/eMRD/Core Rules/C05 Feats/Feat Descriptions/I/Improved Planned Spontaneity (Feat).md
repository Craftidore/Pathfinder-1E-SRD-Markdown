# Improved Planned Spontaneity (Feat)
## Overview
You have an even greater measure of flexibility when preparing spells.

**Prerequisites:** [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) 15 ranks, [[Planned Spontaneity (Feat)|Planned Spontaneity]], ability to prepare and cast 8th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Once per day when you prepare spells, you can designate one spell slot from each of up to six different spell levels that are lower than the highest-level spell that you can cast. In each designated slot you can memorize two different spells of the respective level. You can cast either spell as normal, but when you do, the spell consumes both of the spells prepared in that spell slot.

The designated slots for this feat may be from the same spell level as those from [[Planned Spontaneity (Feat)|Planned Spontaneity]] but not the same slots.

**Special:** A wizard can select this feat as one of his bonus feats.
