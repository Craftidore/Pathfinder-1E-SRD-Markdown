# Improved Unarmored Specialist (Combat) (Feat)
## Overview
You are so well-trained at fighting without armor that you benefit greatly from not wearing any.

**Prerequisites:** Unarmored Specialist, evasion class feature.

**Benefit:** As long as you do not have any armor bonus to AC (such as from wearing armor, or from the spell *[[Mage Armor (Spell)|mage armor]]*), double your Dexterity bonus for the purposes of your AC (for example, a character with a Dexterity score of 15 would have a +4 Dexterity bonus to AC, because the normal bonus is +2, and doubled it becomes +4). Anything that would cause you to be denied your Dexterity bonus to AC still causes you to lose the entire bonus.

**Normal:** Normally you add your Dexterity bonus, rather than twice your Dexterity bonus, to AC.
