# Improvised Weapon Mastery (Feat)
## Overview
You can turn nearly any object into a deadly weapon, from a razor-sharp chair leg to a sack of flour.

**Prerequisites**: [[Catch Off-Guard (Feat)|Catch Off-Guard]] or [[Throw Anything (Feat)|Throw Anything]], base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit**: You do not suffer any penalties for using an improvised weapon. Increase the amount of damage dealt by the improvised weapon by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6) to a maximum of 1d8 (2d6 if the improvised weapon is two-handed). The improvised weapon has a critical threat range of 19–20, with a critical multiplier of ×2.
