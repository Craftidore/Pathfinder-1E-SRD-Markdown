# Improved Familiar (Feat)
## Overview
This feat allows you to acquire a powerful familiar, but only when you could normally acquire a new familiar.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see below).

**Benefit:** When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available to you (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for statistics on these creatures). You may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each alignment axis (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).
