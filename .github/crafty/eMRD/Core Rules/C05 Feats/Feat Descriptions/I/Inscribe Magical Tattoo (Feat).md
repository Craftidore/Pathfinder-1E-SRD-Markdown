# Inscribe Magical Tattoo (Feat)
## Overview
You can craft magical tattoos.

**Prerequisites**: [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (calligraphy, engraving, paintings, or tattoos) 5 ranks, caster level 5th.

**Benefit**: You can create magical tattoos, magic items inked directly into the flesh of a willing or helpless creature. Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots.

Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]*. The spell *[[Erase (Spell)|erase]]* can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner.

Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (calligraphy, engraving, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Magical tattoos may be engraved onto the metallic bodies of constructs, [[Gearforged (midgardpf)|gearforged]], [[Warforged (Domain)|warforged]], etc. This requires the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (engraving) skill and the proper tools. Taking so does not require any additional time. Magical tattoos can be very small (as small as one inch across) or very large (covering an entire body slot). This is a choice the crafter makes at the time of crafting (though the GM may wish to require a higher DC for a very small tattoo).
