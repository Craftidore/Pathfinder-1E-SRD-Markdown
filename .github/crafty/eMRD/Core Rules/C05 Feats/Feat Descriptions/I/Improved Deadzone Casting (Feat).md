# Improved Deadzone Casting (Feat)
## Overview
A character possessing this feat has truly mastered the ability to draw upon arcane energy in order to cast spells no matter how his access to that energy is suppressed.

**Prerequisites**: Ability to cast *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, Concentration 17 ranks, [[Deadzone Casting (Feat)|Deadzone Casting]].

**Benefits:** Character can cast spells in any magical deadzone, such as that created by *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, with only a 10% chance of spell failure.

**Source:** St. John's College of Abjuration (Malladin's Gate Press), pg. 23

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* This feat does not allow the caster to affect creatures (other than themselves) who are in an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*, merely to cast while they are in one.

*House Rule:* Concentration prequisites changed from Concentration 20 to Concentration 17 for Pathfinder.
