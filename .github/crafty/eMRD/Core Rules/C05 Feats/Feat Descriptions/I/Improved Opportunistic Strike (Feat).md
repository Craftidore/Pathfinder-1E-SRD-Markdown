# Improved Opportunistic Strike (Feat)
## Overview
You may strike three times when opportunity presents itself.

**Prerequisite:** Dex 17, [[Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Combat Reflexes]], [[Greater Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Greater Combat Reflexes]], [[Improved Combat Reflexes (Feat)|Improved Combat Reflexes]], [[Opportunistic Strike (Feat)|Opportunistic Strike]], base attack bonus +15.

**Benefit:** For any attack of opportunity, you may strike three times with all strikes counting as a single attack of opportunity. The second strike is at a -5 penalty, just like your second normal attack in any given round. The third attack is at a -10 penalty, just like your third normal attack in any given round. You may not use Improved [[Opportunistic Strike (Feat)|Opportunistic Strike]] against the same opponent more than once in a round.

**Normal:** You strike once at an opponent during an attack of opportunity.

**Special:** N/A

**Source:** The Mage's Tower

**GM Note**

*Note:* This feat was originally presented in Polyhedron #59 as Greater Combat Reflexes. It has been updated for version 3.5 and renamed to avoid confusion with an existing feat.
