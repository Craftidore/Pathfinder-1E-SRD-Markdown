# Portal Master (Feat)
## Overview
You are especially profi cient at creating portals—permanent magic devices that instantaneously transport those who know their secrets from one locale to another.

**Prerequisite:** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]].

**Benefit:** When you build a portal, you pay only 50% of the normal cost to create the device. This benefit does not stack with that provided by the [[Magical Artisan (Feat)|Magical Artisan]] feat.

In addition, you know how to pass through dangerous portals safely. As a standard action, you can attempt to stabilize a malfunctioning portal temporarily. Make a [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check and add the check result to the d% roll for the effect of the malfunctioning portal (see Table 2–2 in Chapter 2 of the *Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting*). The portal remains stable for 1 minute, and you can retry the stabilization as often as you like.
