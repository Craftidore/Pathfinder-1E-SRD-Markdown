# Practical Metamagic (Feat)
## Overview
You can apply a selected metamagic feat to your spells more easily.

**Prerequisites:** Dragonblood subtype, [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 8 ranks, any metamagic feat, ability to spontaneously cast 3rd-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose a metamagic feat you know. When applying the chosen metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell, the spell uses a spell slot one level lower than normal for the applied metamagic feat, to a minimum of one level higher than a spellâ€™s normal level. For example, if you select Practical Metamagic ([[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]]), you can apply the [[Empower Spell (Feat)|Empower Spell]] feat to any spell by using a spell slot one level higher rather than two.

**Special:** You can gain Practical Metamagic multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new metamagic feat.
