# Faerie Mysteries Initiate (Feat)
## Overview
You know the timeless secrets and rituals of the Faerie Mysteries, self-improving rites of grace and passion that have been handed down since the earliest days that form a fundamental pillar of elven culture.

**Regions:** *[[Celene]]*, gray elf, high elf, *Lendore Isles*, tallfellow halfling, *Verbobonc*, wild elf, wood elf.

**Benefits:** You and a partner with the Faerie Mysteris Initiate feat practice a 15-minute regimen of cultural rituals that grant you spell bonuses on skill checks or combat rolls. You choose which bonus you'd prefer before conducting the exercise, modifying your regimen slightly to achieve the desired effect. Both practitioners must agree upon the rite to be performed and receive the same bonus. Granted effects last until the next time you perform the Faerie Mysteries.

The Faerie Mysteries require 4 hours of 'trance' to clear the mind. If your rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time you must trance in order to clear your mind, and you must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior  to conduction the Faerie Mysteries. If you do not need to trance for some reason, you still must have 4 hours of restful calm before conducting the Mysteries.

*Carols:* You and your partner sing in beautiful harmony of the triumph of [[Corellon Larethian]] over [[Gruumsh]] One-Eye, extolling the virtues of elves and enumerating the evils of orcs and goblins, When fighting orcs or goblins, you gain a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls with melee attacks and with ranged attacks at ranges of up to 30 feet, and you act as if you had the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat for the weapon you are using, This benefit does not stack with the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat or other effects that increase critical threat range.

*Frolics :* You and your partner engage in a carefree, joyful gambol featuring hand claps and energetic kicks. At the end of the ceremony, both partners receive a +4 insight bonus on [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (dance) and Tumble checks.

*Gyres:* You join your partner in a delicate, deliberate dance involving clasped hands and a rigidly timed orbit around a living flower. You gain a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

*Passions:* You and your partner engage in an exuberant sensual act. The ritual leaves both partners invigorated, allowing you to use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine bonus hit points.
