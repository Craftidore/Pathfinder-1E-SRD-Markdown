# Force Dash (Feat)
## Overview
You can absorb the magic in your force spells to give you a concentrated burst of speed.

**Prerequisites**: Base attack bonus +4, ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells, ability to cast at least one arcane force spell.

**Benefit**: As a swift action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane force spell (or if you are a spontaneous caster, a spell slot of the same level as an arcane force spell you know) to give yourself an enhancement bonus to speed. The bonus gained is equal to 10 feet × the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus applies to all forms of movement, and it lasts 1 round. If you charge while this bonus is in effect, you do not take the normal –2 penalty to AC until the start of your next turn.
