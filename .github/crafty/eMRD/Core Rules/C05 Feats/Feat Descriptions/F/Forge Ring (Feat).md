# Forge Ring (Feat)
## Overview
You can create magic rings.

**Prerequisite**: Caster level 7th.

**Benefit**: You can create magic rings. Crafting a ring takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a ring, you must use up raw materials costing half of the base price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information.

You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 124
