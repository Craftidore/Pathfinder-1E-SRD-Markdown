# Flexible Hex (Feat)
## Overview
Your wandering hex shifts at your command.

**Prerequisite**: Wandering hex class feature.

**Benefit**: Once per day as a swift action, you can change your wandering hex. When you change your hex, the new hex must be associated with the wandering spirit with which you are currently bonded. At 12th level, you can change either or both of your wandering hexes with the feat.

**Normal**: Shamans select their hexes every day when they prepare their spells and cannot change them.

**Source:** Advanced Class Guide, pg. 147
