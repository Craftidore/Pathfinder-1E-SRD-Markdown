# Fencing Grace (Feat)
## Overview
Your dashing style and fluid [[Rapier|rapier]] forms allow you to use agility rather than brute force to fell your foes.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]], [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] ([[Rapier|rapier]]).

**Benefit**: When wielding a [[Rapier|rapier]] one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weaponâ€™s damage. The [[Rapier|rapier]] must be one appropriate for your size. You do not gain this benefit while fighting with two weapons or using flurry of blows, or anytime another hand is otherwise occupied.

In addition, if you have the panache class feature, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against attempts to disarm you of your [[Rapier|rapier]] while you have at least 1 panache point.
