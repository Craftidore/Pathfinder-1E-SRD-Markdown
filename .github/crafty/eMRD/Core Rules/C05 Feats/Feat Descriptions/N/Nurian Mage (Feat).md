# Nurian Mage (Feat)
## Overview
You can tap the power of ley lines to strengthen your magic.

**Prerequisite:** [[Ley Line Magic (midgardpf)|Ley Line Magic]], [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5 ranks, Language (Enochian), Wis 11+, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may choose to strengthen a spell before you cast it by taking a move action to draw the necessary power and expending 50 gp in material spell components. The next spell you cast will have a +1 bonus to its DC value and gain +1 to each dice rolled for damage or effect. Only one Nurian feat may be used when casting a spell.
