# Nurian Vitality (Feat)
## Overview
You can tap the power of ley lines to heal yourself.

**Prerequisite:** [[Ley Line Magic (midgardpf)|Ley Line Magic]], [[Nurian Mage (midgardpf)|Nurian Mage]], [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] 5 ranks, Language (Enochian), Wis 13+, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may choose to heal yourself as you cast a spell. You must declare this before you cast it by taking a move action to draw the necessary power and expending 50 gp in material spell components. The next spell you cast will heal you of 1d8 hp damage for every 4 spellcasting levels you have.  Only one Nurian feat may be used when casting a spell.
