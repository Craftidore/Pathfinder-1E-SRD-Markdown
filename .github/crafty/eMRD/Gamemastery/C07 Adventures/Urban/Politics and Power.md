# Politics and Power
## Overview
From governments to guilds, temples to private

organizations, the city teems with influential

entities with whom the characters must often

deal. Whether their power is political, financial,

criminal, or social, these groups can make valuable

allies—or potent enemies—to enterprising adventurers.

When used to their fullest extent, they can shape the

course of an entire campaign.

City Government

The most important (or at least the most fundamental)

“faction” at work in most cities is the local government.

Regardless of its source or structure, the government

forms the context in which all other systems—from guilds

to churches to private organizations—must function.

In some cases, the government moderates the growth

and influence of such groups, ensuring that no one

private entity ever outshines the rest. In other instances

(particularly regimes where corruption runs high) the

government is a merely a means to an end for these special

interests—or worse, an insignifi cant factor in their daily

operations, lacking either the power or motivation to

curb their influence.

POLITICAL SYSTEMS

Two comparable cities, each of similar size, population,

and demographic distribution, might still feel very different

from one another if their governments operate

differently. What follows is a look at how the average

city runs under each of the most common forms

of government in a fantasy world. (For more on the

default political systems, see *DMG* 140.)

THE AUTOCRATIC CITY

Since the monarchy is the most common political

structure in a fantasy setting, the autocratic

city is the most commonly encountered type

of urban center (with the possible exception of

the feudal city, below). Cities under a monarchy

tend to reinforce the principles behind their

ruler, including the centralization of power,

the importance of noble birth, and the endorsement

of the rich–poor divide. Members of the

working class do their best to muddle through

their daily routines, with the occasional appeal

to the local ruler (or their neighborhood representative,

if one exists) to improve their lot in life.

The gentry, on the other hand, try to balance

their pride and dignity with taking whatever scraps of power the throne sees fi t to offer them. In an

autocratic city, only the local ruler and those whom he

favors know lives of luxury.

Regardless of how many branches and agencies do

the day-to-day work of making the city function, the

autocratic city is ultimately ruled by a single individual.

If the city is the capital of a nation or an empire, that

individual could well be the king/queen or other

national regent; few rulers care to delegate authority

within their own demesnes. In cities outside the capital,

the local monarch is likely a governor, appointed by or

on behalf of the national monarch. A ruler might well

maintain his share of aides, including chamberlains,

chancellors, and even a parliamentary council, but

at the end of the day, he is indisputably in charge. In

good- and neutral-aligned cities, the governor typically

rules by virtue of noble blood (whether deserving or

not) and does his best to keep the people content, even

if all that effort involves is distracting them from their

complaints. In evil cities, the governor rules by possessing

the might and influence to retain control, with the

power—either appointed or assumed—to crush those

who resist his decrees.

THE DEMOCRATIC CITY

If the autocratic city is the most common type of fantasy

metropolis, then the democratic city is the rarest.

Democratic cities take a great deal of know-how and

cooperation in order to function, and many end up collapsing

under their own weight. (Whatever else might

be said of autocracies, they can certainly sustain themselves,

especially in a medieval setting.) Cities making

a go of true democracy buzz constantly with activity, as

people run to and fro to keep the wheels turning. Few

individuals live lives of indulgence in a democracy, but

just as few go hungry.

A democratic city differentiates itself from other

models in a number of ways: mainly that it is generally

ruled by a single group rather than a single person.

Most often, this ruling group is a council composed of

elected representatives from the city’s various wards,

guilds, or districts. A democratic city often retains its

local focus even if it is also a capital city. If the larger

government is similarly democratic, then the city likely

hosts a senate (or similar congress), but in any republic,

the operation of a city must remain separate from the

administration of a nation. As such, in democratic

capital cities, one often fi nds the council working side

by side with a separate and distinct national government.

Democratic cities generally f lourish only in

good-aligned regions, where the communal desire to

reach consensus has a chance to overpower humanity’s

natural divisiveness. Evil-aligned democratic cities are

rare in the extreme.

THE FEUDAL CITY

The feudal city is usually similar to the autocratic city

in its basic operation; that is, it is often the product of

a monocratic national system. The primary difference

lies in how the local government takes shape. As with

an autocratic city, a single individual (a duke or similar

landed noble) usually governs a feudal city. He or she

rules it as part of a personal fief, and is beholden in

turn to a higher liege (usually the king). Technically

speaking, the duke rules his or her own lands on

political behalf of another, who is the ultimate arbiter

in matters of law and policy (since the fiefdom lies

within the boundaries of the superior’s domain).

Feudal cities are further distinguished by the size and

complexity of the resident nobility, many of whom are

landed gentry in their own right (having been ceded

territory by the local duke). In this regard, feudal cities

are generally “healthier” than truly autocratic cities,

since the size and inf luence of the middle class is

substantially larger.

Between the royal family, the landed nobility,

the gentry, the church, and the working class, the

feudal city displays almost as much complexity as

the democratic city. The highest-ranking noble has

the final word on matters of state, of course, but the

governing family—no matter how wealthy or influential—

doesn’t exist in a vacuum, making a feudal city

the perfect environment for thorny and scandalous

high-society intrigue. Complicating matters further,

feudal cities typically have strong parliaments—either

assisting the ruler in governing or legislating policy in

their own right—made up of other landed nobles. As

such, the city’s ruler must spend much time and effort

courting the favor of the other nobles, regardless of

(or because of ) the fact that his authority technically

outstrips their own.

By its very defi nition, the feudal city is almost never

a capital. If the king is in residence, he has no need

of a duke or other sworn representative, making it an

autocratic city by default. Feudal cities exhibit alignments

of every sort, though good- and neutral-aligned

communities still make up the majority. Evil-aligned

feudal cities are hotbeds of backstabbing scandal and

intrigue of every variety.

THE MAGOCRATIC CITY

Despite the strong presence of magic in most fantasy

settings, magocracies remain extremely rare. Even in

high-magic campaigns, few areas produce more than

a handful of powerful arcane spellcasters, and only

a tiny number would willingly forgo their lives of

quiet study to embrace dreams of political dominance.

Magocracies are substantially more common, however,

in regions dominated by nonhumans (particularly those with strong arcane traditions, such as the drow

and other elf races). When they do occur, magocratic

cities are marvels to behold, demonstrating a public

embrace of magic as a means by which the city can

be designed and run. The primary drawback of such a

system, of course, is that nonspellcasters face severely

limited lives.

Technically speaking, magocratic cities are oligarchies—

political systems in which all power lies in

the hands of a small ruling elite. As a result, magocratic

cities resemble tribal cities in that they tend

to f lourish when the power of the local government

doesn’t reach beyond the city’s immediate surroundings.

Councils of wizards can administer small areas

with little difficulty but tend to falter when trying

to preside over massive swaths of territory. The only

circumstance in which the system works on a large

scale is when it combines with the feudal system,

using a complex web of interconnected but independent

governing lords, bound by magical might or

focus rather than by noble blood. Magocratic cities

rarely appear in good-aligned regions, since their

oligarchic structure keeps the populace divided, but

are relatively common in neutral-aligned cities that

stand independent from any higher authority. Evilaligned

magocratic cities are despotic nightmares, in

which life for the common folk is both meticulously

monitored and rigidly controlled.

THE THEOCRATIC CITY

A theocratic city is similar to a magocratic city; it is

governed by a religious elite instead of a spellcasting

elite, but the two are otherwise very much alike. Unlike

magocracies, however, theocracies are relatively commonplace

in the fantasy world. Due to the power of

the gods, which can actually be seen and felt thanks

to the gifts of divine magic, the masses might embrace

religion on an overwhelming scale—leading some

areas to forgo traditional forms of government in favor

of theocracies. In addition, unlike magocracies, one

needn’t be an actual cleric or other divine spellcaster

in order to join the ruling elite; so long as one holds

suffi cient rank within the church (appropriate levels in

aristocrat or even expert will do), one can garner enough

support to function effectively within a theocratic

system. These forms of government usually leave little

room for guessing as to who is in charge, and religious

iconography appears in every shop and street corner.

People in such cities often want for little, but woe betide

any nonbeliever. . . .

Theocracies, like magocracies, are technically oligarchies,

since all power lies in the hands of a select few.

Each theocracy varies depending on the particulars

of their faith, however, so the actual administration

of city affairs runs the gamut in theocratic cities.

Some take a more detached approach, allowing for

the creation of parliaments and other civic agencies,

while others demand absolute control (or at least

direct oversight) over every aspect of daily life. Unlike

magocracies, which tend to localize their inf luence,

theocracies often spread as far and wide as possible.

Some of the most powerful and longest-lasting

regimes in history have been theocracies; such dynasties

end only in the face of popular revolt, or because

of intervention from outside forces. Theocratic

cities resemble feudal cities in that they can appear

in regions dominated by every possible alignment,

though expansionist theocracies tend to surface in

areas where evil predominates.

THE TRIBAL CITY

A tribal city has much in common with an autocratic

city, and depending on the structure of the ruling

clan, a feudal city as well. Power lies with a local chief,

who might or might not answer to a higher chieftain

of his own. As a rule, the tribal structure only works

well on a small scale; like communism, the farther

it spreads, the shakier its foundation becomes. The

intriguing exception to this, like the magocratic city,

comes with nonhuman communities. Indeed, some

humanoid races (particularly the so-called races of

savagery, such as goblins, orcs, and the like) understand

only a tribal structure, and can extend its efficiency

to include entire kingdoms, each ruled by a supreme

tribal chieftain. The look and operation of a tribal

city depends on the tribe in power, of course, and

to a lesser extent on the mix of races and cultures

over which the tribe rules. Savage tribes tend to

demonstrate their power and dominance at every

turn, festooning the streets with heads on spikes

and similar decorations, while more cultured tribes

merely try to make the city an honest ref lection of

themselves. No matter what the nature of the ruling

tribe, however, those outside its membership—or worse

yet, members of a rival tribe—will find life difficult

in the extreme.

The larger it gets, the more a tribal city takes on the

aspects of a feudal city. Because a ruling clan or family

can only oversee so much on its own, it must eventually

rely on the input and support of other families to govern.

Indeed, tribal cities often grow to become metropolises

when a powerful tribe gathers neighboring tribes to

its banner, and either subsumes them into itself (thus

creating a tribal system of nobility) or rules over them

with their support. The greatest and most successful

tribal regimes keep the values of their people—ties

of faith, blood, ancestry, and belief—in mind at every

turn during their expansion and growth. A united tribe is a powerful thing to behold, no matter what its

culture is. Tribal cities are typically associated with

(and primarily encountered in) areas on the so-called

“edge of civilization.” This is only a stereotype, however,

and some of the largest and most self-sustaining

metropolises follow a variant of the tribal structure. A

tribal city usually falls when it faces internal dissent

or revolt, and it tends to go down hard—often taking

the entire populace with it in blood-soaked conflict.

Tribal cities are a close step behind feudal cities and

theocratic cities in that they can appear in regions

dominated by every possible alignment. Despite this,

the preponderance of tribal fantasy cities are either

neutral or evil.

POLITICAL POSITIONS

The fantasy city wears myriad cultural faces, but the

default setting of the D&D game presupposes a Western

European style; the following information is tailored to

fi t such a setting. Most of these positions can be found

in areas and cultures that don’t fi t this standard; they

simply need a different name and a slight adjustment

to their flavor to better suit the campaign. An Egyptianthemed

setting, for example, might not have mayors in

its urban centers but appropriate equivalents (in this

case, nomarchs).

Mayor

Regardless of the national government above them,

most major settlements in the urban fantasy world have

a mayor, or a closely analogous fi gure. The position typically

originates among the people—often in an attempt

to bring more governmental involvement to their own

lives (since they themselves elect someone to this position).

A mayor is the most public face of a city’s politics,

and although the offi ce-holder is usually selected by the

people, he or she often remains fully beholden to the

local government.

Alternate Title: Governor.

Associated Class: Aristocrat.

Chamberlain

On the national level, a chamberlain is a personal

advisor and confidant to a titular ruling head or heads;

a similar position exists at the local level as well.

Chamberlains—named in part for their practice of giving

advice behind closed doors, in private chambers—give

counsel and lend expertise to executives and policymakers.

In some cities, the chamberlain has direct,

personal authority in various proceedings, in order to

ensure a more effi cient government.

Alternate Title: Steward.

Associated Class: Aristocrat.

Chancellor

Cities have extensive bureaucracies, including the

various branches, agencies, courts, and civil services

necessary to keep things running smoothly. The

chancellor stands at the head of each such operation:

beholden to the mayor in terms of the running of the

city, but otherwise serving as a functionary of the

local government.

Alternate Title: Secretary.

Associated Class: Aristocrat or expert.

Bailiff

The title of bailiff carries an unpleasant connotation in

many cities. Bailiffs enforce commerce laws, including

the collection of municipal taxes . . . which, of course,

doesn’t endear them to the populace. Most bailiffs report

to the mayor; however, unlike the mayor, they are rarely

elected by the people, making it diffi cult to hold them

accountable for any abuses.

Alternate Title: Reeve.

Associated Class: Aristocrat or warrior.

Justice

Every social system requires a means of trying criminals

and hearing civil appeals; the justice (often “justice of

the peace”) presides over such matters. In some cultures,

justices must come from the ranks of the local nobility,

while in others, even the lowliest peasant can attain the

position (given time and hard work).

Alternate Title: Judge.

Associated Class: Aristocrat or expert.

Speaker

Sometimes a government maintains an advisory council

or legislative body separate from its ruler(s). This body is

usually referred to as a parliament or council, its members

known as lords or members of parliament. Their duties

range from simply advising the ruler to legislating city

law and policy.

Alternate Title: Councilor.

Associated Class: Aristocrat.

Alderman

Most urban centers are divided into districts or wards,

each of which usually needs a provincial governor, called

an alderman. Aldermen are commonly elected by the

residents of their ward to lend an ear to any grievances

and to settle minor disputes and offenses in their court

(which is often called a “ward moot”). In rare cases, the

city’s parliament or city council is composed of the collected

aldermen from the various wards.

Alternate Title: Magistrate.

Associated Class: Aristocrat or expert. 

Constable

No matter how many precincts or guards a city boasts,

there’s usually a single fi gure at whom the martial buck

stops. This fi gure, the constable, is to the executive arena

what the justice is to the judicial. In smaller towns,

where there is little need for multiple layers of law

enforcement, this offi cial is often known as the sheriff.

In larger cities, he or she is akin to a chief of police,

commanding multiple sheriffs who each report from a

different district. The constable enforces the city’s laws

and, should the government declare martial law, takes

charge of its local army.

*Alternate Title:* Sheriff.

*Associated Class:* Fighter.

POLITICAL BODIES

Below is an overview of the types of political bodies

found in urban fantasy centers. Each discussion includes

a sample contact upon whom the PCs can call for favors

if the DM wishes. The information at the end of each

sample contact entry represents the number of times

such a contact can be called upon for the type of favor

described. As always, the names and details can be modifi

ed to suit your campaign.

Mayor’s Office

The mayor might be a single individual, but in communities

larger than a small town, he or she needs various

assistants and aides de camp to properly function; the

larger the city, the more help the mayor needs. The

mayor’s offi ce in a metropolis might have a small army

of adjuncts working to keep the governing machine

well-oiled.

*Associated Skills:* Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local),

Profession (scribe), Sense Motive.

*Sample Contact:* Fulven Nuptoose (aristocrat 1/expert

3). As an aide working in the mayor’s office, Nuptoose

can get the PCs some “face time” with His Eminence,

if the situation warrants a personal visit. Once every

two months (or more often, depending on the party’s

reputation).

Parliament

Even in cities under an autocratic system, the local ruler

usually maintains a body of advisors. It might be known

by any number of names, though “parliament” and “city

council” are the most common. Each speaker or councilor

who sits on this body, whether elected or appointed, is

a true insider with opportunities to influence how the

city is run.

*Associated Skills:* Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information,

Knowledge (local), Sense Motive.

*Sample Contact:* Arla Dinlow (expert 5). Arla is the

personal aide to a city councilor, and as such, can arrange

to have her boss bring up a topic when parliament is in

session. Twice every six months.

The Courts

Beneath the mayor sit the various city courts. Most are

classified according to the topics they hear, and they

typically include courts of chancery, courts of common

pleas, husting courts (for disputes involving commerce

and trade), and the courts martial (for offenses

involving soldiers or disputes between nobles). They

normally include the court of the exchequer as well,

but since the exchequer is a separate body, its court

operates independently of the rest. (See below for more

on the exchequer.)

*Associated Skills:* Craft (any), Decipher Script, Profession

(any), Sense Motive.

*Sample Contact:* Gadwick Fen (expert 2). As a scribe in

the husting courts, Gadwick can provide information

about past or pending suits between city merchants and

tradespeople. Twice per month.

The Exchequer

The city’s fi nancial department, the exchequer is one of

the most powerful and troubled institutions in an urban

fantasy setting. It has its own court (creatively titled the

court of the exchequer), which hears accounts and judicial

pleas relating to fi nes owed the city (or vice versa). It is to

the exchequer—and to its head, specifi cally the Chancellor

of the Exchequer (who is one of the most powerful

individuals in the city)—that the bailiff presents his

fi ndings and funds.

*Associated Skills:* Appraise, Concentration, Profession

(bookkeeper or scribe), Search.

*Sample Contact:* Bartleby Stemple (expert 5). Being a

bookkeeper for the exchequer might be stressful, but it

also provides vital information about who owes money

to the city (or vice versa). Once per month.

CITY SERVICES

Some organizations that are technically part of the city

government do not qualify as political bodies unto themselves.

What follows is a sampling of the most common

sorts of civic services. As in the previous section, each

discussion includes a sample contact upon whom the

PCs can call for favors.

Corpse Collection

In most cities, the less than pleasant duty of disposing

of the dead is left to a special branch of the city

government, typically known as the Corpse Collection

Department. In times of plague, collectors are among

the busiest civil servants in town.

*Sample Contact:* Willis Teegle (commoner 2/expert 1).

For a modest sum (50 gp), Willis will make sure any single body is cremated before being examined, so long as it

won’t be missed. Once only (though a more lucrative fee

might encourage him to repeat the favor).

Maintenance

One of the most basic city services is the maintenance

of public areas, including government buildings, roads,

parks, and street lamps. In cities with no sewage system

to dispose of waste, this extra

(foul) duty also falls on

the shoulders of maintenance

workers.

*Sample Contact:* Stanzon

Grum (commoner

7). For a bribe of 5 gp

or more, Stanzon will

collect all the garbage

found on the property

of any politically

unimportant fi gure and

bring it to the PCs, with

no questions asked. Once

per month.

The Watch

Every urban center has

a militia of this variety,

whether it’s called the

guard, the police, or any number

of similar names. The watch

is the city’s fi rst level of law enforcement;

depending on a city’s

morality and resources, its members

can range from thugs with badges

to well-trained and highly ethical

warriors.

*Sample Contact:* Offi cer Foxleigh

(commoner 1/warrior 2). For a small

consideration (3 gp), Foxleigh will share information

about ongoing investigations to which he is privy, provided

it doesn’t come back to harm him or the watch.

Twice per month.

Houses

A house is an extended family bloodline; members can

often track their ancestry back many generations. It

includes all legitimately born members of the family—

some houses recognize bastards as well, but this stance is

far from universal—unless some family members have

been deliberately cast out for serious transgressions.

Usually, one can join a house only through adoption or

marriage. Someone outside the family might become a

servant or employee of the house—or even be favored

as much as some true members—but he will never

truly belong.

Houses carry the primary name of the family; for

instance, House Ebonmar is the house representing

the family tree of Duke Balthus Ebonmar. Since

people can join the house through marriage and

pass their own names along to their children, not

every member of a house shares the family name. For

example, if Duke Balthus’s sister marries a man

named Randas Arran, his last name does not

change; he simply becomes “Randas Arran

of House Ebonmar.”

Most houses in a fantasy setting

represent noble families. Because descent

and purity of the blood are of

vital social importance to most noble

lines, they track their lineage

with extreme care. The larger

the noble house, the more

power it likely has in the local

government. If House Ebonmar

is the largest noble house in the

kingdom, it probably has more

governmental positions than

any other house, and thus it

might be able to put pressure

on the king or other

nobles to make decisions

in its favor. In most cases,

no single house utterly

dominates a kingdom or city,

except perhaps the royal house

from which the king descends.

The political wrangling between

houses can be fierce, especially in

circumstances where the line of ascension

to the throne is not clear. In

most cases, this conflict is limited to

under-the-table deals, payoffs, favor-trading, blackmail,

and other political maneuvers. On occasion, however,

it can escalate into physical intimidation, kidnapping,

assassination, and even civil war.

The leader of a house is usually its oldest living

member. In some cultures where gender is an issue,

the leader might need to be male, or female, depending

on the particulars. If a younger member of a house

holds an especially important position in society, he

might also serve as house leader, but this situation

is rare. A very few houses elect a leader from among

their ranks, rather than declaring someone to be the

newest ascender to the position.

Many noble houses are known for their skills or abilities

at specifi c tasks. One house might produce famous

warriors, while another might have a long history of artistry or craftsmanship in a particular medium,

while a third might breed the best horses and train the

best riders. Such an ability is usually secondary to a

house’s political ambitions, but savvy house leaders

build on their strengths (such as ensuring that the

bulk of military officers in a region belong to their

own bloodline).

A rarer but growing phenomenon is that of the merchant

house, formed not of noble bloodlines but from

families whose members have gained enough economic

and mercantile influence to be powers in their own

right. They often sit at the heart of merchant guilds or

similar organizations. Many can shape the fi nances of

entire markets by setting prices, intimidating rivals,

and threatening to cut off the flow of certain goods. A

few are powerful enough to influence governments or

noble houses. Most merchant houses have influence

over one or two kinds of commerce—such as textiles or

shipping—but the largest might influence all markets in

a given region. They, too, are normally led by their oldest

living member.

Members of a house always belong to the upper class,

whether the house is of the noble or the merchant variety.

Houses are primarily found in cities where humans

or elves predominate. Gnomes rarely trace their family

lineage back far enough to create houses, while dwarves

and halflings live in communities made up exclusively

of blood relatives. Still, members of those last three

races who have dwelt in a human city or an elf city for

more than a generation or so might find themselves

caught up in politics and could eventually be adopted

into a house.

PLAYER CHARACTERS

AS HOUSE MEMBERS

Upper-class PCs might belong to a local noble or merchant

house, either through blood or marriage. In such

cases, consider allowing them an extra contact before

the start of play. Such a contact must be a member of the

house to which the character belongs. Similarly, a PC who

becomes a member of a house during play—unlikely,

but not impossible, through marriage or adoption as

a reward for service—immediately gains one housebased

contact.

HOUSE PATRONAGE

Far more likely for PCs than joining a house is receiving

the patronage of one. Noble and merchant houses offer

fi nancial and political assistance to individuals—normally

artisans, but sometimes researchers or adventurers—

whom they wish to see succeed. For instance, a house

interested in fi ne art might pay a particularly talented

artist, so she can develop her work without having to

worry about earning a living. Of course, the house expects

something in return for its patronage, which can serve as

a fulcrum for numerous stories and adventures during

the campaign.

GAINING PATRONAGE

If a character has grown famous for her accomplishments

or activities, a house might offer her patronage. If the

character’s activities benefi t that house directly—whether

or not she intends them to—then the likelihood of such

an offer increases signifi cantly.

More proactive characters might actively seek out

the patronage of a noble or mercantile house. Start by

deciding what skill the PC wishes to offer the house.

(Most PCs will likely approach a house as adventurers, but

one with high skill ranks might attempt to gain patronage

as an artist or performer.) To determine which house is

most likely to offer patronage to someone with her skills,

the character must succeed on a DC 10 Knowledge (nobility

and royalty) check or a DC 15 Knowledge (local) or

Knowledge (history) check.

Once the character has chosen which house to

approach, she must arrange a meeting with someone

of standing within it; the precise details depend on

the city and the political situation, but doing so likely

requires at least a DC 15 Diplomacy check. Several days

might pass before even a low-ranking house noble can

meet with the character. Once she finally obtains her

meeting, she must convince the individual that her

services are worth supporting. If she seeks patronage

for a craft, she must produce a sample product or

performance of masterwork quality or its equivalent.

(In other words, she must succeed on a DC 20 check

using the appropriate skill.) If she is instead selling

her services as an adventurer or the like, she must succeed

on a DC 20 Bluff or Diplomacy check to convince

the individual that her deeds are of sufficient merit.

If the PC has already performed great deeds of note,

reduce the check DC by 5 or even 10. If the individual

becomes convinced, the PC has gained the patronage

of the house.

Certain houses might have other requirements as

well, such as offering patronage only to individuals

of a particular race, profession, social status, or the

like. The DM should determine such requirements

as he sees fit, based on the persona and nature of

the house.

BENEFITS OF PATRONAGE

House patronage grants a character several valuable

advantages.

First, the house pays for the PC’s room and board,

up to that allowed by a common lifestyle (*DMG* 130). This outlay is not actually paid to the character, and

thus it cannot be used for anything other than living

expenses.

Second, the character gains one free contact from

among the house members.

Third, the house occasionally helps supply the PC for a

task, whether creating a fantastic piece of art or setting out

on an adventure to rid the highways of marauding ogres.

The house supplies the PC with equipment, the total value

of which never exceeds the normal amount owned by a

6th-level NPC (*DMG* 127) or an NPC of one level lower

than the PC’s level, whichever is smaller. The precise

nature of the equipment—weapons or tools, mystical

or mundane—depends on the nature and resources of

the house itself. The house expects this equipment to be

returned within a week or two, and offers such assistance

only twice per year (or a third time with a successful

DC 25 Diplomacy check).

Finally, the PC can use her affiliation with the house

to open doors and cut through bureaucracy. By using

the house’s name, she can add a +2 circumstance bonus

on any Diplomacy or noncombat Intimidate checks

made against anyone familiar with the house’s clout

(except as noted below), and a +4 circumstance bonus

on any Diplomacy or Gather Information checks

made while dealing with members or employees of

the house.

DRAWBACKS OF PATRONAGE

While patronage has many advantages, it includes its

share of drawbacks as well.

First, the PC is expected to regularly publicize her

affi liation with the house—and even if she doesn’t,

the house will, hoping to make her famous and thus

increase its own glory. The PC takes a –2 penalty on all

Disguise checks, and on any Bluff checks made to hide

or downplay her affi liation with the house. Similarly,

when dealing with anyone who considers the house an

enemy (such as a major political rival), the PC takes a

–2 penalty on Diplomacy checks instead of gaining the

usual +2 bonus.

The house expects the PC to do favors and perform

tasks for it. In the case of an artist, such obligations

might involve creating a particular work as commissioned

by one of the house members. Adventurers

might be asked to undertake specific quests, or provide

protection for house members. Whatever the

specific requirements, the PC must spend, on average,

at least 10 hours per week working on tasks assigned

by the house. Failure to do so results in loss of patronage,

as described below.

The PC is forbidden from developing close alliances or

contacts with anyone the house considers an enemy or

rival. Similarly, unless the house has criminal ties, the

character is forbidden to fraternize or develop contacts

within the underworld.

LOSS OF PATRONAGE

Should the character ever fail in an assigned task—or

in *any* task that garners public awareness (such as an

attempt to rid the city of a haunting, or to successfully

open an art gallery)—the house immediately withdraws

its patronage, not wishing to be associated with failure.

Similarly, the house cuts all ties if the PC ever falls out

of public favor, such as being convicted of a major crime

(whether truly guilty or not), or makes an enemy of a

public fi gure the house cannot afford to alienate (such

as a monarch).

HOUSE TYPES

Although houses cannot be as neatly categorized as

guilds or organizations, most of them focus on one area

of expertise above all others. The following sections

detail six primary types of houses—both noble and

nonnoble—to be found in a standard fantasy city. These

divisions represent the different primary concerns a

house can have; each house usually has many other

interests and areas of influence as well.

Each discussion below includes four pieces of information

that the DM and the players can make use of.

“Associated Classes” identifi es the sorts of people to

whom a house is most likely to grant patronage, though

these are not necessarily exhaustive.

“Associated Skills” mentions those talents for which

the house is most widely known. Characters born into a

house must purchase at least 1 rank in one of its associated

skills. Houses are more likely to grant patronage to

someone with at least 4 ranks in an associated skill. A

character who does not have either levels in an associated

class or ranks in an associated skill is unlikely to ever

receive patronage from that house.

“Supplies Available” indicates the sort of assistance the

house might provide on occasions when it is prepared

to assist the PCs in a task.

“Sample Contact,” just as in earlier sections of this

chapter, is a brief description of an NPC associated

with the house and the favor he or she might provide

to a character or characters who enjoy the house’s

support.

MERCANTILE

Most mercantile houses are nonnoble families; although

a select few noble bloodlines have taken up an interest

in trade, such activities are usually considered

vulgar and cause other nobles to look down upon

those individuals. Mercantile houses normally have

substantial interest in one or two areas of trade, owning many business, warehouses, and caravans. A

few have broader reach, influencing the markets of an

entire city or region. They often use their inf luence

to guide the actions of local governments, threatening

to withhold resources or granting discounts to

certain nobles in exchange for favorable treatment.

Some mercantile houses own entire towns or hire

soldiers to patrol their trade routes. (Whether these

are true patrols designed to keep the road safe or paid

brigands intended to harass the house’s competitors

depends on the house.)

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, bard, expert, rogue.

Associated Skills: Appraise, Craft, Diplomacy,

Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty),

Profession.

Supplies Available: Merchant houses can normally

provide mundane traveling necessities, mounts,

vehicles, and petty cash. A mercantile house known

for a particular product might be able to provide that

as well.

Sample Contact: Halliman Hillback of House

Ironthrone (expert 4/rogue 1). Halliman will aid a PC

in haggling for a good deal on a particular transaction

(+2 bonus on the PC’s Diplomacy check). Once every

two weeks.

MILITARY

Military houses boast a strong tradition of soldiering

service. They produce a large number of officers

and generals, and they gain the most political power

during wartime. They are often positioned to profit

from wars by running and supporting weaponsmiths,

mercenary companies, and the like; less scrupulous

military houses often attempt to instigate conf lict

where none exists in hopes of increasing their fortunes.

Some military houses make a practice of sponsoring

adventurers (hoping that their glory and success will

add to the house’s reputation), while others eschew the

use of outside warriors, insisting that they alone are

capable of handling any threat. Military houses frequently

parlay their clout on the battlefi eld into political

power, for they know full well that a kingdom is nothing

without its armies.

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert, fighter,

hexblade (Complete Warrior), paladin, psychic warrior

(Expanded Psionics Handbook), ranger, warmage (Complete

Arcane), warrior.

Associated Skills: Craft (armorsmithing), Craft

(weaponsmithing), Handle Animal, Knowledge (nobility

and royalty), Ride.

Supplies Available: Any mundane weapons and

armor, war mounts, and riding gear. Additionally, the

house might provide magic weapons or armor, but never

in excess of 75% of the total aid provided.

Sample Contact: Sir Benedict de Langahas (fi ghter

7). Sir Benedict will provide a small mercenary company

consisting of six warriors, each of one-half the PCs’ average

level (maximum 6th), to aid the group in one specifi c

battle. Once per year.

MYSTICAL

A mystical house is known for the power of its magic.

In many instances, this is literally in the family’s blood;

many of its members are born sorcerers (or warlocks,

if that class is used). In other cases, the house might

simply study wizardry or other magical arts on a regular

basis. Mystical houses often hold great power in a city,

particularly in areas well known for monsters or strange

beings. At the same time, other nobles distrust mystical

houses, never certain from where they gain their powers,

or with whom their true allegiance lies. Some mystical

houses feature psionic powers rather than magic, at the

DM’s discretion.

Associated Classes: Adept, aristocrat, psion (Expanded

Psionics Handbook), sorcerer, spellthief (Complete Adventurer),

warlock (Complete Arcane), wilder (Expanded Psionics

Handbook), wizard.

Associated Skills: Craft, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge

(history), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge

(psionics), Spellcraft.

Supplies Available: A mystical house can provide

expensive spell components, or various magic items

such as potions, scrolls, wands, and minor wondrous

items. Additionally, it can contribute to the cost of

creating a magic item (the exact amount depends on

the circumstances).

Sample Contact: Salassra the Green, of House

Arbathyre (wizard 5). Salassra will cast any single spell

of 3rd level or lower necessary for the creation of a magic

item. Once every three months.

PATRON OF THE ARTS

Regardless of where they actually gain their power,

some houses are best known as patrons of the arts. They

support painters, sculptors, and musicians—any artist

whom they might transform into the “latest thing,” and

thus share in the ensuing glory and prestige. Invariably,

of course, popularity fades, and the house moves on to

other artists. Patrons of the arts rarely sponsor adventurers,

but they might occasionally do so if their territory

or membership is endangered. They frequently support

artists, of course, and a PC with a high artistic skill might

gain patronage that way.

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert, bard.

Associated Skills: Craft, Knowledge (nobility and

royalty), Perform, Profession, Speak Language.

Supplies Available: The house can supply all manner of

mundane equipment. It can also supply minor wondrous items, whose value cannot exceed 50% of the total aid

provided. Depending upon its other interests, it might

be able to provide alternate materials at the DM’s option,

but never to the same extent as other houses more fully

invested in those areas.

Sample Contact: Baroness Elspath Silverweave (aristocrat

4/bard 2). The baroness will provide raw materials

for the creation of a single work of art (not weapons,

armor, or equipment), the value of which cannot exceed

100 gp. Once per month.

POLITICAL

The most common sort of noble house focuses on

politics. Such houses certainly have other interests—

businesses, military positions, and the like—but they

are all side enterprises: means to an end. Their children

are raised from infancy to take charge, trained in the

arts of deal-making and ruling. Some seek to do well

by their people, but many simply want power for the

family, and they’ll do whatever it takes to obtain it. Their

staples include trading in favors, spreading rumors, and

blackmail, and even those political houses that try to rise

above such activities must master them if they wish to

survive. Political houses often cultivate ties with local

religions, since the church is often the only institution

with enough power to rival the government.

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, bard, cleric, fi ghter,

rogue.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate,

Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Knowledge

(nobility and royalty), Sense Motive.

Supplies Available: A political house can supply

most mundane equipment, as well as magic items

relating to enchantment and divination magics (never

worth more than 75% of their total assistance), or other

wondrous items or magic weapons (never worth more

than 25% of their total assistance). It can also supply

ready cash.

Sample Contact: Lord Caspar Galaint of House

Ebonmar (aristocrat 8). Caspar will arrange for the PC

to see a noble or city official who cannot normally be

contacted through mundane channels. Once every

6 months.

UNDERWORLD

While a number of noble or mercantile houses possess

criminal ties, a rare few are known primarily for their

underworld dealings. In some instances, the house’s

illegal activities might be publicly known, but the family

is clever or powerful enough that the local authorities

cannot prosecute. In other instances, a city might be so

corrupt that overt criminal houses are the norm; this

is most often the case when a criminal house holds the

greatest power in the city.

Some of these houses earn much of their income

through illicit activities, but others are nonnoble

bloodlines that have risen to power—at least in the

underworld, and possibly in more legitimate circles

as well—by funneling criminal profits into legal

pursuits (think of them as a fantasy equivalent of the

modern-day Mafia). Such houses are among the most

frequent patrons of adventurers, since they always

have dangerous or dirty tasks that need doing. Goodaligned

characters should always beware of making

deals with them.

Associated Classes: Barbarian, expert, fi ghter, ranger,

rogue, spellthief (*Complete Warrior*), warrior.

Associated Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Forgery, Gather

Information, Intimidate, Knowledge (local).

Supplies Available: An underworld house can provide

any supplies necessary, up to the maximum allotment.

However, 25% of such supplies are stolen or smuggled

goods, and the PCs caught with them might fi nd themselves

in severe legal trouble.

Sample Contact: Ronto Riddimas (rogue 6/assassin

2). Ronto will assassinate any single individual of a level

lower than his, so long as the target is not especially well

protected. Once only.

Guilds

A guild is an organization formed to protect the interests

and pursuits of people involved in the same general

trade or activity. Within that broad defi nition, a guild

can appear in countless different forms: large or small,

weak or powerful, public or secretive. From the tailors

who band together to battle import tariffs, to the religious

malcontents who form their own united front against

the oppression of the government, to the thieves’ organization

that operates in the heart of the poor quarter,

guilds are everywhere in a fantasy city. Even two guilds

of the same type might differ wildly in appearance and

behavior, depending on the people who join and the city

in which they dwell.

Small, weak guilds often do little more than provide

members a place to belong (and perhaps a bit of

financial support), but powerful guilds control entire

economic markets, and might even guide the course

of their local government. Consider, for instance, a

guild that controls the shipping and sale of lumber

in a city far from any source of wood, or a powerful

mercenary guild that protects a city with an otherwise

weak militia. In both cases, the municipal government

cannot afford to alienate the guild, giving it substantial

leverage to make demands. A guild that becomes this

powerful often fixes prices, drafts legislation favorable

to it, or dominates markets otherwise unrelated

to its pursuits.

GUILD MEMBERSHIP

It is far easier to join a guild than to gain the patronage of

a noble house. In fact, in some cities, people of a certain

profession might be required to join the local guild. Guild

membership can be an attractive prospect, though most

guilds appeal only to characters who stand to gain from

belonging, rather than the party as a whole.

That said, many guilds will be of no interest to PCs. It is

unlikely that an adventurer has much interest in joining

a butchers or bakers guild in his spare time, even if he

possesses some skill at butchery or cooking. Adventuring-

oriented guilds might attract his interest, however,

and some characters might indeed seek to join a more

mundane guild, if only for a way to earn some money or

to practice their skills.

JOINING A GUILD

Joining a guild is a simple enough prospect; one simply

approaches it and petitions for membership. Finding

the guildhouse of a particular guild typically requires

a DC 10 Gather Information or Knowledge (local)

check. A more covert association, such as a thieves or

assassins guild, might require a DC 20 or even a DC

25 check. Some secret societies are so well hidden that

the party must seek out clues through investigation

and adventuring before attempting a supremely difficult

(DC 30) skill check. This check can also reveal

other information about the guild, such as its general

membership requirements, operating procedures, and

so on.

It is also possible that, if someone has obtained fame

or notoriety for a certain skill, the relevant guild might

approach him directly. This is a relatively rare occurrence,

however; once someone has mastered a skill to

such an extent, he is more likely to form his own guild

than to join a preexisting one. Additionally, an established

master is not only far less easily influenced, but

far more likely to seek a position of leadership in any

organization to which he belongs . . . possibly displacing

one of the current guildmasters in the process. Still,

some guilds do approach famous practitioners of their

selected craft, especially if they believe the benefits

outweigh the risks.

The various guild types each have associated classes

and associated skills. In most cases, a petitioner must

either belong to one of these classes or possess 4 ranks in

at least one skill to be accepted for membership. Exceptions

to this rule are possible, however, if a character

has abilities that the guild can clearly use. For instance,

a mercenary guild might accept a sorcerer or warmage

into its ranks, if his or her spells would be of particular

use on the battlefi eld.

Some guilds have additional requirements, such as

passing initiation rites or belonging to a certain race

or religion.

Finally, most guilds gain the bulk of their income

through entry fees and membership dues. The average

guild requires a one-time entrance fee of 25 gp from

a new member, and monthly dues equal to 5 gp per

level. (These fees might be higher in richer cities or

campaigns, or lower in poorer cities or less economically

inflated campaigns.)

BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP

Most guilds provide a standard set of benefits, available

to all members. While they might vary slightly in

specifics, they are generally the same from one guild

to the next.

Most guildhouses include barracks and kitchens,

guaranteeing members food and a safe place to sleep

if needed.

Guild members help one another out. The initial

attitude (*PH* 72) of a fellow member is always one step

closer to helpful than normal. Additionally, a character

gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and

Gather Information checks made when dealing with

a fellow member.

A guild subsidizes the cost of goods, supplies, and

services related to its chosen fi eld, reducing the price to

a member by 10%.

A guild can provide monetary loans to members who

have fallen on hard times. Successfully requesting a

loan requires a Diplomacy check, with a cumulative

–2 penalty for each previous such request made by

that individual to that guild. The DC depends on the

amount requested.

Success indicates that the borrower receives the money,

and has one month to pay it back. Should he or she fail to

meet the deadline, he or she is (at the very least) expelled

from the guild. Some guilds—particularly criminal

organizations—have much sterner penalties.

Table 3–2: Guild Loans

Desired Loan Amount Diplomacy DC

Up to the member’s monthly dues 15

Up to the member’s monthly dues × 10 20

Up to the member’s monthly dues × 100 25

Every guild member gains a contact specifi c to his or

her guild.

In addition to the above benefi ts, particularly active

guild members gain additional benefi ts, depending on

the type of guild. This requires the PC to gain the Favored

feat (see page 61).

DRAWBACKS OF MEMBERSHIP

The most obvious drawback to guild membership is,

of course, the monthly dues. While most adventurers

should have little problem earning this much money,

a slow month can cause problems. A member in good

standing might be given one month’s leeway, but if she

fails to pay her dues (including back-dues) by then, she

is expelled.

Additionally, many guilds have enemies or rivals

among the other guilds of the city. The starting attitude

of a member of a rival guild is one step closer to hostile

than it would normally be.

Guild members have certain responsibilities which

they must perform in order to maintain their standing.

In some cases, these are fairly minor, such as keeping

the guild apprised of certain topics. In others, this

responsibility might involve donating a percentage of

earnings, or seeking guild permission to undertake

certain actions.

An individual who fails to pay her dues or perform her

duties for more than two consecutive months is expelled

from the guild. Similarly, a member who compromises

the guild in some manner, such as providing information

to rival guilds, is also expelled. Expulsion results

in the immediate loss of all benefi ts gained from the

guild, as well as from the Favored feat (if applicable). If

the individual was expelled for failure to perform her

duties, all attitudes of guild members return to normal.

If she was expelled for betraying the guild, the attitudes

of guild members are one step closer to hostile than they

would normally be. Some guilds, particularly criminal

organizations, might enact steeper penalties—up to

and including attempted assassination—in the face

of betrayal.

GUILD TYPES

A single city can have an enormous number of guilds.

What follows is not a comprehensive list, but rather a

breakdown of the general types of guilds most likely

found within a typical fantasy metropolis. The DM

should customize these guilds as he sees fit. Each

guild should have a unique name, of course, but

certain mechanical details might be altered as well.

For instance, a smugglers guild might be based on the

criminal guild, described below, but with Profession

(sailor) substituted for Disable Device in the associated

skills list.

As discussed above, potential members should have

at least one level in an associated class or 4 ranks in an

associated skill. “Duties” describes certain actions or

concessions members are expected to undertake on the

guild’s behalf. “Favored Benefits” lists the advantages

a member gains for taking the Favored feat with this

particular guild.

ADVENTURERS GUILDS

This guild is designed expressly for those who battle

monsters, hunt treasure, and explore unknown lands.

It is far less common than most other types of guilds,

and is not appropriate for all campaigns. An adventurers

guild is an excellent spot for members to relax, share

tales of their exploits, pick up rumors of evil cults within

the city or lost ruins without, and meet with prospective

employers. Many people looking to hire adventurers

come to an adventurers guild fi rst. In addition, PCs can

easily acquire adventuring hirelings or cohorts through

the guild, or hire freelance spellcasters to cast spells

such as identify or restoration. In both cases, the guild

keeps track of its members’ abilities, and often directs

potential employers to the adventurer or party that best

fits their needs.

In settings where adventuring parties can be licensed

and registered, such as certain regions of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS® campaign setting, the guild can handle the

necessary paperwork.

An adventurers guild offers one additional, and

unusual, service. Any time a member embarks on an

adventure, he can, if he chooses, ask that the guild send

out a search party if he fails to return by a specified time.

He must tell the guild exactly where he expects to be. If such a search party successfully locates and rescues

a trapped or injured adventurer, the search party and

the guild each receive 40% of any treasure and valuables

the rescued member found on that quest, as the price

for their assistance.

Examples: Explorers guild, monster hunters guild.

Associated Classes: All PC classes.

Associated Skills: Decipher Script, Disable Device,

Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering),

Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Knowledge

(religion), Knowledge (the planes), Ride, Search, Survival,

Use Magic Device.

Duties: Members must keep the guild apprised of

their abilities and notify the guild when they are undertaking

an adventure or quest. They are not required to

accept any job offers the guild might point their way, but

constant refusal of employment might eventually upset

the guildmasters. Finally, members must be willing, if

asked, to embark on a quest to rescue or discern the fate

of other missing guild members. They are only required

to accept such a mission once per year (if that often), but

doing so more frequently is a good way to gain popularity

within the guild. Finally, all members are expected to

pay the guild 10% of the value of any treasure or goods

they fi nd on their adventures, in addition to the regular

monthly dues.

Favored Benefits: The character can request a

rescue or search party, as mentioned above, but with

a lower cost. While the search party is still entitled

to 40% of the character’s treasure, the guild takes only

the standard 10% for the quest, leaving the character

with 50% rather than a mere 20%. Additionally, the

guild sends potential employers—particularly wealthy

ones—the character’s way with great frequency. He

gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks

when haggling with a potential employer who contacts

him through the guild.

Sample Contact: Barak One-Hand (half-orc bard

4/ranger 7). Barak has traveled all over the region, fought

and studied numerous monsters, and explored many

legends, and is happy to share his knowledge when

asked (+2 bonus on PC’s Knowledge \[arcana], Knowledge

\[dungeoneering], Knowledge \[geography], Knowledge

\[nature], Knowledge \[religion], Knowledge \[the planes],

or Bardic Knowledge checks made when researching any

potential danger or quest). Once per month.

ARCANE GUILDS

An arcane guild consists primarily of spellcasters, but

occasionally boasts noncasting members, such as experts

who practice alchemy. Wizards make up the majority of

guild members, with bards, sorcerers, and other casters

a distinct minority. These guilds offer comfortable and

well-stocked libraries for research, and laboratories for

experimentation. Perhaps more important, they offer

an environment where casters can exchange ideas and

theories, or simply interact with those who actually

understand them. Arcane guilds are also valuable as

political leverage in cities where governments or common

folk distrust the use of magic.

Examples: Mages guild, alchemists guild.

Associated Classes: Adept, artificer (*EBERRON*

*Campaign Setting*), expert, sorcerer, warlock (*Complete*

*Arcane*), wizard.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Craft (alchemy),

Decipher Script, Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Use

Magic Device.

Duties: The member must provide to the guild

a copy of any new spell or scholastic discovery he

researches.

Favored Benefi ts: The guild subsidizes the creation

of magic items, reducing the character’s raw materials

cost by 5%.

Sample Contact: Zinadria Hatherford (human

wizard 7). Zinadria will provide the PC, or one of his

companions, the opportunity to copy one spell out of

her spellbook. Once every 6 months.

CRIMINAL GUILDS

These organizations are illegal and highly secretive,

except in particularly corrupt cities. They exist for

one purpose: to protect their members from the law,

the citizenry, and rival criminals. A criminal guild

offers its members somewhere to train, compare notes,

learn of opportunities, fence stolen goods, or simply

lie low for a time. It is particularly valuable as a means

of fi nding employment, since those who require an

illicit service often approach the guild (which in turn

farms the job out to a specifi c member). Membership

in the guild is a powerful tool for intimidation and

negotiation when dealing with those who know of the

organization’s power.

Criminal guilds occasionally have an underworld

house at the center of their power structure.

Examples: Assassins guild, thieves guild.

Associated Classes: Bard, fighter, rogue, scout

(*Complete Adventurer*).

Associated Skills: Bluff, Disable Device, Forgery,

Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Sleight of Hand.

Duties: Members must keep all details of the guild

secret from nonmembers. They must avoid robbing or

otherwise victimizing anyone the guild has declared

off limits (either because the individual is paying protection

money, or because he poses too great a risk of

drawing attention). A member is not required to take

every job the guild asks her to perform, but she should

have a good reason for refusing. She must obtain guild

permission before undertaking any large criminal endeavor. Finally, she must pay to the guild 15% of all

profits made from criminal activities, on top of her

monthly dues.

Favored Benefi ts: The guild provides access to the

black market and stolen goods. A member can obtain

many goods for a discount, in any city where the guild

maintains a presence. The chance of fi nding a specifi c

discounted item is a flat 85% for mundane items, 50%

for minor magic items, 25% for medium magic items,

and 10% for major magic items. If they are available,

mundane items can be purchased for a 10% discount,

while magic items are discounted 5%. Note that these

items are stolen or contraband, and a PC caught with an

identifi ably stolen item on his person could be arrested

and charged.

Sample Contact: Colben Shey (human bard 5).

Through a combination of clever lies, forgeries, and

a group of “witnesses” he keeps available at all times,

Colben can provide an airtight alibi for the PC, insisting

that he was in one place when he was actually in another.

Once every 4 months.

GLADIATORIAL STABLES

Many cities have arenas where gladiators battle it

out—against one another or against various fearsome

beasts—for the entertainment of the masses. While

many gladiators are slaves, free fi ghters also participate

in public matches. A gladiatorial stable is a small guild,

usually consisting of a number of gladiators, support

staff such as healers and trainers, and an owner or manager.

Some arenas do not accept free fi ghters who do not

belong to an established stable. Even if they do, stable

managers often have the contacts and clout to arrange

better and more profi table fi ghts. A reputable gladiatorial

stable provides free healing to its members (at least

for injuries sustained in the arena), arranges matches

between foes, and offers to invest a gladiator’s profi ts in

other enterprises if the gladiator so chooses. It can also

provide most nonmagical equipment a gladiator might

request, though he can usually use such items only in the

arena, not on outside adventures.

Unlike other guilds, gladiatorial stables do not require

monthly dues. They make their profits on fees from

the gladiators’ matches (and from betting on the side,

of course).

Associated Classes: Barbarian, cleric, fi ghter, hexblade

(Complete Warrior), monk, ranger, rogue, scout

(Complete Adventurer), warrior.

Associated Skills: Balance, Climb, Heal, Intimidate,

Jump, Perform, Tumble.

Duties: The stable earns 30% of a gladiator’s purse per

match (see sidebar). Members must fi ght in the local arena

at least once a week, unless they have a solid excuse, or

else risk expulsion from the stable (or at least additional

fi nancial penalties on their subsequent matches, to make

up for the loss).

Favored Benefits: So long as the privilege is not

abused, the stable heals a gladiator of injuries suffered

outside the arena as well as within. Additionally, in one

out of every four matches, the stable takes only 20% of

the purse, rather than 30%.

Sample Contact: Albrechd Bearer (human cleric 5).

Albrechd will cast a single enhancing spell—such as aid

or bull’s strength—on the PC before a match (something

that is offi cially frowned upon unless cleared ahead of

time). Once every 4 months.

GOVERNMENT GUILDS

Government guilds are unusual in that they blur the

line between municipal and private organizations.

Many cities lack such guilds—government employees

simply work at the behest of their ruler or the city itself.

In regions where government guilds do exist, they take

one of three forms.

In the fi rst form, there is literally no difference between

the guild and the city department it represents. Everyone

who works in that department is a guild member. The

department itself is a guild in only the loosest sense

of the word; it’s a portion of the city government that

provides its members guildlike benefi ts. Government

guilds of this sort do not require dues of their members,

financing themselves instead through taxes and city

monies. Characters who join such a guild can actually

earn a regular (if relatively small) income, but are

required to spend the bulk of their time working for

the city and guild.

In the second form, the city government subcontracts

certain duties to a guild rather than undertaking them

directly. For instance, a government might hire a guild

to permanently oversee its city watch or handle road

maintenance rather than running those departments

itself. As above, everyone who works in that department

is a guild member, and the guild is fi nanced through city

monies rather than dues.

The final variety is a guild in the traditional sense:

a private organization, made up of city employees and

usually drawn from the same department. Membership

is not required (or at least the city doesn’t require

it; the guild might strongarm people into joining).

City workers join the guild for extra benefits, or as a

means of gaining some leverage with the government,

allowing the guild to negotiate for better pay and

hours. This type of guild requires the standard dues

of its members.

Examples: City watch, street cleaners guild, embassy.

Associated Classes: Depends on the specifi c department,

but often includes aristocrat, cleric, expert, and

fighter.

Associated Skills: Depends on the specifi c department,

but often includes Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather

Information, Intimidate, Knowledge (nobility and

royalty), and Sense Motive.

Duties: Each member of a government guild must

spend at least 10 hours a week working for the guild.

Favored Benefi ts: The character gains a +1 bonus on

Diplomacy and Intimidate checks with members of any

guild. (When dealing with members of his own guild,

these bonuses stack with the standard guild bonuses.)

Sample Contact: Sarruel Thorp (human aristocrat

3/expert 3). Sarruel knows how to pull the right strings

and can exempt the PCs from paying one specifi c fee to

the city, be it a fi ne for minor criminal activity or a tax

on a large treasure haul. Once per year.

LABORERS GUILDS

Another relatively small but growing phenomenon,

laborers guilds are associations of unskilled, low-paid,

physical laborers who have banded together for mutual

support. Usually, such groups organize in the hope that

suffi cient numbers might grant them some of the influence

and authority they lack individually. The guild not

only provides laborers with a place to gather and share

their grievances, it attempts to negotiate with employers

and the city government for wages and working conditions.

No single laborer has any real clout, but a few of

the larger laborers guilds have garnered a fair amount

of respect.

Many laborers guilds must weather assaults—usually

economic and political, but in some cases literal—from

businesses or even government departments. Most

employers, after all, dislike it when their workers band

together and insist on higher wages. Although a great

many laborers guilds are entirely legitimate, a portion

of them have allied with criminal organizations as a

means of protecting themselves from government or

business reprisals.

Laborers guilds still require dues from their members,

but the cost is normally lower than other guilds. It varies

from guild to guild, but a fee of 1 or 2 gp per level, rather

than 5, is standard. Entry fees (when they are not waived)

average 5 to 10 gp.

Examples: Dockworkers guild, teamsters guild.

Associated Classes: Commoner, warrior.

Associated Skills: None. Common and untrained

laborers are the primary members of these guilds.

Duties: Members are required to support their guild

and their fellow members in all confrontations. This can

mean joining in demonstrations, or even going on strike

(regardless of the fi nancial hardship it causes) when asked

to do so.

Favored Benefits: Members gain a +1 bonus on

Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when negotiating with

potential employers. When performing basic physical

labor, members can expect to be paid 5% to 10% more

than the standard value for those services.

Sample Contact: Colson of Archer Street (human

commoner 5). Colson serves as a foreman and can arrange

for a labor crew to perform simple physical tasks, such

as carrying goods or driving wagons, for 1d3 days. Once

every 2 months.

MERCANTILE GUILDS

Mercantile guilds are the most common form of guild in

most fantasy cities. Each is typically devoted to a single

craft or profession, or at most a small group of closely

related trades. A mercantile guild provides its members

a place to meet and discuss business with fellow tradesfolk,

protection from fraud and theft, and in the case

of more powerful guilds, safety from criminal guilds

or excessive taxation by the government. The richest

guilds might even offer loans for a member to start up

or expand a business.

A few larger mercantile guilds oversee not a specifi c

craft, but an entire market. These guilds accept all artisans

and tradesfolk as members, and they have an enormous

amount of political clout. On the other hand, they often

require merchants to join before allowing them to set

up shop in “their” city, and can often force independents

out by undercutting prices, intercepting shipments, and

the like.

Examples: Carpenters guild, smiths guild, the Dragonport

Merchants’ Consortium.

Associated Classes: Expert, rogue.

Associated Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Craft (any one),

Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Profession (any one),

Speak Language.

Duties: In addition to monthly dues, a member must

pay a 15% monthly tax on all profi ts acquired from guildaffi

liated businesses.

Favored Benefi ts: Membership in the guild is a sign

of quality merchandise. Members can charge an average

of 5% more than the standard market value on their goods

and services in any city where the organization maintains

a guildhouse.

Sample Contact: Tholo Olivander (halfling expert

4). Tholo will identify the source of any item—region,

culture, perhaps even its creator if it’s distinctive enough.

Once per week.

MERCENARY GUILDS

Like an adventurers guild, a mercenary guild is a place

of safety and camaraderie for those who live lives of

great danger. The guild provides a centralized location

to procure employment, receiving contracts from those

who need hired swords and passing them along to its

members. In most cases, the reputation of the guild

as a whole attracts more (and wealthier) clients than

any individual might on his own. Some guilds provide

healing for their members; this is not free, or even discounted,

but at least the individual always knows where

to fi nd an available cleric. Similarly, the guildhouse is

considered a place of safety, where a member can go to

avoid enemies or simply leave the combat and carnage

behind for a short while. In an urban environment, the

guild serves to legitimize its members: City governments

tolerate members of recognized guilds far more readily

than they would independent swords-for-hire wandering

around their streets.

Examples: District/neighborhood watch, mercenary

company.

Associated Classes: Barbarian, fighter, hexblade

(*Complete Warrior*), monk, ranger, soulknife (*Expanded*

*Psionics Handbook*), warrior.

Associated Skills: Climb, Handle Animal, Intimidate,

Jump, Ride, Use Rope.

Duties: A mercenary guild requires its members to

spend no fewer than 20 hours a week on missions and

patrols. Generally, such duties are fairly safe and do not

require much combat. In times of war or danger, however,

members must support whatever cause the guild does.

With a successful DC 25 Diplomacy check, a member can

have an adventure with her companions registered as a

“patrol,” if the adventure somehow advances the cause of

the guild or its employer, or is intended to pacify an area

of the guild employer’s territory. This counts toward the

guild’s required weekly duty. Each additional attempt to

register an adventure as a “patrol” increases the Diplomacy

check DC by 2.

Favored Benefi ts: Members of the same mercenary

guild learn complementary combat tactics. Whenever

a member is adjacent to another member, each of them

gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class.

Sample Contact: Oriak Soulburn (human hexblade

6). Oriak will accompany the PC on an adventure up to

one day in length. Once only.

PERFORMERS GUILDS

Performers band together in guilds both to enable

them to put on larger and more spectacular shows, and

for the same reasons common laborers do: to gain the

protection, respect, and authority they cannot acquire as

individuals. A performers guild promotes entertainment

events and combines members with complementary

talents (such as grouping dancers with musicians, or

actors with bards who can create illusory backdrops and

special effects). The guild aids its members in fi nding

taverns or theaters in which to ply their trade, or—if the

guild maintains a headquarters large enough to double

as a theater—draws patrons to them. The guild also

provides areas to rehearse and other performers who

can aid in practice or critique performances.

Examples: Acting troupe, minstrels’ society, traveling

circus.

Associated Classes: Bard, expert, rogue, wizard

(illusionist).

Associated Skills: Balance, Disguise, Diplomacy,

Escape Artist, Perform (any one), Sleight of Hand, Tumble.

(Additionally, Handle Animal is common in circuses.)

Duties: Members must perform their chosen services

in support of other guild members as necessary. This

normally requires 1d4–1 days (4 hours/day) each week.

Favored Benefits: In any city wherein the guild

maintains a guildhouse, the member can substitute a

Perform or Profession check for a Diplomacy or Gather

Information check by offering her services for free.

In addition, she earns twice the normal income when

using her Perform or Profession skill to earn money.

These uses of Perform or Profession must match those

with which the character has earned guild membership. For example, a character who joined the guild as

an actor cannot apply this benefi t to Profession (blacksmith)

checks.

Sample Contact: Gerdi Tindertwig (halfling bard

3/expert 3). Gerdi will provide performers and entertainment

for a special occasion. Once per year.

PSIONIC GUILDS

A psionic guild is dedicated to exploring the secrets of the

mind, making new discoveries, and enhancing the power

of its members through shared resources and techniques.

Psions make up the bulk of its members, but other psionic

classes—and even the occasional enchantment-focused

arcanist—are often welcome.

Although their trappings are very different, psionic

guilds often resemble arcane guilds in their general setup

and methods of operation.

Examples: College of psychics, soothsayers guild.

Associated Classes: Psion (*Expanded Psionics Handbook*),

wilder (*Expanded Psionics Handbook*).

Associated Skills: Autohypnosis, Concentration, Knowledge

(psionics), Psicraft, Use Psionic Device.

Duties: The member must share with the guild any

new power or scholastic lore he discovers.

Favored Benefi ts: The guild subsidizes the creation

of psionic items, reducing the character’s raw materials

cost by 5%.

Sample Contact: Aryn Lhal (maenad psion \[telepath]

6). Aryn will use *read thoughts* on a captured foe. Once

per month.

RACIAL GUILDS

Unlike most other guilds, racial guilds are united not

by common interest or a common business, but by

common heritage. They allow members of a minority

race—such as elves or halflings in a human city—to

interact, speak their own tongue, exchange offers of

employment, share news from home, and simply relax

in a place designed to accommodate them. In cities

where prejudice and oppression exist, these guilds also

fight for the rights of their members. In most cases, this

activity means putting political and economic pressure

on local merchants and, if at all possible, the government.

Tales even exist of racial guilds taking up arms

against the leaders of a city in open revolt. Alas, most

such tales end in defeat; such guilds are not particularly

powerful organizations.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, only members

of the race to which the guild is dedicated can join. In

a select few instances, the guild allows members from

other races, if they are truly devoted to helping create a

better world for the guild’s primary race.

Examples: Elves’ Consortium, the Goblin Liberation

Front.

Associated Classes: Varies by race, but always includes

the race’s favored class.

Associated Skills: Varies by race, but always includes

any skills on which the race gains a racial bonus.

Duties: Members must do their best to advance the

cause of the guild’s race. Wherever possible, they must

buy goods and services from members of that race, and

support political candidates of that race.

Favored Benefits: Members gain a +1 bonus on

Diplomacy and Gather Information checks involving

any member of that race who knows of the guild’s

existence.

Sample Contact: Dugal Ruunahuun (dwarf fighter 5). Dugal will accompany the PC on a single adventure, so long as it promises to involve a conflict with orcs, goblinoids, or giants. Once only.

RELIGIOUS GUILDS

A religious guild is either an association of followers of the same faith, or a multidenominational organization allowing membership from a select group of religions. In either case, a religious guild is not the same thing as a sect or cult. Such guilds might be secret orders within the larger confines of a church; an assembly of people with a particular goal (such as protecting the faith from enemies or proselytizing to the masses); or even a gathering of religious individuals belonging to a specific profession, such as a society of priests or a group of temple guards. Any sort of intrachurch organization, such as an order of holy warriors or a group of scholars dedicated to researching ancient myths, might also qualify as a guild, though less formalized or smaller groups might be better portrayed as organizations (see below).

Examples: Knightly order, secret order devoted to forbidden research.

Associated Classes: Cleric, expert, favored soul (*Complete Divine*), paladin.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (any one other), Spellcraft.

Duties: Members must observe and adhere to the specific tenets and strictures of their faith. Additionally, some orders might require partial or complete secrecy regarding their activities, membership, or even existence. Finally, if a religious guild is dedicated to a specific purpose (such as research or proselytizing), members must spend at least 1d4 days (4 hours/day) each week engaged in that activity.

Favored Benefits: The member’s faith and understanding of her fellows is bolstered by association with others who share her beliefs and purpose. She gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when dealing with any follower of her religion, whether or not they are in the guild. She also gains a +2 bonus on Will saves when resisting any compulsion that would cause her to act outside the dictates of her faith.

Sample Contact: Father Eliaj (elf cleric 5). Eliaj will assist the PC in researching religious matters (+2 bonus on any Knowledge check related to a church or religious matter). Once per week.

SCHOLASTIC GUILDS

A scholastic guild can be anything from a small circle of researchers dedicated to studying a particular topic to a full-scale university providing knowledge to all who wish it. In any case, the guild works to further the knowledge and education of its members, if not its entire community. It provides libraries, places of study and academic discourse, an atmosphere conducive to the acquisition of knowledge, and possibly instructors willing to educate students in one or more subjects.

Some scholastic guilds overlap with arcane or psionic guilds if the culture considers magic or psionics to be just another field of study.

Examples: Sages guild, secret society, university.

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, bard, expert, wizard.

Associated Skills: Decipher Script, Gather Information, Knowledge (any four), Speak Language.

Duties: Members must contribute constantly to the guild’s knowledge and lore. They must spend at least 10 hours a week in study, writing, research, and discourse with other members. A successful DC 25 Diplomacy check allows a PC to count time spent adventuring toward this requirement, if the purpose of the adventure is to recover some ancient lore or unearth some great secret.

Favored Benefits: To its favored members, a scholastic guild offers complete access to its many libraries and troves of research. A favored member who is in the guildhouse and is making use of both the library and other guild members for research purposes can take 20 on any single Knowledge skill in which he has at least 1 rank. Such painstaking research is time-consuming, however, requiring 2d4 days (8 hours per day) to complete.

Sample Contact: Professor Tibor Wadsworth (gnome expert 7). He will help research a specific topic (+2 bonus on the PC’s Knowledge check). Once per month.

SLAVERS GUILDS

A slavers guild is an odd organization. In most civilized realms, it is a subset of the criminal guild—either a branch of a larger organization, or another form of guild frowned upon by local law enforcement. In particularly vile or corrupt regions, slavers guilds operate openly, and in slaver cities, such guilds might hold more political and local power than the nominal government. 

Although a slavers guild is usually based in a particular city, it must operate throughout a much larger area in order to gather sufficient “merchandise” to function. Slavers guilds purchase prisoners from the city or other legal slave-owners where possible, but most have no compunctions about kidnapping foreigners or even poor citizens to meet their quotas. Loan sharks and crime lords often sell clients to a slavers guild if the poor souls cannot repay their debts.

Associated Classes: Fighter, rogue, scout (*Complete Adventurer*), sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Gather Information, Intimidate, Search, Sense Motive, Spot, Use Rope.

Duties: Members must spend at least four days out of every month in direct service to the guild. In some instances, this might simply involve arranging sales and meeting with clients. For characters with levels in adventuring classes, however, these duties more likely involve capturing new slaves or guarding and transporting those already under the guild’s whip.

Favored Benefits: Favored members of the guild can purchase slaves at a 20% discount. Further, if a favored member needs a few hours of physical labor performed, the guild provides the temporary loan of slaves, free of charge.

Sample Contact: Durland Galth (human expert 3/rogue 3). Durland will aid the PCs in tracking the sale of any slaves provided by the guild, or in discovering where said slaves might have originated. Once every 2 months.
