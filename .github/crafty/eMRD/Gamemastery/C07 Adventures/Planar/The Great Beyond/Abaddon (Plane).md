# Abaddon (Plane)
## Overview
**Abaddon (Neutral Evil)**

A realm of vast wastelands under a rotten sky, Abaddon is perpetually cloaked in a cloying black mist and the oppressive twilight of an endless solar eclipse. The poisoned River Styx has its source in Abaddon, before it meanders like a twisted serpent onto other planes. Abaddon may be the most hostile of the Outer Planes; it is the home of the daemons, fiends of pure evil untouched by the struggle between law and chaos, who personify oblivion and destruction. Daemons, which are ruled by four god-like archdaemons, are feared throughout [[The Great Beyond|the Great Beyond]] as devourers of souls.

Abaddon has the following traits:

- **Divinely Morphic:** Deities with domains in Abaddon can alter the plane at will.
**- Strongly Evil-Aligned
**- **Enhanced Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the evil descriptor are enhanced.
**- Impeded Magic: Spells and spell-like abilities with the good descriptor are impeded.
