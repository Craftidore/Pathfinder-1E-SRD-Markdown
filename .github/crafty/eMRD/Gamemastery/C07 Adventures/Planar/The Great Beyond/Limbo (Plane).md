# Limbo (Plane)
## Overview
**Limbo (Chaotic Neutral)**

A vast ocean of unrestrained chaos and untapped potential surrounds and is coterminous with each of the Outer Planes. This is Limbo—beautiful, deadly, and truly endless. From its unplumbed depths were born all the other planes, and to its anarchic deeps will all creation eventually return. Where the formless sea of Limbo laps against the shores of other planes, its substance takes on some measure of stability, and it is within these borderlands that travel is safest, though it is still fraught with danger from Limbo’s chaos-warped inhabitants. Deeper into the plane, Limbo’s native proteans cavort in the Primal Chaos, creating and destroying the raw stuff of chaos with unfathomable abandon.

Limbo has the following traits:

- **Subjective Directional Gravity and Normal Gravity**: On the few islands of stability within Limbo, gravity is more likely to be normal (down is toward the center of mass). Everywhere else, gravity is subjective directional.
**- Erratic Time
- Highly Morphic
- Strongly Chaos-Aligned
**- **Wild Magic and Normal Magic**: On the few islands of stability within Limbo, magic is more likely to be normal. Magic is wild everywhere else.
