# Nirvana (Plane)
## Overview
**Nirvana (Neutral Good)**

Nirvana is an unbiased paradise existing between the two extremes of Elysium and Heaven. Its stunning mountains, rolling hills, and deep forests all match a visitor’s expectations of a pastoral paradise, but Nirvana also contains mysteries that lead to enlightenment. Nirvana is a sanctuary and a place of respite for all who seek redemption or illumination. Nirvana’s native agathions have willingly postponed their own transcendence to guard Nirvana’s enigmas, while celestial beings fight the forces of evil across the planes.

Nirvana has the following traits:

- **Divinely Morphic**: Deities with domains in Nirvana can alter the plane at will.
**- Strongly Good-Aligned
**- **Enhanced Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities with the good descriptor are enhanced.
- **Impeded Magic**: Spells and spel-llike abilities with the evil descriptor are impeded.
