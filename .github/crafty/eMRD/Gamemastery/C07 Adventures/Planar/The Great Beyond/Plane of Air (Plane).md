# Plane of Air (Plane)
## Overview
**Plane of Air**

The Plane of Air is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below. It is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner Planes and is the home of all manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.

The Plane of Air has the following traits:

- **Subjective Directional Gravity:** Inhabitants of the plane determine their own “down” direction. Objects not under the motive force of others do not move.
**- Air-Dominant
**- **Enhanced Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the air descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create air (including those of the [[Air (Domain)|Air]] domain and the elemental \[air] bloodline) are enhanced.
- **Impeded Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the earth descriptor or that use or create earth (including those of the [[Earth (Domain)|Earth]] domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental \[earth] bloodline, and spells that summon earth elementals or outsiders with the earth subtype) are impeded.
