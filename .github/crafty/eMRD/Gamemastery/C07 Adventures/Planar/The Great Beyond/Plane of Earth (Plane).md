# Plane of Earth (Plane)
## Overview
**Elemental Plane of Earth**

The Plane of Earth is a solid place made of soil and stone. An unwary traveler might find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and crushed into nothingness, with his powdered remains left as a warning to any foolish enough to follow. Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal.

The Plane of Earth has the following traits:

**- Earth-Dominant
**- **Enhanced Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the earth descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create earth or stone (including those of the [[Earth (Domain)|Earth]] domain and the elemental \[earth] bloodline) are enhanced.
**- Impeded Magic: Spells and spell-like abilities with the air descriptor or that use or create air (including those of the [[Air (Domain)|Air]] domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental \[air] bloodline, and spells that summon air elementals or outsiders with the air subtype) are impeded.
