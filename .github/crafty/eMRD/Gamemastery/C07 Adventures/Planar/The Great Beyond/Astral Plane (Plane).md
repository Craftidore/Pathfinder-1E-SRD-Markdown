# Astral Plane (Plane)
## Overview
**Astral Plane**

The Astral Plane is the space between the Inner and Outer Planes, and coterminous with all of the planes. When a character moves through a portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane briefly touch the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane is a great, endless expanse of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.

The Astral Plane has the following traits:

**- Subjective Directional Gravity
**- **Timeless:** Age, hunger, thirst, afflictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing donâ€™t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.
**- Mildly Neutral-Aligned
**- **Enhanced Magic:** All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were improved by the [[Quicken Spell (Feat)|Quicken Spell]] or [[Quicken Spell-Like Ability (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Quicken Spell-Like Ability]] feats. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the [[Quicken Spell (Feat)|Quicken Spell]] feat, only one quickened spell or spell-like ability can be cast per round.
