# Plane of Fire (Plane)
## Overview
**Plane of Fire**

Everything is alight on the Plane of Fire. The ground is nothing more than great, ever-shifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms and the most common liquid is magma. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire survives here without needing fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.

The Plane of Fire has the following traits:

**- Fire-Dominant
**- **Enhanced Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create fire (including those of the [[Fire (Domain)|Fire]] domain or the elemental \[fire] bloodline) are enhanced.
- **Impeded Magic:** Spells and spell-like abilities with the water descriptor or that use or create water (including spells of the [[Water (Domain)|Water]] domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental \[water] bloodline, and spells that summon water elementals or outsiders with the water subtype) are impeded.
