# Utopia (Plane)
## Overview
**Utopia (Lawful Neutral)**

Utopia is a bastion of order against the chaos of Limbo and the countless demonic hordes of [[The Abyss (Plane)|the Abyss]]. A great city of eternal perfection, Utopiaâ€™s streets and buildings are paragons of architecture and aesthetics; everything is ordered and nothing happens by chance. While no one race rules Utopia, axiomites and inevitables make their homes here, forever striving to expand their perfect city.

Utopia has the following traits:

- **Finite Shape**
- **Divinely Morphic**: Deities with domains in Utopia can alter the plane at will.
- **Strongly Law-Aligned**
- **Enhanced Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities with the lawful descriptor are enhanced.
- **Impeded Magic**: Spells and spell-like abilities with the chaotic descriptor are impeded.
