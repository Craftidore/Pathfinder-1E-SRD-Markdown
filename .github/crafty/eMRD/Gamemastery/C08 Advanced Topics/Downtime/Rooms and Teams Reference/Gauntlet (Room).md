# Gauntlet (Room)
## Overview
**Gauntlet**

**Benefit** defenders get improved cover 

**Create** 4 Goods, 4 Labor (160 gp); **Time** 10 days 

**Size** 4–8 squares 

**Upgrades To** Gatehouse 

This is an area with murder holes or similar defenses that give defenders an advantage when attacking or spying upon intruders. It has good wooden doors with simple locks to allow defenders to trap invaders inside. Any defender using the Gauntlet’s defenses has improved cover against intruders in the Gauntlet, though these defenses limit what attacks the defenders can make. For example, a defender can shoot through a murder hole with a spell, bow, or crossbow, or can pour boiling water through it, but she can’t attack through it with an axe.
