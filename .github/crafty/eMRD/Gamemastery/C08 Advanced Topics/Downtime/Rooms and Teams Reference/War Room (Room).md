# War Room (Room)
## Overview
**War Room**

**Benefit** bonus on mass combat and skill checks while scheming 

**Create** 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 16 days 

**Size** 4–12 squares 

This is a room for planning military maneuvers, plotting grand heists, or providing briefings. It contains a large central table with plenty of chairs, maps, and figures to simulate troops and structures. When it’s used for planning a battle, your army gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and morale checks for their next battle within 24 hours. To grant the army this bonus, the army’s commander must be present at the planning meeting for the battle or you must have some way of communicating these instructions to the commander. When used to scheme for an upcoming adventure (see *Ultimate Campaign 87*), a War Room allows you to use the scheme’s planning bonus on two skill checks instead of one.
