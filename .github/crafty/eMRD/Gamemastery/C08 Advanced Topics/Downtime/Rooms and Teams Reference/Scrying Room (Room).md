# Scrying Room (Room)

A Scrying Room is built to be a quiet place for scrying, seances, and similar divinations. It contains a table, chairs, and either a pool of water (at no additional cost) or a suitable focus object for a scrying spell (for an additional 1,000 gp). A caster using *scrying*, *locate creature*, or a similar targeted divination from here increases the spell’s DC by 1
