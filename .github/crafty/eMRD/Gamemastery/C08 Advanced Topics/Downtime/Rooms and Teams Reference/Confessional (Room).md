# Confessional (Room)
## Overview
**Confessional**

**Benefit** bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks 

**Create** 2 Goods, 3 Labor (100 gp); **Time** 4 days 

**Size** 2â€“4 squares 

This pair of tiny, linked rooms allows for private conversations. Alternatively, you may construct a hidden space that allows you to watch another room without being observed, such as through a peephole in a tapestry or mosaic. One side of this room provides a +4 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks to hide from creatures in the adjoining room. A Confessional can be constructed in a way that allows this bonus to apply to creatures in both sides or just in one.
