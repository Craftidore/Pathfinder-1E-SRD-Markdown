## Overview

An Infirmary is used for treating injured and sick people. It contains beds or cots, a wash basin, and medical supplies. This counts as having a healer’s kit for up to two healers at a time. As long as the building doesn’t have the [[Broken|broken]] condition, you don’t need to track individual uses of these healer’s kits.
