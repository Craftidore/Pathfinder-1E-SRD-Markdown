# Guard Post (Room)
## Overview
**Guard Post**

**Earnings** gp or Goods +4 

**Benefit** defenders get a bonus on initiative and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks 

**Create** 7 Goods, 2 Influence, 6 Labor (320 gp); **Time** 20 days

**Size** 6–10 squares 

**Upgrades From** [[Tollbooth (Room)|Tollbooth]]; **Upgrades To** [[Gatehouse (Room)|Gatehouse]] 

This defensive structure prevents access to a building. It is normally arranged so defenders have a clear line of sight to all room entrances or a clear view of all approaches to the building. You can construct this room in a tower layout (at no additional cost), which includes a second story that also counts as a Guard Post. The listed price includes the cost of having unskilled employees as guards (1st-level commoners or experts with uniforms, but no armor or weapons). If the building has an [[Armory (Room)|Armory]], these employees are armed and armored, but still mostly for show. If you want trained guards who can defend against dangerous intruders, hire professional guards or recruit a team of Guards or Soldiers. Any defender using the Guard Post’s defenses gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks against intruders at the Guard Post.
