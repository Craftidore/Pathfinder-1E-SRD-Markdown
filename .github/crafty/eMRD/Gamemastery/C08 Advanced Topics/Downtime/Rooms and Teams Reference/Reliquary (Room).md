## Overview
**Reliquary** 

**Earnings** gp or Influence +5 

**Benefit** bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks relating to its contents 

**Create** 4 Goods, 4 Labor, 1 Magic (260 gp); **Time** 12 days

A Reliquary is built to securely store religious artifacts, and dedicated to a specific deity or philosophy. It contains shelves to house the items, special display cases to protect them, and sometimes chairs and tables to allow study. It’s secured by a strong wooden door or grating with a good lock. Unlike a [[Vault (Room)|Vault]], a Reliquary is intended to allow people to observe its contents. When stocked with relics appropriate to the chosen deity or philosophy, the room grants a +1 bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks relating to the history, powers, and purpose of those relics.
