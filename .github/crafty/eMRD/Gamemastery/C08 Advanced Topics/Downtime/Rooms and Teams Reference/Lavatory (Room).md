# Lavatory (Room)
## Overview
**Lavatory**

**Benefit** Bonus on Fortitude saves against contracting disease 

**Create** 3 Goods, 3 Labor (120 gp); **Time** 4 days 

**Size** 1–4 squares 

**Upgrade From** [[Shack (Room)|Shack]] 

A Lavatory includes up to four 5-foot-by-5-foot private rooms for dealing with biological functions. If a building doesn’t have a Lavatory, people in it must go elsewhere for this sort of activity. Depending on the building and settlement, a Lavatory might be an outhouse, a closet with a chamber pot, or a stool connected to an external system such as a cesspit or pig trough. If the building has a [[Sewer Access (Room)|Sewer Access]], you can automatically connect all Lavatories in the building to the settlement’s sewer system (see *Ultimate Campaign 101*). The sanitation improvement from having a Lavatory mean residents, guests, employees, and others who frequent the building gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist contracting a disease while in the settlement.
