# GM Tricks of the Trade #61
## Overview
**Working Around Absent Players**

*This is the 61st in our ongoing tips and tricks for GMs. Periodically we will send out these little nuggets written by Master GM Stephen Chenault.*

Being a GM, DM, or CK is a tricky business. You must be able to think on the fly, keep people engaged and lead them down the path to adventure. Bogged down in the minutiae? Stuck in a dungeon? It's important to lead the players to the best game they can have. That's why our CEO and founder, Stephen Chenault -- a gamer for over 40 years and CK that can keep a game of 20 plus moving smoothly -- has put together another 5 gems guaranteed to give you your best game.

As Steve would say: Holy Carolina!

This is a topic that came up in last week's stream and proved a perfect topic for a GMTT: How to handle an absent players character.

Every GM, at some point, is going to run a game where one or more of the players do not show and their character is suddenly like an NPC in a video game, just standing in the way. But what to do with the character is something of an issue. The adventure will continue without them, battles fought, treasure seized, experience doled out. What do you do with the character when the player is gone? Read below for some tips on how to deal with that.

**#1: Don't Be a Player.** Try to avoid playing any character when the player is absent. Taking such an action is fraught with problems. If you misplay the character, the player is going to be grieved and the other players may develop assumptions about the character the original player never intended. You could as easily play the character better or worse; either way is bad. This goes for allowing another player to play someone's character. It's just not a good idea and actually much worse than the GM playing the absent player's character as it may leave some resentment between players, something far harder to handle than anger a player has toward a GM.

**#2: Incapacitate.** If the player misses a game and it looks like it is a one or even a two-time thing, I am likely to incapacitate their character. Basically, their character has become too sick to join in the fun. They were out drinking, picked up the flu or what have you. If they are in a dungeon, they stay behind to guard the entrance. Basically, I try to create a plausible reason they missed the adventure, while not making their character look useless.

**#3: Narrow Roles.** If the character is extremely important or it is difficult to incapacitate them, you can give them limited function. Very limited function. At the utmost allow that the character is still in the action, but only allow them to make neutral actions such as healing, tracking or some such business. When you do this, never roll for the character, always ask another player to do it. This allows the character to be in the action -- help or harm -- but also keeps anyone from playing the character.

**#4: Give them Purpose.** If someone is going to be gone for several games, it is often best to give their character some other purpose. They met and worked with the local authorities. They were captured and held in a dungeon. They sought after and found or did not find a new path. They spent time in the library doing research. Not only does this keep them in play without you playing their character, but it also makes their absence have an actual purpose both for you and the game. They frequently come back to the table and I use their absence to feed them some piece of the adventure, some actionable intelligence, to help further the storyline/plot or what have you. Talk to them before the game and let them know what useful piece of info they have and you can kickstart their returning session with some role playing the yields action.

**#5: Dealing with Level Progression.** One of the largest problems with absent players is level progression. Characters will start to leave others behind, gaining levels, and this creates a challenge for the GM to balance out encounters. A 3rd level wizard standing next to 5th level clerics and fighters is going to be at a crazy disadvantage. This is a fairly easy problem to handle at low level. Allowing the long absent player to find a magic item that equalizes exp is the easiest way. But feeding exp through role playing, ideas etc. is another. At mid-level its starts to become more challenging and carries more weight as noted above. 5th – 7th level characters are much more powerful than 3rd and 4th level characters. Coupling that with the amount of experience needed to gain levels precludes a quick and easy fix. In these cases I tend to feed them 'free' experience points, giving them a few thousand for living with monarch or long and exhaustive studies (as above in #4). This will help some but not just 'give' them the level. Doing that cheapens everyone's experience. At high level I don’t give it much thought, characters are powerful in their own right and one or two levels doesn’t really make that much of a difference. In those cases I just let it be and they can catch up or not as the fates and dice allow!
