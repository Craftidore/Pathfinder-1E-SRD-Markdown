# Prismatic Screen
## Overview
**Prismatic Screen:** When creating this augmentation, choose one face of the wall. A *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]* covers the chosen side. It can be destroyed by the same laborious process as a *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]*; however, note that any layer destroyed automatically reforms 24 hours later.

The creator of the *prismatic screen* is immune to its effects. When creating this augmentation, the creator can add up to 1 additional person per caster level to the list of those who are immune to its effects.

*Caster Level:* 15th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Prismatic Wall (Spell)|prismatic wall]]; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
