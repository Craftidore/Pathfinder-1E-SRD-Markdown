# Ethereal Solid
## Overview
**Ethereal Solid:** The [[Ethereal Plane]] is mostly an insubstantial mirror of the Material Plane, but some solids exist there that have no reality on the Material Plane. If a sufficiently large ethereal solid coexists with the part of the plane where your stronghold stands, ethereal intruders canâ€™t sneak inside (any more than they could pass through a huge rock on the Material Plane).

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Ethereal Jaunt (Spell)|ethereal jaunt]]; Market Price:* 12,000 gp.
