# Thornwood
## Overview
**Thornwood:** This augmentation can only be added to walls of wood or living wood. Creatures who attempt to climb or are forced into *thornwood* suffer damage as if it were a *[[Wall of Thorns (Spell)|wall of thorns]]*. This augmentation does not allow creatures to force their way through the wall (unlike *[[Wall of Thorns (Spell)|wall of thorns]]*). Magical fire burns away the *thornwood* augmentation, though it naturally grows back in 24 hours.

*Caster Level:* 9th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Wall of Thorns (Spell)|wall of thorns]]; Market Price:* 15,000 gp.
