# Spiderwalk
## Overview
**Spiderwalk:** Anyone scaling this wall can climb as if under the effect of a *[[Spider Climb (Spell)|spider climb]]* spell (though you need not have bare hands and feet to use it). When creating this augmentation, you may choose for it to affect only one side of a wall. For instance, you might place it on the inner side of a freestanding wall to obviate the need for stairwells or ladders to reach the top of a defensive placement. Some builders place many arrow slits backed with small platforms all along the inside of such a wall to maximize its utility.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Spider Climb (Spell)|spider climb]]; Market Price:* 1,500 gp.
