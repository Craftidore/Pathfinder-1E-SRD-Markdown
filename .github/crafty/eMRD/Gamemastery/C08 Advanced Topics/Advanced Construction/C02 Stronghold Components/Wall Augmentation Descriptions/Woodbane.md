# Woodbane
## Overview
**Woodbane:** When creating this augmentation, choose one face of the wall. No wooden objects can come within 10 feet of the chosen side of the wall. Fixed wooden objects with a circumference greater than 3 inches—such as most trees—are unaffected. When creating the augmentation, you can choose to include the first 10 feet above a wall of stronghold space in the augmentation (for instance, to protect your wall-mounted guards from arrows).

You cannot apply this augmentation to walls of wood or living wood.

*Caster Level:* 11th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Repulsion (Spell)|repulsion]]; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
