# Bier of Life (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bier of Life:** This large stone platform casts *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* on any corpse laid upon it, but only if you also place a diamond worth at least 500 gp over the corpse’s heart. The activation of the magic consumes the diamond.

The *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]* spell only works upon corpses less than nine days dead and if the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. A raised subject loses a level when raised—or 1 point of Constitution if she’s at 1st level.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Raise Dead (Spell)|raise dead]]**; Market Price:* 22,500 gp.
