# Platform of Jaunting, Greater (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Jaunting, Greater:** This fixture is similar to the *[[Platform of Jaunting (WondArch)|platform of jaunting]]*, except that it has limitless range on the same plane and you have no chance of becoming stuck on the [[Astral Plane]]. You need only a reliable description of the destination. If your information proves unreliable, you disappear and then reappear on the platform.

When using the *greater platform of jaunting*, you can bring up to 850 pounds of material you touch. Since the *greater platform of jaunting* provides only one-way transport, some stronghold builders construct a network of devices to allow for round trips. This works particularly well when you collaborate with other owners so that you can visit each other at will.

*Caster Level:* 17th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Teleport, Greater (Spell)|greater teleport]]**; Market Price:* 76,500 gp.
