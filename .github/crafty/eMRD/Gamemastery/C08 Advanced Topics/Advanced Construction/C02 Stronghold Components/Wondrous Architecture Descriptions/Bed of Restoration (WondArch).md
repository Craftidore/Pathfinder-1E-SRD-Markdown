# Bed of Restoration (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bed of Restoration:** This bed works like a *[[Bed of Restoration, Lesser (WondArch)|lesser bed of restoration]]**,* but it instead casts *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]* on the user. If the subject does not want to be affected, he can make a Will save (DC 16) to negate the effect.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]**; Market Price:* 38,000 gp.
