# Sanctum Sanctorum
## Overview
**Sanctum Sanctorum:** Each creature entering this stronghold space becomes protected by a *[[Sanctuary (Spell)|sanctuary]]* spell. Anyone trying to attack such a target (including with targeted spells, but not with area or effect spells) must make a Will save (DC 11) to do so. Otherwise, that action of the attacker is wasted, and the attacker cannot attack that target again until the target leaves the room. If the target reenters the room, the attacker may attempt a new Will save. If someone protected by the sanctumâ€™s effects attacks, he loses the benefits of the sanctum and can be attacked normally.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sanctuary (Spell)|sanctuary]]**; Market Price:* 1,500 gp.
