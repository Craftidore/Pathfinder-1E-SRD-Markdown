# Platform of Telekinesis, Lesser (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Telekinesis, Lesser:** This addition is similar to the *platform of levitation*, except that the platform can move in any direction at up to 20 feet per round. Though most commonly used as a versatile elevator, this item functions admirably outside strongholds as well (even as a mobile weapons platform). Since it doesnâ€™t fit well through a standard doorway, you must plan your stronghold layout carefully to make maximum use of the platform.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Telekinesis|telekinesis]]**; Market Price:* 20,000 gp.
