# Upside-Down Room (WondArch)
## Overview
**Upside-Down Room:** Anyone entering this stronghold space immediately falls upward, to a maximum of 30 feet above the floor. Cunning builders plant spikes along the ceiling to increase damage (this functions identically to a pit).

If no ceiling exists (or if the ceiling is more than 30 above the floor), victims merely hang in space at a height of 30 feet. In a tall enough room, this can create multiple directions of gravity (allowing guards standing on high ledges to pick off helpless floating targets).

A ceiling-level entrance to the room can allow those who enter to simply flip about and stand on the ceiling, though visitors unaware of the effect must make a Reflex save (DC 10) to avoid falling to the ceiling (this deals no damage either way).

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Reverse Gravity (Spell)|reverse gravity]]**; Market Price:* 45,500 gp.
