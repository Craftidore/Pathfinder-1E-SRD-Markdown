# Well of Flying (WondArch)
## Overview
**Well of Flying:** As with the *[[Well of Falling (WondArch)|well of falling]]*, this is not a well so much as a sneaky way to get from one part of a multilevel stronghold to another. Unlike the *[[Well of Falling (WondArch)|well of falling]]*, the *well of flying* can (and usually does) include multiple entrances to the shaft. Anyone entering the well can *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]* at a speed of 90 (or 60 if wearing medium or heavy armor) while in the well.

If 10 feet wide, the *well of flying* can be up to 50 feet deep. If only 5 feet wide, it can be up to 100 feet deep. You can link multiple *wells of flying* to create a deeper shaft.

Most builders construct the *well of flying* to extend all the way to the ceiling of its top level, allowing you to exit without pulling yourself up from the lip (since the effect extends only to the rim of the well).

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fly (Spell)|fly]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
