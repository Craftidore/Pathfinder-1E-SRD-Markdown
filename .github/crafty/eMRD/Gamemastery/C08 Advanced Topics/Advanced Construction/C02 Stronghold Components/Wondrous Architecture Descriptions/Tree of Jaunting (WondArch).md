# Tree of Jaunting (WondArch)
## Overview
**Tree of Jaunting:** This tree looks like an ordinary member of its species. When you enter this tree, you may immediately teleport to a nearby tree of the same species as if you had cast *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]*. The tree you enter and the tree you appear in must be wider around than you are for this to work.

Some stronghold owners set up several such trees around their stronghold to allow people to move around easily. Sometimes they place one tree at an outpost and another in a central courtyard. Since an intruder can use this tree as easily as a trusted guard, avoid leaving them unprotected.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Tree Stride (Spell)|tree stride]]**; Market Price:* 22,500 gp.
