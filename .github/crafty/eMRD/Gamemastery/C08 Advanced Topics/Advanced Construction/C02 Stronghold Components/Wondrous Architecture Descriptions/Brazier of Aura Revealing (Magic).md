# Brazier of Aura Revealing (Magic)
## Overview
**Brazier of Aura Revealing (magic):** This works like a *[[Brazier of Aura Revealing (Evil) (WondArch)|brazier of aura revealing (evil)]]*, except that it detects magic instead (and an overwhelming aura strength has no dangerous effect).

The brazier does not reveal its own magic power. For particulars about aura strengths and the length than an aura lingers, see the Playerâ€™s Handbook.

*Caster Level:* 1st; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Detect Magic (Spell)|detect magic]]**; Market Price:* 1,000 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 72
