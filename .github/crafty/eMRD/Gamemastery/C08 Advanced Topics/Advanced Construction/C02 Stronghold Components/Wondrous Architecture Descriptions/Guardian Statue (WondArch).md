# Guardian Statue (WondArch)
## Overview
**Guardian Statue:** This item looks like nothing more than a standard piece of statuary. However, if someone comes within 5 feet without giving the password, it lets out with an alarming hue and cry. The creator can make this either a mental alarm or an audible alarm, as per the spell. When found, this is a mental alarm 25% of the time and an audible alarm 75% of the time.

If the alarm is audible, anyone within 60 feet can hear it clearly. Each interposing closed door reduces that distance by 10 feet. Each interposing substantial wall reduces the distance by 20 feet. In quiet conditions, the alarm can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away. A *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell on either the *guardian statue* or the listener defeats the audible alarm.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Alarm (Spell)|alarm]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
