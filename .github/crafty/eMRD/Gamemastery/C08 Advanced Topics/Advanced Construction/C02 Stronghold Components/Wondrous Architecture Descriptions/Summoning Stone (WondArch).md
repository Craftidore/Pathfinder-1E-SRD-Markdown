# Summoning Stone (WondArch)
## Overview
**Summoning Stone:** When any creature comes within 30 feet of one of these menhir-like stones, the stone summons a creature from another plane (as *summon monster*). Summoned creatures will attack anything coming within 30 feet of the stone. A *summoning stone* functions three times a day.

The creature summoned is set at the time of the stone’s creation. The table below indicates some typical creatures, though you may select any appropriate creature from the summon monster tables. 

When creating a *summoning stone*, you may set a password or passphrase that allows characters to approach it without activating it.

Summoning stones come in nine varieties:
