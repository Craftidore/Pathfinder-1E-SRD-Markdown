# Zone of Elemental Immunity (WondArch)
## Overview
**Zone of Elemental Immunity:** The stronghold space is immune to damage from a specific energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Anyone within the stronghold space shares this immunity, but only if the damage comes from a source outside the stronghold. For instance, while the stronghold floats on a lake of lava, those within suffer no damage, but a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]* cast from within the space affects all creatures within normally.

Unless you have some specific reason to protect only a section of your stronghold, this effect is generally placed on the entire stronghold.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *protection from elements; Market Price:* 10,000 gp.
