# Bed of Restoration, Lesser (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bed of Restoration, Lesser:** This bed casts *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]* on any person who lies on it for 3 consecutive rounds. It can function only on a single target at once, so if more than one creature lies on the bed, nothing happens. If the subject does not want to be healed, he can make a Will save (DC 13) to negate the effect.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Restoration, Lesser (Spell)|lesser restoration]]**; Market Price:* 6,000 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 70
