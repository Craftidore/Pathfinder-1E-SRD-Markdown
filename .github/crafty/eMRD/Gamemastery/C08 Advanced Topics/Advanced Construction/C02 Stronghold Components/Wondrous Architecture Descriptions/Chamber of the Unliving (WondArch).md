# Chamber of the Unliving (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of the Unliving:** The entire stronghold space is under the influence of an *[[Antilife Shell (Spell)|antilife shell]]*. Most living creatures cannot enter the space. The exceptions are constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead. No saving throw is allowed to permit other types of creatures to enter the space affected.

The *chamber of the unliving* is most often found in the stronghold of a necromancer, because the spellcasterâ€™s minions can move through the space freely, even if she cannot. Such places are often also encountered in an extraplanar stronghold, because the outsiders that live there can move about without pause, while most visitors from the Material Plane cannot.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Antilife Shell (Spell)|antilife shell]]**; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
