# Forbidding Sigils (WondArch)
## Overview
**Forbidding Sigils:** These inscriptions guard a stronghold space from unwanted visitors—extraplanar or otherwise. A *sigil* has two effects: First, the area is sealed from extradimensional travel into it, including *[[Dimension Door (Spell)|dimension door]]**,* *[[Teleport (Spell)|teleport]]**,* *[[Plane Shift (Spell)|plane shift]]**,* and summoning spells.

Second, creatures with alignments different from the caster’s cannot enter the area. Creatures whose alignments differ in one aspect (lawful evil vs. chaotic evil, for example), suffer 3d6

points of damage and are hedged out. Creatures whose alignments differ in two aspects (chaotic good vs. lawful neutral) suffer 6d6 points of damage.

A successful Will save (DC 19) negates both effects, but if a character fails the save once, future attempts automatically fail.

*[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|Dispel magic]]* automatically fails against *forbidding sigils* unless the dispeller is 11th level or higher.

*Caster Level:* 11th; *Prerequisites:* [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Forbiddance (Spell)|forbiddance]]**; Market Price:* 12,200 gp.
