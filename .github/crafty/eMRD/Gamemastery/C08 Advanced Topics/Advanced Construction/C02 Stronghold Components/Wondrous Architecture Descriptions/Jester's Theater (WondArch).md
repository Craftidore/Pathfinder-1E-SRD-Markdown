# Jester's Theater (WondArch)
## Overview
**Jester’s Theater:** Upon entering this stronghold space, a subject must make a Will save (DC 13) or fall into a fit of uncontrollable laughter for 3 rounds. The subject can take no actions while laughing. Creatures with Intelligence of 2 or lower are unaffected.

At the end of the duration, or if the save succeeds, the target is immune to the effect as long as she remains within the space. If she leaves and reenters, she must make the save again.

The name of this space is somewhat misleading, as no honest performer—serious or otherwise—would ever stoop to using magic to get a laugh. This wondrous architecture is most often used as either a trap (with guards nearby to overhear the laughter) or a form of torture.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Hideous Laughter (Spell)|hideous laughter]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
