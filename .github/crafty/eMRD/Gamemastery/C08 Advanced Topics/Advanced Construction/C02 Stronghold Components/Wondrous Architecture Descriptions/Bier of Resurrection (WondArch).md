# Bier of Resurrection (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bier of Resurrection:** This large stone platform casts *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* on any corpse laid upon it, but only if you also place a diamond worth at least 500 gp over the corpse’s heart. The activation of the magic consumes the diamond.

The *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* spell only works upon remains less than 90 years dead. The revived subject is restored to full hit points, vigor, and health. However, he loses a level—or 1 point of Constitution if he’s at 1st level.

This effect even works on those killed by a death effect or who have become undead. It cannot, however, help someone dead of old age.

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]**; Market Price:* 44,500 gp.
