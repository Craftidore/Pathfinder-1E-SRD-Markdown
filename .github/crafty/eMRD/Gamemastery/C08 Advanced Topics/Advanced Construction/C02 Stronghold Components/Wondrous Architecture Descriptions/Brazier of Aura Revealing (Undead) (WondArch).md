# Brazier of Aura Revealing (Undead) (WondArch)
## Overview
**Brazier of Aura Revealing (undead):** This works like a *[[Brazier of Aura Revealing (Evil) (WondArch)|brazier of aura revealing (evil)]]*, except that it detects undead instead. As with such a brazier, those of good alignment can be overwhelmed if they detect extremely powerful undead.

For particulars about aura strengths and the length than an aura lingers, see the Playerâ€™s Handbook.

*Caster Level:* 1st; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Detect Law (Spell)|detect law]]**; Market Price:* 1,000 gp.
