# Platform of Healing (WondArch)
## Overview
**Platform of Healing:** This 10-foot-diameter platform, which must be affixed to the floor when created, casts *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* on any living creature that steps onto it. If an undead creature steps onto the platform, treat it as if a *[[Harm (Spell)|harm]]* spell had been cast upon it instead, removing all but 1d4 hit points from it.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]**; Market Price:* 30,000 gp.
