# Inscriptions of Urgency (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Urgency:** Any creature who enters this stronghold space immediately becomes the subject of a *[[Suggestion (Spell)|suggestion]]* spell (Will save DC 19 negates). The suggested action must be chosen when the inscriptions are created, and cannot be changed afterward. The suggestion cannot be more than one or two sentences long, and it must seem reasonable in nature (as the spell). The suggestion lasts up to 11 hours after the target leaves the room or until the suggested course of action is completed.

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Suggestion, Mass (Spell)|mass suggestion]]**; Market Price:* 35,000 gp.
