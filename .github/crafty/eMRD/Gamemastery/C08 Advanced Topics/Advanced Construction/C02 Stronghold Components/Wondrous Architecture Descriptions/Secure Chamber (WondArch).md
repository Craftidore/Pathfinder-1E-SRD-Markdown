# Secure Chamber (WondArch)
## Overview
**Secure Chamber:** The entire stronghold space is affected by a spell. No one in the chamber can be affected by abilities, devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions and thoughts, up to and including *[[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]]*. Even a scrying that scans an area does not work. Most throne rooms of mighty rulers use this effect.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mind Blank (Spell)|mind blank]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 83

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* Added the word abilities, to the descriptive text.
