# Inscriptions of Concealment (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Concealment:** Every object within this stronghold space (except for the walls, floor, and ceiling) becomes undetectable to any kind of divination spells and even invisible to normal vision. Living creatures (and any objects they wear or carry) are not affected by this effect. The spell does not prevent items in the room from being discovered by touch.

Most stronghold builders who include this wondrous architecture use it to disguise the nature and contents of a treasure or trophy room. A determined effort can get around the effects, but for most purposes, the room seems empty.

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sequester (Spell)|sequester]]**; Market Price:* 45,500 gp.
