# Inscriptions of Vacancy (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Vacancy:** Everyone within this stronghold space becomes undetectable to scrying. In fact, to them it appears as if the room is entirely empty of people and devoid of activity, no matter how many people are in it or what they are doing.

These inscriptions are often used on areas that need to remain secure, such as throne rooms or war counsel rooms. No decent kingdom is without at least one such room in its leaderâ€™s stronghold.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[False Vision (Spell)|false vision]]**; Market Price:* 22,500 gp.
