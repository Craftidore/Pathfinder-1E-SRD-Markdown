# Leomund's Lasting Shelter (WondArch)
## Overview
**Leomund’s Lasting Shelter:** This stronghold space is essentially a permanent version of *[[Secure Shelter (Spell)|Leomund’s secure shelter]]**.* The Player’s Handbook has a diagram of this spell’s effect.

It’s usually cheaper to simply build a place instead of creating a *Leomund’s lasting shelter*, but there are times and locations in which it’s not so easy to get materials or workers into place. Some builders have created a quick stronghold by putting up four or five of these shelters and then connecting them together with simple stone or wooden walls.

In addition to the structure, *Leomund’s lasting shelter* comes with a decent security system. The doors and windows are fitted with *[[Arcane Lock (Spell)|arcane locks]]*, and the chimney has an iron grate atop it. In addition, an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* is there to meet your every need.

*Caster Level: 7th;* Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Secure Shelter (Spell)|secure shelter]]**; Market Price:* 14,000 gp.
