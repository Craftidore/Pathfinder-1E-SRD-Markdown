# Vegetative Trap (WondArch)
## Overview
**Vegetative Trap:** The plant material in this stronghold space reaches up to snare anyone who enters the area, much like an *[[Entangle (Spell)|entangle]]* spell.

Any creature within the vegetative trap must make a Reflex save (DC 11). If it succeeds, it can move at only half normal speed through the area, but suffers no other ill effects. Those who fail the save become [[Entangled|entangled]].

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Entangle (Spell)|entangle]]**; Market Price:* 1,500 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 85
