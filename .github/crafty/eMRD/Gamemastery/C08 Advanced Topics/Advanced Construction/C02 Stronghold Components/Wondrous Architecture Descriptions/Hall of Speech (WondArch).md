# Hall of Speech (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Speech:** Anyone who enters this stronghold space can understand any spoken words heard, no matter the language. Similarly, the subject can speak in any language, although he can only use one at a time.

This wondrous architecture can be especially useful when used in conjunction with scrying magic. Often a character can spy on someone else magically but not be able to understand what is being said. When the scrying character is in this hall, such a situation is not a problem.

*Caster Level:* 4th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Tongues (Spell)|tongues]]**; Market Price:* 4,000 gp.
