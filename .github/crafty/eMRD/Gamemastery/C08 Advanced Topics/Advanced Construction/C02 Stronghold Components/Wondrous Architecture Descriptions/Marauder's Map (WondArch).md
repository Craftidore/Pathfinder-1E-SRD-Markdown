# Marauder's Map (WondArch)
## Overview
**Marauder's Map:** This item works like the *[[Map of Tactics, Greater (WondArch)|greater map of tactics]]*, except that it can track all subjects in a 10 mile radius for up to 18 hours each. it allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded (as a standard action you can learn the percentage of wounds/hp total), any special condition, extraordinary, supernatural, spell or spell-ability affecting them. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the *marauder's map* ceases to function for it. Spells such as *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]* can possibly prevent tracking by the *marauder's map,* but must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]*. If you cast *[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]* on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

*Caster Level:* 18th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Status, Superior (Spell)|superior status]]**; Market Price:* 128,000 gp.
