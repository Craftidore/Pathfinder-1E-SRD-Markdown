# Hall of Strife (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Strife:** Any creature that enters this stronghold space gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, but suffers a â€“1 penalty to AC and must fight regardless of danger (as if affected by an *emotion* spell of the rage variety; Will save DC 14 negates, though many creatures aware of the effect voluntarily forego the save). This effect does not stack with barbarian rage.

If a wizard creates this chamber, the DC is 16 and the market price is 14,000 gp.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *emotion; Market Price:* 10,500 gp.
