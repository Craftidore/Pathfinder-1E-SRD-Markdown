# Tree of Jaunting, Greater (WondArch)
## Overview
**Tree of Jaunting, Greater:** This Medium-size or larger tree looks like an ordinary member of its species. However, a user can step into the tree and instantly teleport to another tree of the same species, regardless of the distance between the two. You need only specify a direction and distance or location as you enter the *greater tree of jaunting*, and it brings you to the closest possible tree of the same species. You canâ€™t teleport into a dead tree, nor can you use a treelike plant creature (such as a treant).

*Caster Level:* 11th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Transport via Plants (Spell)|transport via plants]]**; Market Price:* 33,000 gp.
