# Hall of Law (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Law:** A dim blue glow surrounds all lawful characters in this stronghold space. This grants them a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. They also get spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and those cast by chaotic creatures. They are also protected from possession and mental influence as per *[[Protection From Chaos (Spell)|protection from chaos]]**.*

If a chaotic creature hits a protected character in melee, the attacker is slowed, as per the *[[Slow (Spell)|slow]]* spell. A Will save (DC 22) negates this.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Shield of Law (Spell)|shield of law]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
