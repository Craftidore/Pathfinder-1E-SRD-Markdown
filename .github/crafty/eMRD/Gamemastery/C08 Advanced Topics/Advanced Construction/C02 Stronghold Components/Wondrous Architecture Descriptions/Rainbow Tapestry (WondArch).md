# Rainbow Tapestry (WondArch)
## Overview
**Rainbow Tapestry:** This tapestry is covered with a glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of colors. This captivates all who see it (Will save DC 16 negates), just as if they were looking at a *[[Rainbow Pattern (Spell)|rainbow pattern]]*. The *rainbow tapestry* can only affect up to 24 HD of creatures at a time, starting with the targets with the fewest HD. Among those with equal HD, the creatures closest to the tapestry are affected first.

Captivated creatures cannot move away from the tapestry nor take actions other than to defend themselves. Any attack upon a captivated creature frees it immediately.

This item cannot affect sightless creatures. It is most often used as a trap inside certain stronghold spaces. Sometimes, it is kept furled over the guardhouse or atop a stronghold wall, then unfurled when danger approaches. Those who know that it is there receive a +10 circumstance bonus on their saving throws.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Rainbow Pattern (Spell)|rainbow pattern]]**; Market Price:* 28,000 gp.
