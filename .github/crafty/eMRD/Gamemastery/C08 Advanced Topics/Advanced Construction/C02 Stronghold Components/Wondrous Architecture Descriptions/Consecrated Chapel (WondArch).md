# Consecrated Chapel (WondArch)
## Overview
**Consecrated Chapel:** The entire stronghold space is consecrated, as per the spell. All Charisma checks to turn undead gain a +6 sacred bonus. Undead in the space suffer a –2 sacred penalty on attack and damage rolls and saves. Undead cannot be created within nor summoned into this space.

The *consecrated chapel* must contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to the creator’s chosen deity. A *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* spell negates the effect of the *consecrated chapel* for the duration of the *[[Desecrate (Spell)|desecrate]]* spell. After that, the effects of the consecrated chapel return.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], fixture dedicated to chosen higher power, *[[Consecrate (Spell)|consecrate]]**; Market Price:* 5,500 gp.
