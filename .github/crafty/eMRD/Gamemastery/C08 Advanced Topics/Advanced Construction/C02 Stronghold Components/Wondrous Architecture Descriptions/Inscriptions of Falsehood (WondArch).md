# Inscriptions of Falsehood (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Falsehood:** Every creature within this stronghold space becomes undetectable to scrying and even normal vision. When the *inscriptions of falsehood* are created, the creator specifies what appears to be going on in the room instead. You must state this in general terms, and once you set the conditions, you cannot change them.

Attempts to scry the area automatically see the programmed illusion. Direct observation can allow a save (Will save DC 22) if there’s a reason to disbelieve the image. Even entering the space doesn’t necessarily allow this, as long as the image is well-constructed and any hidden people take pains to avoid detection.

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Screen (Spell)|screen]]**; Market Price:* 45,500 gp.
