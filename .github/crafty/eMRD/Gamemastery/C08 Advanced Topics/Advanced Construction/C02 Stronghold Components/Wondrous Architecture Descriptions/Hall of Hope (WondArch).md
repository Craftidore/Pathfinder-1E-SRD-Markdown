# Hall of Hope (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Hope:** Any creature that enters this stronghold space gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls while in the stronghold space (as if affected by an *emotion* spell of the hate variety; Will save DC 14 negates, though most creatures aware of the effect voluntarily forego the save).

If a wizard creates this chamber, the DC is 16 and the market price is 14,000 gp.

*Caster Level:* 7th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *emotion; Market Price:* 10,500 gp.
