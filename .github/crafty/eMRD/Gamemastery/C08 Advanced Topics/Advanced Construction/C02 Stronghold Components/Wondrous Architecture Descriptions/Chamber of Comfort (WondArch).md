# Chamber of Comfort (WondArch)
## Overview
**Chamber of Comfort:** The temperature in this stronghold space is always a cozy 70°F. Additionally, the room magically circulates fresh air in and out of the room. The smoke from a fire lit in the room draws directly into the ceiling and then disappears. The place is never stuffy, always feeling like a soft breeze is flowing through the place, even if it’s airtight.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Tiny Hut (Spell)|tiny hut]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
