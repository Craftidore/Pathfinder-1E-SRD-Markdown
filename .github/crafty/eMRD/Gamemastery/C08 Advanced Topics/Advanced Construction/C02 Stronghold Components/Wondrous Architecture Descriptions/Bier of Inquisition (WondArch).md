# Bier of Inquisition (WondArch)
## Overview
**Bier of Inquisition:** This large stone platform casts *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* on any corpse lain upon it. This lasts for 5 minutes, and in this time the corpse can be asked up to two questions, and it answers as best it can. This does not work on undead.

If the corpseâ€™s alignment differs from that of the person asking the question, the corpse gets a Will save (DC 14).

After the effect expires, the *bier of inquisition* will not work on that same corpse for a full week, nor will a standard *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]* spell.

*Caster Level:* 5th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Speak with Dead (Spell)|speak with dead]]**; Market Price:* 7,500 gp.
