# Hall of Silence (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Silence:** All sounds made within this stronghold space are negated (as if by a *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]* spell). A Will save (DC 13) allows a character to speak normally (including casting spells with vocal components), though other sounds remain dampened. This doesn’t affect sounds created outside this stronghold space, so you can hear the noise from other rooms normally.

Stronghold builders often use this wondrous architecture in libraries and sometimes even bedchambers. It can also quiet extremely noisy places in a stronghold—such as a smithy—so that those nearby can hear themselves think.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Silence (Spell)|silence]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
