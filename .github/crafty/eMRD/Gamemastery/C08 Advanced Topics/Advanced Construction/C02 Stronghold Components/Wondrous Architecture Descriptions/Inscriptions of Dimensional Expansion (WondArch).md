# Inscriptions of Dimensional Expansion (WondArch)
## Overview
**Inscriptions of Dimensional Expansion:** This wondrous architecture places arcane sigils throughout the walls, floors, and ceiling of a stronghold space. They can be as subtle or outlandish as the creator likes. The inscriptions act so as to double the size of a given stronghold space. Any other wondrous architecture affecting the doubled space must also be doubled.

*Caster Level:* 13th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Mage's Magnificent Mansion (Spell)|mage's magnificent mansion]]**; Market Price:* 45,000 gp.

**Source:** Sourceforge Vol. 1 (Ideaware), pg. 3
