# Stable of Understanding (WondArch)
## Overview
**Stable of Understanding:** Any character in this stronghold space can understand and communicate with animals in the space (not including beasts, magical beasts, and vermin). This works like a *[[Speak with Animals (Spell)|speak with animals]]* spell, although the effect ends as soon as either the character or the animal leave the space.

While most builders who include this wondrous architecture create it as part of a stable, you can just as easily work it into an aviary, a menagerie, or any other place in which you might wish to communicate with animals. Some stronghold owners include this on the roof of their stronghold so that they can chat with any local fauna—mostly birds—brave enough to enter the space.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Speak with Animals (Spell)|speak with animals]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.
