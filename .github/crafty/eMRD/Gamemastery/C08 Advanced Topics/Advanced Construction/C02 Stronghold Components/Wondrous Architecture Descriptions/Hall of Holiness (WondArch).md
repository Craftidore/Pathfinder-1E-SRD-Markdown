# Hall of Holiness (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Holiness:** A brilliant divine radiance surrounds all good characters in this stronghold space. This grants them a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. They also get spell resistance 25 against evil spells and those cast by evil creatures. They are also protected from possession and mental influence as per *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]]**.*

If an evil creature hits a protected character in melee, the attacker is [[Blinded|blinded]]. A Fortitude save (DC 22) negates this.

*Caster Level:* 15th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Holy Aura (Spell)|holy aura]]**; Market Price:* 60,000 gp.
