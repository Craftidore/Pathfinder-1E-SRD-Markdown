# Prison of the Mind (WondArch)
## Overview
**Prison of the Mind:** Anyone who enters this stronghold space must make a Will save (DC 17) or fall victim to a *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]* spell. Those who cast arcane spells, such as bards, sorcerers, and wizards, suffer a –4 penalty on their saving throws.

Most owners keep such stronghold spaces locked up tight, as the *prison of the mind* doesn’t distinguish between friend or foe.

*Caster Level:* 9th; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Feeblemind (Spell)|feeblemind]]**; Market Price:* 22,500 gp.
