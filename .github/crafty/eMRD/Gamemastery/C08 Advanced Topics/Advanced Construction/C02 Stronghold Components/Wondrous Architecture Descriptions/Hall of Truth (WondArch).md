# Hall of Truth (WondArch)
## Overview
**Hall of Truth:** Those who enter this stronghold space are unable to speak deliberate and intentional lies unless they make a Will save (DC 13). Those affected by the enchantment are aware of it, so they cannot be tricked into saying something they would rather not. This effect only lasts as long as the subject is in the space. If a subject leaves the space and reenters it later, he must make another saving throw.

*Caster Level:* 3rd; Prerequisites: [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Zone of Truth (Spell)|zone of truth]]**; Market Price:* 3,000 gp.

**Source:** Stronghold Builders Guidebook (WotC), pg. 77
