# Kitchen, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 2,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One cook

This rudimentary stone- or wood-floored kitchen centers around a fireplace or stove. It includes a pantry, in which basic foodstuffs are stacked on shelves or hung from the ceiling. The kitchen includes pots and pans made of tin. A scullery provides storage for brooms and rags, along with a basin for washing dishes and laundry.

You can prepare meals for up to fifteen people in this space. In a pinch, you can avoid hiring a cook by preparing the meals yourself.
