# Dock, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 500 gp

**Prerequisites:** Two laborers

A dock allows ships to load or unload people or cargo from or to the stronghold. This component can support up to two rafts, keelboats, rowboats, or longships, but not warships or galleys. Purchase this component multiple times to allow additional ships to moor at the stronghold’s docks.

It’s common for storage spaces, shops, and taverns to be placed near the docks for the convenience of travelers and sailors.

This structure is only appropriate for strongholds that overlook a river, sea, or other body of water.
