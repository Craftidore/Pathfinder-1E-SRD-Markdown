# Storage, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This room includes shelves of every variety and a finished floor. The superior organization allows more efficient use of space than a [[Storage, Basic|basic storage]] component, so this space has about 3,000 cubic feet of usable storage space. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.

You can turn a storage space into a vault with the addition of safeguards such as watchmen, strong walls, traps, locks, and wondrous architecture.
