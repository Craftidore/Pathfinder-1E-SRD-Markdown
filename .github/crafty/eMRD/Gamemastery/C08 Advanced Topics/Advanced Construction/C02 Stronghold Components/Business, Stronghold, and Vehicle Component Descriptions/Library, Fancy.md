# Library, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 3,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Fine polished shelves extend from this chamber’s tile or wooden floor to the ceiling above. Several ladders allow access to upper shelves. Several small tables scattered throughout the place allow researchers space to work.

This library can hold up to three different lots of books on specific subjects. For example, it could contain books on religion, general knowledge, and the planes. Purchase reference books as extras (see the Books sidebar), and if you need a greater capacity, purchase this component multiple times.

**Books**

The library component isn’t very useful unless books line the shelves. In general, a book lot costs 1,000 gp and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on a specific [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] check, such as [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion). Alternatively, you can purchase a book lot of general topics, which costs 3,000 gp and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks. Circumstance bonuses from multiple book lots do not stack.

To make your libraries more interesting, the DM can allow extended or master book lots that take up more than one lot in a library. Comprehensive book lots cost 5,000 gp, occupy 3 book lots, and offer a +4 circumstance bonus on the appropriate [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] checks. Master book lots cost 20,000 gp, occupy 6 book lots, and offer a +6 circumstance bonus.

For example, while a luxury library can hold up to six basic book lots on six different subjects, it could instead hold comprehensive book libraries for two subjects, or a master book library for one subject.

You can only purchase comprehensive or master book lots for specific [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill categories (and not for general topics).
