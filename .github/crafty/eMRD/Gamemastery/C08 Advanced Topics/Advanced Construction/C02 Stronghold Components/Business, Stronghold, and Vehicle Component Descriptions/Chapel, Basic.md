# Chapel, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This space is dedicated to the worship of the higher power of your choice. It includes a simple altar, some rough pews for the worshipers, and an icon of the power in question. There’s also a closet for keeping religious supplies and garb in. While you don’t necessarily need a cleric around so that you can visit the place and pray in it, official services can only be run here by a person ordained by the higher power your character has chosen. The basic chapel has no magic extras, but most stronghold builders have their chapels hallowed or unhallowed; many chapels commonly include items of wondrous architecture (see Wondrous Architecture later in the chapter).

Up to forty people can fit in here for a service. If you need a greater capacity, purchase this component multiple times.
