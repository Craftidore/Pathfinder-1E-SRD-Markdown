# Armory, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 2,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Murals and other artwork depicting the glories of war cover the walls of this armory. As with the basic version, this area has sufficient armor and weapon racks to equip 25 soldiers, though the price doesnâ€™t include any such gear (see Equipping Staff in this chapter). If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
