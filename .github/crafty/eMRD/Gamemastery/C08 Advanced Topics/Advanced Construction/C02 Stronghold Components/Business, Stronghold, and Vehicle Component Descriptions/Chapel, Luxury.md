# Chapel, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 3 ss

**Cost:** 25,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Two acolytes

This enormous chapel features an altar set with gems and chased with precious metals, gilt-edged pews, and large stained-glass windows. Fine candelabra rest in separate prayer alcoves, and an elegant room with a wardrobe and large desk allows the presiding cleric to prepare for services in comfort. A supply closet holds extra prayer texts, altar cloths, candles, and other religious paraphernalia.

Up to 60 people can fit in here for a service. This place requires at least two acolytes (Clr1 or Adp1; [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] \[religion] +7) to run properly. If you need a greater capacity, purchase this component multiple times.
