# Bath, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 2 ss

**Cost:** 10,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One servant and one valet

The ultimate in bathing luxury, this room features a tub large enough for two or three people to bathe in, plus a large fireplace for heating both the room and the water necessary for a warm bath. Two chamber pots with padded and upholstered leather chairs are here. Servants empty these on a regular basis.

An intricately carved cabinet holds a variety of thick towels, and a handsome wardrobe full of fine dressing gowns stands nearby. A gilt-framed, three-fold, full-length mirror takes up one corner, and another mirror sits above a gorgeous, polished grooming desk.

The screen in this bathroom features intricately carved woods and the finest silks. Fine stuffed chairs are scattered about the place.

The dressing table features three gilt-framed mirrors and the finest in grooming products, including aromatic perfumes, gilt-handled brushes, and so on.

The walls are adorned with fine art, often of people bathing in large bath houses, in a river or lake, or at a beach.

A servant keeps the luxury bath clean, and a valet assists the bathers.
