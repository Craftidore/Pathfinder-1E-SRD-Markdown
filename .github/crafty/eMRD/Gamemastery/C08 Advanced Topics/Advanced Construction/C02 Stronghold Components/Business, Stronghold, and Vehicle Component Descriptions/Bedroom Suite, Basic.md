# Bedroom Suite, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 800 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This master bedroom includes a walk-in closet and privy. The furnishings are rough, but they include a straw bed on a low frame, two chests of drawers and a mirror hanging on one wall. The bedclothes are made of rough cotton, wool, or even burlap, and the blanket is often a patchwork quilt made of whatever was available. A couple of rough benches form a sitting area next to a small table.
