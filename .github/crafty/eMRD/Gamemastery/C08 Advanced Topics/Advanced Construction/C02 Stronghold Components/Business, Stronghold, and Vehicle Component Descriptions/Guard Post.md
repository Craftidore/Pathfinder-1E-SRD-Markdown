# Guard Post
## Overview
**Size:** 0.5 ss

**Cost:** 300 gp

**Prerequisites:** One guard per shift (minimum; many use two per shift)

This component allows guards to keep watch upon the surrounding environs. If part of the exterior wall, it includes free arrow slits instead of a window. 

To place this into a tower, use the Building Up and Down sidebar or simply purchase the Guard Tower Cluster described below.
