# Stable, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 3,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One groom

This stable has hay on the floor, but the ground is either wood or stone. The stables are lined with fresh hay, and each horse has access to its own water supply. The troughs are all made of stone, and thereâ€™s even a small fireplace in here to keep things warm in the winter. A stable requires the employment of a groom (Com1; [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] +5).

This place can hold up to six Large steeds at a time, each in their own stall. If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
