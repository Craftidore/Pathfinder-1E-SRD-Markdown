# Labyrinth
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 500 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Generally found only in dungeon strongholds, labyrinth components serve to confuse and bewilder foes, and perhaps trap them forever. Since a labyrinth, by definition, is nothing more than a series of dividing walls, each labyrinth component counts double when determining the price of walls (in other words, pay twice as much as normal for the walls of this space). In addition, since the walls of a labyrinth often undergo attacks from those wandering through, consider upgrading the quality of these walls from your standard interior walls.

For a larger maze, purchase this component multiple times.
