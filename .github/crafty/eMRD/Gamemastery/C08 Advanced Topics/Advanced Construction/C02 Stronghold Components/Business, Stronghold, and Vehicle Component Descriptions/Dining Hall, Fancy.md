# Dining Hall, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 2 ss

**Cost:** 12,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Kitchen, one servant

This upscale version of the standard dining hall includes finely made tables surrounded with chairs instead of benches. The fireplace usually dominates the center of the room, the smoke drawn into a stony hood that goes into the ceiling. This provides a more even distribution of heat (and more equitable comfort level) in the room.

The mural-covered walls depict local legends or the pantheon of deities respected by the owner. The floor is made of fine flagstones or polished wood.

This seats 30 people comfortably. Purchase this component multiple times if you want a larger dining hall.

One servant brings food and removes empty dishes.
