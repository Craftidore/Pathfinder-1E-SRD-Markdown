# Stable, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 1,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** One groom

This rough, wooden structure features stalls for up to six Large mounts, a wooden water trough, and hay covering the unfinished floor. Tack and saddles hang over the dividing walls between stalls. Because of the smell, youâ€™ll want to place the stable far from the main part of the stronghold. A stable requires the employment of a groom (Com1; [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] +5).

If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
