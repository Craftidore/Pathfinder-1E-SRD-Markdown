# Throne Room, Luxury
## Overview
**Size:** 2 ss

**Cost:** 80,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** Six servants

Affordable only to the most puissant of emperors, queens, and absolute monarchs, this, the finest of assembly rooms, displays the rulerâ€™s wealth, power, and dispensation for the sweet comforts in life. This chamber spares no expense in impressing the visitor, whether visiting ambassador, merchant with goods for sale, or the simplest commoner. The walls display a splash of colors that depict complementary themes of blue skies, splashing white-tipped and wave-filled oceans, white birds awing, and fish jumping into the air. Sparkling gems and precious metals adorn the enormous throne. Raised up on a dozen pink marble steps, the throne and its occupant gaze out on the chamber like an omnipotent ruler.
