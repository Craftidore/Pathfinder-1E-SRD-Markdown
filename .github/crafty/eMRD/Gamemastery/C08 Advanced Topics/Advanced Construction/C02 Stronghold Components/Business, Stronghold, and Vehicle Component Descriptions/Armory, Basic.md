# Armory, Basic
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 500 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

Racks of armor and weapons fill this simple room, which has enough space to hold equipment for 25 soldiers (though the price doesnâ€™t include such gear; see Equipping Staff).

If you need a greater capacity, you can purchase this component multiple times.
