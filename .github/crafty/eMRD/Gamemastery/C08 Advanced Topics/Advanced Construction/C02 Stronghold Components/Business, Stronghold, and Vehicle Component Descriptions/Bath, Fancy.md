# Bath, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 2,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

A step up from the basic bathroom, this bathroom comes complete with a large tub, a chamber pot under a chair, and a means of disposing of the contents of the chamber pot easily. This can take the form of a chute to an underground disposal area, an open window over a gutter, or whatever you like.

A fireplace allows you to heat water for baths. A cabinet holds plenty of towels, and a dressing screen separates part of the room for privacy. Padded, upholstered benches allow comfortable seating. One corner holds a mirror and array of brushes and other grooming devices.
