# Bedrooms, Fancy
## Overview
**Size:** 1 ss

**Cost:** 4,000 gp

**Prerequisites:** None

This area contains two smaller bedrooms with a connecting door. Each room has a bed that rests on a handsome frame and includes a mattress made of cotton batting. The sheets are of fine cotton, and the blankets are wool.

Each room has a finely carved bureau and a handsome wardrobe. A bell rests on a bed stand next to each bed so that the occupants can easily call for the servants. In addition, thereâ€™s an upholstered bench and a small writing desk. This component includes a privy, though it need not be attached or adjacent to the bedroom component itself.
