# C03 Strongholds in the Campaign
## Overview
Creating a stronghold isn’t like running down to your local blacksmith’s shop and picking out a longsword with a balance to your liking. Although you might prefer it to be, it’s not that simple.

First, strongholds never come prefabricated (though Chapter 4 provides some predesigned strongholds that you can use in your campaign). Each one must be custom-built, making it by definition a one-of-a-kind place. Sure, there are some common elements to certain types of strongholds; a great portion of this book is based upon that premise. The way in which you put these elements together makes each stronghold unique.

Second, there’s more to a stronghold than just owning it. Even if you manage to get your hands on a stronghold in reasonably good condition, there’s no guarantee that it will stay that way. Weather and wandering monsters aside, if you went to the trouble to make or take the place yourself, somebody else out there will likely covet it too.

What’s more, strongholds aren’t—generally speaking—portable like most of your possessions. They’re real estate. You can’t pop your stronghold in and out of a *[[Portable Hole|portable hole]]* or a *bag of holding* whenever you like. Places that large are simply hard to hide, no matter what steps you might take, magical or otherwise.

## Building a Stronghold
**BUILDING A STRONGHOLD**

The previous chapters of this book discuss how to put together the plans for your stronghold. Once you have done that, you’re kind of like an architect with a finished set of blueprints. You might have the gold necessary to hire people to get the thing built, but actually getting the place built is something else altogether.

**Location, Location, Location**

The first thing you need to do, if you plan on building a stronghold from the foundation up, is find yourself a place to start digging out that basement. As the saying goes, there are only three things you need to worry about in real estate: location, location, location.

The place you choose to plant your roots defines much about your stronghold. Is it in a city or the country? In the middle of a desert or on the seashore? Atop the highest mountain or in the darkest depths of the ocean? Selecting the right place to build can mean a lot.

Of course, there’s more to it than just picking out a likely piece of land. Beyond simple geography, there are the challenges presented by your likely neighbors. Setting up shop on the edge of a cliff might seem like a great idea at the time—until you discover that the cliff is smack in the middle of orc hunting grounds. These orcs are famous for hunting dragons.

Sometimes even what looks like a good idea falls apart once you actually break ground. Who could have known that the idyllic field you chose for your building site is actually the site of an ancient graveyard? You can bet that the spirits of the bodies your workers have disturbed will be less than understanding about your mistake, no matter how much money you may have paid someone for the rights to the land.

Chapter 1 details the ramifications of a site choice on building costs.

**Supply Routes**

Don’t think about what location might be the most defensible. Other concerns. Include Is the stronghold on a common travel route, or is it far off the beaten path?

If your stronghold is in a remote spot, how will you build it? After all, you have to haul the building materials to the spot, and the workers building it have to come from someplace. They have to live somewhere while they work on the stronghold. Builders like to charge hardship fees if they must subject themselves to ordeals just to construct your new stronghold.

Along that same line, once you finish the place, how will you bring in supplies on a regular basis? Unless you plan on feeding yourself and your workers by magical means on a daily basis, you had better have access to places that can provide what you need.

Alternatively, you can request that the local traveling merchants put your stronghold on their routes. Of course, that means you need to spend some money with them when they arrive. Otherwise, their visits start to trail off or disappear altogether. They’re in this to make money, and if they can’t make a profit off your stronghold, it gets crossed off the list.

**Lining Up Workers**

Unless you plan on building the entire place with your own two hands, you need to line up a contractor to slap the place together. As with most things, the prices from contractor to contractor can vary a lot, up to 25% in either direction—or even more. It’s in your best interests to get quotes from as many different builders as possible and then evaluate them based upon not only cost but timeliness and quality.

There’s an old saying about services: You can have it fast, cheap, or good—pick two. In other words, if you’re in a hurry and want quality, you’re going to have to pay for it. If you have some time, though, or you don’t care about the craftsmanship of your new home, you can often get a break on price.

Many times, contractors specialize in certain kinds of buildings, whether they’re stone, brick, wood, or whatever. They also limit themselves to certain kinds of building. A mason who lays the bricks on your new place doesn’t necessarily know how to raise a roof. For that, you need a roofer. If you want any kind of magical effects in the place—and your character isn’t already a wizard or sorcerer with the right know-how—you need to hire on a contractor with the right kinds of special abilities.

From reading the earlier parts of this book, you should know that help like that doesn’t come cheap. Special requests start to add up, and you can suddenly be looking at a wizard’s bill that as much if not more than the fee you’re paying the more mundane builders.

**Getting Gouged and Cheated**

The closer you are to civilization, the easier it is to find good people at a reasonable price. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere, you may not be able to find qualified craftsmen at all. That means you might have to bring them in from somewhere else, along with the raw materials they need to perform their duties.

The trick here is to be flexible. Anytime you put yourself in a position in which you absolutely must have things a certain way—and the rest of the world finds out about this—you set yourself up to be gouged. The price for services rendered can suddenly skyrocket to up to 10 times as much as you might have planned.

Worse yet is that you might find that you’re being cheated. Unscrupulous people are everywhere and the building industry is no exception. Of course, there are magical means you can employ while interviewing prospective employees, but unless you’re willing to go to such lengths with even the lowliest apprentices on a job, you’re not likely to ferret out every possible person that might try to take you for everything she can.

Sometimes the cheating is more obvious, such as when the builder substitutes cheap materials for the higher-quality and more expensive ones you have agreed to pay for—or simply sells the materials off and then claims that they have been stolen. Other times, it can be a lot subtler, such as the masons shaving a foot off the walls surrounding the place.

The trick here is to pay attention and to find at least one person on the team who you can trust, preferably a leader of some sort. That individual becomes your set of experienced eyes and ears on the job. You aren’t a builder; you’re an adventurer. You likely don’t know the first thing about putting a place together. That’s where it pays to have friends who do.

Also, make sure that you don’t pay for the entire job up front. Builders who have all their money in pocket before they start have a bad habit of becoming lazy about completing the work. It’s just human (or humanoid) nature. The fair way to do things is to pay for the materials when they arrive on the site—or half up front and half on delivery.

The same goes for the labor. If it’s a long-term job, arrange to pay the workers on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis. If it’s a shorter project, pay the workers half up front and half on completion. That bit of money waiting at the end of the job does wonders for a team’s motivation.

**Forewarned Is Forearmed**

The best way to avoid most of these kinds of problems is to do a bit of research before you start. Don’t swoop down on your winged steed and proclaim a seemingly abandoned area for your own. Ride into the nearest town or step into the closest inn and talk over your plans with the locals a bit. Learn as much about the site from them as you can. Do yourself a favor and make friends with these people. After all, if everything works out, they’re going to be your neighbors.

This opportunity is a good chance for a bard or a rogue to make use of a few Gather Information rolls. Since you will live in this place for some time—you hope—make sure that you take your time and learn as much as you can. This can be a source for many an adventure, since you may want to investigate some or all the myriad of rumors swirling about a chosen locale, hoping to determine if your chosen home is right for you.

One reason that many people choose to build their strongholds near their childhood homes or their current stomping grounds is that they don’t have to do this kind of background check on the area. Simply by living in the place, they have already been doing it unconsciously for years. Better the devil you know, as the old saw goes.

Of course, because you find out something dismaying about a location doesn’t mean you have to pull up stakes and find someplace else. Many of the problems you may face could very well be the sorts of things that a stalwart party of adventurers would be perfect for handling. This situation at least answers one nagging question for you: If the locale you’re so in love with is all that fantastic, then why hasn’t anyone ever built there before?

If you can determine the answer to that question—perhaps there’s a nearby graveyard full of ghouls, or maybe that island is the nesting place of a group of dragon turtles—then you can try to solve any problems you have identified.

## Running a Stronghold
**RUNNING A STRONGHOLD**

There’s more to a stronghold than building it. Once it’s up, you must take care of the day-to-day operations of the place. As anyone who’s ever run a household of any size knows, this is not a trivial task.

In general, you can assume that your stronghold runs itself as far as the game is concerned. Just because you don’t have to micromanage every detail of the place’s operation, though, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know more than a little bit about how the place works. 

It’s embarrassing when you can’t introduce your own servants to your guests. Once you figure out who you need to keep your stronghold in tip-top shape for you, take the time to think about who they are and how they came to be in your employ. You’ll want your Dungeon Master’s help with this exercise, since he may have some ideas of his own about the true backgrounds of the people that you have hired on to lend you a hand.

These are the people that you will live with between adventures. You must rely on them at all times, both when at your stronghold and when away in some distant land. In time, these strangers will become part of your extended family, people you trust with your life and the lives of all those you hold dear.

**Delegate**

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is all about glorious adventures, not keeping house. Lounging about the stronghold day and night, engaging in the domestic dramas of daily life isn’t the sort of thing that stirs the blood of great heroes. Just because you knows how to cut the wings off a passing fly with your longsword doesn’t mean you has the first clue about how to keep a place running smoothly. So don’t saddle yourself with that task.

Hire someone to do it for you.

If you have enough discretionary gold or power to build or take over a stronghold, you should have enough to hire some talented person to run it for you. They have a name for people who do exactly this kind of thing: they’re called butlers.

The first thing to do when you move into a new stronghold is hire on the best, most trustworthy butler you can find. Truly talented butlers are worth their weight in gold and then some. They take the dull domestic duties off your plate, freeing you up to do the thing you does best: adventuring.

**Determine Your Needs**

Once you have your butler in place, sit down and determine exactly how many other positions you need to fill to keep the stronghold ticking along like a welloiled watch. Again, the butler’s opinion is going to mean a lot here, since he’s the one with the experience in this field.

The number of staff you’re going to need does depend on the kind of stronghold you have. Many strongholds have a cook, a scullery maid, a stable hand, a handyman, a groundskeeper, and so on. Chapter 2 describes the minimum staff required for various stronghold components.

If your stronghold has special needs, make sure that those are met as well. A place that relies on magic might want to have a wizard on staff—or at least on call for when things turn bad. Similarly, underground strongholds might want a dwarven engineer or architect on hand to keep everything in working order.

If your stronghold has many protective traps, you might need a rogue on staff to keep them all in working order. Even the best traps can go bad with long disuse, and the best rogues maintain their efforts regularly to keep them in tip-top shape.

If your stronghold has a chapel to your character’s favored deity, you might want to have a cleric on staff. After all, the deities aren’t all that impressed by a character who lets his personal altar gather dust.

If concerned about security, hire some extra guards to keep any undesirables out in a pinch. If yours is a large place, the leader of these soldiers is normally known as the captain of the guard, and the welfare of the entire stronghold is charged to him. In the household, the captain’s rank is equivalent to that of the butler, and people in these two positions may butt heads on a regular basis. After all, they each have their own particular jobs to do, and they may not always line up perfectly well.

The truly paranoid may include spellcasters on her security detail as well. They can use their magic to handle details from spotting poison in the stronghold’s water supply to placing wards around the place’s perimeter as a backup to the sometimes all-too-fallible guards.

**Fulfill Your Needs**

Your butler and the captain of your guard can help you find people to fill the various staff positions in your stronghold. In the course of rising to their current positions with you, they’re sure to have made many essential contacts for handling this sort of duty. Let them do their friends a favor by hiring them. You’ll find that you can quickly build a happy and motivated staff this way.

Of course, you have likely also met all sorts of people throughout your travels, and you might decide that hiring on one of them to help out around the place is a fine idea. You not only want someone who’s good at his job, of course; you want someone you can trust too. After all, you’ll be living under the same roof with these people, essentially putting your life and livelihood in their hands, not an area in which you want your character to be lax.

When budgeting costs for your stronghold, don’t forget about the salaries of your staff. Find the right people for you, and then pay them what they’re worth. These are the people that help transform your stronghold into a home. Without them your new place would be a lot colder and quieter, for sure.

**Making It Pay**

As far as the game is concerned, once you get your stronghold up and running, you can safely assume that the operation is self-sufficient in the sense that it pays for itself. In other words, the income it generates is sufficient to cover the expenses that crop up for maintaining the place (not including staff salaries).

This guideline is not a blank check for you to make extravagant demands on your DM with regard to amenities in your stronghold. If you go overboard, the DM can and should assign a yearly maintenance fee to you in order to keep the place smoothly purring along. In most cases, it shouldn’t exceed 1 to 2% of the total stronghold cost, and only extraordinary cases should bring it to more than 5% of the total cost of building your stronghold. In all cases, the DM’s call is final.

In order to avoid such costs simply coming straight out of your pocket, look into ways that the stronghold itself can generate additional revenue. The most obvious method is by taxing the people of the surrounding countryside. Of course, most people aren’t willing to pay taxes in exchange for nothing in return.

In many cases, the owners of a stronghold offer their protection from exterior threats as services rendered for the tax income. This adds a bit to your responsibilities, although your staff should be able to take care of most problems such as hungry wolves or the occasional ogre making off with livestock.

Every now and then, though, some larger menace may threaten the surrounding land. What better opportunity for adventure could there be? This situation is exactly what calls for you to rise to the clarion call to arms and rally the land about you to save the day.

Less noble characters can run a similar kind of operation, but it’s actually a protection racket. In other words, your guards “suggest” to the locals in the area that they cough up their “taxes” because, hey, you never know when the master’s pet monsters might get loose and go rampaging through the neighborhood. “Accidents” can happen. Those taxes can go a long way toward making sure that they don’t.

Many times, when you purchase the land for a stronghold, you also get the rights to much of the area around it as well. This land may be filled with all sorts of things that can generate an honest coin: farms, orchards, mines, and so on. Chapter 1 describes how you can incorporate an income source into your stronghold’s construction costs; such sources typically return a value of about 1% of the stronghold’s cost per year. If you have paid for it in this way, you don’t have to build the infrastructure or hire the hands to help make money from these resources on your land.

Some strongholds include an academy, where tutors mentor younger students in the ways of their chosen professions (their classes). The tuition fees help pay for the cost of keeping the stronghold running.

If you are particularly aggressive about building the area around your stronghold into a little empire, the DM could even decide to award a yearly payment to represent the profits the place generates. This should never be higher than 5% of what the stronghold cost to build in the first place, and it should most often be closer to 1–2%.

**The Ties that Bind**

Just as a stronghold should not constantly drain your resources, nor is it meant to be a regular boon. If you insist on building yourself a business instead of a home, it means you will be less available for adventuring. Businesses require constant attention, especially ones that are struggling to grow. Leaving the details to an underling—no matter how qualified—is not acceptable.

If the underling is that amazing at business to be able to handle everything without your involvement, the underling is likely to bolt at the first opportunity. Why should he spend his days making someone else rich when he can clearly do so for himself? 

More reliable but less spectacular employees can maintain a stronghold at as a break-even proposition, but that’s about it. For the business to truly grow, you must invest as much time into it as money—if not more. If you plan on continuing as an adventurer, that will become a problem.

This conflict of interest should become clear the first time your fellows call for you to join them on an adventure and you finds that you can’t get away due to your business obligations. If this happens too often, your friends will eventually get the hint and quit calling on you.

In fact, if you end up doing this much at all, the DM should step in and ask you to retire the character. If you’re only going to be a landed lord or lady from here on out, there’s little point for you to be involved in an adventure game.

If this happens, the character becomes an NPC fully under the DM’s control, and you should set about creating a whole new character from scratch. If you don’t want to start all the way over again, you might consider taking on the role of your previous character’s captain of the guard or one of his lieutenants, or some other character affiliated with the stronghold. In this way, the new character can represent the original character on adventures as a kind of proxy both in name and spirit, lending some continuity to your involvement in the campaign. Either way, it’s the DM’s call as to whether or not this should be permitted.

In any case, the original character should still crop up in the game from time to time, perhaps asking you and your fellows to go on missions for her or to lend her a hand. In certain cases, you might even return to playing the original character for a session or two. However, until that character gives up her involvement in the business of her stronghold, this arrangement can’t possibly last.

## Protecting a Stronghold
**PROTECTING A STRONGHOLD**

Once you get your stronghold built, you face the same problem that every landowner has faced since the first elf staked his claim on a particularly handsome tree: keeping it. As an adventurer, you have likely invaded and maybe even destroyed your share of strongholds in your illustrious career. Think about this for a moment. Every one of those strongholds was for a reason, possibly for the same reasons you want to create your own stronghold.

Then you and your friends waltzed in and made a mess of the place.

What’s to prevent other “adventurers”—“trespassers” you’ll call them now—from doing the same thing to your place? You.

The key here is preparation. When building a stronghold, security should be first and foremost in your mind. Sure, you want that beautiful courtyard to sun yourself in and that well-appointed laboratory for your innovative magical experiments, but if you leave the front door unguarded and unlocked, chances are good that someone will tromp right in and take the whole thing away from you while you sleep.

Some strongholds are more secure by their very nature. A floating keep is impossible for most landbound monsters and people to get at. An island fortress isn’t quite as secure, but it’s a lot harder to lay siege to.

If you can’t secure your place by fortune of geography, you can always fortify the place with strong walls, locked windows and doors, deep moats, and even weapons emplacements. The less you have to rely on these, the better. Sometimes you have no choice, but when you can you should do your best to stack the odds heavily in your favor.

**For the Dungeon Master**

Once one or more of your player characters has established his stronghold, you have a new means of crafting adventures—a ready-made hook for a new style of mission-based game. While usually the characters are the ones plumbing the depth of a foreign castle or dungeon, now they take up the role of the guardians of a locale. Why else should a character take time to employ soldiers or purchase military components, wondrous architecture, or traps?

Like any adventure, make stronghold-based adventures fit within the context of your campaign. Not every adventure should involve a character’s stronghold, and not every one that does should be a simple siege. One adventure may be a site-based adventure in which creatures assault the stronghold, and another a more event-driven adventure in which a villain has a series of objectives that the characters must first discover and then deal with. Variety is the spice of the adventurer’s life.

As a guideline, use stronghold adventures for somewhere between ten and thirty percent of your campaign’s adventure. If more than one in four of your adventures centers around the stronghold, the characters may feel bored and trapped within their own homes. If less than one in ten of your adventures involve the stronghold, the characters may rightly feel that their stronghold has been forgotten, or that it has no value.

Adventures featuring the stronghold should use the same rules for building adventures (such as encounter levels) found in Chapter 4 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.*

**Let Others Do Your Work for You**

If you can’t afford to send your castle soaring over the heads of the world below or to bury it deep within the earth—or to even come up with a decent set of guard posts—there’s one obvious option for you. Set up your stronghold within someone else’s.

The residents of many walled cities would be happy to be home to a wealthy and powerful adventurer. Let the city’s own fortifications be your first line of defense. Sure, you may end up having to pay taxes to the local ruler, but that may prove cheaper than hiring on your own soldiers to keep your place safe.

The best part of setting up your stronghold inside someone else’s is that you have an ally when things go bad. If someone wants to break into your stronghold, they have to get through the rest of the city first. This eliminates the chance of a foe using the tactic of showing up on your doorstep with a well-armed army behind her—unless they really want you, in which case, you should be happy to have all your fellow citizens to rally around you against your common foe.

The downside to setting up shop inside a city or a large castle or whatever is that you make yourself accessible to a larger number of thieves and the like. After all, if they want to rob someone, why bother with hauling themselves all the way out into the wilderness to find a target when there’s one just down the block?

Of course, if someone does try to rob you, at least you can call on the local guard for help. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere, you’re on your own.

**You Don’t Live in a Vacuum**

As much as you might like to pretend it, you don’t live in a vacuum. The actions that you take have wide-reaching ramifications, many of which are practically impossible for to predict.

For instance, if you clear out a graveyard of ghouls, you may win the praise of the local clerics and the rest of the land. What if those ghouls were actually serving some kind of purpose in a gruesome sort of food chain? If the ghouls were feeding on the goblin tribe living in caves under the cemetery, their disappearance could allow the goblins to focus their energies on the nearby town instead of the ghouls, creating a whole new problem to deal with.

Similarly, when you come in and set up house in an area, the locals will notice. Perhaps the wizard on the next hillock over is jealous about the attention that her new “rival” is getting and so works to cause you problems every step of the way. It doesn’t have to be so black and white as good versus evil here, just the everyday, all-too-normal emotions of envy or injured pride at work.

In addition, if thieves in the area seek a juicy new target, you might have just as well painted a target on your shiny new front door. Until the local criminal element is shown differently, they may see your new home as easy pickings.

If you are evil, expect to become the foe of choice of every do-gooder in the region. After all, what could be more tempting to a paladin than the chance to root out a new infestation of evil before digs in too deep?

**Keep a Low Profile**

The corollary of the preceding fact is that it’s smart to keep a low profile—if you can. Many strongholds are too large to hide. A new tower in the center of town causes people to talk, no matter what you might do.

However, if you can keep the location of your stronghold hidden—or, at the very least, secret—that’s a wonderful first line of defense. After all, your enemies can’t attack your new home if they can’t find it.

For some characters, keeping a low profile can be hard work. Adventurers tend to be glory hounds by their very nature. Hiding their light under a bushel doesn’t come naturally to them.

Of course, magical means of hiding a stronghold exist. Illusions can do wonders for this. If an island fortress hides behind an illusion that makes it look like the rest of the lake, only someone who rows out to where the island actually is will ever notice it.

Underground and underwater strongholds can easily be hidden, by their very nature. Floating or flying strongholds are harder to hide, but when they’re discovered, it’s easy enough to move them to a whole new location, something impossible with most other strongholds.

Be sure not to rely entirely on hiding your stronghold to protect it. Sooner or later, someone with ill intentions will stumble across the place’s location. Whether this is by accident or on purpose, have some contingency plans in place for when that day comes.

**Use It or Lose It**

Once a foe actually discovers your place and attacks it, the best defense is often a great offense. This tactic is especially important if the location of your stronghold is now well known.

Often the best means of scaring off potential trouble is to do it loudly so that everyone knows what happened. If your foes simply disappear without a trace after invading your home, it can take weeks, months, or years for the slower predators in the area to take the hint.

In short, if you get into a situation in which you must fight to defend your stronghold, it’s in your best interest to make an example of the target in question. The more people who know about the your ruthless means of dealing with intruders, the fewer intruders you’re likely to have to worry about in the future.

Some canny characters even stage such events. They hire on stooges to make an attempt on their homes, and then they run them out of town in as public a manner as possible. Spellcasters have an even easier time of this. Often, it takes only a display of strength—a series of *fireballs* or *lightning bolts*, for instance—to scare off timid, would-be invaders.

Such tactics can backfire. If you are willing to fight for your place so hard, some members of your “audience” may decide that the place must hold something worth protecting. By scaring off the riff-raff, you may attract a higher class of trouble.

Greedy dragons, for instance, don’t bother with raiding keeps full of nothing but sheep—unless they’re hungry. When they hear about a place stacked to the ceiling with gold, it gets their attention. A dragon’s attention is something most characters would rather do without.

**Hire Those You Can Trust**

It’s one thing to forgo interrogating each and every member of the crew that builds your home. When it comes to members of your staff, take every step you can to make sure that they are 100% on your side

.

Nothing can take a well-planned security system down faster than a traitor from within. If someone can eliminate protective measures before an attack begins, the invaders are surely going to have an easy time of it. 

All sorts of magical means exist that can assure you of your staff members’ loyalty. If you can’t such details yourself, hire on those who can—as long as you can trust those people.

Casting enchantments to force loyalty is usually a bad move, especially if you rely on someone else to cast the spells and thus serve as the actual controller. If and when the enchantment ends, the targeted staff members will (justifiably) feel victimized. Having your staff that angry at you is not a good idea. After all, it’s likely that you will sleep under the same roof with these people.

The better and subtler way to handle loyalty is to earn it, but that takes time. In the meanwhile, cast *detect evil* or *detect chaos* when interviewing prospective employees. *Detect thoughts* comes in handy here as well. Of course, well-prepared moles find ways to defeat these magical means of detection, so it never hurts to rely on your own best judgment as well.

Earning the loyalty of staff members is a journey, not a goal. Employees who are your friends one day can transform into your most bitter enemies if they feel slighted. The only real way to prevent against intentional treachery from this quarter is to treat your staff as well as possible at all times.

Enemies can also blackmail or bribe your employees. The most loyal ones will alert their bosses to any attempts to subvert them, but sometimes even the best people can’t find their way out of a bad situation without hurting someone in the process. It always pays to keep your eyes peeled for suspicious behavior from even the most trusted members of your staff.

**Outposts**

The first line of defense for your stronghold doesn’t have to be the stronghold itself. If your place nestles in the heart of a peaceful valley, for instance, build an outpost or two on the roads leading into the place or overlooking the pass or river that leads into your home.

These can be as simple as wooden watchtowers or as elaborate as stone keeps. Each of them must maintain a guard watch around the clock to be effective, and the night watchers should have some means of seeing in the dark to be fully effective. A simple set of torches or a globe with *continual flame* cast upon it can work, but they also make the watchtower stick out like a full moon on a dark, cloudless night. If you’re trying to keep the location of your stronghold hidden, this is a

dead giveaway.

Even more important, though, is having a means for the people in the watchtowers to communicate with your stronghold. Since the watchers will likely have a bit of a head start on anyone they spot, a simple runner or a horseman might be enough. For top-of-the-line defense, you can’t beat a *mirror of mental prowess* or other similar means of magical communication.

If you have a clear line of sight from the main stronghold to the outposts, cheaper and simpler methods are about as effective. The watchers can use a set of signal flags, for instance, switching to signal torches or lanterns at night. (One if by land, two if by sea, three if by air, and so on.)

Standing guard in a watchtower is the most dangerous guard duty there is. When someone decides to attack your stronghold, he’ll start by taking out the watchers before they can alert you to the impending danger.

**Keeping Watch**

The basic mechanic behind a watch is that the watcher’s Perception (v3.5 Spot) check is opposed by the invader’s Stealth (v3.5 Hide) roll. That’s simple enough, but it can be affected by a number of modifiers.

Begin by determining the limits of the watcher’s vision. Table 3–1 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* indicates the limits of spotting distance in various terrains. You can either use the average distance indicated or roll whenever appropriate. For instance, in a dense forest, the watcher can’t make a Spot check until the intruder comes within 2d4 times 10 feet (or 50 feet if using the average).

Once the intruding creatures come within spotting range, the watcher may make a Perception (v3.5 Spot) check each round to notice the intruders. The base DC to spot a creature at this distance is 20. If the intruding creature is actively hiding, the base DC instead becomes 25 + the hider’s Stealth (v3.5 Hide) skill modifier. Don’t forget to apply any modifiers to this DC as listed on Table 3–2 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*.

An elevated watch position may grant a circumstance bonus on the watcher’s Perception (v3.5 Spot) check in terrains where that would be helpful. Consult Table 3–1: Elevation Bonus on Perception (v3.5 Spot) Checks.

**Table 3–1: Elevation Bonus on Perception (v3.5 Spot) Checks**


| **Terrain** | **Elevation Bonus** |
|---|---|
| Smoke or heavy fog | None |
| Jungle or dense forest | None |
| Light forest | +1 per 10 feet (maximum +2) |
| Scrub, brush, or bush | +1 per 10 feet (maximum +5) |
| Grassland, little cover | +2 per 10 feet (maximum +10) |
| Total darkness | None |
| Indoors (lit) | +4 per 10 feet (maximum +20) |

Make a separate Perception (v3.5 Spot) check for each watcher observing the area. Alternatively, when multiple watchers are part of the same patrol or guard post, you can assume that they assist one another. In that case, simply add a +2 circumstance bonus on the primary watcher’s Spot check for each additional watcher.

Don’t forget to allow guards to make Listen checks to hear intruders sneaking up on them. In this case, simply use the intruders’ Move Silently check as a target for the Perception (v3.5 Listen) check (add +1 to the DC per 10 feet of distance).

**Creating a Watch Schedule**

The captain of your guard should be happy to come up with a proper watch schedule, and he can even hire the guards to execute it. It’s up to you, however, to actually keep them happy by paying them on time.

The trick behind setting up a successful watch is using multiple people in each watch point and making sure that they get regular breaks. Keeping watch may sound like a lark, the easiest of jobs—all you have to do is keep your eyes peeled, after all—but in reality, it’s a constant battle against boredom and lax complacency to do the job right.

Assuming you run a 24-hour watch, set up either three 8-hour shifts or—better yet—four 6-hour shifts. Set up patrols in pairs so that every watcher has someone to help keep him from slacking on the job. Even if a sniper takes out one watcher, the other one might still have a chance to raise the alarm before he’s attacked as well.

Long or stationary watches tend to dull the senses. The DM should feel free to apply a –2 circumstance penalty on Perception (v3.5 Spot and Listen) checks of any sentry on the job for more than 6 consecutive hours, or who is stationed on a specific post (as opposed to being part of a roving patrol). 

Thus, a fully staffed guard post requires either six or eight guards (depending on whether you use 8-hour or 6-hour shifts).

## Assaulting a Stronghold
**ASSAULTING A STRONGHOLD**

Building a whole new stronghold from scratch can be a heck of a hassle. Assuming you can find one, it’s a lot easier to take one that you like. Of course, good characters don’t wander around stealing people’s homes from them. However, if you manage to find a villain who happens to live in a stronghold you want, then stomping on into that place and booting out the current tenants is likely fair game, especially in the more lawless lands.

In the more civilized parts of the world, however, it’s not acceptable to waltz on in and take someone’s home, no matter what their alignment. Laws are in place to prevent theft of any kind, especially if it’s connected with the murder of the owners of said property. Without proper planning, you can actually find yourself on the wrong side of the law if you’re not careful.

Remember that D&D is a game about skirmishes between groups. Its rules represent the action between a small number of creatures and heroic characters. It’s not designed to represent the confrontations between armies. To best make use of the D&D rules, even if your story involves a larger action of hundreds or even thousands of troops, your game session should reflect the actions of the characters in actions against smaller numbers of foes: infiltrators, spies, and invaders. For the most part, you should be using the same tactics whether the characters are attacking or defending a stronghold. Characters attacking a stronghold rely on infiltration and stealth to accomplish their objectives; they don’t generally bring catapults to the fray. Just the same, you can bring to bear hostile creatures, enemy forces, and villains to engage the characters’ stronghold. The larger story of a battle or war is something that your characters can participate in, but are ultimately up to the DM to decide.

The rules here focus on attacks against the structure itself and dealing damage to its parts and components.

**Strike Team**

One of the most popular ways of invading a stronghold is to send in an elite strike team of adventurers to take out a key portion of the place’s defense—or simply to eliminate the stronghold’s owner. This idea can be the source of many adventures.

The benefits of using a strike team are easy to see. Coordinating an army to invade a stronghold is difficult and costly. It’s hard enough to get a party of adventurers all headed in the same direction at once. Imagine the difficulties when multiplying the number of people involved a hundredfold.

A strike team, by comparison, is fairly straightforward. You gather a group of people who have the skills necessary to get the job done, you come up with the best plan that you can, and then you execute it.

Best of all, the rewards for the members of a strike team are usually much better than they are if an army is involved. Those soldiers expect to be well paid for their work, after all, and that means that much less can be had by you and your closest friends.

In the heat of battle, an army can do a tremendous amount of damage to a stronghold. If you’re trying to capture the place and take it as your own, this means you will have a lot of cleaning up to do after it’s all over. In some cases, the damage may be bad enough that you decide to call the place a total loss. Lots of ruins exist in the world that got their start this way.

Even if the army leaves the structure of the stronghold intact, many invaders feel that sacking the place is part of the privilege accorded them as the victors. These are the spoils of war, so to speak. No matter how you might try to govern such behavior, you can be sure that some foot soldiers will stuff their pockets with as many valuables as they can. You’re not going to be able to stop it all. 

With a strike team, on the other hand, if the goals are achieved efficiently, there can be little damage done to the stronghold, and most of the valuables will likely be left in place. When the current occupants are run out of the place, you can be sure that they’ll try to take everything with them that’s not nailed down, but since they’re on the losing end of things, they likely won’t have enough time to do more than grab a few essential items.

The trick with a strike team is getting enough intelligence about the target before you move in. A poorly forewarned strike team is walking into a lion’s mouth. No matter how good the party may be, you can be sure that eventualities will crop up that the invaders couldn’t possibly have planned for.

Fortunately, many strongholds are only set up to prevent massive attacks from large, well-armed forces. Often, a small, well-informed strike team can find many security holes to exploit, things that an army wouldn’t be able to do. If the characters are good, they might even be able to take over the place without having to spill a single drop of blood.

Don’t count on it. As you will discover firsthand once you’re in charge of your own place, the people who own strongholds rarely are willing to give them up without a fight.

**Laying Siege**

Sometime the straightforward ways are the best. If defenders repel your strike team—or if sending one in seems too dangerous or fruitless—then it’s time to pull out all the stops. It’s time to gather an army and lay siege to the place.

The means by which you lay siege to a stronghold can vary, depending on the style of stronghold. It’s difficult, for instance, to lay siege to a flying fortress, but establishing an aerial blockade around the place can do it. Similarly, there are often too many ways for people to get in and out of a submerged stronghold, but naval, submersible blockades can do a lot here as well.

The whole idea behind a siege is to set up camp around a stronghold and cut off the flow of essential supplies to the place. This presupposes that the forces inside the stronghold would have their heads handed to them were they to meet the invading force on an open field of battle, that the only thing keeping the invaders from succeeding outright is the not-so-trivial matter of the stronghold’s formidable defenses. Otherwise, the defenders would simply open the stronghold’s gates, storm out onto the area outside their home, and make quick work of their would-be attackers.

Few places in the world are entirely self-sufficient. Many have their own ready supplies of water, but food and other resources are another matter entirely. Eventually, a place under siege will exhaust its stores and end up surrendering peacefully, aware that it has little hope of standing against the invading force before starving to death.

At least, that’s the theory of those laying siege to the place. It doesn’t always stand up to reality. 

Spellcasters, for instance, can help supply clean food and water from thin air, providing some sustenance to those trapped inside the stronghold with them. Even a low-level cleric has access to spells such as *create water* and *purify food and water,* and a 5th-level cleric can cast *create food and water* to keep five allies sated indefinitely. Strongholds tight on storage space store scrolls of *create food and water* for this very purpose. Certain magic items can help out here a lot, such as a *decanter of endless water*, but even these are usually only stopgap measures.

Furthermore, the defenders can use magic to circumvent the siege. Most armies have little chance of stopping an invisible flying character going in and out of a fortress, and a high-level wizard or sorcerer with *teleport* can supply a decent-sized stronghold without the besieging forces suspecting a thing.

Many strongholds also have secret ways in and out for such an eventuality. Unless the attackers manage to find and plug each and every one of these holes—both magical and mundane—the siege is going to be a long one and may not succeed at all.

The longer a siege takes, the lower its chance of success. All but the most vile villains have friends or allies they can call upon to aid them in such times. Once the cavalry arrives, the attackers can quickly find themselves fighting a battle on two or more fronts, and this is often a losing proposition.

Worse yet is the effect that a long siege can have upon your own ranks. Soldiers are fighters, ill-suited for long periods of inactivity. The simple matter of sitting around outside a stronghold for too long can dull their senses and their skills. Keeping their attention focused where it needs to be can be a true challenge on a daily basis.

So the trick with a siege is to lay as much pressure on the defenders as can be done to get them to capitulate as quickly possible. If this can’t be done, then other alternatives need to be explored, or the effort is doomed to failure.

**Smoking Them Out**

One of the biggest dangers to any stronghold is fire—with the exception of underwater strongholds, which are, of course, immune to such things. When a fire rages through a stronghold, putting it out becomes the top priority, surpassing even that of keeping invaders from knocking down the front door.

This reason is why many strongholds are built from nonflammable materials, such as stone walls and slate roofs. It’s difficult to make a place entirely fireproof however. Even if the building itself is impossible to burn, the same can’t often be said for its contents. Many stone strongholds have wooden floors or support beams throughout them, and the furnishings are almost always susceptible to fire.

The real problem here is that the invader is making a choice to damage the stronghold directly. If you’re after the stronghold itself, this is probably not such a great idea. However, if the place can be brought down so simply, perhaps you would be better off with another stronghold. If you were to move in and occupy the place, it would likely only be a matter of time before someone else would use your same tactics to drive you out of your new home.

Using fire inside the stronghold ensures that if you carry the day you’ll be taking damaged goods as your prize. Fires are often unpredictable and certainly indiscriminate. They devour everything they can.

If the fire drives the defenders out of the place, you may then find yourself fighting to put out the very blaze you caused. If the defenders don’t simply head for the hills, you can end up battling against them at the same time—not an enviable position to be in.

More restrained invaders can simply set fires upwind from the stronghold and hope for the resultant smoke to choke the defenders out. In most fires, it’s actually the smoke that kills someone long before the flames actually get to them, and a number of strategically placed fires can make even the best-defended stronghold a fairly uncomfortable place to be.

The real danger with this strategy is that a shift in the wind can place your forces in the very position into which you were planning to place your foes. Wise commanders make sure to have a friend with a *control winds* or *control weather* spell handy to make sure that the conditions continue to favor their side. The same can be said for the defenders, of course, and the result of the struggles between two opposing spellcasters often means the difference between victory and defeat.

**Attacking the Structure**

Sometimes there’s nothing else for it. If you want to get into a stronghold, you’re going to have to do it the hard way: by knocking down the front door and storming on in. Tactics for this scenario vary a lot depending on the kind of stronghold you’re attacking. However, there are always a few common elements in any of these situations that you can try to tilt in your favor.

Barring significant power discrepancies, superior numbers generally triumph in most battles, especially in a large stronghold in which you don’t want to give the defenders any place to hide. With a larger force, you can attack from several different directions at once, forcing the defenders to split their limited resources. The more fronts they fight on at once, the more difficult it is for them to coordinate their defense. As an attacker, you only need make a breakthrough on a single front for the defense’s whole plan to fall apart.

It’s always easier to attack then defend. The defenders must wait for you to come to them, meaning you can select the time and manner in which the fight begins and progresses. If things turn badly against you, you can often call a retreat without fear of being pursued. You can then lick your wounds for a while and give it another shot on another day. After all—in most cases, at least—that stronghold’s not going anywhere.

There’s a lot to be said for the element of surprise in any attack. It can be difficult to pull off, especially with a large force, but if you can manage to catch your foes unaware, you can do a lot of damage to their chances before they can even muster a response.

The flip side of this is that forewarned defenders have the chance to prepare a nasty surprise for your forces. It’s amazing how resourceful people can be about protecting their own homes. If you let them know you’re coming and bringing hell along with you, all you’re doing is giving them time to heat up the boiling oil in the kettles on the ramparts.

The best tactic then is to hit your target hard and fast, before the defenders can realize what’s going on. If you can do this under the cover of night, all the better, especially if your solders can see in the dark and the defenders cannot. Little is more terrifying than trying to fight off an assault by attackers that can’t be seen.

Attacking the stronghold is like attacking any other object: the walls have armor class, hardness, and hit points. Each must be overcome in turn for you to destroy the structure. Furthermore, some parts of a stronghold get saving throws against magic attacks.

**Armor Class:** This hurdle is the easiest to overcome, because strongholds are (usually) immobile and have very low armor classes. A stronghold has an AC of –3: 10 – 5 (for its effective Dexterity of 0) –8 (most fortresses are Colossal in size).

Aiming at a specific part of a stronghold is harder. Most doors are AC 4: 10 – 5 (Dexterity 0) –1 (size Large), and most windows are AC 5 (they’re effectively Medium-sized).

A stronghold isn’t tough defensively because it has a high AC. It’s tough defensively because it grants high AC to its defenders (mostly through cover bonuses).

**Hardness:** A wall’s hardness rating represents how well it resists damage. Subtract this hardness rating from damage before it’s applied—no matter what the source of damage is. If you deal 10 points of damage to a wall with hardness of 8, the wall takes 2 points of damage. Hardness is strictly a quality of the material, and it doesn’t change based on its thickness. One foot of stone has the same hardness as 10 feet of the stuff.

In general, wood has a hardness of 5, stone has a hardness of 8, and iron has a hardness of 10. That means that no dagger wielded by a Strength 10 character will damage a wooden wall, nor will a longsword wielded by such an attacker penetrate stone, and only a greataxe has a chance to cut through iron. Hardness counts for each blow, so dealing two 4-point attacks won’t damage a wall with hardness 5.

**Hit Points:** Once you have hit the stronghold and overcome the hardness of the wall, the rest of the damage reduces its hit points. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of wall has hit points listed for certain thicknesses; walls twice as thick have twice the hit points, and so on. For example, a 1-foot thick masonry wall has 90 hit points. A 3-foot thick masonry wall has 270 hit points.

*Immunities and Resistances:* As with other objects, strongholds are immune to critical hits and subdual damage. They take half damage from ranged weapons, except for siege weapons such as catapults, ballistas, and trebuchets (see below). Strongholds also take half damage from acid, fire, and lightning attacks, and one-quarter damage from cold attacks. Divide the damage by the appropriate amount before applying the wall’s hardness. Sonic attacks do full damage.

*Effects of Damage:* Once a wall or other part of stronghold has taken 10% of its total hit points in damage, the scars and gouges are noticeable. If the part was particularly artistic—a fresco painting on the wall, for example—it’s noticeably marred at this point. When the wall has taken 50% of its hit points in damage, cracks and rends appear. At 75% of its hit points in damage, holes are apparent (although opponents on opposite sides of the wall have nine-tenths cover from each other). The wall collapses when its hit points are exhausted.

If you’re attacking a multilayered wall, you must overcome each layer in turn. A single attack that has “left-over” damage after destroying the previous layer must overcome the hardness of the new layer before damaging it.

**Collateral Damage:** If you destroy a 10-foot-by-10-foot section of wall, you weaken nearby walls. Wall sections to either side of the destroyed wall take 10% of their total hit points in damage, and walls above take 50% of their hit points in damage. Figure out the total damage, then subtract the wall’s hardness. For example, if you destroy a 10-foot by 10-foot section of masonry wall (90 hit points) on the first floor of a stronghold, the wall sections to either side will take 1 point of damage each (9 – hardness 8). Masonry wall sections above the destroyed section take 37 points of damage (45 – hardness 8). Collateral damage is cumulative; a wall section on the third story takes damage when the first story section below it is destroyed, and again when the second-story section below it is destroyed.

Characters standing near a wall when it’s destroyed risk getting caught in the rubble, unless the destruction was caused by something such as a *disintegrate* spell. Characters within 5 feet of a wall section when it’s destroyed suffer 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 50 hit points of the wall section, to a maximum of 10d6 (Reflex save DC 15 halves). Those who fail their Reflex saves are pinned beneath the rubble, and they take 1d6 points of subdual damage per round. Pinned characters who fall unconscious from subdual damage must make a Constitution check (DC 15) or take 1d6 points of normal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

**Saving Throws:** Nonmagical parts of a stronghold always fail their saves, but magic components and extras get saving throws. Their Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saving throw bonuses are equal to 2 + the caster level of the magic component or extra.

**Anti-Stronghold Magic**

Many strongholds employ magic to augment their defenses, so it’s only natural that attackers will use spells as well. Here are some spells particularly effective against strongholds, along with their cost if you hire an NPC spellcaster to cast them for you. Note that the prices below represent the minimum costs to have the spells cast for you by an NPC. Assuming you aren’t already paying the NPC as part of your attacking force, these prices should increase (by 100% or more) when cast in hazardous situations (such as part of a siege or other assault).

In addition to the strictly offensive spells discussed below, spells such as *invisibility*, *fly,* and *teleport* offer means that stronghold defenders must account for within the fantasy environment. Spells such as these can make even the highest walls and well-intentioned guards wholly ineffective. To counter such threats, the stronghold builder should be sure to be able to include options such as a *chamber of seeing* (see Wondrous Architecture in Chapter 2) or sentinels with access to *see invisibility*. To deal with flying character or creatures, an array of ranged weapons or puissant arcane spellcasters are required. It almost goes without saying, but constructing a stronghold with an open and undefended central courtyard is unwise when a dragon or wyvern could drop in. While *teleport* may be difficult to prevent without raising the stronghold’s cost (see the *ethereal solid* augmentation in Chapter 2), alarms can at least warn the castle’s inhabitants when the castle’s walls have been circumvented.

***Disintegrate* (660 gp)**

This spell is the bane of many strongholds’ existence, because it cuts through everything—wood, stone, adamantine, and *wall of force*—with equal ease. A 10-foot cube of matter simply goes away. Attacking spellcasters typically aim this ray at the ground level of a stronghold to maximize the collateral damage they’ll do.

It’s worth noting that magic wall layers and magic augmentations get Fortitude saving throws against *disintegrate*, and if they succeed, they take 5d6 points of damage instead. *Disintegrate* can otherwise punch through multiple layers of the wall, because such a wall counts as a single multilayered object, not multiple objects.

***Earthquake* (910 gp)**

The spell description notes that “most structures standing on open ground collapse,” but particularly well-built structures have a chance of standing even the strongest earthquake. Every wall section within the area of *earthquake* takes 3d6 ×10 points of damage. Start with the ground-floor wall sections and work upward, because collateral damage might make a difference. If it’s too time-consuming to figure out the effects on every wall section, deal 3d6 ×10 points of damage to each stronghold space, which for the purpose of this calculation has the same hit points as any one of its wall sections. If the stronghold space collapses, deal collateral damage to adjacent and higher stronghold spaces just as you would if they were individual wall sections. In other words, each stronghold space becomes an average of its wall sections, and all the walls in a stronghold space share the same fate.

*Earthquake* further notes that underground strongholds “collapse the roof.” Because they’re surrounded on all sides by shifting, shaking earth, underground strongholds take more damage from the *earthquake* spell: 3d6 ×50 points of damage.

Finally, the cracks in the earth created by the spell will quickly drain moats and rivers, turning them into muddy ground that traps characters who fail Reflex saves (DC 15). Drained moats stay drained after *earthquake* ends, but rivers will flow again with a torrent of water, possibly drowning those stuck in the mud.

***Soften Earth and Stone* (60 gp)**

This spell can deal “a moderate amount of structural damage” by softening the ground underneath an aboveground structure. If the stronghold sits on ordinary ground, such an attack deals 2d4 ×10 points of damage to each 10-foot section of wall so attacked. Strongholds that sit on stone surfaces find their surroundings turned to soft clay, dealing 1d4 ×10 points of damage to ground-level wall sections as they settle.

This spell isn’t typically effective against an underground stronghold such as a dungeon because it only affects unworked earth and stone, and dungeons have little of that. Natural caverns will be reduced to a claylike consistency, enabling attackers to cut and reshape the walls.

***Stone Shape* (150 gp)**

If all you need is a hole in a stone wall, this is your spell. It affects a minimum of 15 cubic feet, which can create a slightly larger than 2-foot-by-2-foot hole in a 3-foot thick wall—enough for a person to climb through. Multiple castings can entirely compromise the protection afforded by stone barriers.

You can also use *stone shape* to weaken an existing structure by thinning a large area of wall. For instance, you can shave a foot of thickness from a 3-foot-thick stone wall in a 15-square-foot area, reducing its hit points by a third.

***Transmute Rock to Mud* (450 gp)**

Much like *soften earth and stone*, *transmute rock to mud* only affects unworked stone, so it can’t be used against most strongholds directly. If it can reach natural rock underneath a stronghold’s foundation, it deals 2d4 ×10 points of damage to each wall section on the ground level, just as *soften earth and stone* does. Note that unlike its lower-level counterpart, *transmute rock to mud* affects two 10-foot cubes per level, and the spell’s area is shapeable.

Against strongholds built from natural caverns, *transmute rock to mud* causes cave-ins that deal 8d6 points of damage within the spell’s area and force a Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid being buried in the rubble.

***Warp Wood and Wood Shape* (60 gp)**

Each of these spells has a similar effect upon wooden barriers, such as doors or shuttered windows: it renders them useless. A locked door doesn’t provide much protection if it’s bent or deformed. Note that *wood shape* has a larger effect, though it requires the caster to touch the target.

**Sapping**

If you can dig underneath a wall, you can collapse it by removing its foundation. In general it takes an hour of digging to weaken a section of wall to the point where it takes 2d6 ×10 points of damage. Using multiple diggers cuts the digging time: two sappers will deal 2d6 ×10 points of damage every 30 minutes of digging, and four sappers deal the damage after 15 minutes. If your sappers are unusually strong (Strength 20+), they dig twice as well, and any Medium-size or larger creature with a burrow speed digs five times as well. Note that *move earth* isn’t helpful here, since it cannot be used for tunneling and doesn’t affect structures.

Naturally, defenders won’t sit idly by while you undermine the walls of their stronghold. Given the time it takes to sap a wall section, many armies begin some distance away and tunnel underground until they reach the wall, rather than dig from an exposed position at the base of the wall. The stronghold’s defenders sometimes counter by digging their own tunnels outward from the stronghold. When two tunnels meet, the resulting skirmish can determine who wins the larger battle.

**Begin with the End in Mind**

No matter what your plan, figure out what you want to happen in the end before you launch yourself into action. If you want to capture a stronghold mostly intact, that limits your options somewhat, since you can’t raze it to the ground.

The key to taking over a stronghold is in either capturing the leaders and breaking the staff or simply driving everyone out. The quicker this is done, the better. If you give the departing tenants a chance, they’ll take everything they can with them and go out of their way to damage the rest.

Some people take their evictions personally. They may leave booby-traps behind for you or even burn the place to the ground or reduce it to rubble. In their minds, if they can’t have the place, no one will.

The ex-tenants who leave quickly and quietly are potentially even more dangerous. They know every secret of the stronghold like the backs of their hands, and their memories can be long and vengeful. Unless they are killed or imprisoned in the process of losing their home to you, you can be sure that they’ll return, and this time they’ll make use of all the tricks discussed in this section.

If you want to be smart and ruthless about it, you’ll cripple such people—figuratively, at least, if not literally. Doing so to villains may not cause many characters much pause, but it’s not always such a clear decision. Harming a surrendered captive is not the hallmark of those of good alignment, and your Dungeon Master is fully justified in applying the appropriate penalties to those who commit such crimes.

Still, dismantling a villain’s organization and scattering his underlings to the four winds is a good start. It will take him time to recover from such a devastating defeat, to regroup his forces around him. If you’re smart about it, you’ll use that time to transform his stronghold into your own, plugging any holes in its defense that you capitalized upon yourself.

Of course, many villains escape rather than surrender. Whether you wish to pursue them or not is your call. If it’s wise to do so or not depends on the state of your forces once you capture the villain’s stronghold and whether you would be overextending yourself to launch such a manhunt. Many invaders decide that it’s not worth it, at least in the short run.

**One Man’s Villain**

Canny evil foes do their best to confuse the issue by posing as respectable people in their own locales. In fact, while an evil character may be a hated villain in one part of the world, many such people are lauded at heroes in and around their own homes. The reason is simple: Only the worst villains are dumb enough to make a mess in their own backyard. Unless these vile people are all-powerful rulers of the land, they have to live next to these people in their neighborhoods, purchase supplies from them, and generally get along.

That said, your character may not be able to depend on help from the locals to take down villains who take care to do good works close to home. Actually, it can be just the opposite. These same people might actually rally around the villain and come to his aid. They have nothing against him—quite the opposite. They respect and even love him.

Many such villains go to great lengths to hide the true nature of their alignment from those around them. A simple *misdirection* spell is good enough for temporary protection, and a *ring of mind shielding* does an even better job of concealing any ill intent. Simply wearing a *ring of mind shielding* isn’t proof enough of a character’s evil intent, of course. Many characters wear similar rings to protect their thoughts from those who would pry into their minds. Pointing out that a person is wearing such a ring would hardly be enough to convince his compatriots that he’s actually out and out evil.

Once the villain has been dispatched, the character can try to find some kind of evidence to justify what she’s done to him. Even the most careful evildoers often have some proof of their villainy hidden somewhere in their homes. There’s the off chance that this won’t be found, but that may be a risk your character is willing to take. As the saying goes, it’s easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission.

## Commandeering a Stronghold
**COMMANDEERING A STRONGHOLD**

You have finally managed to wrest control of a stronghold, whether by hook or by crook. Perhaps you successfully laid siege to a castle, or maybe you methodically cleared a dungeon of the collection of creatures that once called the place home. Either way, you have likely got one heck of a mess on your hands.

Before you can start hiring your own staff, before you can even think about moving in, you have to clean up. This involves more than having someone drag the bodies out of the guard posts. As the new tenant, you don’t know the place as well as you need to, and the old tenants aren’t likely to show you around the place.

**Welcome Home**

It’s up to you to personally oversee the exploration of every nook and cranny in your new stronghold. You want to turn the place upside down and inside out, shining a light into the place’s darkest corners. You don’t want any surprises sneaking up on you later.

What if, for instance, the previous tenant kept a menagerie of monsters imprisoned in the sublevels of the complex? You either must kill or remove the creatures or hope that the old owner’s defenses prove sufficient to protect you and your friends. Most people aren’t so trusting as to rely on their defeated foe’s devices to keep them safe, but it all depends on the situation at hand.

While you can certainly have some help looking over the place, be sure you’re on the premises if at all possible. If someone makes a fantastic discovery about the place, you should be there when it happens. Otherwise, you can’t ever be sure that the newfound information will ever make its way back to you.

**Disarming a Stronghold**

Many strongholds have all sorts of traps and secret doors riddling the place. Barring ownership of accurate architectural plans that reveal these various secrets, it’s up to you and your friends to find them personally.

In such cases, a rogue is invaluable. They can find and disarm the various traps throughout the place, and they can locate and mark the secret doors too. Many rogues should be watched carefully while they take on this job. If they were to somehow stumble upon a cache of valuables, they might choose to pocket the treasure for themselves, reporting nothing to the one who needs to know about it most: you.

You also must ensure that no enemy forces hide anywhere in the stronghold. It’s not uncommon for trapped foes to hide themselves away in a pinch and then come out only once everyone is either asleep or gone. Failure to find such people quickly can even mean losing the stronghold to them if they decide to attack when your guard is down.

This kind of thing is what you should take as much time to accomplish as possible. Have your searchers Take 20 every time. The proper attention to detail here is vital. If you’re paranoid about it, have several people search each location in the stronghold, just to make sure.

**Containment or Abandonment**

Sometimes, you may come across a hazard that you can’t do anything about. If that’s the case, you have to make a hard decision. Is taking over this place worth the risk of being close to that hazard on a daily basis? Can you ask your staff to take that kind of risk as well?

Sometimes it’s simply a matter of putting up a wall around the hazard and doing the best you can to contain it. Few things can’t simply be sealed away, but if you run up against one of them, then it might be time to find yourself another stronghold.

Mark the place as a dangerous zone so that no one accidentally falls victim to the hazard. Some adventurers are notorious for ignoring such cautions, since you may have done yourself in the course of your adventuring career. If you warn them, then it’s their own fault.

If the hazard is truly frightful, the best method for handling it is often to bring the entire place down on top of it. While someone might eventually dig through the stronghold’s remains, chances are good that they’ll never find the hazard you did your best to protect them against.

If they do, despite your best efforts, that’s their own problem at that point. You hope.

**Rearming a Stronghold**

Once you get the place cleaned out and searched top to bottom, it’s time to rework the stronghold’s security to your own design. This element is essential, especially if you expect a return visit from the former owners.

The most important thing you can do is post your own guards and set up your own magical and mechanical locks, wards, and traps. Until that happens, the place is open to the public, which is the last thing you want. In fact, while you were searching the stronghold, you should have already set up a perimeter defense to protect the area from any new incursions.

At first, stick with quick and easy defense systems: regular guard patrols, the occasional new trench or pit, perhaps a hastily constructed palisade. Assuming you make it through the first few weeks that way, you’ll have plenty of time later to try more complicated methods of protection. In the early days, though, the watchers should be especially vigilant. Until they learn the area and shake out any bugs in the new system, they and the stronghold are terribly vulnerable to attack from quarters both known and unknown.

**Retrofitting a Stronghold**

Eventually, you may decide that you want to remodel part of your new stronghold. After all, you’re not the one who designed it, so it very likely doesn’t perfectly fit your needs.

The first question you have to ask is whether or not the retrofitting is possible. For instance, it’s difficult to knock out a room that sits underneath another room. All you’ll end up with is a huge mess.

If your project falls into the realm of workability, from there it’s largely a matter of degree. If you need only to make some changes to the space to alter its purpose, this is fairly easily done. The cost for doing so should range from 10–50% of the original cost of building such a room, depending on the extent of the changes you would like to make.

Altering a bedroom into a library, for instance, isn’t all that difficult. You move out the old furniture, bring in some tables, chairs, and shelves, and you’re all ready to start filling the place with books. The cost of such a venture might only be about 15% of the standard cost to build a library from scratch.

However, if you want to actually gut the room and start all over again, it’s going to cost you. In this case, the difficulty of having to work around the other existing spaces is mostly offset by the ability to make use of those same spaces and the already built framework of the space. In other words, redoing the entire space costs exactly as much as it would have if you built it from scratch.

You can also add on to a stronghold if you like. For this, use the standard rules for building new spaces.

**Retaining Staff**

Once you have kicked out a stronghold’s previous owner, you should decide what to do with the place’s current staff. While it’s perfectly legitimate to hire on some of these people to work on your own staff, it’s often not the wise thing to do. Sure, they know the place well and have their work patterns already established, but it comes down to a matter of trust.

If these people have a loyal bone in their bodies, they’ll still feel some attachment to any former employer that didn’t treat them like dirt. That can work against you if the ex-tenant ever returns. One of the old employees might decide to take vengeance on you on behalf of his old boss, waiting until you’re at your most vulnerable before he makes his move.

On the other hand, if the employees were generally abused by their hated ex-boss, they might be ready and willing to step up to help out a new, kinder employer. In fact, they might even feel some gratitude toward the character who rescued them from the horrible life they lived. This kind of loyalty can’t be bought with any kind of coin.

Of course, if an employee is willing to betray one employer so readily, who’s to say which side he’ll take if the chips fall again? It’s your call as to who you want to hire or let go. Only you know best the situation and the people involved. This can be shaky ground, so tread carefully.

The best benefit of retaining some of the old staff—even if only one valuable, or at least watchful, employee—is that he can let you in on all the place’s secrets. It’s a lot easier to find and disarm traps or to locate secret doors and passageways if you have someone willing to show you where they are.

Additionally, the old employees can help you out with handling your new neighbors. If the locals liked the former tenant of your stronghold, you can be in for a long, bad time. If you can’t get anyone to sell food to you, for instance, you’re not going to have a wonderful stay in your new place.

However, a retained employee can help smooth over those ruffled feathers for you. His is hopefully a trusted face, and he can best explain to everyone in the area exactly what happened in the area and why working for you is honestly the best thing that ever happened to him. Some people might wonder if the man is under the influence of some kind of spell, but once that possibility has been debunked, the employee’s favorable words about you can be as good as gold.

## Destroying a Stronghold
**DESTROYING A STRONGHOLD**

Sometimes you’re going to find that it’s better to destroy a stronghold than to convert it into something you can use yourself. If the whole place has been imbued with a series of permanent *desecrate* spells, it’s likely that it’s not fit for heroic inhabitation. Perhaps the joint is filthy beyond your desire or ability to clean. Maybe you took down too much of the place while you were invading it.

Anyway, now it’s time to finish what you started.

**Neutralizing It**

The first thing to worry about with many strongholds is neutralizing the magic contained therein. To do this, you’ll need to find a high-level spellcaster with access to the *dispel magic* spell.

Most spells used in the construction of a stronghold include *permanency* to keep the effects in constant use, put there by a spellcaster of at least 9th level (the minimum needed to be able to cast *permanency*). The spell upon which the *permanency* is cast may have an even higher level requirement.

In general, you should assume that the wizard who created the permanent magical effect was of the minimum level to cast each of the spells involved. This factor is important because it sets the DC for your spellcaster’s *dispel magic* spell. Remember, the higher the level of your spellcaster, the better her chance of getting her *dispel magic* spell to work.

Of course, the higher your caster’s spell level, the more it’s going to cost you as well—unless you cast the spells yourself. Since each casting of *dispel magic* only affects one spell, you may end up casting *dispel magic* several times to eliminate the previous tenants’ magical effects. The cost to do this can add up quickly.

Remember, though, that *dispel magic* only works temporarily (1d4 rounds) against actual magic items, whether they’re portable or an embedded portion of the stronghold. This interval is usually not long enough for most invaders’ purposes. If you want to destroy the effect, you want it gone forever.

**Looting**

Once you force your way into a stronghold, you earn the spoils of war. Not all of a stronghold’s value is its walls, doors, and towers. The furnishings, art, and other contents also have value, and they can be carted away.

In general, you can recoup about 5% of the cost of each stronghold space as loot. Fancy stronghold components return 30% of their value to looters, and luxury components return 40%, because more of their cost comes from the deluxe furnishings rather than architectural elements.

Most extras aren’t able to be stolen—it’s hard to move a freestanding wall from place to place, and there’s not much of a secondary market in doors. Bulky items such as tapestries listed in the wondrous architecture section can be looted by attacking armies.

**Bringing It Down**

The fact is that nothing works if it’s broken into little pieces, magical or not. If you want to eradicate a stronghold—to make sure that no one can ever use it again—you have to raze it to the ground.

A lot of ways exist to do this. The cheap and slow way is to hire a destruction team and send them in to do the job. For game purposes, you can usually assume that the team does the job in exchange for the rights to anything they can salvage out of the structure.

Of course, if the entire place is somehow cursed, this isn’t much of an incentive. The same goes if getting to or from the place or being in it is extremely hazardous. At some point, the destruction team is going to figure that no amount of salvage is worth the risk, and no one is going to step up to replace it.

All sorts of ways exist to destroy a place magically: *lightning bolt, fireball, disintegrate,* and so on. A number of different magic items can come in handy as well, especially fully charged wands, which can allow you to fire off several spells in a row and make quick work of the job.

Bringing down a massive stronghold takes time. Sure, it’s a lot easier to destroy than build, but if you want to do a thorough job, you’re going to be at it a while.

It’s rarely necessary to level a place entirely. Instead, savvy wrecking teams concentrate on removing floors and supporting walls, leaving the shell of the stronghold intact. Those outer walls are usually made of the most durable kinds of stuff, and bringing them down is often more effort than it’s worth.

Most of the time, it’s safest to work at wrecking a place from the outside in. After all, you don’t want any of that massive debris falling on your character or the other workers. Less cautious characters can speed things along a bit with a bit of creative thinking and a bit more risk.

For instance, a mage could take a *wand of lightning* into the basement of a stronghold and begin blasting away at the various support beams holding the thing up. Once the ceiling started coming down on him, he could then *teleport* away. Destruction of two vital points—like the corners—in a floor or ceiling is enough to cause the whole thing to fall. A *delayed blast fireball* is great for destruction as well. Just make sure that you have an unobstructed route out of the place before casting the spell. Those 5 rounds can tick by fast.

If the stronghold is made mostly of wood or some other flammable material, those parts of the place can be destroyed in a matter of hours by simply setting fire to them. More durable kinds of material take a lot longer.

If you’re not in a hurry, you can assume that you or your team manages to dismantle the place in good time. In only one-fourth as long as it took to build the place, it can be entirely destroyed, its valuable parts carted away to be sold or used elsewhere. In one-tenth of the building time, the place can be rendered unusable, a shell of its former self.

**Sealing It Away**

Sometimes it’s not possible to destroy a stronghold. Perhaps the place is built out of too-stern stuff, or maybe it still contains magic, traps, or monsters that are beyond the character’s ability to take care of permanently. Possibly, there’s not enough time. In any of these cases, the right thing to do is seal the place up as best you can, post a lot of warnings around the area, and leave the region to its own devices.

Fantasy literature is filled with all sorts of strongholds that were occupied by some evil force or another that was beaten back into a portion of the place and then sealed in. Protecting such a place might be a constant source of adventure.

Then again, such seals can be broken, and then it’s usually up to you and your compatriots to come back and finish the job they started. You may have hoped that the threat you buried was long gone and forgotten, but now there’s little left to do but give your best shot at putting it to rest on a more permanent basis. 

The best kinds of seals are the ones that use the natural environment to your advantage. If the main doorway into the stronghold is in the face of a mountain, a massive avalanche should make it impossible for just about any nonmagical creature to get in and out of the place again.

To seal off a place, though, you can’t beat magic. At the very least, set up an *arcane lock* spell on each and every entrance into the place. The fewer the number of exits you have to deal with, the better.

*Magic mouths* do a fine job of frightening off potential trespassers, although they’re only good for a single warning each unless you use *permanency* on them. You can cover entries with a permanent *wall of fire* or *wall of force* or permanent *symbols* of any kind. *Explosive runes* and *glyphs of warding* are wonderful too, although they’re only one-use tricks.

The best magic security system is a permanent *guards and wards* spell on the stronghold. To do this, you effectively have to create a massive, immobile magic item (see Chapter 2): not a task to be undertaken lightly. Ideally, you would also have an *imprisonment* spell cast on any powerful creature trapped in the stronghold—something you couldn’t otherwise kill, of course. Then the stronghold serves as a means of keeping other people from coming to the creature’s aid, intentionally or not.

Once you have done your best to seal the place up, your next job is to prevent other people from undoing what you have done. Two schools of thought exist here.

The first says that you should warn everyone far and wide about the dangers involved in even getting near the place. That way, you reduce the chances of someone stumbling upon the stronghold and poking around it without knowing what they’re getting into.

The second line of reasoning is that you should keep the existence of the place as secret as possible. This way, you prevent those who might be interested in such a place from even finding out about it. Unless the stronghold was hidden or remote in the first place, though, this can be pretty difficult to pull off.

Either way, if you’re concerned about the place’s security, set up multiply redundant lines of defense around the stronghold, just as you would if you were trying to keep things out.
