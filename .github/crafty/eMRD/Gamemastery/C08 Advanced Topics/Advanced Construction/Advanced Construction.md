## Introduction
**Introduction**

Whether a high-towered castle, deep dungeon, or wooden citadel hidden among the trees, the stronghold plays an important part in any D&D campaign. Often the sites the characters visit—palaces on floating clouds, dwarven fortresses carved into sheer cliffs, and haunted wizard towers—remain as memorable as the foes the characters face when they get there. *Stronghold Builders’ Guidebook* gives you a system to create memorable locations for the adventures you create. With this book, you can build the castle your character has always dreamed of. You have the tools to create a nigh-impenetrable dragon’s lair for the climax of your next adventure. You have dozens of new room features to sprinkle throughout any dungeon

## What's Inside
**What’s Inside**

*Stronghold Builder’s Guidebook* contains information for both players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). Players now have a new way to spend their characters’ hard-earned gold, while DMs have detailed rules for creating their next dungeon, castle, or other adventure site.

**Building a Stronghold (Chapter 1):** This chapter sets the foundation for strongholds, giving player and DM alike a step-by-step process for designing a stronghold, filling it with gear and people, and figuring out how much it all costs. A character with the right resources can create anything from a dungeon deep in the Underdark to a castle among the clouds.

**Stronghold Components (Chapter 2):** Find all the building blocks of your stronghold here, from banquet halls to catapults to perpetual hurricanes surrounding your fortress.

**Strongholds in the Campaign (Chapter 3):** This chapter includes tips for running a stronghold-based campaign and dozens of ways to use *Stronghold Builder’s Guidebook* in the adventures you’re already running. It also gives a rundown on how to attack and defend a stronghold.

**Example Strongholds (Chapter 4):** From a simple keep to a floating fortress, this final chapter provides room-by-room descriptions and maps for five detailed strongholds you can use in your own campaign.

## How to Use This Book
**How to Use This Book**

This book aims to give players the rules to construct their own headquarters, places where they can rest and train between adventures or take refuge when pursued by powerful foes. Characters with enough gold and magic at their disposal can construct massive fortresses limited only by their imagination.

Noble patrons in particular are more likely to reward adventurers with a plot of land or hundreds of workers if they have performed a heroic deed for the realm. After all, the king finds it easier to assign the characters a hundred acres on the kingdom’s borders than to give them treasure-chests full of gold.

The DM could build an entire campaign around the characters’ refurbishment of a old stronghold in an out-of-the-way place. The adventurers must travel there, evict whatever monsters are using the stronghold as a lair, and discover its secrets as they explore it. Eventually, they must deal with the stronghold’s legal owners or whatever political authority rules the region. As they repair and refurbish the stronghold, they have to keep the workers and the building safe from predators and political rivals. Once that’s done, there are always improvements to be made and adventures in the surrounding countryside under the stronghold’s protection.

Nonplayer characters (NPCs) use strongholds, too. The *Stronghold Builder’s Guidebook* gives DMs a broad menu of options for the lairs, temples, dungeons, and other strongholds that adventurers often have to infiltrate or assault. Rather than yet another dungeon, the characters may face an elven stronghold made of living wood or a floating castle at the center of a hurricane.
