# C01 Building a Stronghold
## Overview
**Building a Stronghold**

Every stronghold begins with a simple idea. Sometimes a stronghold fills a specific need in the fantasy world of D&D, such as a cliff-top castle that provides protection for an important trade route. Other times the stronghold functions as an adventure location, such as a dungeon of bone that serves as a vault for an important artifact. Some characters will want to build strongholds to serve as a mark of status and a safe place to recover between adventures.

Coming up with the right concept for your stronghold is Step 0 of the building process. You need not nail down all the details right away, but you should know in general terms what you want before you start making plans and purchases. As in real life, remember to keep one eye on how much money you’re spending. If you don’t have enough gold for the stronghold of your dreams, you may have to cut back on your plans or delay building until you raise more money. Alternatively, you might find a partner such as a friendly wizard to cast spells on your behalf or a noble patron to help pay for your keep if you agree to watch over her lands.

**Magic Items and Vehicles as Strongholds**

The advanced construction rules were originally designed to create structures whether standard buildings or dungeons. However they are easily expanded to work with magic items such as the *[[Instant Fortress|instant fortress]]* or vehicles such as ships, wagons, or more fantasic vehicles. Use the *[[Instant Fortress|instant fortress]]* as an existing structure and modify it as desired.

For vehicles such as ships and wagons, take the existing cost of the vehicle (which covers exterior/interior walls already) and then modify as desired.

## Step 1: Select a Site
**Step 1: Select a Site**

Your stronghold might be a coral castle hundreds of feet underwater, or a fortress high atop a mountain in the Barrier Peaks. It could stand alone in the desert guarding the only water for hundreds of miles, or it could be a nondescript noble villa in the heart of a bustling metropolis. Before you raise the first wall of your stronghold, you need to know about the ground where you’ll place your future home.

Selecting a site for your stronghold involves three steps: Choosing a terrain type, deciding the distance between your stronghold and its supporting settlement, and identifying any unusual features nearby. Your choices modify the final cost of your stronghold, so keep track of the price modifiers at each stage.

**Climate/Terrain Type**

First, decide on the dominant climate and terrain type that surrounds your stronghold, using the eleven types listed on Table 1–1. Choose one climate type (cold, temperate, or warm) and one terrain type (aquatic, desert, plains, forest, hill, mountains, marsh, or underground); climate/terrain types are described in Chapter 6 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*. If you choose underground terrain, don’t choose a climate type. Underground strongholds are usually dungeons, but occasionally a traditional palace will be built in a particularly large Underdark cavern.

The price modifiers in Table 1–1 reflect the relative ease of using the terrain as a foundation, how productive workers are in that environment, and how available construction materials and finished goods such as furnishings are. In some cases, a particular terrain type might be good for some strongholds but not others. Mountains, for example, can be expensive places to build a traditional castle, but the availability of natural caverns makes them efficient sites for dungeon strongholds.

Strongholds built in particularly unusual places such as the swirling chaos of Limbo or the hazy mists of the [[Astral Plane]] use the exotic entry on the table below. The high price modifier reflects the special precautions required to keep workers productive and the under-construction stronghold safe in such strange environments.

If you’re constructing a mobile stronghold (one that walks, flies, or otherwise moves), choose mobile terrain on Table 1–1 and skip to Step 2 below. The price break reflects your ability to move your under-construction stronghold from place to place. Rather than bring raw materials to your construction site, you can bring your site to the source of the raw materials.

Your stronghold need not have the native terrain as its actual foundation—you’re defining the surrounding landscape. For example, a stronghold that covers a small island would be in aquatic terrain even though it’s not underwater. A castle constructed in a forest clearing would be in forest terrain, and so would the elven treetop stronghold made from the forest itself.

**Table 1–1: Climate/Terrain Modifiers to Stronghold Price**


| **Climate/** | **Price** |  |
|---|---|---|
| **Terrain Type** | **Modifier** | **Special** |
| Cold | +5% | –50% to cost of ice walls |
| Temperate | +0% |  |
| Warm | –5% |  |
| Aquatic | +15% |  |
| Desert | +10% |  |
| Forest | +0% | –10% to cost of wood walls |
| Hill | –5% |  |
| Marsh | +10% |  |
| Mountains | +0% | –5% to cost of hewn stone walls |
| Plains | –5% |  |
| Underground | +10% | Hewn stone walls are free |
| Exotic | +15% |  |
| Mobile | –5% |  |

**Primary Settlement**

Some strongholds guard lonely mountain passes many days’ travel from the nearest city. Other strongholds have settlements grow up around them, the communities thriving under the protection the stronghold provides.

Regardless of location, your stronghold must have a settlement it relies on for any goods it can’t make itself—everything from necessities such as food to luxuries such as platinum candlestick holders. Other smaller or larger settlements may be near your stronghold, but the inhabitants of your stronghold travel to this primary settlement to hire new staff members and purchase needed supplies.

For your stronghold, identify which settlement serves as its primary link to civilization. Your decision affects the price of your stronghold in two ways: availability of materials and labor, and price of real estate. If you build your stronghold far away from sources of labor and materials, your stronghold costs more. Conversely, real estate tends to be more expensive near larger settlements. Even though labor and materials are readily available, it’s expensive to build a new castle inside the metropolis of Greyhawk because of high land prices and limited availability. You must balance these two factors when selecting your stronghold site.

The presence (or absence) of thorps, hamlets, and villages doesn’t change the price of your stronghold.

**Table 1–2: Primary Settlement Modifiers to Stronghold Price**


| **Size of Primary** | **Distance to** | **Cost** |
|---|---|---|
| **Settlement (gp limit)** | **Stronghold** | **Modifier** |
| Small town (800 gp) | Less than 1 mile | +0% |
| | 1–16 miles | +2% |
| | 17–48 miles | +4% |
| | 49–112 miles | +7% |
| | 113 miles or more | +10% |
| Large town (3,000 gp) | Less than 1 mile | +2% |
| | 1–16 miles | +0% |
| | 17–48 miles | +2% |
| | 49–112 miles | +4% |
| | 113 miles or more | +7% |
| Small city (15,000 gp) | Less than 1 mile | +3% |
| | 1–16 miles | +1% |
| | 17–48 miles | –2% |
| | 49–112 miles | +1% |
| | 113 miles or more | +6% |
| Large city (40,000 gp) | Less than 1 mile | +6% |
| | 1–16 miles | +3% |
| | 17–48 miles | +1% |
| | 49–112 miles | –1% |
| | 113 miles or more | +5% |
| Metropolis (100,000 gp) | Less than 1 mile | +10% |
| | 1–16 miles | +7% |
| | 17–48 miles | +5% |
| | 49–112 miles | +0% |
| | 113 miles or more | +4% |

**The Importance of Primary Settlements**

Since your primary settlement serves as the place where you purchase and requisition everything you need for your stronghold, you have to respect its limits. For example, you can’t buy [[Adamantine|adamantine]] walls in a small town. They can’t afford to make them, much less sell them to you. Alongside each settlement size, the table notes the gold piece (gp) limit for purchasing components, walls, and wondrous architecture. Refer to Generating Towns in Chapter 4 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* to review the limits of communities.

As a result, most castle builders eventually decide to rely on a large city or metropolis. Builders of especially large, lavish, or expensive strongholds don’t have any choice, but builders of smaller castles may be able to find a price break by selecting a site that allows them to take advantage of less populated communities.

**Nearby Features**

Nearby unusual features also modify your stronghold’s cost. A stronghold atop a mesa is hard to assault and thus more valuable, while one near an evil forest might be less valuable because it’s constantly beset by monster attacks from the woods.

With your DM’s approval, you can build your stronghold near benign features such as a consecrated shrine or malign features such as a monster lair nearby. Choose as many as you like from Table 1–3.

For terrain features, you can choose the same feature more than once to cover more than one direction. If you pay an extra 8%, for example, you can have a river on both the north and east sides of your stronghold. It’s also possible to mix good and bad terrain features in this way. The land to the west of your stronghold could slope away (impeding normal movement) but be heavily wooded (making attacking easier), resulting in no net modifier to your stronghold’s cost.

Income sources can be purchased multiple times as well. This can represent multiple income sources, or an income source that’s more lucrative.

**Table 1–3: Nearby Feature Modifiers to Stronghold Price**


-tx-
| **Characteristic** | **Modifier** |
|---|---|
| Natural feature that impedes normal movement | +2% |
| Natural feature that prohibits normal movement | +4% |
| Natural feature that makes attacking easier | –2% |
| Site under legal dispute | –5% |
| Site in lawless area | –10% |
| Site controls income source | +10% |
| Nearby potential income source | +5% |
| Site hidden from long-range observation | +5% |
| Monster lair nearby | special\* |
| \*See text below. ||

**Natural Features:** Features that impede normal movement include hills, tidal flats, and rough terrain that would slow an attacking army. The cost assumes you have built a road for normal traffic in and out of your stronghold. The extent of natural features is left deliberately vague, but the terrain types and obstructions listed in Chapter 9 of the *Player’s Handbook* are a good starting point.

Natural features that prohibit normal movement are more significant barriers such as cliffs, rivers, and more exotic obstacles such as lava plains. Any kind of feature that requires a skill such as [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] or [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] to move through falls into this category. The shape and extent of the natural features depends on the specific site.

Some features actually make a stronghold easier to attack, such as high ground that overlooks a castle or a forest that provides cover for attackers.

**Legal Status of Site:** If your site is under legal dispute, it means that someone else has a claim on your stronghold or the land it sits on. Perhaps a noble family technically owns the land, but no members of the family have been seen for a decade. Maybe another nation believes that any stronghold near their border belongs to them. Exactly who disputes the site’s status and how they’ll enforce their claim is up to the DM.

Sites in lawless areas face a different problem: There’s no other authority in the land. If the stronghold runs into trouble, there’s no greater power to appeal to, and the stronghold’s residents are on their own. Ownership of the stronghold lasts until it’s taken away by force.

**Income Sources:** The exact nature of income sources varies, but they all work the same way. Each income source provides 1% of the stronghold’s final price annually as pure profit—above and beyond labor costs and other expenses. You must supply living quarters for the workers needed (20 per income source) if you want them protected behind the walls of your stronghold.

Potential income sources require some work before they start generating income. You may accomplish this by spending an additional 5% of the stronghold’s final cost at some point (essentially purchasing a controlled income source in two installments). This expenditure covers the income source’s start-up costs. Alternatively, you can complete an adventure such as clearing the gem mines of undead or completing a diplomatic mission to earn timber-harvesting rights from nearby centaurs.

Some ideas for income sources include crops harvested nearby, ranching and horse-breeding, a toll road, gem or precious metal mines, a timber operation, or a travelers’ inn.

**Site Hidden from Observation:** Forest strongholds and other camouflaged structures pay this cost modifier. Most strongholds can be seen from miles away, but hidden strongholds follow the rules for spotting distance as if they were stationary, Colossal creatures (see Table 3–1 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide* for spotting distances). If you use magic to conceal your stronghold, you don’t pay this surcharge, because you’re paying for the magic instead.

**Monster Lair Nearby:** The exact nature of the monsters and the location of the lair are up to the DM. Clearing out the lair should be the basis for an adventure, not just a single battle. Depending what lives there, it may be possible to handle the problem diplomatically. To earn the price break, the nearby monsters must at least initially be hostile. To determine the price break, find the encounter in the lair with the highest EL, and subtract 3. Then add 1 for every additional encounter (up to three) within 1 EL of this encounter. The final price break shouldn’t be greater than the highest EL in the lair unless particularly unusual circumstances dictate (DM’s option).

**Adding It All Up:** Add the modifiers from your climate/terrain type, primary settlement, and nearby features. You’ll apply the sum of these modifiers to your stronghold’s construction cost to arrive at a final price in step 4.

### Behind the Curtain: Nearby Features
**Behind the Curtain: Nearby Features in the Campaign**

If characters seeking a price break put their strongholds in the middle of a valley beyond the frontier surrounded by monster-infested hills on all sides, let them. They have given you spice for countless adventures since they protect what’s rightfully theirs and pacify the surrounding countryside. The stronghold they create makes your job as DM easier. You can create an exciting site-based adventure—and your players have done the mapping for you.

It is possible to go too far. Players will quickly tire of every adventure being interrupted by yet another threat to their stronghold. Worse, they’ll be reluctant to leave their stronghold for fear it’ll be captured while they’re away. Threats to a PC’s strongholds are like strong spice—they add a lot of flavor, but they’re best used sparingly.

### Site Example: Brightstone Keep
**Site Example: Brightstone Keep**

Karlerren, a 12th-level wizard, wants a small keep to act as a home base for her fellow adventurers. The characters recently cleared out a diamond mine infested with undead slaves, and the king has charged them with protecting the mine.

Brightstone Keep will be built up in the mountains (which earns Karlerren a 5% discount on hewn stone walls). It’s sixty miles from the nearest small city, Trueoak, which makes the keep 1% more expensive.

The site is in a lawless area,  at least until the characters establish law themselves, which offers a –10% discount. The diamond mine is an income source (+10%), but some high cliffs overlook the keep site on one side. That makes attacking easier (–2%). 

Adding it all up, Brightstone Keep gets a net 1% discount, and it earns an additional 5% discount on any hewn stone walls. Karlerren notes the wall discount for later, and moves on to step 2.

## Step 2: Choose a Size
**Step 2: Choose a Size**

The size of your fortress is measured in “stronghold spaces” (ss). A stronghold space isn’t rigidly defined in terms of square footage, but most stronghold spaces take up a 20-foot-by-20-foot-by-10-foot space; a simple one-room cottage takes up one stronghold space. Most of the stronghold components you’ll select in Step 3 take up one stronghold space each.

Each of the following things fit in a single stronghold space:

- An opulent bedroom suite, two normal bedrooms, quarters for six servants, or barracks for ten soldiers.
- Kitchen space for fifteen residents.
- An alchemical laboratory, wizard’s workshop, or nice office.
- A small smithy or a stable for six horses.

A complete of list of stronghold components can be found in Chapter 2. At this point, you only need to give some thought to how many stronghold spaces your finished stronghold will have.

The size of your stronghold determines how many of your walls are interior walls—important if you’re trying to save money by building a stronghold with tough exterior walls and weaker interior walls, for example. Many of the magical extras you’ll buy for your stronghold, from intruder alarms to force shields, have prices that depend on how many spaces they cover.

**Size Estimates**

As noted, a simple cottage takes up 1 stronghold space. Most strongholds are much larger, of course. Use the following table to estimate the size of the stronghold you’re building.

**Table 1–4: Stronghold Sizes**


-tx-
| **Stronghold Type** | **Size in Stronghold Spaces** |
|---|---|
| Cottage | 1 |
| Simple house | 4 |
| Grand house | 7 |
| Mansion | 15 |
| Border tower | 4 |
| Keep | 12 |
| Castle | 20 |
| Huge castle | 80 |
| Small dungeon\* | 30–60 |
| Medium dungeon\*\* | 60–120 |
| Large dungeon† | 120 and up |
| \*Such as the sample dungeon provided in Chapter 4 of the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*. ||
| \*\*Such as the dungeon found in *The Sunless Citadel*. ||
| †Such as the Crater Ridge Mines found in *Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil*. ||

### Size Example: Brightstone Keep
**Size Example: Brightstone Keep**

Karlerren wants Brightstone Keep to be fairly large, but his funds are somewhat constrained. He figures everything he wants will fit into fifteen to twenty stronghold spaces. He jots down eighteen stronghold spaces now, realizing that he can change his mind later if he needs to.

## Step 3: Purchase Components and Walls
**Step 3: Purchase Components and Walls**

Now decide which components you want your stronghold to have from the list in Chapter 2, and pick the materials for your interior and exterior walls.

In general, you can choose whatever components you can afford, but some of them have prerequisites. For example, you can’t have a luxury dining hall unless you also have a luxury kitchen. Many of the components take up 1 stronghold space, but others occupies more or less.

Some components come in normal, fancy, and luxury varieties. All three kinds are functionally identical, but fancy components have nicer furnishings, art, and architectural features. Luxury components have dazzling art, masterwork furniture, and stellar craftsmanship throughout.

At any point in Step 3, you can choose some of Chapter 2’s clusters: groups of components and extras that work well together. There’s no difference in price, so choosing clusters simply saves you time. You can always purchase components and extras individually if you like.

**A Stronghold Builder’s Glossary**

A few terms appear frequently in this document. Here are some basic definitions.

**Augmentations:** Add-ons to walls, augmentations are extras that make a wall better in some way, but they can’t support a building by themselves.

**Clusters:** Prefabricated groups of components and extras, clusters simply make stronghold building easier.

**Components:** These are the basic building blocks of your stronghold. Each component takes up one or more stronghold spaces.

**Extras:** These are optional features you can add to components (or even other extras). They never take up stronghold spaces themselves, although the components they’re attached to do take up space.

**Staff:** The soldiers who guard your stronghold and the butlers who fetch your slippers must be paid. Unlike extras and components, which are paid for once, staff costs are paid every month.

**Stronghold Space:** An abstract measure of volume within a building. While stronghold spaces don’t have a fixed size, an average stronghold space is equivalent to a 20-foot-by-20-foot room with a 10-foot-hugh ceiling.

**Wall:** Walls come in three flavors: interior, exterior, and freestanding.

**Wondrous Architecture:** Essentially a stationary magic item. Wondrous architecture often covers an entire stronghold space.

Once you have chosen all your components, select what kind of interior and exterior walls you want. Chapter 2 lists the options and defines how many interior and exterior walls you have based on the size of your stronghold. You don’t have to choose the same material for your interior and exterior walls. It’s common, for example, to build castles with masonry exterior walls and wooden interior walls. 

If you want, you can split up your wall costs. For example, you could create a stronghold that has a wooden second floor atop a sturdy masonry main level by giving 50% of the spaces wooden exterior walls and 50% of the spaces masonry exterior walls. You can also make your walls better by layering them—placing a layer of iron over a foundation of stone—or purchasing augmentations such as spiked walls, camouflaged walls, or walls that repair themselves automatically.

**Do-It-Yourself Spellcasting**

The construction prices assume that when it’s cost-effective to do so, you’re hiring spellcasters to cast *[[Wall of Stone (Spell)|wall of stone]]*, *[[Move Earth (Spell)|move earth]],* and other spells useful for stronghold construction. If you can cast those spells yourself or somehow entice a spellcaster to do so for free, you can earn a discount, as shown on Table 1–5: Construction Discounts from Spellcasting. Note that the discounts shown are cumulative. For instance, you could use *[[Move Earth (Spell)|move earth]]* to prepare the site (–3% per space on ground floor), *[[Wood Shape (Spell)|wood shape]]* in all spaces with wood walls (–5% per space) and *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]* (–5%, 20%, or 50% per space) for a total discount of 13%, 28%, or 58% on all wood-walled stronghold spaces on your ground floor.

### Component Example: Brightstone Keep
**Component Example: Brightstone Keep**

Karlerren wants the following components for Brightstone Keep: a basic bedroom suite for himself (800 gp), four bedrooms for his compatriots (two basic bedroom components at 700 gp each), a basic bath (400 gp), a basic kitchen (2,000 gp), a dining hall (2,000 gp), barracks for 30 soldiers (three barracks components at 400 gp each), three guard posts (300 gp each), a basic library (500 gp), a basic magic laboratory (500 gp), an armory (500 gp), a basic smithy (500 gp), some basic storage (250 gp), a barbican (1,000 gp), and servants’ quarters (400 gp).

These components cost 12,350 gp and take up seventeen stronghold spaces.

### Wall Example: Brightstone Keep
**Wall Example: Brightstone Keep**

Karlerren knows that hewn walls will be cheaper because of Brightstone Keep’s mountain location, where stone is plentiful. She need not craft the interior walls of hewn stone.

According to the wall section of Chapter 2, a 17-space stronghold has 40% interior walls and 60% exterior walls. Karlerren chooses wooden interior walls (no extra cost) and hewn stone exterior walls. Karlerren receives a 5% discount because Brightstone Keep is in mountainous terrain, and 50% discount because he can cast *[[Wall of Stone (Spell)|wall of stone]]*. (Although 12 castings per stronghold space means he must cast the spell 130 times, which ties up all his 5th-level spell slots for 33 days.)

Hewn stone walls have a base price of 6,000 gp per stronghold space, or 2,700 gp after the 55% discount, multiplied by 17 for the size of the stronghold for 45,900 gp. Since Karlerren only wants exterior walls of hewn stone, she pays only 60% of that: 27,540 gp.

## Step 4: Purchase Extras and Wondrous Architecture
**Step 4: Purchase Extras and Wondrous Architecture**

Add whatever extras and wondrous architecture you like, and your stronghold is almost done. Extras range from magic items to traps to siege weapons to *portals*—pretty much anything that isn’t essential to all fortresses.

The wide variety of wondrous architecture (basically stationary wondrous items) available represents both a huge opportunity to make your stronghold unique and an enormous potential drain on resources. You can build magical chambers, altars, statues, and everything else you might desire. You can build your own wondrous architecture yourself to save money, of course, as you would any magic item.

After you have added any extras and wondrous architecture you want, you’re ready to figure out how much everything costs.

### Extras Example: Brightstone Keep
**Extras Example: Brightstone Keep**

Thinking of defense, Karlerren purchases three ballistas (500 gp each) with 200 ballista bolts for each (200 gp each). He decides to put his three guard towers 20 feet up in towers (400 gp each). He can fill the lower stories of those towers with other components at no extra cost, because the first two stories don’t have a surcharge. In addition to the ballista, each guard tower will have four arrow slits (30 gp per extra arrow slit; the first one is free).

Karlerren decides that Brightstone Keep will have three guard towers and three other buildings where the rest of the components are. Thinking about the layout, Karlerren decides to arrange the structures in a pentagon, and she connects them with freestanding walls to create a large protected area in the middle. Remembering her discount for hewn stone, she builds 10-foot-high hewn stone walls connecting the five structures (a total of about 380 linear feet of freestanding wall). Each 10-footby-10-foot section has a base cost of 100 gp, so the walls cost a total of 3,800 gp, or 1,710 gp with Karlerren’s discount. Karlerren adds crenellations and a walkway so her troops can fight from the top of the wall (no extra cost).

For the library, Karlerren purchases books on Arcana (1,500 gp), History (800 gp), and Local Affairs (1,500 gp).

Karlerren chooses to upgrade all her doors to good wooden doors (20 gp each, and there are two in each stronghold space, so that’s 680 gp). He wants an iron portcullis (750 gp) for the main entrance. Ever security-conscious, he’ll put average locks on half the doors (680 gp). 

Karlerren purchases the archer equipment cluster for half his troops (88 gp each, 1320 gp for 15) and the guard equipment cluster for the other half (167 gp, 2505 gp for 15).

Karlerren installs a shuttered *everburning torch* in each component, and an extra one in the two bedroom components (because each component has two bedrooms). He can make them himself for 45 gp and 4 XP each, or a total of 765 gp and 68 XP. His bedroom suite gets a *guardian statue*, which he builds himself for 500 gp and 40 XP. The storage area gets a 5th-level *summoning stone* (6,750 gp and 540 XP). Worried about security in his magic laboratory, he uses *binding* to chain a shadow mastiff there who’ll attack anyone who doesn’t supply the password (7,400 gp).

The extras for Brightstone keep add 33,310 gp to the stronghold’s cost.

## Step 5: Determine Final Price
**Step 5: Determine Final Price**

Once you select all your components and extras, add up their costs. You’re almost done designing your stronghold, but three factors may change your final stronghold price.

**Site Modifiers**

Back in step 1, you made choices about the site for your stronghold. Add together all the price modifiers from those choices, and apply the result to your total cost.

**Build Time**

The price you have determined so far assumes the most cost-effective construction schedule. You have hired enough workers to get the job done reasonably quickly but as inexpensively as possible. You can’t save money by having your builders work more slowly. If you’re in a hurry to get your stronghold built, you can pay extra to shorten the construction time.

Building a stronghold takes one week per 10,000 gp of total price thus far. For every 10% extra you spend, it takes 10% less time to build, up to a maximum of a 70% “rush charge” to get the castle built in 30% of the usual time.

The DM may rule that some strongholds shouldn’t use this rule. For instance, if your stronghold price includes a large percentage of wondrous architecture, you might choose to construct such items separately (using the rules for building magic items in the *DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide*). In that case, you and the DM should work together to determine what parts of the stronghold contribute toward this build time.

**Free and Unusual Labor**

Depending on your ongoing campaign, the characters might have access to free or reduced-rate labor. Maybe a grateful queen assigns laborers to your effort, or your home village starts constructing a manor house in your honor.

You and the DM must work together to decide what discount you receive for free labor on a case-by-case basis. As a guideline, assume that labor costs represent roughly 30% of your stronghold cost thus far. If the queen provides you with half your workers, that represents a 15% discount (half of 30%).

What if your workers are zombies that never grow tired or sleep? Perhaps they’re incredibly strong stone giants or master dwarven stonemasons. In most cases, unusual laborers don’t affect the cost of stronghold, because particularly efficient workers charge correspondingly more for their services. Fifty dwarven stonemasons might do the work of a hundred human masons, but they know they’re better and they’ll demand higher wages as a result. Zombies may be cheap and efficient, but they require constant supervision from expensive evil clerics. If you have unusually efficient workers construct your stronghold, use the build time rules above to get the job done faster. For example, dwarven stonemasons can build your stronghold in half the time, but they’ll charge 50% more.

Unusually efficient workers can save you money if you somehow convince them to work for free, however. Perhaps you have charmed some ettins into “helping” move massive stones around. Maybe the dwarven lord owes you a favor after your last adventure, and he’s willing to assign some architects and artisans. Treat this as any other kind of free labor.

**Staff Costs**

Now is a good time to figure out how much your staff will cost you on a monthly basis. Total up the staff required by your various components and consult the Staff section in Chapter 2.

### Feat: Landlord
**Landlord \[Special]**

By knowing the right nobles, making contacts with masons and artisans, or performing great deeds for a liege-lord, you have resources that help you build and expand your stronghold.

**Prerequisites:** The character must be at least 9th level.

**Benefits:** This feat gives you a small allowance that you can use to build or expand a stronghold. It’s not cash, so it only applies to stronghold purchases. (You can’t cash it out and spend it on something else.)

In addition, the feat provides matching funds for expenditures made from your own purse of gold. For example, if you spend 50,000 gp of your own (beyond the allowance) to purchase stronghold components, walls, or wondrous architecture, the feat provides a bonus allowance of the same amount.

The exact nature of the resources depends on your campaign; you and your DM should decide on this beforehand. If you have performed missions successfully for a noble, rich merchant, or other power group, perhaps they have willed the land to you. If you’re a cleric, maybe the church sends supplicants to provide free labor. Regardless of your class or social standing, you might inherit a keep from a long-lost relative.

See Table 1–6: Landlord Funds for how much you can spend. When you first select the Landlord feat, you receive the amount listed under Stronghold Allowance. At each successive level, you get an additional allowance equal to the amount listed under Additional Funds Gained (which is equal to the difference between the Stronghold Allowance of your new level and the previous level). For example, if you take the Landlord feat at 9th level, you get 25,000 gp to spend on a stronghold. When you attain 10th level, you receive an additional 25,000 gp (50,000 – 25,000) to spend on your stronghold. Characters can save their allowance from level to level if they wish.

Note: Multiple characters can purchase this feat and pool their resources to construct a stronghold together. However, the feat only provides matching funds for your own contributions (that is, if one character from a group of four contributes 10,000 gp to the construction of the group’s stronghold, the feat provides matching funds for that character (10,000 gp), not for all four characters (40,000 gp), even if all four have the feat). If all four characters have the feat and each contributes funds to the cause, they each receive matching funds equal to their contribution.

## Step 6: Map Your Stronghold
**Step 6: Map Your Stronghold**

A stronghold isn’t a jumble of different pieces tossed together and mixed up like some kind of architectural salad. A certain sense goes along with the whole structure, something you’ll end up thinking about once you start mapping.

You may want to take several cracks at the arrangement of your stronghold’s different components and walls. Drawing this over and over again on graph paper can be a real drag. Instead, do yourself a favor and set yourself up with some handy tools first. You’ll save the time you invest in doing this ten times over.

As you map out your stronghold, remember that the exact square footage of each component is deliberately vague to give you the flexibility you need. A master bedroom suite, for example, can be a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, an octagonal room 25 feet across, or a 15-foot-by-30-foot room. Most rooms in a stronghold have 10-foot or 15-foot ceilings, but if you want a vaulted ceiling in your dining hall, just do so and don’t sweat the cost.

**Connecting Your Components:** This flexibility extends to hallways and other connections between rooms. You’ll notice that the component list doesn’t include hallways, stairs, or other connecting items—yet few strongholds lack them. You get hallways and stairs for free, because every component’s cost includes a certain amount of hallway space. Add them wherever you like, as long as you’re reasonable. It’s not fair to build 40-foot wide corridors and fill them with furniture. That’s a room, not a hallway.

**Mapping Techniques**

Rather than simply drawing and redrawing your castle, consider using one of these methods to simplify the task.

**The Old-Fashioned Way**

Cut a piece of paper into squares, each representing one of the components on your list. Single-space components should average 2 inches by 2 inches. Two-space components should be 4 inches by 2 inches on average. Half-space components should be 1 inch by 2 inches. Each inch represents 10 feet, so a 2-inch-by-2-inch square represents a space 20 feet on a side, or 400 square feet.

Label each piece of paper, making sure you get the dimensions for each correct. Once you have labeled your components, you’re ready to start shuffling them around and leaving gaps for your corridors. For multiple-story buildings, stack the pieces loosely and offset them each a bit so that you can see the pieces under the topmost ones.

Play around with the arrangement a bit as described below. When you’re done, tape the pieces in place. Easy-lift, double-stick tape works well for this, because you can pick up and move the pieces around as much as you like, but once they’re put down, they stay in place. 

When you’re happy with the arrangement, you have a map of your stronghold. Draw in any freestanding walls you want, and you’re done.

**The High-Tech Way**

If you have a computer with a drawing program or a page-layout program, you can handle this all even more easily. Use the technique above, but draw the boxes in your document instead of cutting out slips of paper.

Then you can shuffle the squares and rectangles around on your computer, like the slips of paper from the old-fashioned way. Once you’re happy with the arrangement, add in any freestanding walls you like. Then save your document and print it. There’s your map.

**Organizational Tips**

Now that you have your tools, here are some hints about how to shuffle those bits of paper—literal or virtual—around.

When the characters are in the stronghold, they’ll probably spend the majority of their time in the residential components of the place such as bedrooms, kitchens, workshops, and sitting rooms. After all, they’ll sleep and eat there, which covers more than a third of the day already. As such, start by mapping out the residential components, and place them conveniently close to each other.

Also give some early thought to the entry into the residence (often a common room or hall). If this room doubles as a dining room, attach the kitchen to it. Otherwise, place a dining room near the common room and then attach the kitchen to the dining room. Kitchens are often in the back of the residence. A lot of work goes on in a kitchen, and this isn’t the kind of thing you want to bother your guests with, so it’s kept out of sight. Kitchens also generate a lot of heat—an advantage in winter but quite a nuisance on a summer afternoon.

Baths and privies are often placed next to the water source. Water is heavy, and the shorter the distance you have to haul it, the better.

Bedrooms are usually near the baths or privy, but on the opposite side from the kitchen.

**Courtyards**

Courtyards are generally in the center of the stronghold, but they can come in many forms if you’re willing to be flexible about your definition of the word. It’s reasonable to buy a courtyard component and put it in front of your stronghold. This gives visitors a garden view as they arrive.

Traditionally a courtyard sits at the center of the stronghold, with the rest of building arranged around it like a box. This produces a private, sheltered area protected from prying eyes. Some larger strongholds have two or more courtyards embedded within the larger structure in this way, creating different areas for the residents to grab some fresh air without leaving the main building proper.

Finally, you can surround your stronghold with huge, sprawling gardens if you purchase enough courtyard components. Security-minded builders construct a freestanding wall around the entire place, although this prevents passersby from being suitably impressed with such grand gardens.

**Functional Components**

Functional components such as workshops and laboratories are often on the opposite side of the building’s main hall, creating two wings: one for living and the other for working.

This popular arrangement keeps the living area insulated from the work area. Components such as smithies can be noisy, smelly places, so you improve your comfort by separating them from the residential components. Some builders put work areas in separate buildings for this reason.

Stables are often put in separate buildings, as far from the living area as possible. They smell to the heavens, and it’s worst in the summer when the windows are kept open.

**Military Components**

If you have an exterior wall, your military components should be near it. A barbican, for instance, works best near the front gate or entrance, as well as at least one guard post.

The placement of the remainder of the rest of the military components depends on the focus of the stronghold. If you want to present a peaceful face, keep the military components either off to one side or behind the residential areas, preferably nearer the functional areas than to the residential ones.

If you want a military stronghold, though, a show of strength might be a fine idea. In that case, put the military components closest to the stronghold’s entrance. Be sure to put at least one guard post behind the residential area as well, to make sure that it’s always covered.

**Defensive Extras**

Once you have the rest of the place set up, decide if you would like to have any freestanding walls around the place or not. With a sturdy main stronghold, you might be able to do without the extra expense.

If you do go with the walls, think about how you want them to work. If you have plenty of space, move them out a bit from the interior buildings. This helps make sure that someone can’t just top the wall and enter your house through a nearby window or by leaping onto the roof.

If you don’t have that much space, consider attaching the wall to one or more sides of your main building or buildings. Make sure that you don’t have any windows in the building until you get higher than the top of the wall. Otherwise, the wall doesn’t do much good.

Alternatively, you could bar the windows, but they’re not as secure as a solid wall.

## Step 7: Get Approval
**Step 7: Get Approval**

Once you have the stronghold worked up to your satisfaction, there’s still one more thing to do. Show your design to your DM, who should look over the design carefully before work begins on the stronghold.

Just because you have managed to design your stronghold and pay your gold doesn’t mean it pops up at the end of the construction period. The DM might describe problems during construction that the characters will have to deal with. Maybe unscrupulous mercenaries try to seize the stronghold for themselves, or perhaps excavation reveals a mysterious cave complex. Other problems are more mundane: the price of marble goes up unexpectedly, or the stonemasons go on strike.

If any problems do occur, realize that the DM isn’t describing them to see your eyes roll back into your head as you argue with the construction foreman or haggle with a spellcaster. It’s probably part of some larger plot that you’re seeing the beginning of. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a game about adventure, not supervising builders as they put your stronghold together.

### Behind the Curtain: Build Times and Realism
**Behind the Curtain: Build Times and Medieval Realism**

In medieval Europe, castles often took years to build, and truly massive structures took even longer. Main construction on the cathedral in Reims, France, took 80 years, with decorative work continuing centuries after the groundbreaking in 1211.

Such long construction times don’t work well in most D&D campaigns, because the pace of characters’ lives moves too quickly. Characters could undertake multiple epic adventures while their castle was being built, and they would only get to live in their strongholds after they had retired. Any character willing to spend hard-earned gold on a stronghold deserves to enjoy the finished product.

Magic, of course, speeds the building process immensely, and all the costs and build times in this book assume you’re using magic when it’s the most efficient tool for the job. That’s why D&D strongholds are much quicker to build than

### Final Cost Example: Brightstone Keep
**Final Cost Example: Brightstone Keep**

The components and extras for Brightstone Keep cost 73,200 gp. The site modifiers reduce this by 1%, to a cost of 72,468 gp. The keep will take eight weeks to build, and Karlerren decides not to rush it—he’s spent enough money already. Besides, he’ll be busy enough casting *wall of stone* and crafting magic items for the stronghold.
