**TACTICS**

**Before Combat** If she realizes the PCs are near (as is the case if the faceless stalkers drop a bell), Xanesha casts *invisibility* and *mirror image* on herself. She also activates her *Sihedron medallion’s false life* ability.

**During Combat** Xanesha uses *major image* to make an illusory flying demon appear in a cloud of smoke that then begins to circle the top of the tower. She then moves to make a sneak attack on the nearest PC. After this attack, she prefers to fight in melee, saving her *medusa mask* to temporarily petrify any particularly dangerous foe. If she is reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, she casts *cure serious wounds* on herself.

**Morale** If she’s reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Xanesha attempts to flee Magnimar, abandoning her plot and the scroll hidden in her nest. Simply slithering off the side of the tower and using *feather fall* to descend to the ground below is her easiest method of escape. If she escapes, she cuts ties with her kin and Mokmurian, afraid of the punishment for failure. She grows obsessed with the PCs, however, seeing their capture as the only way she can redeem herself to Mokmurian—in this case, she becomes a recurring villain who might ally with any number of foes the PCs find themselves up against in the next adventure—although she specifically tries to avoid any situation that would reveal her failure to her sister Lucrecia.
