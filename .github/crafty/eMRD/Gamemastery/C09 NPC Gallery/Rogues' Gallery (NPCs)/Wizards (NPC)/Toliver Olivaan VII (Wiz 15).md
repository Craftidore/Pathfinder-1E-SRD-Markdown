## Additional Details
**<u>ECOLOGY</u>** 

**Environment:**

**Organization:**

**Treasure:**

Toliver Olivann VII is a *[[Simulacrum, Greater (Spell)|greater simulacrum]]* created from Toliver Olivaan, a wizard (universalist 19) held captive in stasis by the Eldest (elder orb beholder mage).

Toliver Olivann VII's memory has been extensively modified by the Eldest (using *modify memory)*, so he believes himself to be both the original Toliver and the great grandson of the creature calling itself Kamerun Olivaan. He also believes that magical healing does not work on him due to a familial curse.

Each time Toliver Olivann VII returns to Olivaan House in Sasserine, the Eldest records and updates the memories of Toliver Olivaan VII using a *lesser simulacrum bond* and then edits his memories as needed.

The signet ring that Toliver Olivann VII wears allows the Eldest to maintain a constant mental link and implant suggestions within Toliver Olivann VII's mind without him being aware of it. The ring has been enchanted with a permanent *magic aura* to seem nonmagical. 

The Eldest has a permanent *mind to mind* spell with Toliver Olivann VII and has edited his memories so that he is unaware of this fact.
