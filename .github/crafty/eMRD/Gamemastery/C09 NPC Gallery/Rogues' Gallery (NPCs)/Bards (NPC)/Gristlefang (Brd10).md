Khorsheed’s first mate, Gristlefang, is a gnoll slavemaster with a special talent for breaking slaves who step out of line. She capriciously exercises her cruelty even on obedient slaves, giving her the reputation aboard the vessel as someone whose favor it is wise to earn. 

Gristlefang hails from the deserts of southern Osirion, where she participated in countless raids upon trading caravans and small settlements, and even a few on the fortified city of Ipeq. Dissatisfied with the meager pickings she and her pack were able to claim, Gristlefang set out on her own to pursue a more lucrative slaving career in the markets of Katapesh. 

Within the bustling trade city, Gristlefang found work as an enforcer and slave driver. It wasn’t until she signed on to a mysterious vessel said to be in need of a new slavemaster that she truly found her calling. Accepting Captain Khorsheed’s offer sight unseen, Gristlefang joined the *Burnt Saffron*’s crew shortly after its mysterious transformation, and quickly became the most indispensable member of the crew besides the captain himself.
