**Unchained Rogue**

Thief, sneak, charmer, diplomat—all of these and more describe the rogue. When not skulking in the shadows, disarming traps, and stealing from the unaware, rogues may rub shoulders with powerful nobles or plot capers with fellow crooks. The rogue is the master of many faces, using her skills and talents to get herself both into and out of trouble with rakish aplomb. While others may call them charlatans and burglars, even the most larcenous rogues tend to consider themselves consummate professionals, willing to take on any job if the price is right. 

**Unchained**: While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the class from the *Core Rulebook*, there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue’s edge ability ties into a new system presented in Chapter 2 of this book called skill unlocks. With this feature, the rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without access to such talents. 

**Alignment**: Any. 

**Hit Die**: d8. 

**CLASS SKILLS** 

The rogue’s class skills are [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (Dex), [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] (Cha), [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] (Str), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] (Cha), [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] (Dex), [[Disguise (Skill)|Disguise]] (Cha), [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] (Dex), [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (local) (Int), [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]] (Int), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (Wis), [[Perform (Skill)|Perform]] (Cha), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] (Wis), [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] (Dex), [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] (Dex), [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] (Str), and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] (Cha). 

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 8 + Int modifier.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Attack** | **Fort** | **Ref** | **Will** |  |
| **Level** | **Bonus** | **Save** | **Save** | **Save** | **Special** |

| 3rd | +2 | +1 | +3 | +1 | Danger sense +1, finesse training, ~~sneak attack +2d6~~ |

**CLASS FEATURES** 

The following are the class features of the rogue. 

**Weapon and Armor Proficiencies**: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the [[Crossbow, Hand|hand crossbow]], [[Rapier|rapier]], sap, short sword, and [[Shortbow|shortbow]]. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields. 

**Sneak Attack**: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. 

The rogue’s attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. 

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or [[Whip (Spell)|whip]]), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack—not even with the usual –4 penalty. 

The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with total concealment. 

**Trapfinding**: A rogue adds 1/2 her level on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to locate traps and on [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] checks (minimum +1). A rogue can use [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to disarm magic traps. 

**Finesse Training (Ex)**: At 1st level, a rogue gains [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] as a bonus feat. In addition, starting at 3rd level, she can select any one type of weapon that can be used with [[Weapon Finesse (Feat)|Weapon Finesse]] (such as rapiers or daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever she makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, she adds her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to the damage roll. If any effect would prevent the rogue from adding her Strength modifier to the damage roll, she does not add her Dexterity modifier. The rogue can select a second weapon at 11th level and a third at 19th level. 

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion. 

**[[Rogue Talents]]**: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once. 

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made. 

*[[Bleeding Attack]]*\* *(Ex)*: A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue’s sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. 

*Camouflage (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is effective for the rest of the day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area-effect spell that deals acid, cold, or fire damage, whichever comes first. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage. 

*Certainty (Ex)*: The rogue chooses one of the skills she selected with rogue’s edge (see page 23). Once per day, the rogue can reroll a skill check she just made with the selected skill and take the better result. She can use this reroll with the selected skill one additional time per day at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter. A rogue can select this talent multiple times. Each time, the rogue must choose a different skill. A rogue must have the rogue’s edge class feature before selecting this talent. 

*Coax Information (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] or [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] in place of [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] to force an opponent to act friendly toward her. When the duration of the attitude shift ends, that opponents’ attitude toward the rogue returns to its previous level, rather than dropping one level. 

*Combat Swipe*: A rogue with this talent gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she is treated as if she met all the prerequisites for Greater Steal (although she must take the feat as normal). 

*[[Combat Trick]]*: A rogue who selects this talent gains a bonus combat feat. 

*Esoteric Scholar (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can attempt any [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill check, even if she is not trained in that [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill. 

*Expert Leaper (Ex)*: When using the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill to jump, a rogue with this talent is always considered to have a running start and adds her rogue level to the check result. Whenever she deliberately falls, a successful DC 15 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen. For every 5 by which she exceeds the DC of this check, she can ignore an additional 10 feet of distance fallen. 

*Fast* *[[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]]** (Ex)*: This ability allows a rogue to move at full speed using the [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] skill without penalty. 

*Follow Clues (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can use [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] to follow tracks as per the [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] skill. 

*Hold Breath (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent doubles the amount of time she can hold her breath. 

*Lasting Poison (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way that it is effective for a number of successful attacks equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum two) instead of one. This poison has a reduced effect, however, and saves made against the poison gain a +2 circumstance bonus. Applying poison in this way is a full-round action, or a standard action if the rogue has the swift poison rogue talent. 

*[[Ledge Walker]]* (Ex): This ability allows a rogue to move along narrow, uneven, or slippery surfaces (such as ice) at full speed using the [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill without penalty. In addition, a rogue with this talent is not flat-footed when using [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to move along such surfaces, and retains her Dexterity bonus to AC. 

*[[Major Magic]]** (Sp)*: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list once per day as a spell-like ability for every 2 rogue levels she possesses. The rogue’s caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 11 + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier. A rogue must have the [[Minor Magic|minor magic]] rogue talent and an Intelligence score of at least 11 to select this talent. 

*[[Minor Magic]]** (Sp)*: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. This spell can be cast at will as a spell-like ability. The rogue’s caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 10 + the rogue’s Intelligence modifier. A rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 to select this talent. 

*Multitalented (Ex)*: The rogue can use her rogue talents more often. Once per day, she can use a rogue talent that is normally only usable once per day one additional time. At 10th level and 18th level, she can use this talent one additional time per day (for a maximum total of 3 additional uses of a rogue talent that can normally only be used once per day). The uses of this talent do not have to be spent on the same rogue talent. This ability cannot be used with an advanced talent.

*Nimble Climber (Ex)*: Whenever the rogue fails a [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check by 5 or more, she can attempt a Reflex save (using the same DC as the [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] check) to catch herself and avoid falling. 

*Powerful Sneak\* (Ex)*: Whenever a rogue with this talent takes a full-attack action, she can take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. If she does, she can reroll any sneak attack damage dice that result in 1s. She can reroll multiple dice, but she can’t reroll any individual die more than once per attack. 

*[[Quick Disable]]** (Ex)*: It takes a rogue with this ability half the normal amount of time to disable a trap using the [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] skill (minimum 1 round). When she uses [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]] to open a lock that would normally take a full-round action to open, she reduces the duration to a standard action. 

*[[Resiliency]]** (Ex)*: Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice her rogue level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can be performed only when the rogue is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent the rogue from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the rogue’s hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, she falls unconscious and is dying as normal. 

*Rogue Crawl (Ex)*: While prone, a rogue with this ability can move at half speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A rogue with this talent can take a 5-foot step while crawling, and she reduces her attack roll and AC penalties for being prone by 2. 

*[[Slow Reactions]]**\* (Ex)*: Opponents damaged by the rogue’s sneak attack can’t make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. 

*[[Stand Up]]** (Ex)*: A rogue with this ability can stand up from a prone position as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity, or as a free action that provokes attacks of opportunity. 

*[[Surprise Attack]]** (Ex)*: During the surprise round, a rogue with this ability always considers opponents flat-footed, even if they have already acted. A rogue with this ability adds 1/2 her rogue level to her sneak attack damage rolls made during the surprise round. 

*Terrain Mastery (Ex)*: A rogue with this talent gains a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature of the same name (*Core Rulebook* 65), but the bonus does not increase with her level. A rogue can select this talent multiple times, each time applying it to a new terrain. 

*[[Trap Spotter]]** (Ex)*: Whenever a rogue with this talent comes within 10 feet of a trap, she can attempt an immediate [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM. 

*[[Weapon Training]]*: A rogue who selects this talent gains [[Weapon Focus (Feat)|Weapon Focus]] as a bonus feat. 

**[[Danger Sense]]**** (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a rogue gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).

**Blessed Scamp (Rogue)**

These rogues live a charmed life; they have a habit of escaping every trap laid for them, and through seeming luck and incredible moxie they gain the upper hand in nearly all of their endeavors.

Blessed scamps have the following class features.

**Mischievous Strike (Ex):** At 1st level, a blessed scamp gains the ability to apply a debilitating condition on those she attacks while the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target has one or not). At higher level these attacks also deal more damage to the target. This ability acts as sneak attack, except that the bonus dice to damage start at +1d6 at 5th level, and reaches a maximum of +8d6 at 19th level.

When the blessed scamp hits a target denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, she can apply one of the following mischiefs to the target. The blessed scamp must choose the mischief that affects the target when she first deals damage, and, once chosen, she cannot change it. The DC for all mischiefs is 10 + blessed scamp level + Dexterity bonus.

*Befuddle*: The blessed scamp can confuse her opponent with her strikes. The target must succeed on a Will saving throw or suffer a 20% miss chance to all attacks made before the start of its next turn, and the target cannot make attacks of opportunity until the start of its next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.

*Low Blow*: The blessed scamp is able to strike where it really hurts. The target must succeed a Fortitude save or become [[Dazed|dazed]] until the start of its next turn.

*Shove*: The blessed scamp is able to push herself into the attack and knock her opponent backward. The target must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or be knocked 5 ft. away from the blessed scamp (scamp’s choice of square as long as the target ends in an open space that is at least 5 ft. away from the scamp).

*Trip*: The blessed scamp uses misdirection and some element of the terrain or the field of battle to knock her opponent off its feat. The target must succeed a Reflex saving throw or fall prone. Until the start of the blessed scamp’s next turn, if the target gets up, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity from her. This ability replaces sneak attack.

**Scamp’s Favor (Su):** At 1st level, if the blessed scamp has the favored racial trait of the jinnborn, she gains the [[Truly Favored]] feat as a bonus feat even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the blessed scamp does not have that racial trait, she gains it as a supernatural ability. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Rogue Talents:** At 2nd level, a blessed scamp can take any of the standard rogue talents, as well as the following talents. This expands rather than replaces or alters the blessed scamp’s class features. All of the following talents affect the mischief in the mischievous strike class feature.

**Improved Shove (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the shove mischief, she can choose to move the target 10 ft. instead of 5 ft.

**Improved Trip (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the trip mischief, if the target gets up at any time, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you.

**Scamp’s Luck (Su):** At 3rd level, once per day as an immediate action after rolling a saving throw, the blessed scamp can add her Dexterity bonus to the saving throw. At 9th level she can do this twice per day. At 15th level she can do it three times per day. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Improved Befuddle (Ex):** The blessed scamp can use the befuddle mischief even on mindless creatures and those immune to mind-affecting effects. When she does, the saving throw is a Reflex saving throw instead of a Will saving throw.

**Improved Low Blow (Ex):** When the blessed scamp uses the low blow mischief, and the target fails its saving throw, she can choose to stun the victim instead.

**Fighter**

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

**Role**: Fighters excel at combat—defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

**Class Skills**

The fighter’s class skills are [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] (Str), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] (Cha), [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] (Cha), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (dungeoneering) (Int), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (engineering) (Int), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] (Dex), [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] (Wis), and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”

Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.

**Bravery (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.

**Armor Training (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.

In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

**Weapon Training (Ex)**: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.

A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.

Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups):

*Axes*: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, heavy pick, light pick, [[Axe, Orc Double|orc double axe]], and throwing axe.

*Blades, Heavy*: bastard sword, [[Curve Blade, Elven|elven curve blade]], falchion, [[Greatsword|greatsword]], [[Longsword|longsword]], scimitar, scythe, and two-bladed sword.

*Blades, Light*: [[Dagger|dagger]], [[Kama|kama]], [[Kukri|kukri]], [[Rapier|rapier]], sickle, starknife, and short sword.

*Bows*: composite longbow, composite shortbow, [[Longbow|longbow]], and [[Shortbow|shortbow]].

*Close*: [[Gauntlet|gauntlet]], heavy shield, light shield, [[Dagger, Punching|punching dagger]], sap, [[Spiked Armor|spiked armor]], spiked gauntlet, spiked shield, and unarmed strike.

*Crossbows*: hand crossbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, [[Crossbow, Repeating Heavy|heavy repeating crossbow]], and [[Crossbow, Repeating Light|light repeating crossbow]].

*Double*: [[Flail, Dire|dire flail]], dwarven urgrosh, [[Hammer, Gnome Hooked|gnome hooked hammer]], [[Axe, Orc Double|orc double axe]], [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]], and two-bladed sword.

*Flails*: [[Flail, Dire|dire flail]], flail, heavy flail, [[Morningstar|morningstar]], [[Nunchaku|nunchaku]], [[Chain, Spiked|spiked chain]], and [[Whip (Spell)|whip]].

*Hammers*: club, greatclub, heavy mace, light hammer, light mace, and warhammer.

*Monk*: [[Kama|kama]], [[Nunchaku|nunchaku]], [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]], [[Sai|sai]], shuriken, [[Siangham|siangham]], and unarmed strike.

*Natural*: unarmed strike and all natural weapons, such as bite, claw, gore, tail, and wing.

*Pole Arms*: [[Glaive|glaive]], [[Guisarme|guisarme]], [[Halberd|halberd]], and [[Ranseur|ranseur]].

*Spears*: [[Light spear, elven (MeleeWpn)|elven light spear]], [[Greatspear|greatspear]], [[Javelin|javelin]], [[Lance|lance]], [[Longspear|longspear]], [[Shortspear|shortspear]], [[Spear|spear]], and trident.

*Thrown*: blowgun, [[Bolas|bolas]], club, [[Dagger|dagger]], dart, [[Sling Staff, Halfling|halfling sling staff]], [[Javelin|javelin]], light hammer, [[Net|net]], [[Shortspear|shortspear]], shuriken, [[Sling|sling]], [[Spear|spear]], starknife, throwing axe, and trident.

**Armor Mastery (Ex)**: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the [[Longsword|longsword]], greataxe, or [[Longbow|longbow]]. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.

**Spear Fighter (Fighter)** 

The spear is one of the oldest weapons known to most humanoid races, and no weapon has seen as much use across the different continents of Golarion. One of the oldest spear-fighting styles originates in Vudra, where many martial arts traditions consider the spear to be the ultimate weapon. 

**Class Skills:** A spear fighter adds [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] to his list of class skills and removes [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] as a class skill. 

This alters the fighter’s class skills. 

**Armor Proficiency:** A spear fighter is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields. Instead, he gains [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]] as a bonus feat, even if he doesn’t fulfill the prerequisites, but he can’t use this feat while wearing heavy armor or using a shield. 

This alters the fighter’s armor proficiencies. 

**Balanced Stride (Ex):** At 2nd level, the spear fighter gains a +1 bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks to avoid attacks of opportunity. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he has beyond 2nd. 

This replaces bravery. 

**Spear Parry (Ex):** At 3rd level, a spear fighter learns to parry his opponents’ attacks with his spear. This functions as a swashbuckler’s [[Opportune Parry and Riposte (Deed)|opportune parry and riposte]] deed (*Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide* 57) except as noted below. The spear fighter must use a weapon from the spears weapon group to perform the parry. He doesn’t need panache to parry an attack or to make an attack against a creature whose attack he has parried; instead, he takes a cumulative –4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts) until the end of his next turn. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, the penalty decreases by 1. At 19th level, a spear fighter can use spear parry without penalty. 

This replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4, and armor mastery. 

**Weapon Training (Ex):** At 5th level, a spear fighter must choose the spears weapon group for the weapon training class feature. 

**Weapon Mastery (Ex):** At 20th level, a spear fighter must choose a weapon from the spears weapon group for his weapon mastery class feature.

**Elf Racial Traits**

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, –2 Constitution:** Elves are nimble, both in body and mind, but their form is frail.

**Medium:** Elves are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed:** Elves have a base speed of 30 feet.

**[[S3.1D-F - Universal Monster Rules D-F (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Darkvision]]:** Though uncommon, some groups of elves are born with darkvision, rather than [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]]. In many cases this is taken as a sign of a drow in the elf’s ancestry, and can lead to persecution within the elf’s home community. Elves with this racial trait gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, but also gain sensitivity to light and are [[Dazzled|dazzled]] in areas of bright light or within the radius of a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell. This racial trait replaces [[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|low-light vision]].

**Elven Immunities:** Elves are immune to magic sleep effects and gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.

**Elven Speed:** An elf with this racial trait may draw a single longbow, longsword, shortbow, rapier, or any weapon with “elven” in the name as a free action, or as part of an initiative check (requiring no action). This racial trait replaces the elven magic trait.

**Source:** Amazing Races: Elves! (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

**Keen Senses:** Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks.

**Weapon Familiarity:** Elves are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name as a martial weapon.

**Languages:** Elves begin play speaking Common and Elven. Elves with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Celestial, Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.

**Swyft (Template)**

Swyfts are creatures that possess heigntened speed. Some inherit their powers from quickling parents or distant swyft ancestors, but others seem to become swyfts spontaneously. Such creatures are often individuals in need of great speed to flee a foe or reach a loved one in time to prevent tragedy. Most count their gift of speed as a great blessing at first, but they soon learn to curse it when they see their lives rapidly passing by.

Swyfts, like quicklings, are prime examples of the old adage, “Live fast and die young.” In fact, they age twice times as fast as normal for their kinds. Elf swyfts die of old age just as their companions are old enough to be married, and human swyfts rarely live past fifty or so. Knowledge of their impending doom, however, drives many swyfts to accomplish great deeds in the small amount of time they have.

**Creating a Swyft**

“Swyft” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A swyft creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature +1

**Initiative:** A swyft gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks.

**Armor Class:** A swyft gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

**Weaknesses:** A swyft has the following weakness:

*Aging Vulnerability (Ex)* A swyft takes 50% more damage from aging effects, including the number of years aged.

**Speed:** Each of the base creature’s speeds is increased by +10.

**Special Attacks:** A swyft retains all of the base creature’s special attacks and gains the following:

*Rapid Actions (Ex):* A swyft gains one extra attack or move action each round. This does not stack with other *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* effects.

**Abilities:** Dex +2.

**Skills:** A swyft creature gains a +2 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +5 racial bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks.

**Feats:** A swyft creature gains Dodge or [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]] as a bonus feat.

**Special Qualities:** A swyft gains the following:

*Rapid Aging (Ex)* A swyft ages 2 years for every 1 year that passes.
