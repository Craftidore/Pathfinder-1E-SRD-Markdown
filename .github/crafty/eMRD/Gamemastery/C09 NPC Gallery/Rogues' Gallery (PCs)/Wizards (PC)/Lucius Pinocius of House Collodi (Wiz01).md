### Race and Template(s)
**[[Wyrwood (Bestiary 4)|Wyrwood]] (20 RP)**

This relatively young race was created by a cabal of wizards who needed nimble and skilled construct servants to do their dirty work. This cabal was interested in creating magical machines, so they built their tools to be small, agile, and clever. Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and created minions with free will, and these first wyrwoods began to question why they were involved in their masters’ petty intrigues. When the wizards forced the wyrwoods to fight each other as proxies for the wizards themselves, the constructs instead killed their creators and stole the notes on how to create more of their kind, allowing them to perpetuate their race.

Wyrwoods are secretive and somewhat xenophobic, and can seem cold and calculating to others—a trait that could earn respect or enmity, depending on the audience. Purely rational and unemotional, wyrwoods see the survival of their race as their primary goal. Even the rare wyrwood who understands the point of empathy and altruism sees such concepts as mere tools to help ensure its own survival or that of its people. All wyrwoods know how to create more of their kind, and they keep the details of their construction process secret from other creatures to make sure their race is never again enslaved.

Most wyrwoods are wizards or rogues. The few who are inclined to worship tend to revere lawful deities with strict codes of behavior, which they follow to the letter rather than the spirit.

**Racial Traits**

**Ability Score Modifiers:** Standard (+2 Dex, +2 Int, –2 Cha) (0 RP)

**Type:** Construct (20 RP)

**Size:** Small (0 RP)

**Base Speed:** Normal (0 RP) Modified by Swimmer alternate racial trait.

**Languages:** Standard (0 RP)

**SENSES RACIAL TRAITS**

**~~Darkvision:** Wyrwoods have darkvision and so can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.~~ Replaced by Repair Magic alternate racial trait.

[[S3.1G-M - Universal Monster Rules G-M (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Low-Light Vision]]: Wyrwood can see twice as far as humans in dim light (they have low-light vision). (0 RP)

**Alternate Racial Trait**

**Repair Magic:** Some wyrwoods have developed magic to keep them more self-sufficient. They can use *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]* as a spell-like ability once per day. This racial trait replaces darkvision. 

**Alternate Racial Traits (3pp)**

**War Titan:** Some wyrwood creators have increased the size of their progeny over time to make them more formidable and intimidating opponents. Such wyrwoods are Medium-sized creatures and gain 20 bonus hit points when created; however, their base speed is decreased to 20 feet due to the extra weight of their bodies.

**Favored Class Option**

**Wizard:** The wizard gains 1/6 of a bonus item creation, metamagic, or spell mastery feat.

### Classess and Archetypes
#### Wizard
**Wizard**

Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.

Role: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.

**Alignment:** Any.

**Hit Die:** d6.

**Class Skills**

The wizard’s class skills are [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]] (Int), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), [[Linguistics (PF Freeport Comp)|Linguistics]] (Int), [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (Wis), and [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] (Int).

Skill Ranks per Level: 2 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells:** A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in Chapter 10 (of the Core Rulebook). A wizard must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3–16. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 of the Core Rulebook).

A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages:** A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

**Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp):** At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. 

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see arcane school).

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in Chapter 5 of the Core Rulebook). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

**Arcane School:** A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a* fireball*. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.

**Cantrips:** Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 3–16 under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below). 

**Scribe Scroll:** At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats:** At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.

**Spellbooks:** A wizard must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for *read magic*, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to his own (see Chapter 9 of the *PFRG Core Rulebook*).

**Adding Spells to a Wizard’s Spellbook**

Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. A wizard can only learn new spells that belong to the wizard spell lists.

Spells Gained at a New Level: Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast.

Spells Copied from Another Spellbook or Scroll: A wizard can also add a spell to his book whenever he encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings). Next, he must spend 1 hour studying the spell. At the end of the hour, he must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell’s level). A wizard who has specialized in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus on the Spellcraft check if the new spell is from his specialty. See Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook for associated costs.

**Arcane Spells and Armor**

Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting any spell that has a somatic component. The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

If a spell doesn’t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster’s hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks still apply normally). The metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell without the somatic component at one spell level higher than normal. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.

**Alternative Capstone Ability**

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. When a character reaches 20th level in this class, the following new ability can be selected instead of the standard 20th level class ability which would normally be gained. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.

**Well-Prepared (Su)**

At 20th level, the wizard has a spell for every occasion he can imagine—and a few he can’t. The wizard gains two additional cantrips per day, six additional 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots, four additional 3rd- and 4th-level spell slots, two additional 5th-level spell slots, and one additional 6th-level spell slot.

#### Arcanamirium crafter
**Arcanamirium crafter**

An Arcanamirium crafter is one of the builders of the arcane world, assembling magic items with facility, skill, and power. He is intimately familiar with the craft and practice of imbuing items with arcane power, and works with precision even early in his career to help create some of the most powerful magic items.

**Associated School:** Universalist.

**Replacement Power:** The following school power replaces the hand of the apprentice power of the universalist school.

**Metacharge (Ex)**

As an Arcanamirium crafter, you gain a bonus feat at 3rd level, which must be an item creation feat or metamagic feat. You must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. When using metamagic feats to create magic items, your skill and understanding of the principles involved in the item’s creation give you a +2 bonus on the skill check made to create the item.

#### Poleiheira Adherent
**[[Poleiheira Adherent (Archetype)|Poleiheira Adherent]]**

Poleiheira adherents are wizards who wish to partake in great odysseys. These adherents bond to a book known as the Poleiheira. This allows them to record their travels as well as any lost magic and lore they encounter.

**Bonded Book (Sp)**

A Poleiheira adherent forms a bond with a spellbook. This bonded book becomes intrinsically tied to a Poleiheira adherent’s conscious and subconscious mind. The book always opens to the right page, and she can record any number of spells and other information in her bonded book—when she turns pages, more blank pages appear. Other wizards find it difficult to read the book, which displays information in a seemingly random order: the DC of all [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks to copy or prepare spells from the book increases by 10.

Each time a Poleiheira adherent attains a new wizard level, she gains four spells (rather than two) to add to the bonded book. The cost and time requirement for writing a new spell into the book are halved. The time to prepare spells is reduced to one third (20 minutes to prepare all spells, and 5 minutes to prepare up to one quarter of her spells). Once per day while holding the book in one hand, she can use it to cast any one spell she has written in the bonded book, even if the spell is not prepared.

A Poleiheira adherent can replace a lost or destroyed bonded book in the same manner as a bonded item. The new bonded book retains a number of spells per spell level equal to the Poleiheira adherent’s Intelligence modifier from the previous bonded book, as well as all the mundane information that was recorded in the previous bonded book. If a Poleiheira adherent replaces her bonded book or dies, the previous book reverts to an ordinary blank spellbook.

This replaces arcane bond.

**Great Odyssey**

A Poleiheira adherent specializes in exploration and travel rather than a particular school of magic. She gains the abilities below.

This replaces arcane school.

- **Mount (Sp):** A Poleiheira adherent can summon a magical steed to her side (per the *[[Mount (Spell)|mount]]* spell) that lasts up to 2 hours per wizard level. The duration of this ability doesn’t need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 2-hour increments. When riding a mount summoned with this ability, a Poleiheira adherent can substitute [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks for [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] checks.
- **Master Mariner (Su)** At 8th level, a Poleiheira adherent can telekinetically control a boat or ship with such skill and finesse that she counts as a number of people equal to her wizard level for the purpose of determining how many crew members are needed to move a water vehicle. When controlling a ship in this manner, she can substitute [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] checks for [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) checks.
