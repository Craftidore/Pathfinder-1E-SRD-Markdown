# Speed Round Tips For Playing Virtual Tabletop RPGs
## Overview
On a blustery day in the Winter of 2019, four gamers gather in their Storyteller’s den. The long table groans under piles of books, miniatures, soda cans, and dice as the party hears how they must rescue the elderly Reeve of Sallcam, who was kidnapped by Goblins. Four players listen, imaginations fired by the Storyteller’s descriptions of a dank forest, and lean forward as he describes a chill breeze, a snapped branch, and a half-dozen Goblins stepping out of the foliage. The players react, calling out actions, asking questions, offering advice, and collaborating on their response as the 

Storyteller draws a forest on the map.

Each of the players rolls for initiative and eagerly calls out their results while the Storyteller quickly notes the order on a whiteboard, players interspersed with that of the monsters. Combat begins ...

The Fighter advances and swings her sword at the tallest Goblin, who deflects the blow with his rusty battleaxe. The Rogue joins the Fighter and kills the tall Goblin with a sneak attack. Three more Goblins rush forward and attack the Fighter, hitting her twice and almost killing her. A Goblin wearing a bearskin hat charges forward and attacks the Rogue, but misses. Next, the party’s Cleric positions himself between the Wizard and the remaining Goblins. He heals the Fighter, curing most of her damage. The last Goblin, clad in a rusty chainmail shirt, swings at the Cleric but misses him.

Less than 10 minutes later the party finishes looting the corpses and eagerly moves up the trail, ready for more battle. Three combat encounters later, they rescue the Reeve, escort the aged worthy back to Sallcam, and are feted as heroes by the grateful hoi polloi. Finally, they sail to the half-sunken city of Scilly, a bustling trade port.

This session took four hours and the party accomplished a lot. Another session like this and they will level up…

A year later, in the bleak and dismal Winter of 2020, the players login to their weekly virtual game session. Although sick of teleconferencing for school and work, their virtual game is a reminder of happier days. Unfortunately, the rules of their tabletop role-playing game are not optimized for online play ...

The group logs into a virtual tabletop. The Rogue’s laptop needs a browser update, which clears the saved password. Whoops … she did not write it down. Request a new password. Amanda, playing the Wizard, is having connectivity issues and will have to turn off her video. The Storyteller, who had uploaded the various battle maps in advance of the game, decides to send screenshots to the Wizard so she can follow the action.

Half an hour later, they start their first combat encounter, fighting two Trolls, two Ogres, and six Orcs. The Fighter wins initiative and charges to attack but misses the bigger Ogre with both of her attacks. The big Ogre is up next and hits the Fighter with its massive stone hammer. The Fighter, who had accidentally muted, interrupts the Storyteller’s description to point out that she was using her action surge to make another attack. The Storyteller backtracks to the Fighter, who attacks again, killing the Ogre with a critical hit. The second Ogre moves to engage the Cleric and hits. Brenda, who is playing the Fighter, disappears from the camera, having left to get something to eat.

The Storyteller moves on to the Rogue, who asks for some details of the battlefield. The Rogue readies her action to attack if an enemy comes within reach. Now it is the monsters’ turn, so the Storyteller begins to describe the … wait a minute, the Rogue also wanted to use her cunning action to hide. Is the pillar drawn on the screen sufficient cover? A minute later, the Storyteller starts again, changing the description of the monster actions to account for the now-hidden Rogue.

Brenda returns a few minutes later, sandwich in hand. Mike, who is playing the Cleric, is missing, as he went to top off his coffee. One of the Orcs moves up to engage the Wizard and prepares to bash her with a spiked club. The Storyteller begins to roll the dice… but wait, the Rogue uses her reaction to sneak attack the Orc, killing it. That accomplished, Penny, who is playing the Rogue, goes to feed her cats. Another Orc moves up to engage the Wizard.

More than an hour later, the first encounter finally ends. If they are lucky, the group might finish a second encounter this session … but it is not likely. The players have taken between 15 and 20 actions over the eight rounds of combat and have made between six and 10 die rolls. Brenda made a sandwich, popped popcorn, and sent a couple work emails. Penny fed her cats, poured herself another beer, and heated up some leftovers. Mike posted a new blog entry, brewed another pot of coffee, and swapped out some laundry. Amanda finished up two sketches, prepared herself a spiked cocoa, and set up a stock purchase for the next morning.

Octavius, the Storyteller, who controlled 10 monsters, has taken over 50 actions and rolled his dice over 30 times. Octavius is strongly engaged in the game and is having a great time. His only complaint is that he did not have enough time to get another soda.

This group has problems. This group is not alone. This book contains solutions.

This game play supplement accelerates virtual game play by streamlining administrative overhead and shifting the spotlight away from the rules and back to the characters. This shift in focus back to the players sustains interest and engagement.

Speed Round enhances the flow of play. When seemingly insignificant bits of time spent on single actions or die rolls are added up the total time becomes substantial, especially when the Storyteller is running multiple monsters. This is particularly problematic in virtual play, where players sit in isolation, avoid sharing casual remarks that drown out active players, and are easily distracted when combat slows to a crawl.

The following suggestions are focused on sustaining the flow of combat encounters. Some of these suggestions can easily be used during non-combat interactions but, because such encounters typically rely on fewer die rolls, the time savings are not as significant. Speed Round speeds up “roll-play” to make more time for “role-play.”

Apply these tips as needed to enhance the flow of the game, always with the goal of keeping the spotlight on all the players. Speed Round is straightforward. Once you are familiar with the concepts, implementing these tips will become second nature.

**Speed Round Virtual Play Tips**

Moving from a live tabletop to a virtual online setting requires patience and, at least initially, some effort, and a bit of advance preparation will pay off during the game session. We have provided bulleted lists of the lessons we have learned about running sessions, some software options, and a few other suggestions. We also describe in some detail the use of a virtual tabletop, which typically includes a chat window, a window where a map can be displayed, and either a window showing the participating players or separate ones for each of them.

## Teleconferencing and Virtual Tabletops
**Teleconferencing and Virtual Tabletops**

The Great Pestilence of 2020 generated a surge of teleconference-savvy workers and students. Consequently, we assume you are familiar with some of the strengths and limitations of virtual meetings, regardless of setting. An internet search of “teleconferencing” provides \~10,000,000 hits and, if you need a primer, the “Teleconference” entry on Wikipedia provides a succinct overview and up-to-date lists of available options.

There are any number of choices for a virtual tabletop. We have had success with both game-specific platforms (e.g., Roll20, Shard Tabletop, Fantasy Grounds,) and non-gaming conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Discord, Twitch). Each category has advantages and disadvantages so it makes the most sense, if possible, to begin with what you know. Game-specific platforms have useful features but often have a challenging learning curve for newer players. The D&D Beyond website offers a variety of virtual play aids, but not a virtual tabletop (yet).

- Choose your virtual tabletop with the players in mind. Tech-savvy hackers will have different expectations than parchment-loving Luddites. When in doubt, start with a simple platform, and you can always “upgrade” later if you feel the need.
- Make sure each of your prospective players has access to the virtual platform you select (to include appropriate permissions, sufficient technology, and no network restrictions).
- You do not need to use the same platform for every session. If you are going to run a role-playing-intense session you may not want or need a bleeding-edge virtual tabletop.
- Once you have selected your virtual tabletop, spend a few minutes testing uploads and managing your map. Run a “practice” session with a single player to work out bugs in advance of the larger group.

The following features and steps work as of the time of writing, and in the future new features may become available and specific steps may change.

- If you have little experience with these tools, we suggest starting with Google Meet, supplemented by the free Google Chrome Web Store “Google Meet Dice Roller” extension. Its ability to allow participants to roll virtually in the chat window is a distinct advantage over other non-gaming platforms, although it may not be an issue for your group if there is mutual trust vis-à-vis dice rolling.
- It is typically best if the Storyteller initiates the meeting. This allows more control over file sharing and group management.
- A shared-cloud spreadsheet with a few randomizer functions is a viable alternative for groups with an aversion to Google Meet.

                ○ Examples of randomizing functions that work for both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets are =RANDBETWEEN(1,20) for a d20 roll, =RANDBETWEEN(1,4) 

                    for a d4 roll, =RANDBETWEEN(1,100) for a d100 roll, or =RANDBETWEEN(1,6)+RANDBETWEEN(1,6) for 2d6

                ○ Paste the bolded text into the spreadsheet cell.

                ○ For Excel spreadsheet, press the “F9” key to generate new values.

                ○ For Google Sheets, select an empty cell and push the “backspace” key to generate new values.

                ○ It is OK to have different rules for the players (virtual dice) and Storyteller (real dice), but all the players should use one method or the other 

                    and you should not require individual players to roll virtually because of trust issues.

- Once you have started your meeting, load the Google Meet collaborative whiteboard (i.e, the “Jamboard”).
- Set the virtual background for the combat, either by uploading a map image or by using the Jamboard’s drawing tools to sketch out a rudimentary battleboard on one of the preset grid or hexagon backgrounds. If you need a grid on your map, add one to the map image before you upload it. The long-standing free IrfanView image software provides the aforementioned functionality.

                ○ If there are parts of the map background that need to be hidden, just cover those sections with a few filled polygons. You can adjust the size of the polygons during the session 

                    to reveal new parts of the map.

                ○ Alternatively, clip your background image into sections before the sessions and then upload them as images when you need them, 

                    moving them to the “Back” using the whiteboard’s “Order” function.

                ○ The whiteboard supports multiple pages, allowing you to put host several maps in the same session. Use the small arrows at the top of the page to create or navigate to new pages.

- Load icons for your monsters and characters using the “Add Image” function.

                ○ If you do not already have an image library, virtual icons (e.g., Skirmisher Publishing’s “Cardstock Characters” and “Tokens & Avatars”), downloaded images from a web search, 

                    or pictures of actual miniatures can all be used to represent characters, companions, and monsters.

                ○ If possible, use .png format icons with transparent backgrounds.

                ○ The whiteboard will sometimes force a minimum image size on uploaded icons (i.e., the uploaded icons are too big for the map background). 

                    If you have problems resizing uploaded images, try pasting a smaller version of the image onto the corner of a larger canvas, then saving the result in .png format 

                    with a transparent background. This should bypass the whiteboard’s feature of restricting image-size reductions. The aforementioned IrfanView software can be used for this.

                ○ Alternatively, “Resize” the canvas; adding \~20 pixels to the left border and \~200 pixels to the top border often produces usable icons. Again, IrfanView can be used to do this easily.

                ○ You can copy and paste icons, or a set of selected icons, between whiteboard pages using the standard <control>-C and <control>-V copy-and-paste functionality.

- Either have players move their own character icons, or have them use the whiteboard “Laser Pointer” function to indicate where they want to move.
- The “Laser Pointer” is also useful when indicating targets or areas of interest.
- Add a virtual sticky note to the whiteboard with the initiative order.
- Use the drawing tools and sticky notes to mark-up the map. The Google whiteboard layout saves to your cloud Google Meet drive so you can easily resume interrupted sessions.
- Use your map to help visualize the game, rather than as an accurate model of the environment. Be liberal when interpreting distances, ranges, and areas of effect for both characters and monsters. A 5’ square one way or another is not going to ruin the game; it is a role-playing game, not a chess match. Keep the game moving, as there is little joy in counting squares or re-measuring distances.
- Most teleconferencing options let participants adjust the name that accompanies their video image, so consider asking all your players to use their character names in conjunction with these.

## Session Preparation
**Session Preparation**

- Understand your player’s knowledge level, motivation, goals, and interests, and consider these when developing encounters, clues, and rewards.
- Consider purchasing a few maps, icons, or images to use in your game. Many talented artists sell their work through virtual tabletop marketplaces, art-content websites, and gaming websites. Professional artwork contributes to immersion (e.g., if the Orc icon on the screen looks like the Orc you describe, including weapons and armor) and comprehension (e.g., players can see that the icon is an Orc and not a Human).

                ○ Maps are easiest to use if you plan your encounters around them. If you are using a module or adventure with a different virtual map, 

                    key the scenario’s encounters onto your virtual map before the session.

- If you are not happy with your equipment’s performance, consider upgrading your webcam and microphone. Even modestly-priced external devices often boast superior perform and a myriad of placement options.
- If possible, understand and troubleshoot your equipment before you start the session.
- Logging out and logging back in often resolves connection issues. If that does not work, try restarting the computer or device.
- If you are using a mobile phone to teleconference, be sure you have a strong signal. Keep phone or laptop chargers handy.
- Have a communications alternative available so that you can text or email the group about unexpected technical difficulties, especially if you are the Storyteller.

                ○ Have a continuity plan if a session fails mid-game (e.g., a power-outage prevents the Storyteller from logging in, a cloud-server fails). 

                    A typical plan might be that if a single player drops out, play continues; if more than one player or the Storyteller drop out, the rest of the group remains logged in 

                    and takes a 10-minute break; and if the group is still incomplete after the break, the session is canceled.

- Before your first couple sessions, have a “dry run” with a tech-savvy player before going live.
- Work out your gaming schedule in advance. Decide what your “critical mass” is for attendance, and how to manage absent players.

                ○ Are missing characters busy elsewhere/guarding the camp/running an errand back to town?

                ○ Will missing players’ characters be present and, if so, will someone run them on their behalf? Options include having the Storyteller and/or one or more 

                    of the other players run the missing player’s character, or specifying that the playerless characters are somehow assisting or supporting the rest of the part in appropriate ways 

                    and granting them commensurate benefits (e.g., an instance of advantage each turn). In either event, do not inflict any long-term harm on missing player’s characters 

                    (e.g., loss of life or limb, destruction of cherished equipment).

- Have a “one-shot” small-group adventure ready as a substitute for the regular campaign for no-notice cancellations (e.g.,a reconnaissance team from the existing party is exploring a previously-ignored passageway). Alternately, keep a roster of secondary characters specifically for one-shots or use a recurring cast of rotating backup characters (e.g., guildmembers sent on excursions, consultants hired by government agencies, soldiers assigned to a specific mission, children of the main characters).
- Account for time-zone differences when scheduling widely-dispersed groups and plan your start and end times accordingly. A couple of shorter sessions are often easier to arrange than longer virtual marathons.
- Use handouts and images to enhance your game. Photos or drawings of places, people, and objects give players an initial frame of reference that you can supplement with your verbal descriptions.

                ○ Many images can be uploaded onto the virtual tabletop or whiteboard; crop extraneous sections out of larger images in advance. 

                    Various apps and websites can render photos into line drawings or otherwise transform their appearance to be more appropriate (e.g., less anachronistic in a fantasy setting).

                ○ Use interesting but legible fonts for written documents and clues. Keep text to a minimum.

                ○ Upload these documents to a shared cloud directory for the players to access later.

                ○ Paste important names, clues, and loot into the chat bar.

- If possible, handle bookkeeping before the game. A couple of email messages can resolve character leveling, downtime activities, and minor equipment replenishment and not cut into valuable game time.
- If you are providing written background materials for a session send them out before the session, bearing in the mind the following:

                ○ Most players do not enjoy homework.

                ○ Do not expect your players to be as interested in the details of your setting as you are.

                ○ Humans are wired for stories. Convey the setting background during the game, as tidbits revealed in conversation, or as a short story told in an NPC’s voice.

                ○ Keep your descriptions vivid while leveraging the familiar; describing a demon as a “a large winged red poodle-man with a glowing blue rhino horn” 

                    is probably easier to visualize than a “bipedal 11-foot-tall humanoid, covered in curly crimson fur, with ponderous leathery flaps joining its arms to its body, 

                    its sinister head sporting glistening white fangs, a jagged chitinous growth on its snout, the whole being wrapped in cerulean flashes of energy.”

- Send session invites, links, and other details before the meeting.

                ○ Be aware of severe weather (e.g., storms) or events (e.g., major holidays) that might conflict with the meeting. Your player in New Orleans, for example, 

                    might prefer that the regular Tuesday night game be postponed if that happens to be the evening before Ash Wednesday.

- If a new player is joining an established group, have them get online with you at least a few minutes ahead of the session to troubleshoot connection difficulties.
- Before your first session, discuss and agree on ground rules, including:

                ○ Have fun.

                ○ Be kind.

                ○ Be forgiving.

                ○ Tolerate different personalities and play styles.

                ○ Play your own character.

                ○ If other players want advice, they will ask for it.

                ○ Managing breaks

                ○ Plan to take a short break every hour.

                ○ If you keep forgetting breaks, use a timer, or delegate this to a player.

                ○ If they can, players that need to step out for a few minutes should wait for an appropriate point (e.g., the end of their turn in combat, during an interaction they are not part of). 

                    A short message in the chat bar is typically sufficient to signal their intent.

                ○ If they are stilling missing when their turn comes around, keep playing and just delay their character’s actions until they return.

                ○ Players should ask for breaks if they need them, and other players often will step out at the same time.

                ○ Time your breaks between combat rounds.

                ○ Breaks are a great time for sidebars, non-game discussions, and planning.

                ○ Be aware of off-limits topics, which may vary widely among different groups. Err on the side of caution if you are not that familiar with a group. 

                    Some guidelines to consider for newer groups, particularly when the players are not already friends, might include:

                         ○ Acceptable language (i.e., profanity).

                         ○ Avoid discussing politics, religion, sex, race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, socioeconomic class, age, off-color jokes, unpleasant or morbid subject matter.

                         ○ Allow participants to veto uncomfortable themes or scenes without debate (e.g., graphic depictions of torture, sexual violence). Establish a specific phrase 

                            (e.g., “Let’s not go there,” or “That’s offensive to me”) that redirects action without further discussion.

                                 ○ Players should consider telling the Storyteller about taboo themes before the game. If a player is ncomfortable with the topic of slavery, 

                                     the “Slave Pens of Sewertown” module is probably best left on the shelf.

                                 ○ The person feeling ncomfortable defines the limit. There is not much room for debate.

                        ○ Do not tolerate bullying.

                        ○ Discourage cliquish behavior or out-of-character favoritism.

                        ○ Do not ask personal questions (e.g., where do you live, what do you do, who did you vote for); if people want to share that information, they will.

                        ○ Consider the age and maturity of players if you have a mixed group, and you may want to tone-down some of your descriptions for young players 

                            (e.g., “you hit the Orc and he falls down” instead of “your blade cleaves the Orc’s neck, severing his carotid arteries, releasing a jet of hot blood that sprays across the room”).

                ○ Rolling dice (real or virtual?)

                ○ In-combat discussions. If a combat round lasts 6 seconds in the game you are playing, for example, then if a player can’t say it in about 6 seconds their character probably can’t either.

                        ○ In-combat plans and orders should not be longer than the length of a combat round. A Wizard stating “Fighter, attack the Orc while I cast Color Spray on the Bugbear” is fine.

                            The somewhat longer exchange of Wizard: “Should I Cast Color spray on the Bugbear?” Fighter: “No, cast in on the Ogre.” Cleric: “Wait, I can use my Command on the Bugbear.” 

                            Rogue (who is currently in a different room): “Doesn’t the Ogre have a higher Wisdom?” Fighter: “No, I think Bugbears have a higher Wisdom.” 

                            Wizard: “What about Magic Missile instead? Who should I target?” Rogue: “Yes, do that instead …” Wizard: “I cast Color Spray on the Bugbear,” on the other hand, is not fine.

                        ○ This may apply to out-of combat interactions, too. If the gatekeeper asks the Knight, “What is the difference between an X and a Y? Answer in two seconds or die!” 

                            there should not be time for suggestions, much less collaborative discussions, with the rest of the party.

                        ○ As a compromise, you might allow brief discussions during the imaginary gap between rounds. If you do, however, set a time limit on these as well.

                ○ Use the chat bar to share off-topic remarks or jokes without disrupting the flow of the game.

                ○ Off-topic remarks, discussions, jokes, or references.

                        ○ How much of this you want will be group-specific; friends will typically enjoy these more than strangers. Is the group there to socialize and play, or just to play?

                        ○ Avoid making these during another player’s turn. Try to hold your comments until breaks between turns or after the encounter is over.

                        ○ If off-topic remarks become overwhelming, just refocus players on the game. Either ask a player what their character is doing, jump to the monster’s turn, 

                           or announce a random encounter.

                        ○ If that does not work, just take a short break.

                        ○ Encourage off-topic discussions in the chat bar. Players commenting on or joking about the game in chat is a vast improvement over scrolling through newsfeeds 

                            or watching cat videos while they are waiting on their turns.

                ○ Unless you are using a “reaction,” do not interrupt other player’s turns, particularly when they are talking.

                ○ Mute your microphone when you are not talking, especially if you are somewhere noisy.

                ○ It is typically best to keep your camera on, as speech is easier to understand when people can see faces. Facial expressions can also convey meaning.

                        ○ Turn off your camera if you are doing something distracting (e.g., eating shawarma, flossing your teeth), especially if you are not talking.

- The Storyteller can assign players to help manage the session if needed.

                ○ This also invests players in the game and will help them to stay engaged. Rotate these duties from session to session.

                ○ Have a player facilitate technical issues.

                ○ Have another player track treasure on a party loot sheet.

                ○ If characters claim loot (e.g., “I’ll take the +1 Longsword”), remove the item from the party loot sheet and add it to the character’s sheet.

                ○ If the Storyteller enters the loot to the chat bar, the loot tracker can easily cut and paste it to the party loot sheet.

                ○ Have another player track how many monsters and challenges the party has defeated.

                ○ Have another player keep a brief log with important names, facts, or clues. Again, use the chat bar to document important names and clues.

- If you are recording or livestreaming your session, make sure you have everyone’s consent. Note that the legal nuances surrounding this vary by jurisdiction. If kids or teens are playing, you will probably need their parent or guardian’s consent.

                ○ Consider using nicknames or online aliases when livestreaming.

                ○ If recording, delegate a player to manage the camera (i.e., turn on, turn off, save files, set subtitle options).

## Running Your Session
**Running Your Session**

- Players have different wants. Some players thrive on the social aspect, a few are happy to sit back and watch events unfold, and others are most interested in combat tactics. Give each of your players what they want at least some of the time.
- Plan for a few minutes of small talk at the beginning of each session. This gives everyone an opportunity to make final adjustments without impacting the start of the game.
- If the session is a one-off with players that have not previously met, start with a brief round of introductions. The Storyteller can call on each player by name to briefly introduce their characters and mention any known scheduling needs (e.g., needing a 10-minute break at 9 p.m. to walk the dog).
- Login at the scheduled time and plan to start a few minutes later.
- If there were problems in the previous session, briefly review the agreed-upon behavioral or process guidelines (e.g., “let’s try to avoid the F-word,” or “don’t interrupt a player that’s talking, put your comments in the chat bar”).

                ○ Do not bring up past specifics, guilt players, or use names.

                ○ Keep it short and do not lecture.

- The Storyteller should generally keep their camera on.
- Players often turn off cameras when stepping away for a few seconds or when doing something distracting. Muting the microphone is a similar courtesy.
- Set up an easy hand signal to indicate that a speaker is muted. Everyone pointing at their ears or covering their mouths will generally clue in the hapless orator.
- Remind players to use the chat bar for aside comments.
- If a player is hogging the spotlight, it is up to the Storyteller to change the focus by shifting the action.
- After introductions, lead with a brief recap of the previous session, highlighting important names, the party’s mission, and the current environment.
- Keep the game moving and redirect players as needed.

                ○ If a player can’t decide on an action, give a thumbnail sketch of the situation phrased in terms of possible actions (e.g., the Orc is next to you, 

                   a wounded Goblin is threatening the Wizard, the wooden bridge to safety behind you is on fire, and the Fey Portal at the far end of the cavern is pulsing more rapidly. What do you do?)

                ○ If they still can’t decide after five or ten seconds, delay their action to the end of the initiative order for that particular round.

                ○ Do not make a big deal out of it, just state that and move on to the next player.

                ○ If it already is the end of the round, ask if they want to perform a defensive, logistic, or non-combat action (e.g., Dodge, use a potion, cast a defensive spell, change weapons).

                ○ Some players need extra time when planning or verbalizing their actions (e.g., attention deficit, stuttering). Give these players whatever time they need, 

                    do not point out how much time they are taking, do not overwhelm them, and be kind.

- Stay on track.

                ○ If you are forgetting to take breaks then use a timer or appoint a player as the break-caller. See the Session Preparation section, above, for more suggestions.

                ○ The Storyteller should maintain control over communications and conversations. Keep them relatively courteous and on-topic. Call for a short break if the party gets sidetracked.

                ○ Share the spotlight by asking less outgoing players what their characters are doing. This is particularly effective if an extroverted player keeps assuming control of the narrative 

                    (e.g., Fighter: “We’ll cross the bridge and bash open the door,” Storyteller: “Cleric, what are you going to do? Are you crossing the bridge,” 

                   Cleric: “Hmmm. No, I’ll cast Guidance on the Barbarian but will stay on this side of the bridge and cover the Fighter with my crossbow.”)

                ○ Use graphics (e.g., images of monsters, artifacts, locations, maps, handouts) to keep your players focused on the game. Just upload the images onto the battlemap page 

                    and then delete or shrink them when you do not need them.

                ○ Adjust your descriptions to match the handouts. If your adventure takes place in a ruined castle, base the description on the picture that you are using. 

                    If your uploaded picture of an Orc King is using an enormous club, have him use a greatclub in the game.

                ○ If you are hosting a game with players you do not know that well feel free to simply remove players that refuse to follow the guidelines.

                ○ If a player repeatedly causes problems, do not invite them back.

                ○ Mute, sideline, or expel unruly or discourteous players after giving them fair warning.

                ○ If a player is violent, abusive, or out of control expel them immediately.

                ○ Eliminate distractions.

                ○ An incredibly detailed animated space battle wallpaper background will not help anyone immerse in a dungeon crawl gaming session.

                ○ Your barking dog sounds better when muted.

                ○ Maintain control of conversations.

                ○ Review ground rules if players are ignoring them (e.g., no excessive profanity, no bullying, no metagaming, no hogging the spotlight).

                ○ Make sure everyone understands the consequences for repeatedly violating the ground rules. A popular remedy in the Golden Age of Role-Playing Games 

                    was to smite the characters of offending players with Blue Bolts from Heaven.

                ○ Slowly escalate the consequences, ending with permanent banishment from the group. A series might follow: Remind; remind again; rebuke; ignore (mute); 

                    remove from session; remove from campaign.

                ○ Consider having a separate session if a character needs to complete a longer personal mission or quest.

                ○ To ease scheduling, consider adding such a shorter session at the end of the regular session if that is most convenient for both the Storyteller and the player.

                ○ Be careful with scheduling secondary sessions before the regular one, as this can cause problems if they run too long.

                ○ Consider having a longer break during the game where you can run a short sidebar encounter for a subset of the party.

- Audio.

                ○ Periodically check your connection.

                ○ Encourage everyone to speak up if the connection is poor or if they need something repeated.

                ○ Speak clearly, enunciate complicated words, speak up, or move closer to the microphone.

                ○ Convey mood by altering your voice and your facial expressions.

                ○ If there are technical issues, reconnecting to Wi-Fi, refreshing the browser, or rebooting the device may resolve them.

                ○ Check the chat bar from time to time.

                ○ Encourage active speakers to turn their cameras on. It is easier to understand people if you can see them talking.

                ○ Encourage players to mute when not talking if they cannot control or reduce background noise.

                ○ Do not multitask during the meeting. That cat video will still be there in two hours.

- Keep players engaged.

                ○ Provide action-based commentary and filler (e.g., “OK, I’m loading a picture of what your party sees as they reach the top of the hill. 

                    There’s a wide valley, about two miles wide, with a meandering stream, not quite a river, lazily flowing to the west.”)

                ○ Randomly ask players that have not chimed in what their characters are doing.

                ○ If the party is divided, jump back and forth between groups every round, or every couple minutes.

                ○ Monitor and reply to chats as convenient.

                ○ Avoid detailed or trivial content that is better relayed in a handout or as an image. Most players tune out during long monologues or blocks of exposition. 

                    Keep names, historical background, and setting-specific minutia to a minimum, and even then convey the information as a conversation or story.

- Handouts.

                ○ Prepare handouts in advance.

                ○ Use interesting backgrounds and unusual fonts.

                ○ Customize your images by adjusting the colors, applying filters, and merging elements of different images together.

                ○ Wikipedia, search engines, artist pages, and online museums are great sources of interesting images to use in your games.

                ○ Keep copies handy in a dedicated directory on your computer.

                ○ Load them to the cloud and post links in the chat bar.

                ○ Load images you only need briefly onto the battle map and then delete when they are no longer needed.

- Ending the session.

                ○ Stop a few minutes early instead of playing late.

                ○ If you have to pause during combat then break between rounds. Cliffhangers are a great way to end and resume sessions.

                ○ If breaking during combat, track important details between sessions (e.g., hit points remaining, spell and ability slots remaining, which characters are fighting which monsters).

                ○ If breaking outside of combat, consider allowing the party a “long rest’ between sessions to simplify bookkeeping.

                ○ If this offends your sensibilities, give the party a magic item that allows them to take a free long rest at the end of each session 

                    (e.g., Torch of Rejuvenation, Wondrous item, common. The Torch looks like a 2’ long engraved cedar rod with a bundle of linen wrapped around one end. 

                    When you hold the Torch, you can use an action to command it to light, at which time it burns indefinitely, providing bright light in a 20’ radius 

                    and dim light for an additional 20’; a similar action will extinguish the Torch. The Torch can be lit or extinguished without limitation and will burn forever. 

                    Additionally, when used at the end of a game session, all friendly creatures within the radius of its bright light immediately gain the benefits of a long rest. 

                    Except as noted above, the Torch acts as a normal torch.

## Wrapping Up the Session
**Wrapping Up the Session**

- If appropriate, award experience at the end of the session and let players level up. Most of this can be handled off-line and independently, but players should let the Storyteller know if they are planning something unusual (e.g., multiclassing).
- The end of the session is a great opportunity for the Storyteller to get feedback. Did the game move quickly enough? Was anything particularly memorable? Too offensive? Too easy? Too hard?
- Feedback should be aimed at improving future games, not criticizing past actions.
- Consider posting a brief summary of the game, either by email or on a website.
- This can be delegated to a player, or players in rotation. Having the player write from their character’s point of view is particularly effective.
- The Storyteller can optionally edit the summary to correct errors (spelling, setting details).
- Before you log-off, schedule the next session, at least tentatively.
- Check on players that missed the session or dropped off unexpectedly.
- Encourage players to email additional suggestions.

## Lexicon
**Lexicon**

This brief lexicon defines some new terminology and provides context on Speed Round’s use of existing terminology (e.g., players). Terms defined in the Lexicon are bolded in this section.

Characters: Characters are the avatars of the players. Fabia the Wizard (Amanda), Abdera the Fighter (Brenda), Anodios the Cleric (Mike), and Deianeira the Rogue (Penny) are the characters of the aforementioned players.

**Combat:** In Speed Round, combat covers traditional encounters of clashing opponents. Mechanically complex non-combat situations where the timing of character and monster actions can influence the outcome of the game, and conditions where players disagree with each other about the timing of non-combat actions.

Speed Round continues the tradition of representing combat as a cycle of rounds and turns. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

**Companions:** Companions are long-term NPCs that help the player characters. The type of support is typically dependent on their abilities. Players often guide the actions of companions, although Storytellers may take control of companions when they see the need. Chaz, a Satyr druid, is the party’s companion. His actions are typically controlled by Mike; Octavius occasionally vetoes actions that contradict Chaz’s personality.

**Friendly Monsters:** Friendly monsters are monsters that assist the characters.

**Mechanics:** Mechanics refers to specific rules, often accompanied by die rolls with their associated calculated modifiers. The aim of Speed Round is to speed up the mechanical actions of the Storyteller.

**Monsters:** Monsters are the forces that oppose or hinder the desires of the characters. Monsters include all types of opposition, regardless of form (e.g., human, dragon, swarm, slime). Some monsters are also non-player characters.

**Non-Player Characters (NPC):** Non-player characters are intelligent personalities, not affiliated with the characters, that are controlled by the Storyteller. These NPCs can be friendly (e.g., a quest-giving patron), neutral (e.g., the shopkeeper selling merchandise), or hostile (e.g., a bandit). They have the potential for significant interaction outside of combat and often are named. In Speed Round, every NPC is a monster, but not every monster is an NPC.

**Opponent:** The target of an attack.

**Players:** The players are the people who direct the actions of their characters. If companions are present, players often guide their actions. Amanda, Brenda, Mike, and Penny are the players in our examples.

**Storyteller:** The Storyteller is the game’s referee. The Storyteller prepares adventures, describes situations, interprets the rules, and judges the outcomes of actions. The Storyteller controls the actions of monsters. In some situations, the Storyteller may also control the actions of companions. Octavius is the Storyteller in our examples.
