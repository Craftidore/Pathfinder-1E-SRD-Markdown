# 4a - Grandmother Baba Yaga and Her Daughters
## Overview
**Grandmother Baba Yaga and Her Daughters**

There are many tales of the bony-legged fey witch Baba Yaga, and most of them contradict each other. It’s hard to get a sense of Baba Yaga, and one suspects that’s exactly what she wants. Indeed, little ever happens anywhere that isn’t exactly as she desires. As convoluted and dark a mystery as Baba Yaga is, bits of her story rise to the surface and provide more truth than the rest, like foam on a bubbling stew.

Baba Yaga is a trader of secrets. It’s said there’s nothing she does not know. The brave, the desperate, and the stupid make pilgrimages to seek her wisdom, but she is rarely found when she doesn’t want to be. Those who find her regret it when she attempts to force them into her service—as a beast of burden or common tool—or eats them, having developed a taste for mortal flesh. Rarely, though, she seeks out those in most need of her assistance, when it serves her purposes as well.

For those who can trick her out of her impossible secrets and escape her whims, all knowledge is within reach. Grandmother makes it her business to know everything: the last thoughts of the dying star Tovaya while in its death throes; the directions to Buyan, the mystical island of the dead; the life and times of the Forgotten Queen and why she was erased from history; the Words of Unfounding that can never be unspoken and that would unseat the gods; the true names of every creature never born; the secret network of byways that cross reality; and the circumstances that bring an end to the world.

For a dangerously high price, Grandmother will part with her knowledge. The price might be a first kiss, a final breath, a forgotten artifact, or an impossible wager that forces the seeker to attempt a task with no real possibility of success. Those rare individuals who make their way past these trials and gain her secrets survive in tales. Those with knowledge she desires have a rare sway over her, since she will offer much to own it—though it’s still best not to push her too far, since she’s not one to ever forget a slight. Grandmother does not stoop to haggling.

All the mortal kings, the lords of heaven and hell, and the gods themselves leave Grandmother alone out of fear. Her secrets could unravel the skein of the world—or so she claims, and it is in her interest to make others believe it. She is content with all her knowledge, but she will gladly demolish those foolish enough to test her. Many have been erased from history for their wasted efforts to best her. She is the consummate schemer, a hundred steps ahead of the opposition with contingencies in place for even the most outlandish of possibilities. The wise let her be. The foolish seek out her hut.

### The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga
**The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga**

Grandmother and her daughters live in remarkable dwellings that appear as small log huts with stone chimneys—and enormous chicken legs. Grandmother’s hut is the largest of these, said to contain 20 or 40 rooms, an entire mansion of kitchens, cages, and kettles to please the crone’s vile heart. Her hut is incredibly difficult to find for those who don’t know how to look, and it constantly shifts its location. It permits entry only to those who address it politely.

Her daughters’ huts are newer and smaller, their legs only the height of a horse. Even they contain a half-dozen rooms and comfortable lodgings for the winter or summer, complete with cellar and feather beds.

The dancing huts travel when commanded by their owners, down from the Cloudwall Mountain valleys, across the Rothenian Plain, though the deepest glades of the Margreve, or along the banks of the River Tanais. The huts have even been sighted in the North, among the Riphean Mountains near the halls of the frost giants.

The huts are not combatants, though they strike back hard when attacked (make an attack with the same BAB and damage as the attacker). They run with a base speed of 50 feet and can cross deep rivers and lakes with little effort.

### The Many Faces of Baba Yaga
**The Many Faces of Baba Yaga**

Baba Yaga’s dealings are frankly odd. She appears in many places at once, seemingly everywhere when one knows how to look, as if there were more than one crone of the same name.

Indeed, she often mentions her sisters; apparently, they all happen to be identical twins and respond to the same name.

There is little evidence to either support or contradict the claim. However, some interesting—or possibly nonsensical—theories have developed. Because of their identical appearance and the fact that they are never seen together, some suspect that all appearances by Baba Yaga might be the same creature—that Baba Yaga truly is unique, but thrives in multiplicity. The “sisters” could be clones of the original, set in place as elaborate vessels for a contingency against her own death, either to receive her dying memories or to relieve the burden of so much terrible knowledge in a single crone’s head.

It might also be that some of her “sisters” are echoes of Baba Yaga in time. The normal barriers of time are nothing to one such as her, and that might be the secret of how she can collect so much impossible knowledge. The sisters could be versions of herself in the past or in the future. This would explain why she sometimes knows visitors without previously meeting them, and why she might not remember those who have visited her frequently.

### The Daughters of Baba Yaga

Occasionally Baba Yaga is found with her daughters, the beautiful fey known as veela. Although there is no apparent record of the crone’s life, it seems unlikely that she descends from veela stock. Typically, veela do not age, staying beautiful forever. Veela do not have children, so it seems unlikely that they should truly be her daughters. Nevertheless, Baba Yaga treats them with a tenderness that she shows no one else. Perhaps they are victims of Baba Yaga’s wicked whims, or perhaps they are being prepared as her replacements. One of them, Eldara, is a particular favorite of the Despot of the Ruby Sea; others are seen more commonly in the Margreve forest, in the Magdar palace, or dining with the tsar of Vidim.

The daughters are not of a single mind. Some of these veela have assisted Baba Yaga in devouring guests and some have taken pity on travelers and helped them escape. Some of them have witch’s huts of their own, though rarely as well appointed or as well warded and enchanted as Grandmother’s hut.

### The Victims of Baba Yaga

Those guests who don’t escape or aren’t eaten are typically transformed into animals or utensils, maintaining their intelligence and memories. They serve her to the best of their abilities, but they are still angry with the crone and assist guests as much as they can to spite her.

**Koschei the Deathless**

Through trickery or persuasion, Baba Yaga has gained many powerful allies—whether unwilling or unwitting, it makes no difference to her as long as they serve her interests. Most important among them is Koschei the Deathless. This dreaded figure’s origin is lost to time. His defenders claim his descent from the living to his current state was one of tragedy and betrayal, painting him as a sad victim; others, less generous, believe his wickedness as a living creature was his downfall and the fuel for his vile transformation. Whatever the cause, Koschei is eternal. Most believe his soul is embedded within an egg hidden in a duck nestled within a hare that rests within a goat. Only the destruction of that egg will allow Koschei’s destruction.

The goat in question was supposedly tied to a great oak on the fabled island of Buyan (see page 223), but it is believed that Baba Yaga currently controls the goat and therefore the egg, and whosoever controls the egg also controls Koschei. He has no love for the crone and would prefer his freedom, but he obeys her commands unquestioningly. He does not know where the goat is, and it is unclear whether he could take possession of it even if he could find it.

Koschei is a gaunt and pallid version of the man he was in life, and he rides an equally gaunt black mare. His wretched appearance and calm demeanor belie his incredible power. He is an incarnation of death, some say an avatar or herald of Chernovog or Perun, and few can withstand his onslaught when he wades into battle on his steed, betraying a glimmer of satisfaction and enjoyment in the slaughter.

Despite its emaciated appearance, his intelligent steed is among the fastest in the multiverse and appears to be bonded to Koschei, apparently sharing his fate.

### Magic on the Plains
**Magic on the Plains**

Baba Yaga and Koschei both command deep magic of a kind rarely seen outside Bemmean archmagery at its height. Grandmother Yaga and Koschei the Deathless can summon strong ley line effects (see page 19) at will as a swift action 3 times per day, and do so to strengthen their position whenever threatened by rude or hostile visitors. These knotted leylines usually appear in conjunction with a coruscation of lights, somewhat like the Northern lights. For this reason, many sites across the steppes are marked with small stone cairns. Some of these are tombs and monuments, but others are markers for ley line groundings.

Baba Yaga’s daughters, the veela, are found roaming far and wide on the plains, usually seeking ingredients and information for their mother. They question dragons, they cast geases on adventurers, and they call up shadow roads with incantations and the sacrifice of animals that—technically—belong to someone else. The motion of the Northern lights is said to foretell Baba Yaga’s arrival, or that of her daughters.
