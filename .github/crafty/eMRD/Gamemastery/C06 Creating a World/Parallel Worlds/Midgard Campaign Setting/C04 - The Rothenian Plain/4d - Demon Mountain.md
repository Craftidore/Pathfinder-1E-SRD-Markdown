# 4d - Demon Mountain
## Overview
*“So we agree? You give me your daughter and I send my pets to help you in your war, milord?” A smile played on his lips as the fiend caressed the horns on his forehead. “Excellent!”*

The tall, lonely mountain south of the Wormwood forest is a spire of gray shale and red-pink granite, a barren peak standing far from the Cloudwall Mountains and topped with snow or clouds. It is a crucial landmark in the plains, and yet it seems not to belong there at all. And indeed, the Demon Mountain is a creation of magical forces and demonic will. When the Master found the conjoining ley lines at the mountain 600 years ago, he was intrigued. The place was filled with dark and demonic energies. The tsar of Vidim considered it a wasteland, a hellish blight on his—admittedly distant—southern borders. If the Master could tame it, it was his.

The sorcerer wasted no time. He summoned and bound a demonic legion and immediately staked his claim. The tsar was delighted: at last, someone had tamed the blight. The tsar gave the Master his daughter’s hand in marriage in gratitude for the deed of commanding and controlling the demons. The tsar’s daughter, Stasya Markova-Yodorovic, was a woman of virtue and tranquility. She bore the Master a daughter and a son, and then died in childbirth. After that, the incidents of demon raiding grew more frequent, and the tsar was no longer as fond of his former son-in-law.

Though the marriage had ended, the Master’s claim to the mountain’s eldritch power did not. The Master’s spells and incantations carry great potency. The demons praise him, and he has mated with more than a few. His many children are tiefling ambassadors to the world, heralds of his power—and extortionists as well.

The Master of Demon Mountain remains a figure of legend as well as a political force. But wielding worldly power and extending his influence is merely an entertaining game for him. His real goal is to reach immortality—although first he must break the pacts binding him to Demon Mountain. The pacts the Master swore to gain power over the mountain and its creatures are not the endless font of power that he had hoped. Indeed, he rarely leaves the mountain, and his children suspect he does not truly command it. Instead, the mountain commands him to bring it reagents and perform certain rituals, as demanded by demonic messengers, dreams, or priests of Chernovog. Even a gnome emissary showed up once, demanding that his wishes be met in the mountain’s name. The Master made certain that gnome never left the mountain, but the power he draws from it comes with requirements that he hardly expected.

The Master has heard from oracles that he could break his chains by marrying a bride who would bear him a son untarnished by his demonic blood—but this son must be sacrificed to the Eleven Hells. So far many of the Master’s children are tainted, but the Master has found a new promising target in Irina, the beautiful daughter of the tsar of Vidim. Indeed, he has grown obsessed with Irina recently and plots to win her over.

## The Mountain's Mystery
**The Mountain’s Mystery**

The mountain is known as Dontrona Mountain to the Perunians, Sable Mountain to the gnomes, and Demon Mountain to the tsar of Vidim and all this people. It has always been a place of haunts and superstitions, and Rothenian travelers avoid it. Some believe it is a gateway directly to the Eleven Hells, or that it was Chernovog’s home in the mortal world, and that witches, demons, and dragons haunt its every gorge and crag. In fact, its slopes do hold several small shrines to the dark gods, and a small ruined castle as well. What befell the people who lived on the mountain before the Master’s arrival is unknown.

## The Master Himself
**The Master Himself**

The Master of Demon Mountain fled the ruins of Vael Turog hundreds of years ago and came to the mountain with little but his wits. Things changed quickly, and now his Castle Dontrona atop the sable mountain is black and gloomy, raised overnight by magic. At one time it is said he even had a bride, Stasya, a gentle priestess of Lada who showed kindness and mercy.

The Master has ruled for so long that the people of the Plains have largely forgotten his name. Out of fear or dread of drawing his attention, instead they refer to him as “the Master” or “the Sorcerer” when occasion demands they speak of him at all. The Master is a tiefling summoner, over 7 feet tall with handsome features, a fine beard, bright green eyes, and black horns. He wears a polished iron mask with accents of gold and mithral; some believe it provides true seeing or the ability to see into a visitor’s heart (discern lies and know alignment). Other believe it is an aspect of his eidolon, or a mocking phylactery or artifact.

The Master is a creature of lascivious appetites and the father of dozens of tieflings (see “Children of Demon Mountain” below), and his family is a source of great pride to him. They are the foundation of an empire, and his brood is loyal and as ambitious as their father. They serve him ably as his eyes, ears, and hands in distant corners of the world, since the Master seems unable or unwilling to leave his lofty castle. Instead, he sends his envoys to forge alliances through marriages or arcane trades, and then wander home along the shadow roads.

In distant courts, the Master is known by the name he used in Vael Turog: Roggero Lucar Ordontrona, or sometimes an even older name, Gardever the Archmage of Vael Turog. He claims to be the last living scion of the noble bloodline of Vael Turog, and his children will carry on the title. True or an empty boast, he acts like a king. His lust for power drives him on, to ally with the Bemmeans, to offer arcana to the Dragon Empire, and to seek the hand of the tsar’s comely daughters. His depravity simmers beneath an affected veneer of civility.

An expert demon binder, the Master’s power is terrifying even at a distance. His eidolon manifests like no other, a looming disembodied iron mask called Baelmourn, used as his emissary when niceties are abandoned. The mages of Allain warn that this is his true face.

## Children of Demon Mountain
**Children of Demon Mountain**

The Master of the Mountain might have more children than those noted below, but he never reveals their presence to the world until they reach the age of 17. These are his children by his late wife, various demons, a spitfire Capleon concubine named Iana Zaccaro, and a Zobeck courtesan named Eronika Frazo. All these children hold considerable power over the demons of the mountain and the Master’s affairs.

**Zhenya “Blue-Mantle” Yodorovic (LG female tiefling cleric 9 \[Khors]):** Many wonder why this young woman is still alive, because the Master’s eldest child is a sworn enemy of the devils, demons, and evil spirits that prowl the mountain’s flanks and plains. Her father loves her because she resembles her mother so closely, and he cannot bring himself to cast his eldest child out of the family. She is a remarkably effective ambassador to those who doubt the Master’s motives. Zhenya has a legitimate claim to the throne of Vidim, one she has never pressed.

**Reafen Yodorovic (LE male tiefling fighter 10):** Second eldest Reafen is a hulking figure, with coarse black hair over most of his forearms. This youth is much larger than his kin, who assume his strength means a lack of wit. He feigns ignorance to those who consider him a pawn rather than likely heir.

**Lo’dain the Lithe (CE male tiefling cleric 8 \[Chernovog]):** Third scheming child of the Master and the first born of a succubus, this stick of a man looks frail but has a shrewd and cunning mind. He vies for power, having raised seven daughters of his own, each of whom he intends to send into a major city, extending his father’s reach and likely his own.

**Blinx the Clever (LE female tiefling rogue 8):** Always surrounded by at least 20 cats, Blinx is said to see through their eyes and relish their kills. She has a disconcerting habit of licking visitors when introduced, and she loves flowers and fresh blood. She gets along famously with Stasya, except when they hate each other and attempt elaborate physical or character assassinations against each other.

**Stasya, the Horned Raven (NE female tiefling rogue 7):** Named for the Master’s dead wife, Stasya is a talented cat-burglar who steals precious tomes for her notorious father. Guards usually only catch glimpses of her diminutive black horns and loose dark hair. She runs with a crew of huginn from Vidim, who are her spies and lookouts.

**Cyllene Zaccaro (CN female tiefling rogue 4/fighter 6):** Watched over by her living black cutlass Ebonscour, this surprisingly human-looking daughter is the first of the Master’s children by Iana Zaccaro, the Capleon corsair. She is a fixer, enforcer, and cleaner in her father’s service, and her authority extends everywhere but the bridal suite. She spends most of her time in the Seven Cities, gathering favors and making interesting friends.

**Elizaveta Zaccaro, the Red Daughter (CE female tiefling sorcerer 6):** The second youngest child, spoiled and strong, Elizaveta is an independent lady and one of the most ill-tempered women ever to roam the Rothenian Plain. She fights beside the Khazzaki and centaurs, who have nicknamed her Red Death. She has recently been seen in Reth-Saal organizing fast caravans of Rubeshi and tiefling riders.

**Ulfer Tarrick Frazo (NE male tiefling magus 10):** The baby of the family was born to the Zobeck courtesan Eronika Frazo, and when he grew up he married the plump daughter of a wealthy Zobeck wine merchant. As an ambassador and man of means, Ulfer has expanded the family business, selling wine all over Midgard and building a vast trading and spy network in the process. He is a rival to Blinx and a friend to Stasya.

## A Visit with the Master of Demon Mountain
**A Visit with the Master of Demon Mountain**

Visiting Demon Mountain is not as frightening as it might first seem. The Master receives visitors from the earliest snowmelt to late autumn, though few visitors are expected in the winter months, when the mountain is under 30 or 40 feet of snow. Flying guests are expected to land outside the fortress walls at a clearing kept open for that purpose, and walking guests have a clearly marked pathway of stone skulls to follow to the keep.

At the gate, titles are expected and announced (any visitor with a Status of less than 20 will be turned away at the door). Word is sent to the Master of unexpected visitors, who are permitted in if they are smooth-tongued enough (Diplomacy DC 30 or Bluff DC 40 for drop-ins). Those who pass through the demon-guarded gates are given chambers suited to their state and titles, demonic or human servants to fetch and carry, and fresh clothes and wine.

The guests are kept waiting until the Master’s dinner hour, and then can try to make an impression on him, 1d6 of his children, and the various visiting dignitaries who flow through the great hall: the heralds and lieutenants of major demon lords, mages of Bemmea, barons or knights of the shadow fey, minor huginn bandits from Vidim, Rubeshi captains of the Despotate, troll kings from the North, Mharoti priests of Baal, and veven Dukes of Hell have been known to visit.

Over an evening meal, the Master displays his command of the local demonic forces and ley lines, and sometimes projects his spirit to make the entire mountain speak and shudder. Those who have petitions for him are sometimes answered over wine and rich caviar, and sometimes are told to climb to the mountaintop for their reply (where they are either carried away by a two-headed roc or are given an offer by a pact drake—if their fingers are not too numb to sign).

## Adventures on Demon Mountain
**Adventures on Demon Mountain**

Adventures on the mountain involve demons, rites, and strange intrigues among the Master’s offspring.

- A gilded invitation is delivered to a rogue, fighter, or tiefling in the party, asking them to visit Demon Mountain. Once arrived, the PCs are offered a pile of magical treasure, if only they will go fetch something incredibly rare (a phoenix egg, an angel’s caul, a *ring of wishes* or a valkyrie’s spear) from someplace incredibly dangerous (a roc’s nest, an angel’s perch, a dwarven vault, or the Storm Court of Valhalla).
- The Master of Demon Mountain personally sends a gilded invitation to a good-aligned female human character. His intentions are honorable: he wishes to woo and marry her, but does not mention this fact until after she arrives.
- The Master sends crag drakes, lesser demons, and tiefling raiders against all nomads and nearby towns until his demands are met. He wishes a bridge delivered to his mountain, immediately.
