# 3a2c - The Kobold Ghetto
## Overview
**The Kobold Ghetto**

The Kobold Ghetto, a warren of streets no more than 6 feet wide (at best), lies between the Argent and Derry rivers. Throughout most of the Ghetto, roofs meet overhead to keep out the worst of the sun for the nocturnal inhabitants who must venture out during daylight. The Ghetto has only two entrances, the Ghetto Gate and the Water Gate, each carefully watched from both sides. Multiple kobold “kings” or tribal chieftains rule the district, each of which has power as long as he keeps his relatives and minions in line. One king, the King of Kings, holds the others in check until their united strength undercuts him. King Kuromak recently ousted Brandorek, the 12th of that name, to claim the leading position. Few kings last more than a decade. Some barely last a year.

More than 80 years ago, the kobolds were slaves to House Stross, and the Ghetto was their pen. They were chattel used by the family to do the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs so that humans and dwarves could work at finer crafts and live comfortably. Kobold slaves mined silver, built clever clockworks, and worked deadly steam boilers for the constructs and automatons that fueled Zobeck’s industry. History largely ignored them, but some believe the kobolds helped invent the everwound spring, the aeolipile generator (a steam engine used in places where water or muscle power won’t suit), and the reciprocating balance wheel, thus laying the foundations for Zobeck’s fame. These centuries of enslavement form an indelible part of the kobolds’ culture, and despite their (relatively) short lives, no kobold in Zobeck has ever forgotten the indignity.

Now, the Ghetto is a place of free kobolds, the legal equal of any man or woman of the Clockwork City. They remain a people apart, however, physically, culturally, and habitually. The single biggest obstacle is their nocturnal nature. Kobolds labor all night and return home before dawn to spend the day in sleep and rest before venturing back out shortly before sunset.
