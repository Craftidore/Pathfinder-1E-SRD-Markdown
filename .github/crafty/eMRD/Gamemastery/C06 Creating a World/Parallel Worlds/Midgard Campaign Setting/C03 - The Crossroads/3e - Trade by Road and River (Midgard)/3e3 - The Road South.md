# 3e3 - The Road South
## Overview
**The Road South**

The Magdar Kingdom is a reasonably stable kingdom of insanely ambitious and scheming barons, dukes, and bastard princes. They all spend their time vying for the kingdom’s Eagle Crown, and the Magdar have at times had as many as 12 Immortal Kings within 18 months. Their politicking and scheming partially relies on the trade flowing through their kingdom, since they spend their tariffs and tolls to import the rarest poisons and the priciest assassins.

Goods reach the Magdar Kingdom in oxcarts, meaning they might travel 12 miles on a good day. Though glacially slow, this method has at least two good points to recommend it: Oxen are cheap and pull efficiently, and ox carts can be circled for protection each night. The latter’s importance cannot be overstated. The White Mountain Marches contain nothing but a nest of robbers, and the raiders from the Mharoti Empire are patient and vicious. The third unspoken benefit of this system is its reduced personnel cost and plentiful opportunities for advancement: half the guard company will likely die before reaching Harkesh.
