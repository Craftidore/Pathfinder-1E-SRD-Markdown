# 3d1 - School of Clockwork Magic
## Overview
**School of Clockwork Magic**

Stories claim the magic of clockwork is derived from a divine gift, since the weaver goddess who became Rava of the Gears granted knowledge of these devices and automatons to one of her earliest followers. Others say that the arcane power of clockwork magic was discovered by an artificer who harnessed steam and gearwork to build the first device and animated it with primitive enchantments.

Regardless of the murky origins of their power, Clockwork Mages are clearly masters of time manipulation, constructs, and mechanical devices of various kinds. Their school thrives in areas rich in automatons, golems, and other constructs. Their relatively few spells display a wide range of styles.

The Clockwork Mages possess an eye for mechanisms, springs, gearing, and balanced forces. Non-mages have difficulty distinguishing them from gear grinders and clockworkers, though they wear better clothing, and their tools include wands as well as hammers and loupes. Clockwork Mages can build clockwork familiars using the Improved Familiar feat. Use the clockwork template from the Advanced Bestiary from Green Ronin to generate the resulting creature (typically a normal familiar, although sometimes a hunting dog, an eagle, or even a winged monkey).
