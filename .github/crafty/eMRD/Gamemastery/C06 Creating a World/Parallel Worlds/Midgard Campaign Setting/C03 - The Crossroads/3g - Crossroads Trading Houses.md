# 3g - Crossroads Trading Houses
## Overview
**Crossroads Trading Houses**

Dozens or hundreds of trading houses clog the roads with mule trains and the rivers with barges. Some are more successful than others, and most are quite specialized on certain routes or goods.

**Charon’s Chosen:** Entirely a barge-driven trade company, the secret of Charon’s Chosen is its close ties to the priesthood of St. Charon and its ability to travel between rivers on the shadow roads. The company trades in extremely expensive goods for wizards and alchemists, plus a few specialty items such as requiem smuggling and enchanted ringwork from the Northlands. Its leader is His Dark Magnificent Pontifex Umbaros Lexti of Trombei (male human cleric 9 \[St. Charon]). The company barges are a distinctive black with red and blue trim.

**Cutlasses and Cutlery Trading Company:** This trading company deals in blades of all kinds, and one can buy daggers, razors, swords, sickles, and scythes from these itinerant dealers. These merchants also buy unique or rare blades from foreign countries, so it isn’t unusual to find a katana, khopesh, seax, or other curiosity in a wagon’s inventory. The Cutlasses and Cutlery’s base is a series of warehouses located near the Duchy of Perun’s Daughter’s capital, which is operated mostly by women, many of them doubling as guards. Branka Kolchak (female human expert 4/fighter 7), a famous swordswoman in her mid-forties, heads the company.

**Hammerfell Wagon Company:** Largest and most ruthless of the cantonal mule train and merchant wagon companies, the Hammerfell wagons deal in iron and copper ingots, mountain ash and yew, excellent chisels and hammers—and weapons for the Septime wars. Their wares compete with those of Melana and are preferred by dwarven mercenary companies. The company is led by a married couple, Crishy and Vodolf Vikkelsheide, both followers of Volund the Wayfarer and astute observers of the Crossroads markets.

**House Greymark:** The largest and wealthiest trading company of the Free City of Zobeck, House Greymark has wide and varied interests. It trades primarily in leather, wool, apples, ale, clockwork items, amber, and silver. Rumors of less savory business interests (in Rubeshi slaves, Margreve timber and mandrake, and items from the Shadow Realm) are relatively common; those who ask too many questions find their business rarely prospers.

**House Maillon:** Alchemical materials, perfumes from Bourgund, and all the inks, parchment, and fine quills of the Bemmean heartland. House Maillon brings these and more to Friula, Neimheim, and even as far as Harkesh and Reth-Saal. The goods are usually moved in caravans through the Goblin Wastes, though a few travel by water on the Bemmean Galley to Triolo. House Maillon is said to include werewolves among the guards for its shipments, though whether this is true or a ruse to scare off bandits is not clear.

**Mavrite Forge Works:** Founded by a coalition of cantonal dwarves and Zobecker merchants, this trading company specializes in the construction and dissemination of the tools of warfare. If you want quality swords, shields, axes, spears and catapults at reasonable wholesale prices, these are the helpful folks you want to see. Trading from the Reaver Coast to the Seven Cities and the Wasted West, even to Nuria Natal and beyond, this group of merchants will sell to anyone and smile as they take your money. Their rivals say the Mavrite Forge merchants retain spies and agent provocateurs to start small wars so they can sell weapons to both sides. The Mavrite merchants deny it with their trademark smiles, and would you like a small discount on armor to show our goodwill?

**Steel’s Coaches:** This small band possesses a dozen armored carriages drawn by teams of eight horses dressed in full-plate barding. Each carriage tows a gigantic silken kite, which is equipped to carry a single lookout that observes the road, the carriage’s immediate surroundings, and the sky as well. These armored equipages solely transport valuables and important personages, the rate fixed at 15 gp per mile traveled. The drivers and footmen alike are clad in heavy armor and proficient with all crossbows. The lookout is generally a spellcaster or rogue, who disdains such cumbersome protection. An enigmatic female fighter known as Steel controls this peculiar Perunalian company.

**Winged Lion Company:** The first among a dozen shipping companies based in Triolo, the Winged Lions send some mule and wagon trains to Illyria, Melana, and Zobeck, but the bulk of its work is shipped across the Middle Sea to and from Nuria Natal, the Mharoti Empire, Kyprion, Capleon, and as far as Barsella, Maillon, and Bemmea. Its most common cargoes include wheat, oats, wine, olive oil, and other bulk goods, but it also carries livestock, rare spices, salt fish, and cloth. Its current leader is Commodore Ondreas Borelli (male human rogue 7).
