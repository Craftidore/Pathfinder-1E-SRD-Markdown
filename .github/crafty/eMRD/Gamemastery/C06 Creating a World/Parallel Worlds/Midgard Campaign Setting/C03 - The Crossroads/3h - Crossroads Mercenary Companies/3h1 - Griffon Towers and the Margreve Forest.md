# 3h1 - Griffon Towers and the Margreve Forest
## Overview
**Griffon Towers and the Margreve Forest**

The Margreve forest is an ancient place, already old when most of the gods were young. In time immemorial, it cradled the great spirits of nature, and its loam felt the footfalls of the old ones. As millennia passed, its roots swallowed rivers, its canopy stole the sun from vast tracts of land, and its groves crested mountains that have since weathered to hills.

In all that time, the Margreve has changed little. History transpires around it, lapping at its edges like the sea at the shore, but never truly invading. Though kingdoms rise and fall beyond its borders, the Margreve remains a world apart—a place where memories and old magic linger in the rings of trees and where new ideas and ways never take root.

A strange realm that lives by its own rules, the Margreve harbors wonders and horrors in equal measure. Those few regions men know well have an evil reputation, not worth risking to gain the potential rewards. Every year, however, a few brave souls decide to ignore the old stories and cautionary tales. Most never return.

Long the private property of House Stross, the Margreve forest retains a certain hushed atmosphere of wild decay and noble privilege. Travelers go quietly through the deepest woods, seeking to avoid throat-slitting bandits, howling barghests, and even kobolds bitterly defending their secret mines.

At the same time, the untamed regions of the Margreve call to Zobeckers’ lust for wealth. The forest provides the timber that builds its barges, fuels its smithies, and braces its silver mines. The noise of kobold miners, timber-cutters, and merchants rumbling along the Great Northern Road grows each year. Silence returns only in winter. The road brings goods from cities of the Red Queen, the undead princes of Morgau and Doresh, and the Bemmean Magocracy to the banks of the Argent. Maintaining the connection between this route and the river makes Zobeck half its fortune as a trade center. Naturally, castles and towers defend the road.

The most famous of these are the dozen Griffon Towers. Eight of them stand on the road, and the others guard hunting lodges, mines, or powerful wellsprings of magic. Most people assume that they earned their name from the griffon blazons carved in their walls, but that was merely the mark of the Stross border guards.

House Stross built the towers for its griffon riders, an elite company of couriers and shock cavalry, and each served as stables, roosts, and shelters for the animals and their riders. The parsimonious council of the Free City does not pay to maintain these outposts any longer and keeps its own Griffon Knights closer to home.

Now the Margreve griffons run wild. They come in both black and speckled varieties, and knowing the difference is important. The black griffons are more aggressive and fond of horseflesh; some claim they are fey steeds. The speckled ones are shy, tamable, and can serve as animal companions to suitable heroes.
