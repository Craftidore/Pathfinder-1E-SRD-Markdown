# 3p - The Principalities of Morgau and Doresh
## Overview
**The Principalities of Morgau and Doresh**

The masters of Morgau and Doresh are exclusively ghouls, vampires, and other intelligent undead. Their cold hands control a nightmare realm where peasants suffer without hope or sanctuary. The Imperial Principalities fight against all their neighbors from time to time: Krakova in the north, the Rothenian Plains and even Rubyat to the east, the Ironcrag cantons to the southwest, and Zobeck to the south.

The rulers of Morgau and Doresh rightly believe themselves surrounded by a sea of enemies. Any one of these foes they could dispatch in short order, but the combined alliances against the undead nobles means the undead hold the passes when they must and raid the lowlands with fire and sword whenever they can. Morgau and Doresh draw special hatred for their tendency to wage winter wars and to fight by night, since neither condition bothers their undead soldiers but plays to the Principalities’ strengths.

For the most part, the wars remain small: holding a village for a season, despoiling a graveyard for new troops, laying waste to crops, or turning a tenacious enemy’s daughter into a ghoul or vampiric spawn. The Principalities do not wish to make friends, only to terrify their neighbors and dissuade them from denying their undead sovereignty. 

Equally as important, raids and warfare keep its neighbors from spreading the seeds of rebellion among the living who suffer beneath the undying gentry. The peasants of Morgau, restless and fearful, long to shake off their masters. Despite their undeniable strength of arms, the one war the undead princes can never win is the one waged for the hearts of their people.

Most right-thinking men acknowledge that extracting taxes and enforcing laws are the price of civilization, which makes any ruling class bloodsuckers in a sense. But everyone outside the Principalities believes that the undead aristocracy’s demands for their subjects’ warm blood and cold corpses go beyond any reasonable standard. Some citizens think their undead masters’ command of death and darkness is a glorious beginning, but most living folk realize that Morgau is a place of suffering. They obey their masters and fight in their armies out of fear rather than patriotism, since doing anything else invites reprisals against their families or forced enlistment in the “bone company.”

As a result, the army is led by its officers, and its success comes from undead troops and ghoulish darakhul mercenaries. The darakhul are the true ghouls who dwell in their own lands below the earth. They are both entirely evil and among the best troops the Principalities can field. Great victories in the field, however, are secondary to the vampire princes’ desires. They wisely join together to field the best troops whenever a real threat appears. Everything else—the raids, the constant drumbeat of war, or slave taking—serves to keep the border in flux and their neighbors off balance.

## Living under Vampire Rule
**Living under Vampire Rule**

North of the Margreve, in the Imperial Principalities of Morgau and Doresh, vampires roam openly and rule proudly. Depravity, decadence, and the worship of dark gods abound. Here, the living are little more than property, drained and dispatched as the vampires see fit.

Many living slaves long for their masters to drain them of blood, so they can escape the “tortures of the living” and gain social status as vampires. Vampire masters occasionally grant such rewards. If the slave is clever, he makes some plans before he receives the death-bite, such as hiring assassins (or do-good heroes) to kill his sire after the planned death-bite. This frees the slave-turned-vampire from mental enslavement on the master’s Tree of Chains.

The Imperial Principalities frequently host hunts in its hills and forests and stages gladiatorial fights in its cities. In these spectacles, living combatants clash, and vampires cheer and salivate at the blood that sprays into the stands. This foreplay lasts for hours before culminating in a vampire’s blood drain of the winner and the lucky winner’s rise into the ruling class.

Once a year, tradition demands that a vampire elder free the winner rather than kill him. An arcane tattoo forever marks the champion and grants him perpetual freedom from all vampire predation. One of these lucky souls recently emigrated to the Free City of Zobeck where he runs a gladitorial pit under the Kobold Ghetto.

## Prince Lucan
**Prince Lucan**

Lucan, known as the First Prince or the Shroud-eater, is the current ruler of the Principalities of Morgau and Doresh, having usurped the kingdom from its former ruler. Soon after the Rubyat-born Lucan arrived in the Principalities some 300 years ago, he became the right-hand man (and possibly lover) of the ruling prince. Shortly thereafter, the priests of Lada the Golden Goddess sickened and died. Then the priests of the Green Gods fled into the forests, where they were hunted down, and the land’s prince disappeared. Later, many of the court nobles became nocturnal servants of their new Eastern prince.

Within a year of his arrival, Prince Lucan had utterly and completely taken control of the Principalities, and any who questioned the old prince’s whereabouts found themselves exiled to the least desirable fiefdoms and given the most grueling or expensive tasks.

## The Red Goddess
**The Red Goddess**

During Lucan’s usurpation, the worship of Marena spread throughout the Principalities. All the nobles took up her worship, though some retained their fondness for St. Charon or the goddess’ husband Mavros, the War God. In time, the common people embraced her, whether they feared her aspect as the goddess of death and respected or leered over her aspect as a goddess of lust and fertility.

All the cities and villages of the Principalities are now devoted to the Red Goddess, and all other deities are second to her in importance. Worship is frequent and public; offerings are loud and messy. Every village of any size at all has at least a small blood-stained altar stone, and her name is invoked at every birth, funeral, and battle.

Marena’s main temples include the Blood Priestess Sonye of the Spear’s Temple of the Scourging Goddess (in Vallanoria), where Marena’s cult of slaughter worships death and mayhem; the Home Abbey of the Red Sisters near Trollheim, where the matronly Mother Abbess Calle protects pregnant women; and the Temple of Aprostala in the Grisal Marches. At these temples reside Marena’s greatest zealots, the Flagellants of the Red Goddess and the Order of the Rosy Salvation.

## Order of the Knights Incorporeal (Ghost Knights)
**Order of the Knights Incorporeal (Ghost Knights)**

The Ghost Knights of Morgau are an interesting group: many of them are living creatures who chose to join the ranks of the undead as a method of advancement. The knights begin as living men and women, bound to the service of a vampire, necrophagus, or priestess of Marena. If they provide good service for five or 10 years, they might be “raised up” into the ranks of the undead as a foot soldier in the Ghost Knights, roughly equivalent to a squire elsewhere.

If they provide additional good service and make the transition through ghoul fever or vampiric bite without undue madness or blood frenzy, they are slowly advanced through the grades of the Order of the Red Shield. These ranks are Initiate Brother/Sister, Honest Brother/Sister, Master of Arms, Captain of Arms, General at Arms, Commander, and Grand Marshall.

Equipment for Ghost Knights is excellent, and typically includes a dappled gray or white warhorse, two lances, a red banner, a mace or longsword, and a tabard displaying the insignia of the order (a skull on a red background). Knights are expected to provide their own armor: this is leather or chain for an initiate, and a full suit of plate or better for a full knight or master.

Grand Marshall Princess Hristina oversees the order. Commander Baleneus, Hristina’s lover, commands the vital commanderies along the Great Northern Road where tolls are collected. These include the Commanderies of Valach, Bruvik, and Engerstal. He also protects the Home of the Red Abbey of the Red Sisters in the north. Commander Orkov watches over the southwest borders near Zobeck and the Ironcrags. She is responsible for the Commanderies of Walker’s Wood, the Temple of Aprostala, and Langrone.

## Blood Money
**Blood Money**

Though the basic unit of exchange in the Principalities is the silver piece, as in most places, and gold and copper coins circulate as well, the principal unit of coinage among the nobles is the blood mark, more commonly called the drop. This nickname is said to date to the minting of a particular form of red gold, which has been debased over time with silver and other metals.

The blood mark resembles a gold ring with single hole in the center, representing a pledge of one pint of blood. They are rarely collected but rather are exchanged among the nobles of the realm as a way of measuring and maintaining the supply of available human, dwarven, and other sources of blood.

When redeemed, the blood magically disappears from the person who first pledged the token (1 permanent Constitution drain). Any person foolish enough to pledge more than a single blood coin might find them all redeemed at once, since such redemptions happen at great blood feasts on special occasions. Living creatures with sufficient Constitution loss grow weak and die, and desperate peasants discover this to their sorrow at the great feasts each year.

## Bratislor
**Bratislor**

Built in the center of the most fertile fields of Morgau, Bratislor is a city of gray walls dominated by the Bratis Castle on its crag in the center of the city. The castle is entirely the domain of the undead; no living knights or servants are permitted within, though many skeletons serve the keep and a company of darakhul and imperial ghouls guards its walls.

Boasting clear access to the passes and roads and a commanding position for anyone on the Great North Road, Bratislor manages to attract most of the Elders and their spawn each year at the winter solstice, when the Prince is expected to hold court. These festivals are a time of fear for the living of Bratislor; each year, one hundred of them are invited to attend the Prince’s Feast. Each year, only one of them returns to the city, his eyes and tongue gouged out, and his or her mind shattered by having heard the words of the Elders and their plans for the realm.

## Hengksburg
**Hengksburg**

The main trade center of the realm is always bustling and free of major disruptions. Trade must flow, tolls must be paid, and most of that profit winds up here. The cult of Mammon appears here in public, though without a temple to call their own.

But even the priests of Mammon are wise enough to make their obeisance to Rodyan, Lord Mayor of the city. The Glutton’s appetite for gold and blood is exceeded only by his need for sexual release. To date, Rodyan has been married more than three hundred times—some of his wives have lacked the constitution to survive even a single night of Rodyan’s amorous advances—and little is more feared among the teenaged peasantry than to be selected for candidacy within the gentry.

The peasantry have been spared Rodyan’s attention for the past six months, however. The Mayor’s newest wife, Aliessa, has outlasted the past seventy-five women given the honor of pleasing Rodyan. The Lady Aliessa has become as feared as her husband: she uses what power is given to her by her lord to disappear any peasant foolish enough to mutter about Death’s Whore.

## Vallanoria
**Vallanoria**

The main military city of the realm is small but well organized. The  Order of Grey Knights has a great commandery here, and the Temple of the Scourging Goddess is a center of the more warlike and flagellant priestesses of the Red Goddess. The city retains close ties to the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova to the north, and its citizens are not as subdued and pliant as most of the living serfs of Morgau. Indeed, rumors of revolt are all too common—but many of these are rumors spread by informers seeking to ensnare the unwary.

The palace of Vallanow is a beautiful one, and serves as the venue for the Princes of Morgau and Doresh to celebrate the Winter Solstice each year. The invitations to this debauch are highly sought after, at least by the undead. The stench of slaughter and decay brought to the palace by its guests is said to make the living nauseous for days. Baba Yaga is said to be invited each year, but each year sends her apologies. On some occasions, Koschei the Deathless attends, always with a different young woman on his arm. Their look of shocked terror is said to amuse the Princes of Doresh to no end.

The Winter Ball is followed by a brutal round of executions, when the servants and others attempt to rise against their masters. Each year, they pray for a Krakovan army to arrive with the spring; each year they are disappointed.
