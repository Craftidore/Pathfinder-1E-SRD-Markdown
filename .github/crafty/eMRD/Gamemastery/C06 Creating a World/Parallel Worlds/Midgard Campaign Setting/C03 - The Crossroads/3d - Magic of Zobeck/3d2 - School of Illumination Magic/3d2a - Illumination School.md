# 3d2a - Illumination School
## Overview
**Illumination School**

The illuminationist focuses on the study of combining star and shadow magic.

*Insight of the Stars (Su):* The stars provide you glimpses of fate, granting you a +1 insight bonus to initiative. This bonus increases by 1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

*Orb of Light (Sp):* As a standard action, you can unleash an orb of light targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The orb of light deals 1d6 points of positive energy damage +1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

*Bend Light (Sp):* At 8th level, as a swift action, you can bend the light around your body, causing your opponents to suffer a 50% miss chance as if you had total concealment, for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions as a *displacement* spell.
