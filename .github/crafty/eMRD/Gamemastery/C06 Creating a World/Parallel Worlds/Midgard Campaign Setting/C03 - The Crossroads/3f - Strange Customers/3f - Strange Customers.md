# 3f - Strange Customers
## Overview
**Strange Customers**

Zobeckâ€™s status as the hub of the crossroads stems partly from its river and road, but also from its close ties to the fey realms, kobolds, and other peculiar merchants. Two of these less-known trading partners are the kobolds of Lillefor and the shadow fey.
