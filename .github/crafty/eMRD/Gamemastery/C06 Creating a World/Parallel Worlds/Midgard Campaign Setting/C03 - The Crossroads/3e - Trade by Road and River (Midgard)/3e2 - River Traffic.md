# 3e2 - River Traffic
## Overview
**River Traffic**

Pulling an oar is easier than marching up a mountain, but the “easy money” of floating on a barge downriver to Sveretska or the Duchy of Perun’s Daughter is not so easy that guards are tripping over one another volunteering for it. The river gods are fickle, especially in spring, and a pack of river trolls can capsize a barge no matter how heavily laden it is. Worse, the songs of the lorelei can distract a pilot, and hill giant bandits can sink a cargo with a few well-placed boulders and loot the wreck. Of course, if the cargo doesn’t go through, the guards don’t get paid.

A successful run south creates still more work when going back upriver. Guards are expected to pull at the oars. Forests crowd the riverbank for long miles, hiding bandits and worse. And the river is filled with snags, shifting sandbars, and other bargemen whose cargo might have been stolen. Some bargemen turn to banditry, pretending friendship and then turning pirate. Say what you want about the stink of a mule train, at least you won’t drown in your armor.
