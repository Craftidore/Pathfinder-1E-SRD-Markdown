# 3e - Trade by Road and River (Midgard)
## Overview
**Trade by Road and River**

The commerce of a trade city sounds glamorous and exotic: silks and spices, [[Mithral|mithral]] and magic, and relics and lore all change hands between locals, visitors, and sharp-eyed wanderers. Everything seems sweeter when minstrels sing about it—largely because they gloss over the sweat and donkey dung. But as the Crown Square merchants say, “There’s no such thing as easy money.”

## TABLE 3-4: Spring Travel Times and Costs (days on
**TABLE 3-4: Spring Travel Times and Costs (days on horseback/foot)**

Estimated travel times are listed using swift horseback and ship travel first and then travel by foot, mule train, or slow cart over generally poor roads and wilderness; more settled regions show faster travel. Estimates can vary wildly from actual time required due to prevailing winds, inclement weather, terrain, and road conditions. None of these travel times include any use of magical conveyances or deep magic such as shadow roads or fey roads.

All blue routes with a single number are largely or entirely waterborne. Sea or river travel is included to minimize time for some entries.

Assume all ship routes cost at least 5 gp/day for a single trusted passenger through safe waters, 8+ gp/day for dangerous waters. Costs rise to

triple that if also transporting a mount, and quadruple if the mount is a warhorse.
