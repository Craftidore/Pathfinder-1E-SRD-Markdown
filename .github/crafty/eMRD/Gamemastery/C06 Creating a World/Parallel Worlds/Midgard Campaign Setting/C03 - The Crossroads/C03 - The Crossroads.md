# C03 - The Crossroads
## Overview
**The Crossroads**

The Free City of Zobeck shares borders with four states: the dwarven Ironcrag cantons to the west, the undead-ruled Principalities of Morgau and Doresh to the north and east, the human kingdom of the Magdar to the south, and the female dominated Duchy of Perun’s Daughter far to the east, at the mouth of the River Argent. Together, these regions, and nearby areas like the Margreve forest, the Cloudwall Mountains, the subterranean cities of the Ghoul Imperium and Lillefor, and the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova, constitute the Crossroads of Midgard. Even the shadow fey’s Shadow Realm touches this area via the fey roads.

The regions of Midgard spin around the Crossroads region like spokes around a wheel. Everything that goes from north to south and east to west passes along the River Argent, the Sultan’s Road, the Great Northern Road, and other well-trod trade routes, all with their own difficulties and dangers. But the nations that thrive in the heartland know how to spin copper into gold and how to turn a sinking barge into a prince’s ransom. Though they borrow language, customs, tools, and even gods from all their neighbors, the Crossroads have their own code, their own pride, and their own way of doing business. Welcome to the beating heart of the world.

**Customs of the Crossroads**

The Crossroads region seems like a mishmash of cultures at times, but some customs are entirely unique to its people, including the styles of its great gatherings and its history of dwarven thralls.

**Great Gatherings**

The nations of the Crossroads traditionally gather once or more each year for great celebrations and times of judgment. These gatherings vary by national character.

**Daughter’s Feast:** On the years of her whims, the divine ruler of Perunalia invites all her people to the Daughter’s Feast at Redleaf. The feast takes place when all harvests are complete and debts are paid, and everyone is starting to prepare for the season of snows and winter raids from the Rothenian Plains. It is a last chance to hearten the people and celebrate. The Daughter’s Feast is a smaller event than some of the other gatherings due to it winter timing and the potential peril of its honored guests. It is held in a winter palace outside the city of Orkasa on an island in the River Argent.

Perun’s daughter always invites her father, the god Perun, to the feast, and sometimes he attends. On those occasions, he arrives in a flash of thunder with some of his other children, such as his son Bacca (CN male outsider demigod oracle wine 13/divine rank 0) by a Septime mother, and his youngest daughter, the centaur Fleremina Daughter (CG female outsider demigod shaman 9/divine rank 0). Both of the daughter’s half-siblings are friendly enough, but they create difficulties for their host and so the feast is not held more than every three years.

When Perun arrives with one or more of his wives (variously Marena, Lada, or Sif, depending on who you believe), things grow even stranger. In those years, the feasts are a time of madness, thunder run riot, great gifts, sudden deaths, and profound visions amid drunkenness and chaos.

**Dwarfmoot:** The Ironcrag dwarves have a reputation as staunchly independent, isolated except in matters of trade, and entirely willing to declare themselves superior to all lowlanders of any race or kind. The foes they respect most are dragons and their fellow dwarves. As a result, many of the conflicts that occupy the cantons are internal feuds within a clan or canton: a broken engagement, a conflicting mining claim, or a simple insult in a fit of drunken foolishness can be enough to stir dwarven blood to battle. The cure for this infighting is the Dwarfmoot.

Even the worst feuds rarely last more than a single year, thanks to the cantonal Dwarfmoot. During the Dwarfmoot at the spring equinox at Bundhausen, under the stones of Loccishtal, each recognized feud is brought forward to be weighed by the cantons as a whole. To continue the feud, each side must pay a feudgeld. If both sides pay, the feud continues. If neither pays, the feud ends. If one pays, the money is given to the more peaceful side at the next Dwarfmoot.

Marriages, declarations of new chieftains, mustering for raids into the lowlands, and even the launch of new trade routes or airships are all announced at the Dwarfmoot. It is the stage and forum for all matters and disputes involving status and prestige among the dwarves. The Dwarfmoot takes place within 30 days of the passes opening in the spring, and the gathering sets the tone for the following year. Dwarven alliances with free companies of mercenaries are also forged at this time.

**Kingsmeet:** The Magdar rulers King Stefanos and Queen Dorytta hold a great tournament called the Kingsmeet once each year in the month of Low Summer at the fields outside Cronepisht. It is mandatory for their vassals to attend, but it is also a show of power and chivalry, since King Stefanos invites prominent knights from Illyria, Krakova, Perunalia, Triolo, Trombei, Valera, Zobeck, and (less commonly) Bourgund, Capleon, Doresh, Morgau, or Vidim. The Kingsmeet Crown is a helmet set with a gold band and encrusted with garnets and a single shining ruby. Each year, the prior year’s champion is expected to defend his title. 

While the knights tilt and fight in the grand melee, courtships are underway, arranged marriages are solemnized in the eyes of king and queen and Khors, and ambassadors, merchants, and adventurers all find time for new opportunities. The Kingsmeet can be attended profitably by wandering souls who have never held a lance.

**Knight’s Call:** The Order of the Storm and the Order of the Undying Sun both hold knightly gatherings in Krakova at Heiderbirg, and also in Magdar at the Castle of Smoltenberg.

The less formal and more entertaining Knight’s Call is clearly that of the Order of the Storm. Valkyries, women of Perunalia, dwarves from the Northlands, and riders from Magdar all attend, as do a few elfmarked from the Grand Duchy of Dornig. They boast, they brag, they swear great oaths to undertake raids against Morgau and Doresh, or against undead holdings in the North, or to slay trolls and giants by the score. Once the ale has ceased to flow and the Storm’s Call ends, a few of these knights seek to impress their fellows by following through on their bragging. Others wisely disregard the more outrageous boasts.

## Dwarven Thralls
**Dwarven Thralls**

“Ten years under the mountain” is a common grievance among those who visit the Ironcrags against their will and survive. The dwarves ransom other dwarves for a fee in gold, but all members of all other races captured in war are held for 10 years of captivity. Not long for a dwarf, perhaps, but an age for a human or halfling.

The dwarves raid the lowlands, especially the Seven Cities, Magdar, Morgau, and Zobeck, but sometimes they assault Bourgund or even the Wastes near Allain or Bemmean caravans. These raids aim to take prisoners or lay siege to rival cities, and are deadly earnest affairs, resulting in significant losses of prisoners, deaths, and dwarven blood. Most such raids happen in the spring and summer months, before the harvest. Reciprocal raids against the dwarves in their mountains are nearly universal failures.

Why do they do it? The dwarves take their thralls in war, others say, as a way of discouraging their enemies. As they see it, each slave is a hostage to be returned to his or her home, if the gods will it, to tell other nations not to war against the Ironcrags. The threat of being taken and forced into picking through the dust of a salt mine or crushing rock for a smelter is enough to make many mercenaries think twice before agreeing to fight the dwarves. Some mercenary companies refuse to take such work at all, which in turn gives dwarven companies more opportunities for work.

In practice, the thralls’ work is grueling and some do die, although the dwarves are not nearly as harsh taskmasters as goblins, ogres, or the giants of the North. Dwarves mark their thralls with a brand or tattoo on the shoulder, but slaves are not beaten or starved like those in the Ruby Despotate. Thralls are given adequate food and rest.

Each spring, the dwarves release hundreds of slaves (or more 10 years after a great war) at the top of a pass and send home the thralls with a warning never to take up arms against the dwarves again. Most former slaves heed this advice, but a few carry rage and bitterness all their lives, becoming fierce foes of the dwarves, plundering their mule trains and chasing airships. These few know what they face, and they want vengeance at any price.
