# 3b - Dwarven Thralls
## Overview
**Dwarven Thralls**

“Ten years under the mountain” is a common grievance among those who visit the Ironcrags against their will and survive. The dwarves ransom other dwarves for a fee in gold, but all members of all other races captured in war are held for 10 years of captivity. Not long for a dwarf, perhaps, but an age for a human or halfling.

The dwarves raid the lowlands, especially the Seven Cities, Magdar, Morgau, and Zobeck, but sometimes they assault Bourgund or even the Wastes near Allain or Bemmean caravans. These raids aim to take prisoners or lay siege to rival cities, and are deadly earnest affairs, resulting in significant losses of prisoners, deaths, and dwarven blood. Most such raids happen in the spring and summer months, before the harvest. Reciprocal raids against the dwarves in their mountains are nearly universal failures.

Why do they do it? The dwarves take their thralls in war, others say, as a way of discouraging their enemies. As they see it, each slave is a hostage to be returned to his or her home, if the gods will it, to tell other nations not to war against the Ironcrags. The threat of being taken and forced into picking through the dust of a salt mine or crushing rock for a smelter is enough to make many mercenaries think twice before agreeing to fight the dwarves. Some mercenary companies refuse to take such work at all, which in turn gives dwarven companies more opportunities for work.

In practice, the thralls’ work is grueling and some do die, although the dwarves are not nearly as harsh taskmasters as goblins, ogres, or the giants of the North. Dwarves mark their thralls with a brand or tattoo on the shoulder, but slaves are not beaten or starved like those in the Ruby Despotate. Thralls are given adequate food and rest.

Each spring, the dwarves release hundreds of slaves (or more 10 years after a great war) at the top of a pass and send home the thralls with a warning never to take up arms against the dwarves again. Most former slaves heed this advice, but a few carry rage and bitterness all their lives, becoming fierce foes of the dwarves, plundering their mule trains and chasing airships. These few know what they face, and they want vengeance at any price.
