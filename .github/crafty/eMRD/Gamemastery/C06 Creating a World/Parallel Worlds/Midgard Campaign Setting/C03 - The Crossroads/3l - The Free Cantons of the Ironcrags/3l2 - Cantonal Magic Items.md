# 3l2 - Cantonal Magic Items
## Overview
**Cantonal Magic Items**

Dwarven magical innovation and the innate dwarven love of creation combine in their crafting and development of magic items. The following is a small sample of new items created by the dwarves.

**[[Air Seed]]**

When cracked or shattered (hardness 8, hp 2, Break DC 22), this plum-sized, nearly spherical sandstone releases a 10 foot burst of fresh, breathable air, displacing other gases in that area. Within that area, the blast acts as a *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* spell (Fort DC 14), except that it can only blow back creatures a maximum of 10 feet.

If used underwater or in a vacuum, the air lasts only long enough for those inside to fill their lungs once. Otherwise, it provides up to 10 minutes of breathable air for any number of creatures in the area.

**Description**

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, *gust of wind*; Price 500 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.

**Bear Cloak of Bareicks**

This thick bear-fur cloak provides excellent protection against the cold in the form of cold resistance 10. In addition, the cloak also allows you to change into a brown bear (Bestiary 1), as the spell *polymorph*. You may assume bear form no more than once per day, but you may stay in the form indefinitely. If killed, you revert to your normal form.

Your armor and equipment become part of your body and are nonfunctional. Whenever you shift forms, you regain lost hit points as if you rested for a night.

**Description**

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, *polymorph, resist energy*; Price 16,000 gp; Weight 4 lb.

**Black Shield of Grisal**

A shield treated by the dwarves of Grisal to become a black shield of Grisal is specially empowered to provide protection against the undead. This special ability grants you a +2 divine bonus on all saving throws made against spells and abilities of any undead creatures. It can only be added to shields.

**Description**

Moderate abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *resistance*; Price +2,000 gp.
