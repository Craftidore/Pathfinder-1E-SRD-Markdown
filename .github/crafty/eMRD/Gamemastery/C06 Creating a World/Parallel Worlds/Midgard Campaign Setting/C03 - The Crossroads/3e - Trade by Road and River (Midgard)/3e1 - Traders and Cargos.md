# 3e1 - Traders and Cargos
## Overview
**Traders and Cargos**

The traders and stevedores make their coin because someone has to physically move all the iron, wheat, silver, ale, wool, and timber sold in Zobeck. The traders take a (sometimes literal) whip to kobolds or humans who load and unload the city’s barges, oxcarts, mule trains, and hay wagons. Once the trip begins, the costs rise: time, toil, fodder, and travel all drain money. All too often, blood is also a price of doing business—someone has to defend the cargo against bold robbers, ravaging ogres, or grasping petty lordlings who close their bridges and demand a toll.

Still they come, more merchants and more caravans, and Zobeck welcomes each shipment. The Free City spurns no opportunity to gain every copper. Many merchants prize the most uneventful and short routes, to Cronstadt or Hammerfell. Specialist items—rare and spectacular—can command far greater fees and profits. The Templeforge airships down from the Ironcrags, the Flying Cities of Sikkim, charging the air with their alluring spice, and even the shadow road of the scáthesidhe (shadow elves) that connects the Free City to the courts of the Shadow, can return many times an investment’s cost to a bold and careful merchant. Everyone wants something and everything wants someone—meaning that there is always money to be made if you can bring the right goods to the right market.
