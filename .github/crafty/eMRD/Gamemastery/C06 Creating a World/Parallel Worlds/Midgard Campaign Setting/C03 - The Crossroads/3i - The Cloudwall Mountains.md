# 3i - The Cloudwall Mountains
## Overview
On the upper reaches of the Principalities of Morgau and Doresh lie the Cloudwall Mountains. The sharp, tall mountains’ peaks remain snow-covered throughout the year. At their base is the Cantri Abbey (also called the Home Abbey of the Red Sisters), and their runoff water gives impetus to the River Runnel.

Overrun with Cloudwall leopards, two-headed krakovan eagles, ogres, and yeti, the Cloudwall Mountains serve as the private hunting grounds of the Prince of Morgau and Doresh and his vampire coterie. Every living creature found there—including humans and dwarves—is subject to death by a variety of blood sports, from being hunted by two-headed rocs to the simpler night hunts of ghost knights and their vampiric masters. Criminals are sometimes sentenced to exile in the Cloudwalls. Those who survive their trip over to the Rothenian Plan are said to be granted their lives and freedom, but few ever make it that far. 

Other dangers prevail in this territory, as well. An ancient white female dragon known as Zrobaishalil and her yeti entourage reside on the tallest mountain and hunt the Cloudwall region. Dozens of ogre tribes war with one another and take wanderers as slaves and mates. An elder shroud-eater known only as the Dark Host or Blood Lord makes his home in the Cloudwalls. And Baba Yaga’s hut sometimes wanders the valleys below.

Silent and unshakeable, Lady Darvulia, the Mistress of Cloudwall, keeps closer ties to the Lords Subterranean than any other among the shroud-eaters. With her castle’s control of the main entrance to the Empire of the Ghouls and their near-surface trade town of Fretlock, she keeps a court with ghouls and employs them as mercenaries against her rivals.

## Cantri Abbey
**Cantri Abbey**

Mother Abbess Calle of the Cradle rules the Home Abbey of the Red Sisters, which watches over pregnant women and priestesses. Mothers-to-be might make a pilgrimage here if the augers predict a difficult birth. Resting near the Trollheim border, the Home Abbey is off limits to men, and the Mother Abbess has been known to execute male trespassers. The Prince of Morgau and Doresh has assigned the abbey’s protection to Commander Baleneus, a powerful leader of the Ghost Knights.

## Unnamed
**The Commandery of Lost Souls**

The ruins of a temple and commandery post of Khors lies at the base of the Cloudwall Mountains on the northwestern side. The Principalities of Morgau and Doresh are said to include a cavalier group of Ghost Knights, but those bear no resemblance to the ghost knights and paladins marching out of the commandery and into the mountains on full-moon nights. No records detail what caused the commandery’s fall. Cloudwall’s residents keep a safe distance from the ruins, parts of which have remained entirely intact.
