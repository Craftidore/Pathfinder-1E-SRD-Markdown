# 3f2 - The Shadow Realm
## Overview
**The Shadow Realm**

The Shadow Realm is a place of long winters and wan summers, a home to elves as unforgiving as a blizzard. They are the twisted servants and worshipers of their goddess and queen Sarastra, the Goddess Night and Magic. Her Moonlit King is rarely seen but is feared even among the shadow fey.

Sarastra sits on a mirrored throne within her palace of glass and dreams, attended by 1,000 lords and ladies with alabaster skin and hearts of ice. Human tales describe the queen is an implacably cruel demigod, though many details are likely exaggerations. The queen dreams of conquest, blood, and loss; she remembers too many worlds that once were hers.

The Winter Court waits trapped within a world stitched together from memories of a past that never was. Shadow ships sail seas of fog. Fey hounds lurk near crossroads and echoes of forests in hope that something warm will find its way between the worlds. Each summer is weaker than the last.

But where before they despaired, the shadow fey now have hope. The world of men remembers them and comes to trade, and for these isolated and dangerous fey, this presents their greatest opportunity in many bleak years.

Mankind comes to bargain, and the Winter Court loves nothing as much as a bargain. The humans entreat the fey to travel with them to their wondrous, vibrant city to stimulate commerce, and they offer the Winter Court their desires in exchange.

The Winter Court knows all about desire. The humans talk of caravans, nursery rhymes, blood sacrifice, and ambassadors. They speak of mutual profit, normalized trade relations, and the chance to heal the breach between their world and the dark creatures of the Shadow Realm. They speak so much that they never notice the desperation of the alabaster fey or the way their living breath fails to thaw the ceaseless snow.

The humans welcome the return of the Winter Court, and the Winter Court welcomes them. If it is ambassadors the humans want, then ambassadors they shall receive. The Shadow Realm is stirring for the first time in living memory. The shadow fey ambassador to Zobeck has been seen on the streets, and changes are afoot.
