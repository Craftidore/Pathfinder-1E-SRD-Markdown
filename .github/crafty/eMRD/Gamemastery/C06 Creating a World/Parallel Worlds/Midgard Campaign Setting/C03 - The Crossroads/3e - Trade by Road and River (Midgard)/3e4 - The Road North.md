# 3e4 - The Road North
## Overview
**The Road North**

Zobeck’s Order of the Griffon Riders protects travel and trade along the Great Northern Road, which stretches over 200 miles from Zobeck to Castle Valach on its way to the city of Bratislor in the north. Though the road is only a wagon-width wide in most places, the forest seems unable to totally reclaim it; the road remains a scar cut down the Margreve’s face. High overhead, the branches of flanking trees reach for each other, turning the road into a long tunnel with a tall, green gothic arch. Some sun breaks through, but night falls early here even in high summer.

Due to boggy, rocky, and overgrown stretches, travelers frequently take a fortnight to traverse the road on foot. Riders typically take eight to 10 days without wagons. Coaching inns, spaced one to three days apart, offer travelers a respite from beasts and weather.

Though snow and cold challenge winter travelers, the road’s condition suffers most from melt waters, rains, and mud in the early spring. Coaching inns are either closed or not prepared for travelers during this time. Merchants willing to risk the Great Northern Road before the annual Road Opening festival in Zobeck can expect tough going from both the terrain and the hungry creatures emerging from the deeper hollows.

The Great Northern Road is the only passable route to the rich cities of the Red Queen and the undead princes of Morgau and Doresh. As the second source of wealth for the city of Zobeck—the first being the River Argent—the Great Northern Road sees heavy, steady use.
