# 3n - Order of the Undying Sun
## Overview
**Order of the Undying Sun**

The Order of the Undying Sun is strongest in the Magdar Kingdom, the canton of Grisal, and south in Illyria, with a lesser presence in the Free City of Zobeck. Hundreds of knights serve in dozens of small and major commanderies from the White Mountain Marches to the Ruby Sea and the borders of the Mharoti Empire. The Order is widely admired, and the king of the Magdar Kingdom would never think of excluding its Grand Marshall from his deliberations when the season of war approaches. Its scarred and devoted warriors each fight harder than half-a-dozen mercenaries, and their unwavering devotion to high ideals makes them the elite backbone of Magdar’s army.

Though known for its outstanding heavy cavalry, the Order also raises most other troops, though rarely archers. These include companies of warrior-priests of Khors in war wagons, swift White Riders who primarily act as scouts and skirmishers, and even companies of devout pikemen who serve a season for pay and honor (the “Sunset Regiments,” so-called because their service sees an end). 

These troops obey the Grand Marshall Ödon Vencelsohn, called the Protector, and though they are not knights, the Sunset Regiments vastly increase the order’s martial power. With weapons and basic armor provided by the order’s armorers, these soldiers are uniformly of a higher quality than most levied troops. Some claim the order’s infantry and horse are even of higher quality than some vassals in the Magdar Kingdom.

The order’s headquarters is at Wagenstein, though it also controls Smoltenberg, several small keeps in Grisal, one castle in Illyria, and a smaller commandery outside Zobeck.

## Entering Knighthood
**Entering Knighthood**

Joining the knights is a simple matter: swear allegiance to the local commander, swear to obey the priests of Khors and uphold the creed of the Sun God, show your proficiency in mounted combat with lance and sword, and you’re in. New recruits receive armor and weapons of simple quality (but not trained warhorses).

The first rank is as a squire to a senior or veteran knight, fetching, carrying, and polishing armor. This might last a month or a year, depending on the age and skill of the applicant. Once the senior knight considers the squire fit, the candidate receives spurs, a sword, and the title of knight-novice. Though the knight-novice now answers to the Order’s captains and commanders rather than the senior knight, such young warriors remain junior figures within the Order.

## Paladins of Khors
**Paladins of Khors**

The elite of the Order (and most of its officers) are paladins of Khors. Their white- and yellow-plumed helmets are striking and distinctive, as are their blue cloaks and the white or dappled gray horses they favor. Most speak the Magdar dialect or the Trade Tongue (with a Magdar accent), and they are generous to their friends and implacable against their foes. Their light truly does shine brighter than most, and their bright swords cut through the darkness.

Zobeck’s council gives them little respect because of the Order’s support for the wrong side during the Revolt, but everywhere else, the white plumes of Khors are a sign of righteous might and outstanding skill. They include dwarves and centaurs in their ranks, but by far the majority are human.

### Sun Divine Aspect for Paladins of Khors
**Sun Divine Aspect for Paladins of Khors**

You radiate celestial light and warmth. Your sight pierces darkness and deception the way sunlight pierces the gloom. The Divine Aspect ability replaces the Divine Bond class feature a paladin gains at 5th level. Once chosen it can’t be changed.

**Sacred Torch:** At 5th level, the paladin glows with the light of a torch. She gains a +2 divine bonus on Perception skill checks and a +2 divine bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against undead. Both of these bonuses increase to +4 at 11th level and to +6 at 17th level.

**Holy Warmth:** At 8th level, the paladin and all allies within 10 feet of her gain resist cold equal to the paladin’s level. 

**Divine Light:** At 11th level, the paladin radiates light as a *daylight* spell and gains a +4 divine bonus on saves against gaze attacks and blinding effects.

**Blinding Light:** At 14th level: Whenever the paladin scores a critical hit with a melee attack, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + paladin’s base attack bonus) or become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature that saves is instead dazzled for 1 round.

**Hammer of the Undead:** At 20th level, the paladin is immune to cold. She gains a +8 divine bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against undead.

## Order of the Storm
**Order of the Storm**

The major rivals to the knights of the Undying Sun are the somewhat rougher and less disciplined outriders of Perun, a much smaller faith among the Magdar. They include human, dwarven, and centaur members in their ranks, and their Grand Master is Larina Perunal, a daughter of the Baroness Margit of Sveretska. They are excellent light cavalry in the field, fearless and bold as any knight, though in peacetime they spend a good deal of effort on drinking and talking of pilgrimages to the Seat of Mavros or to prostelize among the Rothenian centaurs. Though they do not equal the number of the sun-knights, their major castle at Valtros is a strategic one along the southern road and the Mharoti border, and their service is honored and respected by the crown. Those who think of them less charitably say, “Not everyone can be a servant of the sun.”

## Magdar War Wagons
**Magdar War Wagons**

The copper-clad armored wagons are built in Cronepisht with iron wheel rims from the Revskaya Foundry, leather yokes from Ironcrags, and oxen to pull the wagons from Magdar’s best herds. The army paints its war wagons in the red, green, and yellow colors traditional to the land from Sveretska to Cronepisht. Their wood is oak or ash, enchanted and strengthened by alchemy.

On the open plains, when the Dragon Empire’s elementalists unleash the jinn of thunder, lightning, wind, and fire, the copper-sheathed bulwarks of the war wagons are a vital bulwark against their magic. The copper is grounded against lightning and proof against fire, and the cover they provide is crucial. Better still, a wagon fortress protects all those within it and provides ready-made lookout points; guards standing atop the war wagons can see farther and spot enemies sooner.

To keep the wagons from being overturned, the front and rear wheel of neighboring wagons are built to slightly different widths. This allows the soldiers to chain them together when formed up into a tabor (or wagon-camp). In addition, some of the larger wagons are fitted with ballast stones in a compartment under the wagon. This lowers their center of gravity and making them almost impossible to capsize.

The Mharoti Empire has attempted to build its own war wagons, employing them in a similar way. However, the real strength of their army is in the akinji light cavalry and the elemental-fortified skirmishers, and neither of these groups can maneuver in the disciplined ranks required to make the most of mobile fortresses. The Mharoti wagons, called arbasi, are relatively small in number and are roofed in tin.

The Mharoti have the unusual habit of removing the wagon’s wheels at night, to secure them.

## Company Wagons
**Company Wagons**

Not all wagons are owned by the Magdar Kingdom. Many are outfitted in the Zobeck Gear District for use by mercenaries: the pike and crossbow companies of the Ironcrags, the exile companies that fled from Krakova, and the amazon companies of Perun’s Daughter. These are called company wagons, and they travel in small groups of 2 to 10 wagons, depending on the size of the adventuring company or mercenary company that uses them.

They provide all the same advantages with one further consideration: drawn by powerful oxen and fitted with strong axles, the company wagons can carry a great deal of treasure from adventuring, plundering, or banditry. Though the ballast compartments of the war wagons are usually filled with stones, a successful company wagon will sometimes say, “We carried gold and silver ballast, so rich were we!”
