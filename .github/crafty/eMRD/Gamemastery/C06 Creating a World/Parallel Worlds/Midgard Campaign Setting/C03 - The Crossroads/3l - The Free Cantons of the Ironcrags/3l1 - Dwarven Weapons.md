# 3l1 - Dwarven Weapons
## Overview
**Dwarven Weapons**

In addition to the dwarven urgrosh and waraxe, dwarves of the cantons and far North developed two other specialized weapons, the [[Greataxe, Nordmansch|Nordmansch greataxe]] and [[Poleax, Tijino|Tijino poleax]], and are expert at the use of a third, the [[Estoc|estoc]].

**[[Estoc]]**

A hand-and-a-half sword designed to pierce heavy armor and sharpened only on the tip, an [[Estoc|estoc]] is 4 foot long, sometimes with a second crossguard. It is said to have been used first by the knights of Vael Turog and Balinor against the elves, but now is used by dwarven mercenaries and human knights who expect to fight other heavily armored warriors. Its anti-armor properties make it popular with monster hunters and dragon slayers as well. Sometimes called the “tuck.”

**Nordmansch Greataxe**

The Nordmansch greataxe likely originated with the foresters and lumberjacks of the Ordenn forest, who found a secret way of making axe heads they continue to keep secret. The Nordmansch make more axes than their woodsmen actually need.

The Nordmansch greataxe is a two-handed weapon built to sunder other weapons. Its edge is hardened especially for this purpose, and its haft is likewise set with trapping prongs to catch and hold a foe’s weapon.

If you have the Improved Sunder feat, the Nordmansch greataxe provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all sunder attempts, in addition to the usual +4 for using a two-handed slashing weapon in a sunder attempt.

**Tijino Poleax**

The Tijino poleax bears a long axe blade in front, with a long, looping backhook designed to unhorse riders. The Tijino poleax has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe.

When you use a Tijino poleax and strike a mounted rider, the rider must immediately make a DC 25 Ride check or fall from his mount. Even if he succeeds, he suffers a –5 penalty on all other Ride checks until the beginning of his next turn. You can use the Tijino poleax to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the Tijino poleax to avoid being tripped.
