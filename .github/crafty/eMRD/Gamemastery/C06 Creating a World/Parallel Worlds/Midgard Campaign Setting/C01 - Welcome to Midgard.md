# C01 - Welcome to Midgard
## Overview
The age of heroes is dead, and the bridge to glory is broken——Bifrost fell long ago. The world is lost in an age of war, of dark wilderness and lost empires sunk beneath the waves. Only magic and the warmth of hope keeps lights aglow when dread things prowl and the priestly wardings shake, bent by hideous demonic rage. In this dark time, new heroes must arise to claim the crowns of Midgard, and restore the jewels to her scattered thrones. New heroes must lead a return to glory!

## Seven Secrets of Midgard
**[[01 - Seven Secrets of Midgard|Seven Secrets of Midgard]]**

At first glance the Midgard campaign setting might seem familiar, flavored with a strong dose of European and Middle Eastern mythos, a medieval level of technology, and fantasy races taken directly from the greatest fantasy traditions.

Dig a little deeper, and you’ll find some surprising twists that take Midgard from standard fantasy to exceptional. Here’s a quick summary for the game master who wants to plan out a short campaign or a long arc.

### A Flat World
**A Flat World**

The world of Midgard is flat and floats in a vast space of living stars. The heavens are accessible to great heroes who dare to visit them. A great serpent surrounds the world, or so claim those few travelers who have been to the edge of the world. What lives underneath? No one knows for sure. Midgard is not a modern world dressed up in a few medieval bits of armor and weaponry. Midgard makes the mythic real, with a world to explore from edge to edge.

### Elves, Ley Lines, and Shadow Roads
**Elves, Ley Lines, and Shadow Roads**

The histories of Midgard are laden with secrets you can use to shape adventures. The elves used the magic of ley lines (see “Ley Lines” later in this chapter) to create and sustain the shadow roads, making it possible to connect a far-flung empire. When the elves retreated from the world, their roads remained, and humans and dragons have learned to tap into the ley lines that sustain this magic. Player characters and villains alike can use these wellsprings of power, though the game master (GM) determines exactly where they are to be found. In Midgard, you can increase the level of magical power to levels unheard-of in other settings—without destroying the reality of the setting outside those particular areas.

### Elemental Dragons That Rule
**Elemental Dragons That Rule**

The dragons of Midgard are linked to the elements rather than to colors and metals (though all the traditional dragons and [[Linnorm (Bestiary 3)|linnorms]] are present). They have an urge to power, to rulership, and they exercise that rule through an entire empire that carries their name. All dragons throughout the land seek to rule their smaller kingdoms, to carve out power, the better to amass treasures. The dragons of Midgard have no interest in sitting in a lonely cave somewhere, counting coins. Their greed makes them ambitious, and that ambition is dangerous.

### Mysteries and Hidden Races
**Mysteries and Hidden Races**

The Midgard campaign features humans, elves, and dwarves and also new races and new mysteries, including the huginn raven-folk, the minotaurs, and the clockwork gearforged, as well as dragonkin and tieflings. These races had a place in the world from the start, their own kingdoms and ambitions and leaders. There are still hidden races in the corners of the world, races found nowhere else that can surprise players, such as the intelligent, ghoulish darakhul and the mysterious morphoi. Humans are the most numerous people and their kingdoms are grand, but Midgard offers many flavors and a wide range of heroes and villains.

### Time Flies, and Status Matters
**Time Flies, and Status Matters**

Two optional rules make Midgard special. The Status rule (see “[[Optional Rule_ Status (Midgard Worldbook PF)|Optional Rule: Status]]” in Chapter 2) gives player characters (PCs) a type of advancement not linked to level, but rather to their prestige and renown. The social status of PCs makes a difference in who they can visit and how they are treated—not that important in most dungeons, but possibly vital in the Court of the Imperatrix of Dornig, or when trying to counter a Dragon Empire ambassador’s plots.

In a similar way, the Time Flies optional rule advances campaigns quickly, so that months and years can fly by, and events of a campaign roll out at a less hurried pace. Generations can rise and fall, and adventurers can see their careers as a long arc rather than a brief set of fireworks.

### Gods That Dabble and Plot
**Gods That Dabble and Plot**

The Midgard pantheon has needs, and the urge to meddle. The gods dispense spells and miracles to their faithful, but they make clear demands of their worshipers and priesthoods. The gods also argue, sire children to rule kingdoms, and foment wars and feuds. Divine murder and enslavement are options, and this is part of the reason why the gods of Midgard wear masks (see Chapter 10). Their hatreds and rivalries spill out from the heavens and into the mortal streets and kingdoms. Each deity in the pantheon has distinct goals and desires, and sets down what is expected of his or her followers.

### Shifting Borders and Falling Kingdoms
**Shifting Borders and Falling Kingdoms**

Midgard is a world of cultures designed to change, collapse, and grow over time. Borders are not fixed and immutable, kingdoms rise and fall, rulers die and are replaced, and entire cities can be leveled or rebuilt by magic. Midgard is a setting meant to change after every adventure; the work of the heroes in Midgard is meant to challenge the existing order, give rise to great new lords and ladies, or to see the failure of hope and the death of kings.

There’s no point to playing a game where nothing changes but the statistics on a player’s sheet. As GM, you can and should take advantage of the inherently unbalanced politics or dangerous triggers built into the setting. Those ancient curses and festering revolts are there for your campaign. Find out whether your players have what it takes to change things—for better or worse! Some of these changes will be incorporated in future adventures and sourcebooks.

So with those points in mind, let us draw back the curtain on the world and its people. It is a place of great danger and a few flickering lights, holding out against a tide of darkness that threatens to engulf all lands in a new age of horrors and barbarism. Midgard is a place in need of help, where a few stout hearts can turn the tide, or a few bad decisions can plunge a kingdom or an empire into bloody ruin.

## The Creation
**The Creation**

The world is flat, with a single sun, one major moon, and six planets. Beyond these facts, the details of Midgard’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Almost all the gods and giants and other powers claim to have created the world. Some of them must be lying, and likely all of them are. The most common tale is that of the Northlanders who say that in the beginning, before Midgard was created, there was only the endless void called Ginnungagap. At one extremity of this vast abyss was biting cold; at the other, raging fire.

Life sprang up in the center where rime met flame, melting and boiling. This was Aurgelmir, the first and greatest giant, from whose body both the earth and sky were crafted. Creatures sprang from Aurgelmir like branches on an oak, among them the first giants and the eldest of the gods. The two groups warred, and when Aurgelmir sided with his giant kin, the gods slew him.

The giants have never forgotten this murder. Since that day they’ve nursed a grudge and hope one day to see the gods’ dominion ended and their forefather avenged.

The gods, meanwhile, fashioned the world from Aurgelmir’s corpse. His bones became the earth and his blood flowed out to fill the rivers and seas. From his teeth they fashioned mountains and his hollow skull became the sky. With giants cowed by the cleaving of Aurgelmir, the gods explored their new-forged world and soon they fell to strife among themselves.

The gods of nature and the gods of passion and glory formed factions and fought for dominion over their new realm of Midgard, and Creation trembled from the blows they struck. Eventually canny Wotan, always wise and victorious, brokered a truce. The gods exchanged hostages and peace descended once more.

Smaller races took their place in the world, and the gods watched.

### The Rise of the Dwarves
**The Rise of the Dwarves**

During the conflict between gods called the Vanir War, the smithgod Volund and the thunder-god Thor created the dwarves. Warriors forged on an adamantine anvil, the dwarves were created to counter the wild elves of Thorn in battle, who sided against Wotan’s forces. Fearless warriors and giant slayers, the dwarves did great deeds in the name of their patrons. Legions fell beneath their glittering axes and the dwarves became proud, believing themselves the greatest of all mortal races. Perhaps this was their undoing.

No mortal knows for certain what caused the Reaving, as dwarves call the fall of their mighty Northern civilization. Many believe they began to favor Volund over Thor, delighting in craftsmanship rather than warfare, and the Thunderer was filled with wrath and smashed their mountain kingdoms into the sea. Others claim that it was treachery from beneath the earth, an alliance of dead souls slain by dwarven axes and the defeated yet vengeful fey, who infiltrated their halls and brought them low from within. Early reaver dwarves claimed that elves were responsible, and they immediately went to war with their old enemies.

Grove by grove, mile by bloody mile, the elves and their allies were driven out the North. Most fled to the West, across the sea. Some dwarves continued the push further southward, among them Volund’s most devout followers, where they made a new home in the Ironcrag Mountains and the smith god became their preeminent deity. Those in the North stayed faithful to their dual heritage, however. They remained fierce warriors, slayers of elves, giants, and trolls, the proud and vengeful clans forever dreaming of a time when their fallen empire could be reclaimed.

### The Rise and Fall of Ankeshel
**The Rise and Fall of Ankeshel**

In those ancient days, humans mastered magic and alchemy, engineering, navigation, and many other useful arts. They were citizens of Ankesh, an island in the western ocean blessed with rich deposits of copper, iron, and orichalcum. These humans built great cities, slew aboleths with vril rifles and lightning spears, traveled in flying carriages, and built orichalcum temples of shining gold. It was a golden age that lasted long centuries, perhaps a thousand years. Some believe the aboleths destroyed the island nation in the end. Others believe it was different horrors—perhaps krakespawn, the shining children of Caelmarath, the titanic servants of the sea god Nethus, or the arrival of the sea-devil sahuagin—that overran the walls of Ankesh and drove its people into the sea.

When Ankesh fell 3,000 years ago, all contact with the island was lost. The world sank into barbarism for centuries; the coasts were places of terror and avoided by the wise. The dwarves ruled in the North, humans and others struggled on the mainland, and goblins, gnolls, ghouls, ogres, centaurs, and other brutal races thrived. Nuria Natal was the only human kingdom of any size and power, its dynasties threatened but unbroken.

Elsewhere, chieftains and petty kings held power for a generation, then fell back into chaos and struggle against the darkness. The light and knowledge of the world glimmered and went out.

### Arrival of the Elves
**Arrival of the Elves**

Roughly 2,200 years ago, the elves arrived from the far West and landed their ships on the outskirts of the Arbonesse forest. They slowly built their empire from the Western Ocean all the way to the Ruby Sea, ruling the humans, gnomes, halflings, and others who saw in the elves a restored hope for civilization. Their cities were tall, their magic powerful, and their mastery of living things, art, magic, and swift travel gave them a powerful advantage. They swept all other nations before them, and built cities in the high places and the forests.

The elves ruled over at least five centers of culture and imperial power over the span of their 1,300 year rule, each corresponding to a different king or queen: first in the planeshifted and hidden River Court of the Arbonesse under the Emperor Xindrical the Explorer, then the eastern hub of Sephaya on the Ruby Sea under Queen Shillesh Greensun Sephaya, the Daughter of Yarila. The empire was briefly thought to linger at the High Court of Liadmura in the Ironcrags where the Eagle Emperor ruled. The empire was centered for the longest time in the great capital of Thorn under the High Queen Lelliana Thorntree Endiamon, and her daughter the Shadow Princess Sarastra—mother of the shadow fey bloodlines, driven into exile in the Shadow Realm. Finally (when Thorn fell), the capital was held in the southern metropolis of Valera.

The elves’ influence among humans was considerable in the magocracies of Caelmarath, especially Allain, Bourgund, and Vael Turog, who all learned the arcane arts in the elven style before they created their own. Some believe Parszan and the Margreve forest also held large elven enclaves, but if so the details are lost. The more distant regions were all connected to the elven centers of civilization by the fey roads, magical routes that compressed journeys of weeks or months into mere days or hours.

### The Young Kingdoms
**The Young Kingdoms**

Sheltering under elven wings, various human magocracies and kingdoms arose starting around 1,800 years ago. Each pursued its own path outside the elven lands. The most important of these Young Kingdoms were the secret wizard societies of Caelmarath and Vael Turog, the Great Kingdom of Illyria, the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova, the Sultanate of Cassilon, the Mountain Kingdom of Morgau, the Magdar Kingdom, and the Moon Kingdom of Roshgazi, led by the minotaurs of the South.

As the human kingdoms grew to prominence on the outskirts of the elven lands, in mountains and plains where the elves elected not to rule, their strength, pride, and daring grew likewise. The secret societies of Caelmarath and Vael Turog began as human guilds within the Elven Empire that considered themselves apart and above elven rule. Although they resented elven authority, they profited from its arcane knowledge and experimented with magic the elves considered dangerous. The societies created their own lords, titles, tithes, and loyalties. The elves attempted to subvert them, but they proved difficult to dissuade with either reason or force.

The kingdoms of Morgau, Krakova, Illyria, and Cassilon were founded early on, as were certain small city-states such as Achillon and Zobeck. The Sun Kingdom of Cassilon crowned its first human king in the south 1,739 years ago. Illyrian bloodlines go back to around 1,600 years ago, the Krakovan nobility built their first castle and throne about 900 years ago, and Morgau was settled 800 years ago, all on the edges of wilderness never explored or settled by the elves. These were traditional kingdoms, working to create cities, castles, and great monuments in their own corners of the world. The elves seemed to consider these realms interesting but not threatening. Morgau and Krakova fought over their borders, but for the most part the human kingdoms were occupied in securing their own territories. Cassilon befriended the desert giants and storm giants, and together humans and giants built great cyclopean fortresses in the Pytonne Mountains, fearing elven encroachments that never came.

The Moon Kingdom of Roshgazi thrived and sent forth colonies throughout the middle sea to Kyprion and Corremel and Capleon, settlements that are still influenced the Moon Kingdom’s faith and people. Roshgazi’s Labyrinth was famous throughout the world, said to rival some of the works of the elves.

The last of the Young Kingdoms was the Magdar Kingdom, settled 722 years ago from the East by a Rothenian tribe of human horsemen. The humans saw the elven spires of Sephaya, and their king decided that this was a good place to trade. The Magdar quickly made war on both Illyria and Morgau—and the elves paid little attention. The Magdar Kingdom built cities throughout the plain east of the Ironcrags, and their kings paid more attention to piling up castles than wooing the elves. Though the noble families of the Magdar did learn magic from the elves, they gave it their own cast.

In time, the Young Kingdoms profited greatly from trade and knowledge brought from the West, and they also brought great wealth to the Elven Empire through the sheer number and fecundity of humankind. As they grew stronger, some humans resented the elder race, and this led over time to “elf hunts” and laws proscribing what and where the elves might live and trade within human lands. The two races grew prickly and difficult with one another, while the dwarves stood by and laughed.

### Black Sorceress' Revolt
**Black Sorceress’ Revolt**

Roughly 800 years ago, the tieflings and humans of Caelmarath society revolted against elven rule in the First Great Revolt, often referred to as the Black Sorceress’ Revolt after Melathea Stross, the sorceress who led the uprising. The revolt was brutally suppressed, so the wizards carried on in secret, summoning helpers and corrupting the fey roads. They carved out their lands in opposition to the elves by using dark powers. The revolt burned out within 20 years, in arcane cataclysm and great walkers and madness, but not before humans seized control of Maillon and Bourgund and built arcane strongholds at Vael Turog and at Bemmea. A strange wise woman named Baba Yaga—long known in the East—offered her services to the rebellion, calling up fortress walls overnight, unbinding elven wards, and releasing demons by the score.

The elves sought to limit the damage, but the human willingness to call on dark powers to fuel their cause combined with the tremendous human advantage in numbers was difficult to withstand across an empire spread thinly from the Western Ocean to the Ruby Sea. The elves were soon entangled in a hopeless struggle that threatened to corrupt their own hidden lands. The elves feared human contamination of the elven homeland, and for good reason. Demons, devils, and horrors could easily walk the fey roads if elven vigilance slipped, or if an elf gave in to darkness.

The records of the period say the fey roads and the Elflands themselves became magically corrupted. The elves who became the shadow fey threw in their lot with the dark powers that the mages of Caelmarath summoned and sent against each other. The shadow elves taught even more foul magic to certain human and tiefling families, such as House Stross, House Neckart, and House Galbrion, among others. Their hideous servitor-demons were the shining children of Caelmarath, as well as the elder walkers whose strength grew and grew as the portals between worlds were disrupted and expanded. But though the shadow elves were corrupt, most elves remained on the side of light, and they found the growing fusion of magical and mortal realms abhorrent and vile.

### The Great Retreat
**The Great Retreat**

At last the elves decided not to join the mages of Caelmarath in their infernal descent into ever-greater madness. The elven roads shut down; the fey method of transport suddenly disappeared, and the legions marched out from Thorn and Valera for the last time, banners flying, to distant lands far from the reach of men. Those who believe the elves marched to war say they fought a great battle in the Realms Beyond to undo the evils of the wizards of Vael Turog, House Galbrion, and the other diabolists. Others believe that the elves merely prevented further summoning, and re-established the borders of the Elflands on the far side of Midgard.

During the Great Retreat 472 years ago, the elves withdrew from the mortal world and went back to the Elflands. The elves have never explained their decision to leave the world, and those who question them get no answers. Their empire was abandoned within a week, and houses and roads alike stood empty. The elven songs stilled, their towers gathered spider webs, and their courts and halls were stripped bare of all readily portable goods.

The dwarves and humans stepped in as masters of the empty realms, but the high civilization of Thorn, Valera, Liadmura, and Sephaya was gone. Only the River Court of Arbonesse remained as an elven stronghold, and that land was closed to all outside contact. The elfmarked were abandoned by their parents, forced to make their way in a newly hostile world. Servitor races such as the gnomes and halflings were suddenly free of the obligations and protections of their elven overlords. The gnomes fled the elven halls, while the halflings found new masters, or at least new friends, in the small human realms.

The races that paid obeisance to elves were suddenly free to run their own affairs, but the first years after the Retreat were confused ones. The reaver dwarves marched south through Krakova to seize the rich mines around Liadmura, creating the first of the Ironcrag cantons. A new human kingdom was founded during this time of confusion, when 400 years ago the god Perun founded a matriarchal kingdom near the ruins of Sephaya.

The victory of Caelmarath was complete, having won human independence and total freedom from elven interference. But Caelmarath could not control the powers it had unleashed, and its last gasp followed soon after. The warring mages could not agree on who led them, whose summonings were greatest, and they started to clash among themselves once the common enemy was gone. This conflict led to the period called the Great Mage Wars.

### The Great Mage Wars and the Wastes
**The Great Mage Wars and the Wastes**

The Great Mage Wars brought ruin and devastation to the western heart of the land. The battles brought rains of acid, vast shambling beasts tearing through the walls of reality, and the wholesale sacrifice of men, women, and children to dark gods from the Realms Beyond. The arrival of the walkers was simply the latest in a long line of darker and darker summonings. The western regions fell to corruption and foulness as a result of the Caelmarath mages’ campaign. Over time, the magocracies slowly destroyed each other with eldritch power.

The last gasp of Caelmarath was heralded 414 years ago, by the summoning of the titanic ocean-behemoth called the Isonade. The beast sank the western part of elven Arbonesse, and nearly sank Allain as well. The last of magocracies fell under the tread of elder walkers and hordes of demons, goblins, and things from Realms Beyond, leaving only Allain and Bourgund standing. The forces of evil unleashed had turned the once-rich lands of Caelmarath into a wasteland. The human kingdoms of Cassilon, Balinor, Vael Turog, and Carnessa were destroyed, their people slain or transformed into aberrations and horrors.

The Goblin Wastes earned their name from the survivors, some of whom are surely the humans who once lived in these lands, transformed into goblins, ogres, and worse. Since then, the Wasted West has remained a howling wilderness with small and struggling kingdoms, primarily Bourgund and Allain. In time, the lands of the giants fell to the corruption and summoned horrors, their ghosts now wandering free across the lands. Few visit here beyond the Seat of Mavros, though the road from Verrayne to Salzbach is still passable (if plagued by constant goblin raids).

In the wake of the Mage Wars, many of the survivors crawled away to rebuild their strength, or to hide from the unleashed horrors. Since that time, Allain has ruled supreme in this area and the champions of other nations have vanished. At least one mage of Vael Turog, a sworn foe of Allain, made his way to the east and established himself as the Master of Demon Mountain.

All know of the fall of the flying cities during the cataclysm. Several are believed to have fallen into the sea, others into the Southern deserts, and others still sent spinning out into the void. Meteors and comets fell too, leaving their elements strewn across the land.

### Rise of the Dragons
**Rise of the Dragons**

Over 300 years ago, the dragons of the Dragoncoil Mountains decided that raiding villages was a pleasant pastime, but the subsequent incidence of human and elven incursions into their territory was growing alarming. It was time, they decided, to found a kingdom of their own. Six dragons established themselves as founders of a new empire, not one of them trusting the other five. After years of discussion and negotiation among their children, the kobolds and the dragonkin, the dragon swore a compact that they would allow a human of draconic blood to rule and administer the land, as long as a tithe and tribute was paid to the dragons every 10 years. In return, the dragons swore to fight together to destroy any army arrayed against them, or to send the “children of draconic blood” in their place—meaning, legions of kobolds and dragonkin.

This was the founding of the Mharoti (Mah-ROW-tee) Sultanate, in which humans, kobolds, and dragonkin successfully seized all the lands of the eastern elves from Sephaya to Nuria Natal. They plundered far afield, demanding tribute from the Ruby Despot and the Daughters of Perun as well as the Southern realms of gold and salt. They took much of the land that was once the Kingdom of Illyria and the far eastern realms of Khandiria and Beldestan. They seized land near the Dragoncoil Mountains, and even reached beyond Nuria Natal to destroy two coastal cities of the minotaurs, Roshgazi and Cindass. The minotaurs of Cindass resettled in Capleon and Kyprion, but in Roshgazi the devastation was so great that the people sought more distant sanctuary. The minotaurs of Roshgazi boarded a great fleet of ships and were never seen again. The Lost Fleet of Roshgazi remains one of the mysteries of the early Mharoti Empire. The Nurian counterattack against the Mharoti coastal invaders drove the dragonfolk back in one of relatively few major defeats.

The dragons have learned from those mistakes, yet still they lust for gold. To that end, each year the sultan or sultana leads the armies into the field in search of gold and silver to make up the next tribute to the dragons of the realm. These dragons have grown to more than 20 in number, and each considers itself a master of earth and sky. The Mharoti Sultanate grows as they do, and its people are certain their destiny is to rule the earth as the elves once did. Their greed is great, and their ability to make war and conquer lands seems unstoppable.

### The Prince of Morgau
**The Prince of Morgau**

About 300 years ago, the vampire Prince Lucan arrived in Morgau and ingratiated himself with the king of Morgau, then seized the throne. He infected the children of his bloodline, and adopted the faith of the Red Goddess. After his ascendance he was nearly driven from the throne by the combined armies of Krakova, Doresh, and Magdar. However, his undead strength and persistence gave Prince Lucan an edge, the ability to return again and again and convert his enemies to his side. Furthermore, he made a second alliance, this one with intelligent and organized ghouls. The next attempt to drive him from his throne was a complete rout, with Morgau’s army killing (and devouring) the cream of Krakovan and Magdar nobility on the Field of Salesh. Within 50 years, Lucan conquered Doresh as well, but the dwarves of the Ironcrags took Grisal before he could capture that as well. The vampire lords’ undead power and devotion to the Red Goddess make them extremely dangerous, but they fight among themselves more often than with their neighbors. As they have grown more numerous, it grows harder for them to feed their ghoulish allies. They are surrounded by enemies: Baba Yaga, the Daughter of Perun, and the kings of neighboring kingdoms maintain a working alliance against the undead.

Prince Lucan and his undead hordes remain dangerous, but somewhat contained within the hills and forests of Morgau and Doresh.

### Baba Yaga and the Gnomes
**Baba Yaga and the Gnomes**

Roughly 200 years ago, gnomes made a deal with Baba Yaga and it went very, very wrong. They promised her great things, arcane wonders, the blood of kings, the sighs of valkyries, the tears of statues, and the wealth of Mammon. These were all typical gnome lies, of course, but in the past no one had been able to hold the gnomes to the exact letter of their agreements. This time, they promised far too much and delivered far too little to keep Grandmother happy. She swore an oath of vengeance and an oath of fury to destroy the gnomes entirely.

Some fled to the Northlands or the Elflands, or the distant East, where Baba Yaga could never find them. But most of the gnomes did not flee. Instead, the foolish gnomes were so terrified they sold themselves again, but this time to the arch-devils of the Eleven Hells. Ever since, the gnomes have fallen further and further into diabolism, and to this day they are tools of evil powers. Baba Yaga still hunts the gnomes and pays well to those who bring her their heads. The gnomes seek a way out, either by giving Baba Yaga the impossible things they promised her, or by mastering some new art that will allow them to abandon their hellish allies.

## Recent Events
**Recent Events**

The following events are still resonating with the people of Midgard, shaping their kingdoms and their destinies.

- 82 years ago, the people of Zobeck cast off the feudal masters of House Stross, declaring themselves a Free City. Their patron goddess, Rava the Gear Goddess, helped them create the first gearforged north of the Middle Sea.
- 50 years ago, the Khazzaki of Rhos Khurgan, the gnomes of Neimheim, and the Duke of Domovogrod allied to quell a centaur bandit king. When the centaurs were routed, Neimheim’s army turned its crossbows on their Khazzak allies in a great offering to their infernal masters.
- 42 years ago, Ra-Amon-Ra, the prophet of the Sun God Aten, was martyred in the Nurian city of Per-Xor by dragonfire. His followers have continued to expand their faith, throwing down the idols of other gods and declaring the supremacy of Aten.
- 40 years ago, the minotaurs were pushed off the last of the Illyrian mainland, and their queen swore an oath of vassalage to Triolo in exchange for naval assistance against the Mharoti Empire.
- 8 years ago, the Triolans chose a minotaur as their Duke and Admiral of the Republic.
- 2 years ago, the old Mharoti sultan died and the Sultana Casmara Azrabahir ascended to the throne.

## Time, Planes, and Dates
**Time, Planes, and Dates**

Midgard is geocentric, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars swiftly circling the world. Beyond that, strange other worlds are linked to Midgard through dark roads, both sullied heavens and golden hells.

**Sun, Moon, and Heavens**

The sun is the chariot of Khors the sun god, or of Aten the sun god, or perhaps a lamp of one of the other cults of the sun. When it disappears, it presumably shines on the other side of the flat world. As the sun passes the edge of the world, some believe that the world serpent snaps at it, someday to consume its light, plunging the world into eternal darkness of Fimbulwinter.

Midgard has a single, primary moon and seven lesser moons called the Mage’s Stars, used as a common symbol in arcane workings and in the coat of arms of the magocracy of Bemmea. The moon is generally called just that, though some wizards and others call it Ond or Selles, names in older languages also meaning “the moon.”

Midgard stars are living creatures, lesser lights to the sun god’s greater light. Thus, a young star might require someone to defend it from the dark gods who would happily devour it. On rare occasions, these stars come down from the heavens to visit people on the face of the world. Five known planets orbit the world of Midgard, though the elves insist on the existence of a sixth planet, called Idelitan or Melgros, that human eyes are too weak to see.

**Asaph, the Green Planet:** A planet that shines white and green, Asaph is rumored to hold powerful influence over the seas and air, and alchemists associate it with elemental air, mithral, and spirits. Ermaon, the Jumping Planet: Fastest and strangest of the planets, this one is small and difficult to see. Some believe it is not a planet at all, but a comet trapped in a circle. It is represented as silver or mercury by alchemists and astrologers.

**Melgros, the Dark Wanderer:** Not visible to the naked eye, this planet is a dark and mysterious home of malevolent forces, including nightshades, demons, and devils of all sorts. Stories dating to Ankeshelian times claim it is the source of both a soul-consuming fire and all black magic. Seeing it is widely considered unlucky among humans. Elves refer to it as “Idelitan” or “the Archer’s Planet” because those who see it happen to be the best archers. Alchemists associate the planet with adamant.

**Temperos the Giant:** This is a yellow planet, easy to see in the night sky and commonly associated with the giants of the Haunted Lands, who held it to be the home of the gods. Alchemists associate it with copper, tin, and bronze.

**Tiomoutiri, the Golden Planet:** This bright and shining planet is most visible around sunrise and is widely associated with Khors the sun god and with Lada the Golden. Astronomers of Nuria Natal believe it governs the health and sexual aspects of life. Priests of Khors and Lada perform their high rituals when Tiomoutiri is in the sky. Alchemists associate the planet with gold and orichalcum.

**Zuhal, the Dragon:** The elves claim that this red, distant planet has rings. Though it is a powerful symbol in the heavens, living dragons consider its name a bit of a misnomer, associating it with blood and life force instead. Alchemists associate it with platinum, earth and minerals, and Zuhal is widely considered the planet that controls aspects of magic and the arcane.

**Days and Months**

The measure of time in Midgard is straightforward. There are 12 months of 30 days each, for a total of 360 days in the calendar, and another six intercalendar festival days: New Year’s Dawn, Mustering, Rites of Spring, Summer Festival, Harvest Dances, and the Lantern Festival. With six festival days, the year is 366 days long.

The seven days of the week are the same in most cultures of Midgard: Moonday, Volsday, Wolfsday, Torsday, Marksday, Ceresday, and Khorsday. These names are common from the Northlands to the Middle Sea and the Crossroads to the Wastes.

Two cultures have exceptions to this pattern: the elven peoples and the Dragon Empire both use different names for the days of the week. Among the Mharoti of the Dragon Empire, they are called Pazar, Nazartesi, Salı, Charsamba, Pehrsembe, Juma, and Umartesi. Among the elves, they are Larasday, Elothsday, Orielsday, Bowsday, Freyasday, Yarisday, and Leafsday.

The months are measured from the arrival of the new year with the onset of spring in Springmelt or Mustering. The festivals associated with various months are given in parentheses. The names given in brackets are the names used for winter months in the southern regions, where snow is rare or unknown.

**Major and Minor Festivals**

As a relief from the toil and danger of daily life, the holidays of the calendar mark a series of festivals, rites, and occasionally processions meant to signal the changing seasons, to mark great times of victory, and to give the pious an occasion for reflection and the discharge of their duties to the gods.

**New Year’s Dawn**

At the first sign of spring comes the New Year, when the light of Lada the Golden drives away evil spirits, or when mage’s fireworks do the same. The holiday is celebrated in the early hours with a simple procession to the town center, and then waiting to see the sun rise over the horizon. As soon as it does, celebrants clang on pots and ring bells to drive out bad fortune and welcome good luck for the coming year.

Gifts are common among family members, and many places (especially in Illyria) have a wide range of superstitions about what you can and cannot do on the first day of the year, such as keeping a full pantry, not leaving the house, or leaving a basket of food on the doorstep the night before.

**Mustering Days**

The campaigning season (especially in the Seven Cities), and the mustering is the day when soldiers must report to their captains, captains to their lords, and lords to their kings. It is a day of oaths, calling up of peasant levies, and the beginning of the season of raids, war, and commerce. Three days are granted for the holiday, one to travel to the muster festival, then a swearing of oaths and contracts, then a day of blessings and prayer to Mavros before the march to war. The holiday is widely celebrated in the Magdar Kingdom, Bourgund, Verrayne, and Melana, and serves as an initiation for young men, who fight “Mustering Bouts” against each other to crown a “Chosen of Mavros” or “Kingdom Champion.”

The holiday’s date is movable and declared by the local priest of Thor, Perun, or Mavros. Given varying weather and climate, the dates of the holiday vary, depending on the roads and rivers. In the sunny South, Mustering can take place in the first week of Springmelt (or even the last week of Deep Winter). In the North, Mustering rarely takes place in Springmelt, and the holiday is more often held in the first or second week of Sowing.

**Rites of Spring**

The festival of sowing and fertility is overseen in various places by the priests of Yarila and Porevit, as well as by druids, village elders, or wise women on the equinox. The priests bless the fields and the flocks, and pray for their health and a successful harvest. The usual sacraments are wine and sometimes lamb’s blood spread on the fields, and in many places in the Domains of the Princes, young courting couples are sent out to the fields after dark to plant seeds of their own.

The Spring rites are a little more dangerous in the Mharoti Empire, where they are part of the Egg Festival. Dragons retreat from their usual haunts to guard their nests, while their various supporters keep a week-long vigil that ends with the Hatching Day, a day of joyous celebration when young kobolds, dragonkin, wyverns, drakes, and even true dragons are said to have their first birthday. Indeed, many of the scaled races do hatch around this time, though rarely exactly at the spring equinox.

The second day of the Rites of Spring is the Day of the Child Priests or Day of Misrule. On this day, a child is pronounced high priest or king. In each place that celebrates the festival, a child wears a crown or full priestly regalia and makes pronouncements that adults seek to fulfill, though often the commands lead to a day of chaos and confusion. The festival is especially popular in the Seven Cities, the magocracy of Allain, and the Grand Duchy of Dornig.

**Crown Festival**

The birth or coronation of the king, queen, duke or prince is celebrated in most nations. In Morgau, the coronation of Prince Lucan some 300 years ago is celebrated in Goldflower with the gift of 12 comely maidens to his court from the people of the realm. In the Mharoti Empire, the Pact Day of the first dragons and the Founder Mharot is celebrated by the rendering of tribute to the dragons by their people, and their renewal of their oath of alliance to Sultana Casmara. In other places, such as Magdar, the king is expected to give loaves and olives to all visitors to his palace during the Crown Festival.

**Summer Festival**

A festival of warmth, trade, oaths, and friendship, the Summer Festival is held at a crossroads or fairground at the solstice. The Summer Festival is a time for marriages and betrothals, horse trading, and fair dealings with strangers and old friends alike. Priests of Volund are especially sought after in this time, and the festival is huge in trade hubs such as Triolo, Capleon, Salzbach, and Zobeck.

**Harvest Dances**

In the bright harvest moonlight,

when the sheaves are gathered in and the threshed grain is stored in the granaries, the people of the land celebrate with dances late at night. All dancing, gambling, and merriment is permitted, and music, foot races, and even magical fireworks are sometimes part of the celebrations. The festival takes different forms in every nation, but all peasants and nobles count their blessings at the end of the growing season, and give thanks to Ceres. Shops, workshops, guildhalls, and smithies are all closed during the harvest dances, and only taverns and inns are open.

**Lantern Festival**

A month after the winter solstice, when the night is dark and spring seems most distant, the people celebrate the returning sun with a parade of lanterns and candles. They send prayers to Lada, Khors, and Aten in elaborate ceremonies involving candles, lanterns, illumination magic, and sometimes lantern or candle drakes. A torch lit or candlelit parade with songs sometimes winds its way around an entire town as part of the Lantern Festival; other places send small floating lights into the sky as part of a solar mass. The festival ends early for children, and at dawn for the priests and the devout who maintain a vigil through the night.

**Minor Festivals**

Many festivals are celebrated only in parts of Midgard or are not celebrated every year. These are a few of the more prominent minor festivals.

**Axe Festival:** A rare festival held during the red moon of a lunar eclipse, the Axe Festival is a propitious time to sacrifice to Hecate and also (for those of darker bent) to Marena, the Red Goddess. Blood rites, kidnappings, and ritual torture can mar the celebrations, but some wizards and witches swear by the festival’s power when crafting new magical items.

**Ghost Night:** Also called Hag Night, this goblin festival is honored in many places with masks, invocations of the elders, and candle offerings. The Ghost Night is the first new moon of the winter, when things are their darkest. In some places, requiem is smoked or offered at this time, and answers are sought from departed elders.

**Night of Open Roads:** The first winter moon is a time to communicate with ancestors and spirits of the dead. This festival is especially sacred to Charun, Lord of the Dead, as well as his bride Hecate. It is also an unusually good time to travel to the Shadow Realm, to open portals, and to build secret shrines or to raise the dead, and thus it is beloved of necromancers. The festival’s celebration is especially common in Dornig and the Seven Cities.

**Slaughter Festival:** Also called the brewer’s festival, the Slaughter Festival is about meat and drink: the autumn butchering plus drinking the first ale of the season, overseen by the priestesses of Ninkash. Animals are smoked or salted for the winter, and the best beer is chosen by the goddess (or her priests). The largest celebration of the Slaughter Festival is in Trombei.

**The Count of Years**

The people and nations of Midgard measure time in many ways, though the most common standard is simply the formula “so-and-so many years ago,” counting backward from the present. But in records meant to stand over time, a count or calendar is required, and Midgard has at least seven of them. Each begins a certain number of years ago. These are the most important, though other reckonings exist, listed in order from the oldest to the most recent.

In many regions, even these counts are unknown, since the nations of Midgard are fragmented and largely too weak to impose a unified calendar. Many use a local dating system, such as the founding of the kingdom or counting from the coronation of the current duke, queen, or prince.

**After the Retreat Reckoning (AR):** The Great Retreat of the Elves to the Arbonesse and the Fey Realm, ending their empires in Midgard. This date, 472 years ago, began a second descent into chaos and warring states, and led to the birth of the Goblin Wastes and the further decline of the West.

**Ankesh Count (AC):** No longer in use anywhere, but ancient records from before the elven arrivals date from 3,909 years ago, the date of the first coronation of a king and queen on the island of Ankesh.

**Count of the Prophet’s Years (CP):** The prophet of the single god Aten in the South was martyred 40 years ago, and since that time his cult has grown substantially, especially among women, Southern dwarves, and the poor. For religious reasons, these people disregard the Dragon Ages and use the Count of the Prophet’s Years instead. This does not endear them to the Mharoti officials and governors.

**Daughter’s Count (DC):** The god Perun granted dominion over Sephaya and the eastern provinces of the elves to his human daughter, Vasilka Soulay. The founding of this kingdom was 422 years ago. 

**Elvish Thorn Years (TY):** Counted from the founding of the city of Thorn 2,190 years ago, and used in the Domains of the Princes to this day. Formerly used by the Valerans, and sometimes referred to as the Valeran reckoning in the south.

**Founder’s Roll (FR):** Counted from the founding of the human magocracies that later became Caelmarath, 482 years ago. The rebellion lasted only a few years and was suppressed by the elves, but this date is still used in the magocracy of Bemmea, the Kingdom of Bourgund, and sometimes in Verrayne.

**Horse Years (HY):** The kingdom of the Magdar was founded by Rothenian nomads who settled the finest grasslands of the Crossroads region and held them against all comers. They count their dates from the First Horse King, and call this the Horse Years. Nomads and centaurs of the plains know this count as well. The date begins 722 years ago.

**Mharoti Dragon Ages (MDA):** The dragons swore their compact 337 years ago, founding the Mharoti Sultanate. The empire is the only place that uses this reckoning, but its formidable size and strength means that neighboring kingdoms are familiar with the system.

**Old Calendar (OC):** The most common reckoning among humans and dwarves dates to the founding of Cassilon, which makes the current year 1739. This date is commonly given in brackets after other year reckonings, since it is the best known and most widely traveled. 

**Shadow Reckoning (SR):** The shadow fey date their own creation from the time before human revolt, roughly 572 years ago when they summoned and bargained with the Queen of Night and Magic and split the fey roads. Some believe infernal hands were at work in this.

**Zobeck Free Years (FY):** The people of Zobeck revolted against their rule by House Stross 82 years ago, hanging all members of the family and winning a battle against considerable odds. The dating is not used outside the city, but is typical of the reckoning of years in free cities and smaller kingdoms.

## The Seven Regions of Midgard
**The Seven Regions of Midgard**

The Midgard Campaign Setting is really seven regions that are culturally and geographically distinct, and each of these gets a chapter in this book. These are the river and roads of the Crossroads region at the center, surrounded by the Rothenian Plains, the vast mountains and deserts of the Dragon Empire, the Seven Cities peninsula and islands, the blasted ruins of the Wasted West, the imperial hodgepodge of the Grand Duchy of Dornig, and of course the frosty Northlands.

Each of these regions share gods, language, and culture. In general, people of Midgard also refer to the North, West, South, and East as distinct areas, apart from the seven regions. The North includes the dwarfholds of Tanserhall, Stannasgard, Wolfheim, and Thunder Mountain as well as human and inhuman lands such as Trollheim, the Bear Kingdom, Skaldholm, and Huldramose. Most of these lands are small in size and population.

The West includes the region more commonly called the Western Wastes or the Goblin Wastes, the Haunted Lands of the Giants, and the Magocracy of Allain, and the lands beyond the Western Ocean where the elves come from. It also includes many ruins and the crucial western port city of Barsella and the sunken lands of Lost Arbonesse.

Two additional regions are not covered in this book. The first are the Kingdoms of Gold and Salt, also more commonly called the Southlands (including Cindass, Saph-Saph, Roshgazi, Omphaya, Lignas, Morreg, Terrotu, Narumbeki, and Kush). The second is the East, including Khandiria, Sikkim, Beldestan, and Far Cathay. Each area is extensive enough to merit its own catalog of wonders.

## Planes and Hells
**Planes and Hells**

Most adventures happen in the mortal realm of Midgard, but sometimes devils, angels, and the heralds of the gods show themselves and offer greater horizons. These are some of the planes and hells known to the people of Midgard.

**Elflands**

Shining bright, the land of the Last Horn is where the elves

presumably retreated. Its elves holds great fairs and pay homage to kings and queens who speak with the River Lords of the Arbonesse. Their Birch Queen and Oak and Holly Kings are little more than names to mortals, but their silver halls and white horses are sometimes glimpsed in dream or at the edge of the great forests of the world, where the fey roads are still traveled, and where the elven ambassadors sometime come to call on the Imperatrix of the Grand Duchy of Dornig.

**The Eleven Hells**

There has been frequent speculation about the links, if any, between Midgard and the Hells. The places with the keenest answers are surely Neimheim and old Caelmarath, the most debauched and diabolical of the magocracies. Both nations have a history of connections to the 11 Hells, which are listed as the Hells of Fire, Ice, Darkness, Styx-Lethe, Insects, Plague, Acid, Cannibals, Ignorance, Lies, and Blood, though sometimes Fire is described as Sulfur, Acid is sometimes called the Abyss, and sometimes the Hell of Cannibals is instead called the Hell of Decay or Putrefaction. Even the Hell of Blood is confused with the plane of Spears (see Dark Roads & Golden Hells). These planes are the homes of devils and demonic forces, and the common people of Midgard correlate the various supernatural evils as “the Eleven.”

**Evermaw**

Evermaw is confused with the Eleven Hells, since it is an afterlife of ghouls and vampires, cannibals and gluttons. A road like a lolling tongue sprawls through a waterless desert of blood dust, passing towers that sprout like crooked white teeth, until it’s swallowed by the gullet-like sinkhole that houses the city of Vulture’s Beyond, osseous capitol of the Hunger God Vardesain. Here ziggurats flow with the blood of daily sacrifices, liches study new necromancies of flesh and bone, and the cooks claim they can skin and butcher anything, from ghosts to gods.

**Plane of the Marketplace**

Imagine a tangled nest in the branches of the World Tree, formed of stacked shops, stalls, nooks and crannies radiating out in all directions, connected by bridges of rope, wood and bone. It’s a maze of commerce, friendly to all. Visitors can walk the whole way around and never see the same item twice. All things can be bought or sold here—for every faire, fete and bazaar that ever was is a road to and from the Marketplace, and thus it connects to both the cities of Midgard and the fairs of the Elflands.

**Plane of Rusty Gears**

Each plane has its secrets, and the domain of Rava the Gear Goddess is no exception. A visitor can discover the dark side of the Mother of Industry and the Weaver while visiting her purgatories: the Desert of Rust, the Junkyard of Broken Cogs, the Hall of Inevitables’ Fate. Boons and banes aplenty wait for those who dare explore the junk piles and haggle with the strange scavengers and exiles of the rusty gears.

**Plane of Spears**

Some say it’s a punishment for those who revel in killing, others that it’s heaven for the most valorous and bloodthirsty. Here is found all the triumph and tragedy of war, a never-ending glory where the soldiers who die today rise again to re-join their battle again tomorrow, watched over by archdevils, archangels, and all the gods of war, though Mavros is first and foremost. The rivers and rain run bloody, the dreadful sound of screams and war-cries echoes everywhere, and so many swords and spears lay underfoot that it’s the only ground to be found.

**Shadow Realm**

Home of the shadow fey and their dark goddess Sarastra, the Shadow Realm is a place of illusions, half-seen magic and glamours in the dark heart of the fey. Its court is sometimes amused to toy with humans, dwarves, and other delightfully simple-minded folk. The place is known for tricks, cruelty, endless mazes, and strange connections to the Rivers Styx and Lethe. Not a place for the trusting or the weak: the shadow fey are quick to take advantage of their visitors with cunning gifts and false words. The ebon fortresses of the shadow fey here all answer to a fey Court.

**The Storm Court**

Home to Thor, the Shield Maidens, and mighty Wotan, the Storm Court is the place where the Northern gods meet. Their hall and their battleground is said to have a glorious view onto the Plane of Spears. Some believe that the best way to visit is to fly into a raging thunderstorm; few return from that road. Sometimes called Valhalla.

**The Yawning Void**

Far beyond other planes, connected to Midgard by only the most tenuous paths and twists, is Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void, the Realm Beyond. Little can definitively be said of it, other than it harbors monsters and creatures of unspeakable evil, horrors such as nightshades, yithians, gugs, shoggoths, hideous rune giants, leng spiders, hounds of Tindalos, the shining children of Caelmarath, and many more. Few wish to visit, but creatures from that distant and primordial realm seem eager to visit the mortal world.

**Yggdrasil**

The greatest World Tree reaches into all other planes and connects them to Midgard, Valhalla, and the Hells. How to travel its twisting paths and how to evade its guardians are held to be secrets of Wotan and the Northern gods, just as the rivers and roads are secrets of the Southern gods and the elves. Yggdrasil is ancient and perhaps conscious; certain of its trails are easier to follow than others.

## Ley Lines
**Ley Lines**

Ley lines are the scales of Veles, the bones of the world, the blood that makes Midgard live and makes its magic strong. They are invisible rivers of power, and the connecting elements of fey roads and ancient wards as well as the spells of liches and the living.

As power sources, ley lines empower magic both arcane and divine in most places across the face of Midgard. They are invisible to normal sight, but to experienced spellcasters with the Nurian mage feat (see below) they are visible as glowing strings or bands of light. Despite their power, ley lines are not universal: some regions have no ley lines to speak of (such as the Western Wastes), and in others they can be difficult to find (ley lines are notoriously rare underground).

**Classifying Ley Lines**

Ley lines come in three varieties: weak, strong, and titanic. Weak ley lines are found almost everywhere; they whirl on the wind, burble along streambeds, and spring forth from standing stones and ancient trees. Crossroads sometimes draw weak ley lines, as do bridges. Weak ley lines are not found inside consecrated holy or unholy buildings or on freshly plowed earth, however. This suppresses their function for a time, but ley lines generally return when the temple falls or when rain or plant growth restores some vital element to the soil.

Strong ley lines are found in places of magical reputation, which often coincide with locations settled by elves, dragons, and other magical races. These are found on hilltops, river confluences, stone circles, druid groves, elven ruins, deep canyons, rocky spires, and similar places.

Titanic ley lines are very rare and sometimes fleeting. They are found in distant places, in the hearts of great temples, and in other special locations such as the Tower of Boreas. Natural wonders such as the peaks of enormous mountains, towering cliffs, volcanoes, forest heartlands, or a glacier’s heart are often anchors. Greater demons, elder dragons and other creatures of awesome power will often make their lairs along titanic ley lines to further augment their magical might.

Each kind of ley line has a specific ratings and power levels. Weak ley lines can only empower or affect spells of level 0 to 3, strong ley lines can power up to 6th level spells, and titanic ley lines can empower all spells levels. They enable the user to act as if they were using certain metamagic feats, many of them familiar to arcane casters, others entirely new. Though the effects resemble metamagic feats, they are useful only when empowered by the hidden light of the ley lines themselves.

### Locked and Unlocked Ley Lines
**Locked and Unlocked Ley Lines**

Most ley lines always provide the same effect. These are called “locked” ley lines and are the most common kind. For instance, a weak ley line might always provide an Enlarge Spell effect, and a strong one might always provide a Echoing effect. Some such locked ley lines may sometimes have multiple effects or a smaller list to choose from, especially strong and titanic ley lines. For instance, a strong ley line might be locked to Umbral Spell, Spirit Art Spell, and Shadow Grasp in a dark god’s tomb.

The locking means that a ley line is always found in the condition you as the GM decide it is found in, and this generally means it suits the preference of groups or individuals living near it, who understand its power. Newcomers must experiment to discover how it functions.

Newly discovered or abandoned ley lines may sometimes be found unlocked and capable of any power on the table for its strength. Use of the Ley Line Locking feat can set an effect for such a wild, unlocked ley line.

### Ley Line Feats
**Ley Line Feats**

Eight feats are known to be specific to ley line use. Many of them are referred to as Nurian magic or Nurian feats, because ancient Nurian wizards were the first to understand ley line magic.

There has long been a suspicion that Nurian mages are somehow more in tune with the nature of raw magical power than others, and to a certain extent this suspicion is true. Some believe that the reason is their peculiar language, which is in some ways similar to Enochian, the celestial language. Others believe it has more to do with the way Nurian casters use ley lines in everyday spells, rather than merely in major ritual castings—this use of ley lines weakens the ley lines themselves while strengthening the caster’s spells.

**Duplicate Spell \[Metamagic]**

You can tap the power of ley lines to cast the same spell twice.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 9+

**Benefit:** A duplicate spell will manifest itself twice, against two different targets (this feat cannot be used with “Personal” range spells). They cannot overlap in their area of effect or have the same targets, but in all other respects the spell happens twice. A duplicate spell uses up a spell slot twice its normal level.

**Ley Line Channeling**

You can tap the power of ley lines to lower the cost of your metamagic.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may reduce the increase in spell level of any metamagic cost by 1 spell slot. For prepared casters they must be near the line when preparing spells, while spontaneous casters must be near the line while casting them.

**Ley Line Magic**

You can see ley lines and draw on their power.

**Prerequisite:** Spellcraft 3 ranks, Int 13+

**Benefit:** You can sense the presence of any ley line within one mile of your current location. You can tap ley lines for their inherent powers (see “Using Ley Lines” below for details). Once per day, by making a successful caster level check within one mile of a ley line, you regain one spell or spell slot of your choice.

**Ley Line Override**

You can tap the power of ley lines to lower the cost of your metamagic. 

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Ley Line Channeling, Spellcraft 9 ranks, Int 15+

**Benefit:** Once per day when you are within one mile of a ley line, you may cast a spell as if it were affected by a single metamagic feat you possess without altering its spell slot or having prepared it as a metamagic spell. You may not use this to alter a spell such that it would be greater than 9th level if the slot increase were applied.

**Ley Line Locking**

You have learned the secrets of locking ley lines.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Ley Line Channeling, Ley Line Override, Spellcraft 15 ranks, Int 17+

**Benefit:** You have learned to perform a ritual that can lock a ley line (see the rules for ley lines below). This ritual takes a full day to complete and requires 5,000 gp in spell components. You can only lock a ley line to a metamagic you know and which appears in the effects table for a ley line of its power level. You may also use this ritual to unlock a ley line that is currently locked.

**Nurian Mage**

You can tap the power of ley lines to strengthen your magic.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Language (Enochian), Wis 11+, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may choose to strengthen a spell before you cast it by taking a move action to draw the necessary power and expending 50 gp in material spell components. The next spell you cast will have a +1 bonus to its DC value and gain +1 to each dice rolled for damage or effect. Only one Nurian feat may be used when casting a spell.

**Nurian Shield**

You can tap the power of ley lines to protect yourself.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Nurian Mage, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Language (Enochian), Wis 13+, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may choose to gain divine protection before you cast it by taking a move action to draw the necessary power and expending 50 gp in material spell components. The next spell you cast grants you a +4 divine bonus to Armor Class and a +2 to all saving throws until the end of your next turn. Only one Nurian feat may be used when casting a spell.

**Nurian Vitality**

You can tap the power of ley lines to heal yourself.

**Prerequisite:** Ley Line Magic, Nurian Mage, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Language (Enochian), Wis 13+, Int 13+

**Benefit:** When you are within one mile of a ley line, you may choose to heal yourself as you cast a spell. You must declare this before you cast it by taking a move action to draw the necessary power and expending 50 gp in material spell components. The next spell you cast will heal you of 1d8 hp damage for every 4 spellcasting levels you have.  Only one Nurian feat may be used when casting a spell.

### Using Ley Lines
**Using Ley Lines**

To consciously tap the power of ley lines you must take the Ley Line Magic feat. The feat may be learned either from someone already wise in the ways of ley lines or by extended study and experimentation with a readily available ley line.

Ley lines are commonly used to enhance spells with a variety of effects. Ley lines usually provide random powers to those tapping into them, but very powerful practitioners can lock ley lines into providing specific benefits when accessed. A spell caster with access to a locked ley line can be a terrible foe indeed!

To use a ley line you must make a caster level check as a free action just prior to casting your spell. The DC of the check is 10 plus twice the level of the spell being cast. So a 4th level spell would require a DC 14 caster level check. Multiple casters tapping into a ley line can entangle the aura: raise the DC by 1 for each other spell caster who has successfully used the ley line during this combat.

If the check is a success, the caster can roll on the table for that ley line (or use the automatic effect of a locked line). On a critical success (natural 20), the caster chooses any effect on the table for that type of ley line. This includes choosing to roll on a more powerful table, but if that choice is made, roll normally on the next table (the caster cannot choose twice).

A failure other than a natural 1 means the spell functions normally, but gains no boost from a ley line. A natural roll of 1 is a spectacular failure and leads to immediate ley line burnout and backlash (see below). The spell is lost and has no effect. The ley line vanishes for at least 24 hours, sometimes longer (GM’s choice).

### Other Methods for Using Ley Lines
**Other Methods for Using Ley Lines**

It is widely known that ley lines are used to empower fey roads and shadow roads throughout Midgard. The enchantments used to create such roads are secrets of the elves and the shadow fey.

Ley lines can also empower permanent glyphs and wards of various kinds. Aboleths, wizards, and demons know how this is done—some believe the art of glyph magic was taught by Wotan, others that it comes from the archdevil Titivillus.

### Ley Line Burnout
**Ley Line Burnout**

Ley lines burn out if overtaxed. When this happens, any spell being cast by a spellcaster drawing on the ley line fails and that spell slot is expended without effect. The ley line vanishes for at least 24 hours (minimum, this is often longer for titanic ley lines). The caster suffers a backlash effect, chosen by rolling d% on the Ley Line Backlash table.

For a weak ley line, subtract 10 from the d% roll. For a titanic ley line, add 10.
