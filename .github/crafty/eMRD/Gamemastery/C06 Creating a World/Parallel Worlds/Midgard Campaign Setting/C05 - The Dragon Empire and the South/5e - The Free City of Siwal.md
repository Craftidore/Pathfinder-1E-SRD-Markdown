# 5e - The Free City of Siwal
## Overview
**The Free City of Siwal**

Siwal is the largest settlement between the Sands of Sorrows and the Vulture’s Quarter, and it is a center of culture and commerce. Minarets of basalt tower over fountains of granite and marble statuary. Built around a natural oasis and watered with elemental magic, the city’s gardens line all structures in Siwal, including its high outer walls. Great rakishly cut sandships glide silently into the city through tall, intricate gates shaped like enormous cathedral windows. Within, the ships dock at the Iron Spine, a set of thorny wharfs that fill a vast stone-paved dock plaza. In times of plenty, the Spine docks are loud and bustling; in times of piracy and want, they rattle nearly empty, filled with swirling dust devils.

Traditional camel caravans arrive through the narrow Camel Gate carrying salt, spices, barley, and other goods from the cities of the Sultanate. The most famous lodging for the caravaneers is the House of Mehmet, a caravanserai known for the quality of its food, its dislike for preachiness, and the strong arms of its guards.

Siwal is also a city famous for dance, as others are for weaving carpets or creating beautiful books or strong steel and armor. The Zahrah al-Zaina are among the best dancers in the city, though hardly the only ones. Even the sultan’s harem includes a dance troupe. Less reputable independents ply their trade in the caravanserai and in shops near the Iron Spine, where the sand ships dock.

## People of the City
**People of the City**

Despite its lush opulence, Siwal’s inhabitants keep their treasures well guarded by high walls and heavy gates. Urchins as well as storytellers fill the streets, and the Grand Souk reflects the ebb and flow of trade each season. Temple bells ring throughout the day, and the wailing of mourners can be heard from the enormous necropolis north of the city.

The Defender of the Faithful, the Sultan al-Mamun, rules Siwal with his vizier, Akil ibn Khaldun. A hundred difficulties beset the two, from assassins to sand pirates, and from the intrigues of djinn to the dangers of forbidden romance. Fortunately, the city is filled with the brave and the beautiful, and it is famous for its dancers and its dervishes. Siwal need never beg for charity as long as its people are courageous.

## The Tamasheq, People of the Desert
**The Tamasheq, People of the Desert**

The desert cities of Siwal and Saph-Saph are small centers of culture and trade, but they are surrounded by vast hinterlands in the Crescent Desert and the Sarklan Desert, and the desert tribes called the Tamasheq rule these lands. They speak their own hidden tongue, called Tamasheq, as well as the Southern Tongue and not infrequently Gnoll, Draconic, and Kushite. Their lives are spent on the move, from oasis to oasis, keeping herds of goats and camels and conducting trade with the Kingdoms of Gold and Salt. Their warrior-chieftains call themselves the Imajaghan, and a few of them keep hawks and cheetahs as hunting animals. It is said that they have a hidden desert homeland somewhere in the heights of the Chelamite Mountains. They are known to take slaves, and yet rarely sell them.

The Tamasheq display signs of their status in their long white robes and colorful turbans, their exquisitely tooled camel saddles and their elaborate scimitars. They are nomads whose prowess in surviving desert journeys gives them wealth, valuable trade routes, and a position of great influence. They are expert travelers who can ensure a caravan’s safe journey—and also raiders who can destroy even a well-defended caravan or sand ship. Many are rivals to the gnoll tribes and friends to the heru. The Tamasheq abhor the shabti (gearforged) and have little patience for city folk or dragonkin.

They were among the soldiers hired as mercenaries to destroy Roshgazi and drive the minotaurs out of the desert; they consider the minotaurs along the coasts to be dangerous raiders.

## Gate of Old Cyreen
**Gate of Old Cyreen**

The old families of Siwal and their traditions do not change much. Old Cyreen is a city center that used to be the main city gate, before the days of the sandships. People went to meet and discuss politics and commerce at the Old Gate, and hold the yearly festivals of lanterns, of harvest, and of the dead. They still do.

The gate is very large and broad, with a domed covering. The gate was not meant to provide extensive defense before banditry became so entrenched. On the “inside” of the Old Gate is an open yard where people make their ablutions and rest before branching out into the city. This is where the House of Mehmet stands, as well as an open-air market with shrines and counting houses.

## Sand Ships of Siwal
**Sand Ships of Siwal**

The small city of Siwal claims its own Sultanate because of its sand ships, sailing vessels that glide above the desert and can carry small cargos long distances. They connect Saph-Saph, Nuria, Per-Xor, Per-Bastet, and even distant Cindass, Sarkland, and the Southern Kingdoms. The city has only a handful of ships, but they and its water priests keep it from falling into the hands of the Empire or the River Kingdom. Siwal is more valuable as a neutral party than as a tiny vassal.

## The Salt Merchant Meshna Elai
**The Salt Merchant Meshna Elai**

If the party needs a patron to come to Siwal, they might hear from Meshna Elai, the salt merchant. Salt is extremely important to water retention and is a crucial commodity in any desert.

The incredibly rich Meshna (LN male human aristocrat 3/rogue 3/fighter 2) has a palatial estate a short walk from the sultan’s palace. Adventurers in Siwal might come into town after being hired by one of his men, as guards for one of his salt caravans, or as advisors on some difficulty.

## Ancient and Respected Gardeners
**Ancient and Respected Gardeners**

The gardeners of Siwal are priests of the Water Gods Nun and Naunet (masks of the twin gods Yarila and Porevit) revered as teachers and as bringers of life. They oversee not only the strength of the date palms and the yield of the millet and lentil harvests, but also the birth and adulthood ceremonies of all citizens. Without them, the city would be a much smaller place, dependent on imported foodstuff.

Many of these positions are hereditary. The eldest, the Master Gardener Muadil abd-Muadil, is a valued advisor to the Sultan and frequently seen in the palace.

## The Gravebinders
**The Gravebinders**

The gravebinders are the mortuary assistants and funeral advisors for burials in the great Necropolis outside the city, led by the humble Panshal al-Marhji (LN male human cleric 4 \[Aten]) and his daughter Aiysha. There is no death god priesthood in Siwal, that deity being associated with the taint of ghouls. Instead, the gravebinders oversee the making of shrouds, the mourning ceremonies, and the consecration of graves to prevent the rise of undead and to ward off ghouls who seek to despoil burial plots. 

Gravebinders are respected but feared. The four or five families who dominate the trade pass on their secrets from generation to generation. In recent times, they have employed a powerful troll to dig the graves and to watch over the graves by night. Siwalians avoid entering the Necropolis after dark by longstanding tradition.

The work of gravebinders is said to be magical and involves charms and incantations. This is true for the burials of nobles, scholars, heroes and wealthy merchants; for poor artisans, farmers, and priests, the magic might be somewhat less efficacious.

## Adventures in Siwal
**Adventures in Siwal**

Adventures in the oasis of Siwal typically involve the Necropolis, trade, or desert threats.

- Something is luring the city’s daughters into the Necropolis, from which they do not return.
- A sand ship is missing, and sand giant bandits are suspected.
- The new ambassador from Nuria Natal wishes some help disposing of a doppelganger among her servants.
- The Zahrah al-Zaina are seeking new members. Perhaps you could bring them some ostrich plumes and destroy a threatening sand drake’s lair?
