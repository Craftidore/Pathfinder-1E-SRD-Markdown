# 5j - Dragon Magic
## Overview
**Dragon Magic**

Dragon magic is a school of its own study, founded in the draconic language and in an elemental understanding of arcane forces. Dragons seem capable of seeing ley lines while casting spells, and twisting them to enhance or constrict the flow of elemental energy. As a result, many of their spells draw directly on wind and flame, earth and ocean. Dragon magic can be taught to others, and dragonkin and kobold sorcerers are quite common. Some of the most famous spells of the region are given here.

### Heavy Chains
**Heavy Chains**

**School** conjuration (creation) \[earth]

**Level:** Druid 3, Ranger 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Witch 3

**Casting:** Time 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** one creature

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** See text; **Spell Resistance:** No

You conjure dense tendrils of earth which drag and impede your target’s movement. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack. If hit, the target is staggered and entangled, tethered to the ground by the thick earthen chains (preventing movement entirely). The target may make a Strength or Escape Artist check to remove the entangled condition. The DC for this check is the DC for the spell +4.

### Jeweled Bolt
**Jeweled Bolt**

**School** conjuration (creation) \[earth]

**Level:** Druid 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6

**Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target:** One flying creature

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance:** No

A large jagged prismatic crystal bursts from the ground and flies toward its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the crystal shatters into smaller jewels that cover the target and deal 1d4 hp damage per two caster levels. The target must make a Fortitude save or immediately begin falling. If the save is successful, the target descends to the ground in at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no damage upon landing. An affected creature cannot fly until the jewels are removed, a process which takes 10 minutes for Medium-size creatures, 20 for Large, 30 for Huge, and so on.

### Mighty Gale
**Mighty Gale**

**School** evocation \[air]

**Level:** Cleric/Druid 4, Sorcerer/Wizard 4

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** 60 ft.+10 ft./4 levels

**Area:** 60-ft. cone+10 ft./4 levels

**Duration:** instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** None; **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You call forth a mighty cone of winds that batter all creatures and obstacles in its path. Against creatures and moveable objects this wind acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

To destroy immovable objects or structures in the cone, you must make a Strength check. The winds have an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus your best ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you’re trying to break—see “Breaking Items” in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. 

*Mighty gale* extinguishes any fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires from a spell or effect of 4th level or below are also extinguished. Magical fires from a spell or effect of 5th level or higher are unaffected.

### Ocean's Army
**Ocean’s Army**

**School** conjuration (summoning) \[water]

**Level:** Druid 9, Sorcerer/Wizard 9, Summoner 6

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S, M (open body of water - see text)

**Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect:** One Huge water elemental/5 levels

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw:** None; **Spell Resistance:** No

You summon Huge water elementals from a significant body of open water (i.e. not from a puddle or bathtub, but a pond, lake, sea or ocean). You may be mentally command them each round as a swift action to attack foes, tear down structures, and so on.

If within the spell’s range from the water they were summoned from, they can make themselves into a vortex on land, and do not suffer the -4 water mastery penalty. Water elementals that move beyond the spell’s range from the water’s edge lose these bonuses, and the caster must succeed in a DC 25 Spellcraft check each round or that elemental is dispelled.

### Puff of Smoke
**<sup>Puff</sup> of Smoke**

**School** evocation \[air]

**Level:** Bard 0, Druid 0, Ranger 0, Sorcerer/Wizard 0

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect:** Puff of Smoke

**Duration:** 1 round

**Saving Throw:** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance:** No

This cantrip creates a puff of smoke. If the smoke bursts in front of a single creature, you gain complete concealment against that creature unless it makes a successful Reflex save. Sightless and blinded creatures, as well as creatures you are already concealed from, are not affected.

### Riding the Thunder
**Riding the Thunder**

**School** transmutation

**Level:** Cleric 7, Sorcerer/Wizard 7

**Components:** V, S

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Range:** Touch; 1 creature/5 levels

**Duration:** 10 minutes per/level

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude (harmless); **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The target(s) of the spell, which may include the spellcaster, as well as all their equipment carried, become as gaseous and translucent as the air itself. An affected creature is gaseous and can move in any direction, even up or down, at four times its normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through porous objects at half speed. Sight and hearing are limited to 120 ft.

For the duration of the spell, the affected creatures gain a +8 on all Stealth rolls and gain a +4 enhancement bonus on AC, and cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or make physical attacks. They can use supernatural and extraordinary abilities, so long as they do not have to move or touch any objects or creatures to use them.

If you end the spell and rematerialize while inside a material object (such as a wall), you appear at to the nearest open space and take 1d6 hp damage per 5 ft. that you travel.

### Sea of Fire
**Sea of Fire**

**School** conjuration (creation) \[fire]

**Level:** Druid 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Witch 3

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area:** 30 ft. radius spread

**Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Reflex partial; **Spell Resistance:** No

You conjure a sea of flames from the ground at a target location. The area is difficult terrain for the duration of the spell. Creatures take 1d6 hp fire damage and must succeed on a Reflex save or catch fire (see the Burn special attack) each round they remain in the area.

The spell sets fire to combustibles and can melt metals with low melting points. Smoke in the area obscures vision, giving concealment (20% miss chance) to targets within it.

### Thunderbolt
**Thunderbolt**

**School** evocation \[air]

**Level:** Bard 3, Druid 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 3, Witch 3

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target:** 1 creature

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance:** No

You blast your target with a thundering roar. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack. On a hit, you deal 1d6 sound damage per caster level (max 10d6). Regardless of whether you hit, all creatures within 15 feet of the target, including the target itself, must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute.

### Thunderstorm
**Thunderstorm**

School transmutation

**Level:** Cleric 6, Druid 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6, Summoner 5, Witch 6

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** One dragon or draconic creature with the air subtype

**Duration:** 1 hour/level

You are surrounded by dark rolling storm clouds with a radius of 10 ft/caster level while flying, which move with you as you travel. Loud rumbles of thunder regularly emanate from the storm. While flying you have concealment, your overland flight speed is doubled, and you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage. You receive a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to half your caster level. The spell’s effects are suppressed while you travel on land and

resume when you fly again.

### Treasure Chasm
**Treasure Chasm**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) \[mind-affecting] \[earth]

**Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4, Witch 4

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target:** 1 creature

**Duration:** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw:** Will disbelief, see text; **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You convince the target that an immense chasm filled with gold, gems, and other treasure has emerged from the earth at a location within range of the spell. The target is fascinated for the duration of the spell. After having failed a Will save to disbelieve the spell, the target must succeed on a second Will save to willingly move more than 100 feet from the chasm. Hostile action will break the fascination but not the movement restriction.

Dragons and draconic creatures take a -4 penalty to their Will saves to disbelieve this spell.

### Waft
**Waft**

**School** transmutation \[air]

**Level:** Sorcerer/Wizard 1

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Personal

**Target:** You

**Duration:** 1 round

You gain a fly speed of half your movement speed; all movement requires a successful Fly check unless you have other means of propulsion (such as pulling yourself along on a rope, or pushing off a cliff face). In windy conditions you are carried in the direction of the prevailing wind 10 ft./round in a mild wind, 20 ft./round in a strong wind, and 40 ft./round in a gale (GM’s choice for exact path, but in a straight line). If you end your movement in the air after the duration elapses, you fall as normal.

### Wave Riding
**Wave Riding**

**School** transmutation \[water]

**Level:** Cleric 7, Oracle 7, Druid 7, Sorcerer/Wizard 7

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action

**Components:** V, S

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature or object touched of Gargantuan size or less

**Duration:** 30 min./level

**Saving Throw:** Fortitude (harmless); **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creature or object (usually a vehicle) can travel on water as if affected by water walk. The target can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground using its ordinary method of movement. If the target does not ordinarily have a means of movement on land (for example, the spell is cast on an object such as a fallen door), the object gains movement 20 while on the water. The target moves at normal speed when moving against the current, twice normal speed in still water, and three times normal speed when moving with the current. This movement benefit also occurs when the spell is used on creatures or vehicles that normally travel on water.

### Words of Transformation Ritual
**Words of Transformation**

**School** transmutation (polymorph)

**Level:** Cleric/Druid/Oracle 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 7

**Casting Time:** 5 minutes

**Components:** V, S, M (dragon scale, eggshell, magic circle, elements– see text)

**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target:** One reptilian creature

**Duration:** Permanent

**Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

**Spell Resistance:** Yes

Draconic sorcerers and wizards use this specialized form of polymorph to transform kobolds into dragonkin. The *greater words of transformation* ritual transforms dragonkin into drakes (9th level spell, but otherwise the same). The caster must have two pieces of eggshell; one shard from the creature’s current species, and one from the new species.

The subject stands in a magical circle in a temple of the Dragon Gods, surrounded by the four elements and holding the scale and shell. The elemental materials are traditionally a burning golden brazier, a silver bowl of sea water, a crystal vial of wind from a mountain top and a chunk of onyx from far below the surface of the world, though other items might work as well. The caster chants to summon the Elemental Powers. 

The caster must succeed in a DC25 Concentration check once per minute for five minutes or the ritual fails. A failed ritual cannot be attempted on the same subject for another 12 months. Other casters may assist the primary caster in the ritual, following the standard aid another rules.

If the ritual succeeds, there is a rush of wind, a blinding flash of roaring fire, the spell components are consumed, and the subject is transformed into the base type of the intended form (dragonkin or drake). Levels and ability scores remain unchanged except as required by changes to size. New racial ability score modifiers (if any) are applied, and the subject gains any racial abilities of the new form, and loses the old ones.

This change cannot be undone by dispel magic or a magical *disjunction* spell, only by a *wish* or *miracle* spell, or deity level magic.
