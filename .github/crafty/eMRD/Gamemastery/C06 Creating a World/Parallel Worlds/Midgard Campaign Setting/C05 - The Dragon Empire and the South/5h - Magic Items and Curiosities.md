# 5h - Magic Items and Curiosities
## Overview
**Magic Items and Curiosities**

Dragons love magic and create a fair bit of it themselves. The following items are typical of the Mharoti elementalists and their style. The flying items are found at shops catering to the Dragon Lords, such as Flights of Fancy in Harkesh or the Cloud Shop in Ashadar, the Cloud City of Betik.

**Animated Gold:** Animated jewelry is very popular with all dragonkind. These are [[Animated Object (Bestiary PF1)|animated objects]] using the standard rules, sometimes necklaces or bracers, sometimes entire living hoards of the stuff. Wearing such a cloak, gauntlet, or animated serpentine holy symbol of Veles is a mark of status and display. Some such treasures are enchanted to return to their owners if stolen.

**Claw-Blades:** Dragons honor their worthiest followers with blades made from alchemically strengthened claw shavings. These are too valuable to sell, and most are destroyed at the follower’s death or passed on to the next generation as heirlooms. A few are sold; they are typically masterwork quality, with a few humanbane +1 weapons.

**Dragonheart Extract:** This illicit product temporarily enhances the drinker’s strength and endurance. Chronic use leads to permanent scales, reptilian eyes, and other signs of true draconic heritage. Those caught at this advanced stage are either killed, or turned into undead as punishment.

## Harness of Perfect Fit
**Harness of Perfect Fit**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** –

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 26 lbs. (including saddle)

**Description**

When not in use, a *harness of perfect fit* appears to be an ordinary, finely made, leather horse harness (bit, bridle, a saddle, and pack straps). When placed on any mount, it adjusts to mold to the shape of the animal; for instance, the bit changes shape to fit a [[Hippogriff (Bestiary 2 PF1)|hippogriff]]’s beak instead of a horse’s mouth, extra straps appear to accommodate a [[Dragon (Bestiary PF1)|dragon]]’s wings, and the saddle widens to conform to a riding bear’s back.

If a *secure saddle* is attached to the *harness of perfect fit* before the harness is placed on an animal, the saddle will transform along with the rest of the harness.

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]*

**Cost** 900 gp

## Brands of the Rubeshi
**Brands of the Rubeshi**

The branding irons of the Rubeshi are their signature item, the tool they use to mark their slaves and to show their authority. Only the most powerful captains may have and use a personal brand; lesser citizens can only aspire to acquire one from the hand of the Glittering King. Many have been passed down for years from one hand to the next.

The brands are not used on every slave, but only on the most valuable, rare, and powerful creatures. They are meant to humiliate and control the strongest slaves, to show usurpers and rebel leaders the depth of their defeat, and to dispirit other slaves. They are meant to break the strongest.

Each brand is heavily guarded, carried by a captain on his person. Seizing one means a captain has lost his title, and a new house is founded around the brand. It is one of the most valuable treasures seized during a power struggle among the elite of the Despotate.

Destroying a brand brings the immediate wrath of captains and king.

### Brand of the Despot
**Brand of the Despot**

**Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 5,500 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The demon-face glyph of the Ruby Sea sits prominently at the end of blacked branding iron—a few also feature a Captain’s rune or symbol. Its wielder can make a touch attack as she utters the command word. Any creature touched by the brand takes 1 hp nonlethal damage and must obey the wielder to the best of the creature’s ability for one minute. A successful Will save (DC 12) negates the nonlethal damage and the target can act normally. The brand can be heated in a fire of at least torch-size for one minute. Once the brand is heated, it deals 1 hp fire damage in addition to its other effects for one minute. If a creature takes fire damage from the brand, it suffers a −2 penalty on its Will save to resist the brand’s effects.

The slave keepers of the Despotate are issued these brands to control willful or valued slaves. More powerful versions of this item exist, heirlooms from the earliest days of the Despotate.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Bleed (Spell)|bleed]], command, forbid action*

**Cost** 2,750 gp

## Mharoti Carpets
**Mharoti Carpets**

Magical carpets come in many forms, from guardians to maze carpets, hypnotic patterned carpets, and even wizard-locked carpets that must be dispelled to cross. Most are traps, though a few are said to contain spells useful to their owners such as *[[Protection From Evil (Spell)|protection from evil]].*

### Carpet of Fortunate Passage
**Carpet of Fortunate Passage**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** —

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

A lightweight carpet bearing a sunrise or animal motif, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is a great boon to travelers. Once per day, after the command word is spoken, the carpet may be unfurled across any space up to 150 feet across, creating a 10-foot wide path which lasts for 10 minutes. The path may support any weight and may even take the form of a spiral stair for tight quarters.

If the space to be bridged is greater than 150 feet, the carpet fails to activate.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *shadow step*

**Cost** 6,000 gp

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 121

### Carpet of Unwelcome Visitors
**Carpet of Unwelcome Visitors**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** —

**Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

A thick, plush carpet woven with an intricate serpentlike design, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is laid out across an entryway or similar traffic bottleneck. It can be set in one of two ways. First, the carpet can be keyed to a specific passphrase, enabling those who cross it while saying the phrase to travel unmolested. Those who fail to correctly say the phrase are affected by a *[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*, requiring a DC 16 Will save or become frozen in place for 1d4+5 days. Second, it can be set to affect anyone who walks on the carpet until the phrase is spoken a second time. Up to 20 Medium-sized (or 40 Small or 4 Large) humanoids can be frozen on the carpet before it is too crowded to allow further passage.

The effect cannot be disarmed via [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]]. However, an *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* spell can safely roll an unsecured carpet, allowing one to cross the space unaffected. For this reason, many owners affix their carpets in place with trapped, concealed latches.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Sepia Snake Sigil (Spell)|sepia snake sigil]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp

### Carpet of Vexing Imprisonment
**Carpet of Vexing Imprisonment**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th

**Slot** —

**Price** 45,000 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

A heavy carpet woven with a labyrinthine design, this 8-foot by 10-foot item is often laid out across an entryway or similar traffic bottleneck. Once per day, after the command word is spoken, the carpet causes the next creature to cross it to be affected by a *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]* spell. Those initially trapped in the carpet may make a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape after 10 minutes. Unlike the spell, this item only permits one Intelligence check to escape per day, and all creatures within the effect occupy the same labyrinth. Subsequent checks to escape are made at sunrise each day.

Occupants cannot die of starvation or dehydration while in the *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]* effect, and may be freed from the carpet with a command word. Those trapped within the carpet become represented by a small figure woven in the pattern of the fabric.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Maze (Spell)|maze]]*

**Cost** 22,500 gp.

### Rug of Safe Haven
**Rug of Safe Haven**

**Aura** faint transmutation\* (see description); **CL** 3rd

**Slot** —

**Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 7 lbs.

**Description**

A small, 3-foot by 5-foot area rug, woven with a tree motif or a tasseled fringe, this item does not radiate magic when detected, as per *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]]*. However, when the command word is spoken and an edge of the carpet is lifted, an entrance to an extra-dimensional space becomes accessible, as per *[[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]].* This space remains in existence as long as a creature occupies it, and cannot be used to store unattended goods. A creature inside the space may utilize the rug as a trap door at any time while it lies flat.

The same extra-dimensional space is accessed no matter where the rug lies. If someone within the extra-dimensional space wishes to escape the rolled rug, they must succeed against a 17 CMD while trying to open the trapdoor inside the space. Success indicates the escapee is spit out and arrives prone, adjacent to the bearer of the rolled rug. If the rug is being actively held shut, use the possessor’s CMD.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Magic Aura (Spell)|magic aura]], [[Rope Trick (Spell)|rope trick]]*

**Cost** 7,500 gp

## Ring of Flying
**Ring of Flying**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 7th

## Ring of Flying, Improved
**Ring of Flying, Improved**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** ring

**Price** 10,000 gp; Weight –

**Description**

As a *ring of flying*, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer’s [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]] checks.

**Construction**

## Secure Saddle
**Secure Saddle**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** –

**Price** 300 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

This saddle can be plain or ornate, but it appears to have no special features. Once a rider sits on it and speaks the command word, she cannot be unseated from the saddle until she (or someone else) says the deactivating command word. Although popular with horse-mounted cavalry or jousting knights, a *secure saddle* is an essential piece of tack for those who ride pegasi, griffons, or other flying mounts.

Secure saddles have two drawbacks: an attack that would normally knock a rider out of the saddle (for example, a successful [[Unseat (Feat)|Unseat]] attempt) does double damage because she can’t roll with the blow; and if the rider falls asleep, is knocked [[Unconscious|unconscious]], or dies in the saddle, she remains there if she didn’t share the command word with a comrade.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Wondrous Item (Feat)|Craft Wondrous Item]], *[[Make Whole (Spell)|make whole]]*

**Cost** 150 gp

**Source:** Midgard Campaign Setting (Open Design), pg. 122

## Wind Jars
**Wind Jars**

From simple jars of foreign air to magical bags of wind, the Azuranites drive this peculiar but thriving wind economy. The exact purpose for all this fancy air is somewhat obscure, but air from distant lands or high peaks is considered to grant virtue or blessings to followers of the Winds. Any casting of a spell with the \[air] descriptor that involves a wind jar gains a +1 to the DC of all related saving throws, and *[[Gust of Wind (Spell)|gust of wind]]* spells cast using a wind jar treat target creatures as if they were one size category smaller. The wind jar is consumed in the casting.
