**Necklace Garrote:** This deadly item is a strong wire concealed by false gems, stones, or pearls and worn as jewelry. A snap of the wire breaks off the adornments, and the clasp doubles as finger grips. If the wielder successfully controls a grapple, she inflicts an additional 1d4 damage, regardless of the action chosen, and the victim suffers 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Additionally, the victim suffers a penalty equal to the attacker’s Strength modifier to all rolls while [[Grappled|grappled]]. A Constitution check (DC = 10 + hp damage dealt this round) reduces the Constitution damage by one-half, minimum of 1.

**Mharoti Scorpion Stiletto:** This masterwork weapon has an extremely sharp point but no cutting edge. During construction a special process infuses the blade with the distilled venom of a Mharoti emerald scorpion. A successful hit with the stiletto poisons the victim. After five strikes the poison is depleted and the blade cannot be reinfused.

**Mharoti emerald scorpion:** Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 21; Frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; Effect 1d4 Con damage; Cure 2 consecutive saves; Price 500 gp.

**Trump:** A 2-ft. long, bronze-lined barrel packed with an alchemical mixture on a pole, the trump projects fire a few feet in front of it. Attacking with a trump is a melee touch attack that can be part of a full attack action. A trump’s damage is unaffected by Strength or feats that increase damage, such as [[Power Attack (Feat)|Power Attack]] or [[Vital Strike (Feat)|Vital Strike]]. Loading a trump  with fuel is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. 

*Trump Fuel*—An alchemical mix of resins, pitch, sulfur, and straw, wrapped in cloth or burlap, a single billet of trump fuel burns for 5 min.

Though the human word “trump” describes its resemblance to the trumpet, the dwarven term translates to “troll stick,” indicating the dwarves’ favored use for it.
