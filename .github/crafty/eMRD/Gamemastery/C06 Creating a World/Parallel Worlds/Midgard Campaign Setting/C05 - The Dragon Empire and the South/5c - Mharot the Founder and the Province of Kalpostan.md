# 5c - Mharot the Founder and the Province of Kalpostan
## Overview
**Mharot the Founder and the Province of Kalpostan**

*First Lord of the Empire, Duke of All Flames, Master of the Compact, Great Khan of the Province of Kalpostan (LN colossal male ancient fire dragon elementalist 19)*

The eldest and most powerful elementalist of the Empire is Mharot, the dragon who first suggested the Compact that formed the empire. Together with Ibbalan, he convinced his fellows to try something new. Despite the venture’s obvious success, he rarely leaves the old provincial backwater of Kalpostan; Harkesh and the west are not for him.

Mharot’s black wings are streaked with gray, and his presence is so overwhelming that kobolds and even some dragonkin find themselves compelled to worship him when in his presence. Mharot ignores them, speaking primarily to the crimson drakes and marshals who command his legions of fire giants, wyrms, fire scale dragonkin, and salamanders.

Hundreds of dragonkin and drakes attend to his Fire Seal Mountain cavern, a place filled with tribute and rarely open to visitors. Mharot himself spends much of his time sleeping, waking once or twice a year to attend to urgent matters such as devouring a herd of cattle, appointing emissaries, and speaking the Words of Transformation (see pg. 126 over new-made drakes. His politicking and counseling to the sultana also takes time each spring, since he is the voice of the Compact. 

He has mellowed with age, and his scales have grown glossy and golden with the years. Mharot’s treasure hoard is said to rival mountains in size.

### Kalpostan, the Province of the Heart
**Kalpostan, the Province of the Heart**

Deep in the Dragoncoil Mountains, this is where the Compact was first signed. Though the province is vast, it remains largely unpopulated. The dragon Mharot still maintains his ancient lair here, in a valley with three small villages and a nigh-unclimbable peak called the Signer’s Tower. The runes carved into the mountain name the 12 dragons who first swore to gather together to create the Empire. Mharot spends little time here.

All sorts of wild stories exist about Mharot’s Valley in Kalpostan, but most of its people are farmers and herdsman in the fertile valleys, maintaining the enormous herds that feed the Empire. Kalpostan provides spearmen and slingers, smiths and armorers, and miners and fullers to the Empire. In many ways, its status as the forgotten heartland of the empire means it has changed less than the regions the dragons conquered to the west and south of Kalpostan.

It is also home to one of the great temples of Baal outside the capital, the Shimmering Temple. Its heart is so hot that the earth is molten, and the land around it is surrounded by brightly colored hot springs, each filled with water hot enough to boil flesh from bone. The priesthood of the Shimmering Temple numbers a mere 50, but each is a master of fire and a child of Mharot.

## Ibbalan the Illustrious and the Province of Mezar
**Ibbalan the Illustrious and the Province of Mezar**

*The Scribe of the Pact, Eldest Morza, the Gold-Cloaked, Khan of the Province of Mezar (LE gargantuan wyrm male gold dragon ravener)* 

The empire is Ibbalan’s brood and the world his hoard. After having forged the pacts that founded the empire, he left the old lands of Mharot, his primary rival, and led the armies to victory under his benevolent wings. Since Ibbalan is the eldest Dragon Lord, he was also the first to die of old age. Unlike the others, he was prepared for his demise. The Empire’s guide and guardian in life, by Lord Baal’s power Ibbalan sacrificed both his living flesh and eternal rest to finish his incomplete draconic designs upon the mortal world.

Ibbalan wears his hoard as a golden hide of gem-studded scales over his ancient bones. Along with glorious regalia replete with a crown of orichalcum horns and gilded death mask, he bears an uncanny resemblance to his living form. Yet in his ashen heart Ibbalan realizes it is all a facsimile. He has grown reclusive, directing policy through envoys. Audiences with him consist of executions of criminals, war prisoners, and seditionists, their essences fuel for his immortal soul-fire.

The non-scaly folk of Mezar are terrified of Ibbalan, and they speak of him as of the worst sort of devil. The dragonkin revere him as the soul of wealth and duty.

### Mezar, Province of Trade and the Maze
**Mezar, Province of Trade and the Maze**

The province nearest to the border with Nuria Natal is a place of burial and raids, since there is no peace between the River Kings and the Mharoti. Ruled by Ibbalan the Illustrious and guarded by legions living and dead, the Mezar province stands ready for a Nurian invasion and constantly prepares for the Empire’s next attempt to annex Nuria and Per Bastet.

Mezar includes the vital trade routes from east to west and connects merchant centers from Siwal to Sarkland and far beyond, to Capleon, the White Sea, and elsewhere.

**City of Irkaly:** Home to the Great Souk where Sarkandi carpets and Khandiri spices are sold to Nuria and Capleon traders, Irkaly is also the seat of power for Ibbalan. It hosts great garrisons and the Elemental Academy, a training ground for the timarli and edjet wizards of the dragonkin.

**Harbor City of Prezhan:** Home to the Ageless Spire, a great temple of Seggotan, as well as the naval base of the Mharoti, Prezhan was one of the first major ports that the Empire seized, about 200 years ago. Remnants of its legacy as a minotaur city are few and far between, though a great and labyrinthine cave system is said to connect many of its key points. Its harbor boasts a large lighthouse maintained by the priests of Baal, but the city belongs to the marine side of the elements. The Sea Sage Storros occasionally visits the city.

**Efesis:** A city of leisure and culture, beloved by drakes for its fine updrafts and views over the sea. An enormous necropolis of fine vaults and monuments is empty of bones; they have all been raised and sent marching to Nuria Natal, and most now lie scattered in the Sarklan Desert.

## Lashmaraq Talshah and the Province of Hariz
**Lashmaraq Talshah and the Province of Hariz**

*Queen of Fury, Marshall of Mayhem, Morza of Beloved Hariz, Defender of the Pact, Voice of Order (LE  gargantuan female very old red dragon)*

Lashmaraq Talshah rules over the isolated Hariz territory on the borders of Beldestan and Khandiria, and she is bent on expanding her territories and the Empire. To enable this conquest, she has spent decades building an elite army of dragonkin, drakes, elementals, and humans, arming them all with magic and the best equipment. Her forces are well trained, fast, lean, and ferocious—but most of all, they are deadly and efficient, much like the Dragon Lord herself. Lashmaraq allows no waste and suffers no incompetence in her army’s ranks. Her minions keep meticulous records on everything, and her spies keep a keen eye on the other Dragon Lords and her enemies, reporting their every move back to her.

Lashmaraq lairs somewhere deep within the Lumera forest, in a sinkhole and cavern large enough for her to fly within. She works hard for every copper in her hoard, and twice as hard to keep her troops fit, equipped, and ready for the day they march south and west.

Despite her distance from Harkesh and the intrigues of the throne, the other Dragon Lords fear Lashmaraq Talshah. She might, after all, someday deem them inefficient and unnecessary. At such a point, the rumors claim, she will rise against them, usurping the empire for herself and uniting it under one capable, strong leader. Until then, she is kept busy defending the northern and eastern borders, far from the centers of power.

### Hariz, Province of the Empty Road
**Hariz, Province of the Empty Road**

Primarily open plains and dense forest, Hariz is relatively unsettled, and many of its inhabitants are nomadic centaurs, humans, and gnolls. The land is under Mharoti control, but with few connections to the rest of the Empire and with the threat of horse tribes north and east, it is both somewhat isolated and very poor.

Tabur: The city of Tabur is the only settlement of size in Hariz. Most of its plains and forests are covered with small villages or the yurts of nomadic shepherds who provide meat, wool, and parchment for the western provinces. Tabur trades east to Cathay and Sikkim, and north as far as Vidim and Neimheim, over the plains. Its caravans are well protected, but the dragonkin and kobolds dislike the long trek over the plains, which can take months.

## Parsis the Hidden and the Province of Betik
**Parsis the Hidden and the Province of Betik**

*Master of the Fields and Clouds, Wisest of Lords, the Lord of Chains, Morza of Wisdom, Khan of the Province of Betik (N huge adult male gold dragon)*

As one of only two golden wind dragons of the Empire, Parsis is an exotic creature even among the morza. Parsis works extremely well within the Empire’s structure, and he delegates far less of his province’s rule than the others. Indeed, Parsis retains a tight-knit council called the Golden Circle to conduct the everyday work of Betik, his central province. These circle members know his affinity for shapeshifting and disguising his identity: Parsis wanders Betik’s cities disguised as a dragonkin or even one of the non-scaly folk, as a lawyer, scholar, alchemist, or other academic. He loves learning and sharing wisdom, as well as the sound of his own voice. He is also a military genius at tactics and strategy, and thus holds the hinge province that controls much of the Empire. Just as important as Parsis’ military acumen is his political and diplomatic skill, and he maintains the Mharoti spy network with the Vizier Kah-Vizier Wassan hin Usbar wal-Akeshaba.

The Golden Circle is known for fairness, but recently it has been dogged by rumors of corruption and betrayal as some of Parsis’ most valued councilors have been murdered by harem assassins (see p. 107). Some believe that Parsis has many hidden children, pretending to be humble jambuka but truly dragon-blooded. This makes the other morza distrust Parsis all the more.

### Betik, Province of the Book
**Betik, Province of the Book**

The province of Parsis is home to universities, famous astronomical observatories, and hoards of magic stolen from all corners of the earth. This was, indeed, a dragon-ruled land even before the Mharoti compact that founded the empire, and might be the place where the dragonkin first walked the earth, though their origin is much disputed. Some believe that the dragonkin are simply large and powerful kobolds, much as hobgoblins are larger and more organized goblins.

In any case, Betik is home to the Hidden University, built on a mountaintop. It is also home to a captured flying city of Sikkim, renamed the cloud city of Ashadar and used as the lair and treasure of morza Parsis the Hidden. His Golden Circle of advisors lives in Ashadar and in the ground city of Uqmal. The Hidden University in Ashadar is home to a wizard’s collegium limited to dragonkin and the dragon-blooded, and six traditional schools of literature, alchemy, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology open to anyone with the skills to pass the scholar’s exam to get in.

Indeed, the whole of Betik is riddled with invisible castles, cloudtop fortresses, and devices meant to enhance or confound scrying. It has many active ley lines and is widely considered the arcane heart of the Empire. Its scrying is accurate and used for purposes grandiose and mundane: the servants of Parsis confirm tribute is paid, choose a direction for the sultana’s armies to march, and even question the spirits, angels, and heralds of enemy gods. Drakes and dragons fly into and out of Ashadar on a daily basis. The city is much too valuable to risk as a military tool, but it does give Parsis a certain level of semi-divine authority.

## Rüzgar, the Dragon of Fog and Hungers
**Rüzgar, the Dragon of Fog and Hungers, and the Borders of Zaldiri**

*Blood Duke of the Dragoncoil Heart, Khan of the Province of Zaldiri (NE huge adult male cave dragon)*

Rüzgar is a strange cave dragon who enjoys the surface and heights, though his lair is deep beneath the earth like all of his kind. Currently he rules the Empire’s northwestern frontier province, a lively place of frequent warfare against Illyria and the Magdar Kingdom, as well as lands more recently conquered such as the eastern sections of Illyria. Most of this territory is thinly populated, and Rüzgar’s enormous hunger for meat and disregard for governing means that it remains largely unsettled beyond a few brave kobolds and jambuka. Armies march under his command, and his thirst for battle means he cares little for anything other than finding enemies and devouring them. The sultana finds Rüzgar useful but rather tiresomely vain and one-dimensional.

Rüzgar’s Hollow Palace is a hillside cavern overlooking the city of Zaldiri, and he comes out primarily at night. Many believe he is secretly in league with followers of the White Goddess or with ghoul servants of Mordiggian. His gray-black hide is deeply scarred by battle, and his scales have regrown many times, each time tougher and more ragged. His wings are bones and tatters, and Rüzgar cannot fly.

### Zaldiri, the Border Province
**Zaldiri, the Border Province**

The lands near Illyria and Magdar are new provinces under the control of the dragon Rüzgar, the dragon of fog and darkness. They are loosely held at the moment, with legions of soldiers camped in the ruins of Pharos. The Zaldiri lands that are most stable are the Marea and Achillon, old cities conquered more than a century ago. The newly conquered Illyrian heartland and Parszan are rebellious and troublesome, but the Mharoti reprisals against rebels have been ruthless and thorough. The land around Parszan remains contested by bandits, cultists of the White Goddess, Illyrian troops, and even Magdar or Triolan raiders. The Empire’s hold is tight within the city walls of Parszan, looser everywhere else. The primary source of supply to the region is by wagon train from the city of Zaldiri.

**Ruins of Pharos:** Once a seat of learning and a hub of trade, Pharos was razed during the dragon invasion across the Mavressa Straits and has never been rebuilt. Its ruins are swampy, but towers, hillocks, and even half-flooded caverns abound. The place is said to be home to dark dragons and darker ghosts.

**Zaldiri:** Built at the mouth of the River Tragos and supplied by sea more than by land, the city is entirely of Mharoti construction, with wide streets and frequent perches to satisfy any drake or dragon. The city is famed for its extensive underground tunnels, cisterns, and caverns, since Rüzgar prefers not to travel above ground by day. The city’s temple of Khespotan is called the Telluric Cathedral, a place encrusted in runes, crystal, and powerful ley line magic that dragons find congenial. The underground complex includes a set of sacred catacombs, which are forbidden to all but the scaly folk.

## Yiraz Azah and the Province of Marea and the Isl
**Yiraz Azah and the Province of Marea and the Islands**

*The Cloud Chaser, Morza of Silver Frost, Khanum of the Province of Marea (LG gargantuan female old wind (silver) dragon)*

Yiraz is one of the few morza that is not from the Dragoncoil Mountains, but rather an emissary from a distant realm in the North. Her gleaming scales and shimmering wings are famously bright, and as a devotee of Azuran, she has preached peace and prosperity rather than the Empire’s usual wrath and conquest since the day she first arrived. Her fellow morza found this more than mildly embarrassing, and so the empire’s fire dragons assassinated her silver dragon host. She surprised them by claiming his mantle as a morza. She is known for her airy messengers and elemental planar allies, and her province of Marea is unusual for hosting a temple to Boreas, a god rarely found this far south.

Recently, Yiraz Azah’s thunderous forces have fought against Illyria, Kyprion, and Triolo to expand the empire. The irony of her yearning and preaching for peace while practicing war hasn’t escaped the dragon. She believes in a chivalrous conquest that brings territories swiftly under her protectorate, rather than letting them fall into the hands of the fire dragons or the rapacious Rüzgar.

### Marea and the Islands, Province of Fallen Temples
**Marea and the Islands, Province of Fallen Temples**

The conquest of Achillon and its territories is 100 years in the past, but the land retains a different character than the lands east of the Mavressa Strait. Heavily populated by humans related to the Illyrians and Triolans, Marea and the islands of Eraklion and Rados are one of the rare places in the empire where the dragonkin are distinctly in the minority. Human troops, farmers, and merchants are the majority, a few kobolds and gearforged remain in the area, and the region still speaks the Trade Tongue as often as Draconic. It is ruled with a light hand by Yiraz Azah, the silver dragon scion.

Marea and the islands also retain a distinct faith centered on Rava, Nethus, Charun, Apollon (Khors), and Ceres. The dragon gods have temples here, but they often remain empty. Yiraz’s temple to Boreas likewise has few followers. The arrival of priests of Seggotan at the temples of Nethus 10 years ago was met with anger and rioting. The temples of Nethus now stand mute and empty, and his few priests are found in the harbors or aboard ship. The Mharoti believe that these priests are organizing a rebellion against draconic rule.

**Achillon:** A human city of merchants and architects. Known for sculptors, and clever accountants, this is one of the few places in the empire where gearforged live in some numbers.

**Eraklion:** A small fishing island that is also home to a Temple of Nethus now dedicated to Seggotan.

**Methony:** A small circular fortress guards the harbor of this important naval outpost. The city is a key point of the Mharoti defenses against Triolan corsairs. Its governor and garrison commander are one and the same, a dragonkin elementalist named Serhat Baalat (LN male dragonkin sorcerer 9).

**Mistras-Marea:** A silk-producing city on a mountaintop with a long tradition of producing its wares only for dragonkin and officials of the Empire.

**Rados:** A naval outpost that consists entirely of a fortress and small harbor that covers much of the island. It has a spring and well water to withstand long sieges.

## The Dragoncoil Mountains
**The Dragoncoil Mountains**

The mountains are prime dragon territory, full of small villages of dragonkin, huge herds of mountain goats and sheep, and home to the finest flying conditions. When westerly or southerly winds hit the peaks, rising currents along the ridgelines are perfect for long soaring and gliding for hundreds of miles.

The peaks are always covered in snow, and the valleys are home to hundreds of small lakes and glaciers. Dragons swarm in the air in the mountains, hunting, flying for pleasure, or taking an offering to one of the tiny Dragoncoil temples, accessible only by air or by a long, long climb. Some believe that the dragonkin were created here, and they are at home as an alpine race.
