# 5b - Harkesh, the Provinces, and the Great Dragon Lords
## Overview
**Harkesh, the Provinces, and the Great Dragon Lords**

The empire is divided among its lords into eight provinces. Each lord considers its domain the most important, but in truth all have their virtues and some are clearly more magical, more fertile, or more spacious than others. Poets declaim the virtues of the provinces to each Dragon Lord as a matter of public order. It is important to know that the most beautiful, bounteous, learned, and fruitful province is the one a traveler finds himself in.

Mharot and seven companions are the surviving dragon lords of the twelve who formed the original compact over 300 years ago. They are three fire dragons (called red dragons in the North), one cave dragon, one silver and two gold dragons (called wind dragons within the empire), and one star drake.

## Seggotan's Demesne
**Seggotan’s Demesne**

The ninth province of the empire is that of the sea, the domain of Seggotan and the route to riches south and east of the Empire, and to trade connections to Triolo and the North. The waves and islands are the great dragon turtle’s domain, and this dragon is accounted the admiral of the Mharoti fleet, charged with destroying Triolan, Khandirian, and Nurian shipping in times of war.

Storros is somewhat slothful in this duty, preferring knowledge over valor—thus his title as the Sea Sage. Some of his children and servants are much more aggressive in pressing the fight. Sea serpents and dragons are not the empire’s only navy: considerable effort is expended on war galleys and barges that carry wind or fire dragons over the sea. The region under the waves might be claimed and ruled by Storros, but in practice the province is rarely visited by humanoids.

## Ateshah, the Heart of the Desert, and the Province
**Ateshah, the Heart of the Desert, and the Province of Gizmiri**

*Padashah of the Flaming City, Morza of the East, Khan of the Province of Gizmiri* (NE colossal great wyrm fire dragon)

The dominion of Ateshah is the Burning Sands, a deadly wasteland that is what it is because of the dragon who rules it. Ateshah incorporates the essence of fire as few dragons do: his fiery presence creates the desert around him, and he carries it with him wherever he goes.

Ateshah lives in the holy temple of Al-Ajach in the city of Sarkland. Only dragonkin, efreet, and other fiery creatures can survive the burning presence of Ateshah. He hasn’t left the temple for decades, but the Mharoti fear the prophesized day when he will.

Ateshah’s ultimate goal is to turn all of Midgard into an extension of his realm. Instead of putting himself at risk by waging wars, he searches for ancient knowledge to increase the reach of his presence over the known world.

## Gizmiri, the Red Province
**Gizmiri, the Red Province**

Gizmiri is a wasteland of red desert sand and bones, the remnants of entire armies of Khandiria. Ruled by the fire dragon Ateshah, little grows here and most inhabitants are kobolds and dragonkin who profit from its mines and the fishing along the coast. The ruins of several Khandirian cities litter the plain, each thoroughly sacked and plundered when the Dragon Empire took the city. In other places, small mounds stand out from the flat landscape; these are the burial mounds of dragons slain in battle by Khandirian sorcery.

**Sarkland, the City of Dust:** The largest—and more or less only—city of Gizmiri is Sarkland, a hive of military watchfulness and the springboard for spring or fall campaigns against the Khandiri. It is the central breeding ground for war lizards and hunting lizards, both of which enjoy the baked clay of Gizmiri and eat desert weeds and aloe plants without complaint.

Sarkland is also a trade center and a crossroads for goods and ideas, and grows it rich by selling everything to everyone. That said, the  city has its own character as well: the bazaars are enormous, built to dragon scale, for the scaled folk love to haggle (and are not above arguing over a price in the noonday sun with a human trader, to watch the seller wilt). Everywhere are small tea shops and the gilded and copper trinkets that the Sarklanders love.

The finest shops sell magical carpets, some enchanted with maze designs from Kyprion, others showings the gold-coin patterns that dragonkin adore, and still others shimmering with a peacock’s spread of rich colors that bring magical balm and blessings to those who keep them in their homes. The looms from which the Sarkandi carpets spring demand the constant work of the province’s people: keeping sheep and silkworms, harvesting, dying, and spinning the yarns, and finally weaving them. It takes years to create a large work, or even decades for a large, enchanted carpet. Rare war carpets are dyed with the blood of the fallen and displayed as memorials.

## Satarah al-Beldestani and the Capital Province of
**Satarah al-Beldestani and the Capital Province of Harkesh**

The Keeper of the City, Castellan of Harkesh, Counter of Coin (NE Small female star drake)

When Satarah, the legendary dragonkin paladin of Seggotan climbed the Sky Stairs of Beldestan, most expected that to be the end of her legend. Yet she returned, transformed into a star drake, and her goodness and righteous strength had been transformed into a much wilier, more cynical, and cunning character. Many refused to believe she was the same person, but rather some cursed creature who was impersonating the legend.

But magical divination and consultation with spirits alike confirmed it was Satarah, and she had returned with a mission from Seggotan and Veles-Beyond-the-Void. Her secret knowledge has astonished the oracles and great dragons throughout the empire, and Satarah has led the imperial legions to triumph against Khandiria, seized power in the province of Harkesh, and is leading a growing movement to declare a dangerous war on Nuria Natal. Satarah is implacable and hungry for power, and her new form has expanded her ambition a hundredfold.

## Harkesh the Golden City
**Harkesh the Golden City**

The dragonkin say, “Harkesh shines like gold in the sun,” by which they mean it is both a treasure and a tremendous distraction from other things. The capital city is a province unto itself, and includes most of the flatlands on the southern shore of the Mavressa Strait. Its huge population depends on the other provinces to feed it, with huge grain shipments arriving daily from Marea and from Nuria, and herds of sheep and goats driven down from pastures in the Dragoncoil Mountains in spring, summer, and fall. Steel, copper, ceramic tiles, straw, fodder, and leather: everything comes to Harkesh in vast quantities. Even its water is piped in via an aqueduct supplementing the output of its many springs.

Harkesh contains tiny patches of claimed ground, small fiefdoms held as lairs by the noble courtiers to the sultana, kobolds and dragonkin and others. The manors and perching towers are well decorated and guarded, and a surprising amount of the land is given over to private gardens. The city’s enormous size makes it the center of Mharoti political life, though the Great Dragon Lords visit rarely. More often, they send emissaries, factotums, and various courtiers to plead before the Portal of the Void, the capital’s enormous (and enormously empty) temple to Veles, the invisible and infinite world serpent (see page 230).

The docks of Harkesh throng with people from a dozen lands, and here Rubeshi slaver-pirates rub shoulders with Friulan librarians, Khandirian priest-nobles, Bemmean apprentices, Nurian smiths, and Triolan merchants. Though Harkesh is a place of politics, the harbor has room for a thousand ships and practically forms a second city in the straits. Some say the draconic waterfolk—a strange breed of sailing gypsies called the Seggosi—need never step foot on land. They are responsible for the Empire’s trade in grain, fish, timber, metals, and dyes.

### Highlights of Harkesh
**Highlights of Harkesh**

It is impossible to do justice to all the marvels of Harkesh, its variety, its small miracles, its cruelties and hidden byways. Here are 20 places visitors might wish to see for themselves.

**Arsenal of Mharot:** Containing weapons, armor, fire potions, alchemical smoke and heat stones, and entire siege weapons stored for transport by ogres in harness, the Arsenal of Mharot is heavily guarded, heavily warded, and never empty. The Arsenal’s Quartermaster is Golmesh al-Fainnec, a desert dragon related to the sultana.

**Azuran Open Temple:** This mountaintop temple has a commanding view of the city and the straits.

**Brotherhood Temples:** Priestly warriors of the elements make their vows and then come here to train in combat. Schools of war more than schools of theology, the five brotherhoods are also charitable societies devoted to feeding the poor.

**Drake’s Quarter:** Along a cliff in the southern portion of the old harbor, hundreds of drakes have carved elaborate homes in the sheer rock.

**Edjet Barracks:** The barracks stand apart from the palace, and empty during the summer campaigning season. The sultana’s favored troops rest here in the winter, and sometimes riot for better food or more heatstones.

**Flights of Fancy:** A shop specializing in flying creatures and flying magic. The owner Zingara Paltikarza (LG female human sorcerer 11 \[elemental bloodline]), has close connections to Yiraz Azah, the powerful Dragon Lord of Marea. Some believe Zingara once assisted the Dragon Lord on the front lines in her expansion efforts, before retiring to a quieter life selling magic.

**Four Pillars of Wisdom:** Four temples of Azuran lie within sight of each other. Street battles between them are somewhat ritualized for the first day of each month. Murder is not infrequent when the sects are at odds with one another.

**Grand Bazaar:** Anything and everything is for sale here, and carpets and incense are merely the start. See page 118 for details of the exotic creatures and materials bought and sold in Harkesh.

**Great Fane of Baal:** The fane is lavishly decorated with eternal flames, garish red stone arches, and gilded statuary. The Great Fane is not subtle, and it is never cold. A favored place for young courting couples among the dragonkin.

**Greenscale Armory:** This small armory for drakes and dragons caters to scaly races, with harnesses that can help an adult dragon reliably carry a company of 50 or more kobolds in flight, or with claw sheaths enchanted to intercept spells or sunder feathery wings. The Greenscale Armory’s secrets are rarely seen outside the field of battle.

**Imperial Palace of the Eight Elements:** The Sultana’s Palace is a sprawling complex of gardens, barracks, halls, harem, and private apartments, combined with state rooms for the Sublime Throne and halls for business and entertainment. A high walkway connects it directly to the Sultan’s Fire Shrine.

**Island of Green Tides:** The great temple of Seggotan is an island unto itself, and also the site of the city’s customs and home to its harbormaster.

**Mavressa Ferry Dock:** Every day, thousands of dragonkin and visitors march onto the great ferries and make the one hour crossing to the Zaldiri lands.

**Necropolis of Khespotan and the Step Temple:** The Step Temple is carved out of the stone and entirely below ground level. The Necropolis is enormous, rivaling those of Nuria Natal and Siwal.

**Portal of the Void:** The temple of Veles is not much of a religious destination, since it has so few priests, but it serves as the house of justice and negotiation. Contracts are signed here, marriages arranged, and oaths sworn.

**Sultan’s Fire Shrine:** An entirely gilded temple near the palace, once for the sole use of the sultan and the morza, now used for high state occasions and readings of the auguries.

**Triolan Quarter:** A walled ghetto for non-scaly folk, and most Septime and Nuria visitors stay here. The Triolan merchant houses all maintain warehouses here, even in times of war. The warehouses are occasionally looted by angry mobs of dragonkin or kobolds when a Triolan fleet commits some impertinence.

**Western Docks:** The merchant docks are always full with 100 galleons and 200 galleys from the Ruby Sea and from Friula. Non-Mharoti ships are given poorer berths farther from well-maintained quays and warehouses. Most of the heavy lifting for foreigners is done by ogres and some kobold crews. For the sultana’s favored merchants, wyverns snatch materials off the deck and giant lizards carry heavier loads directly to the nearest warehouse.

**Winter Palace of the King of Kobold Kings:** A rat’s nest guarded by thousands of officious doormen, courtiers, functionaries, and trapsmiths, the Palace of the King of Kings is an amusement to some.

## Figures of the Court
**Figures of the Court**

The first and most important figure of the Elemental Court of the Mharoti Empire is Sultana Casmara herself, naturally. But wizards, drakes, dragonkin, and stranger figures throng its halls by the dozens every day. Here are some important functionaries adventurers might meet in the palace or within the city and its waters.

### Aban Qalam ("Wyrm That Walks")
**Aban Qalam (“Wyrm That Walks”)**

As the Mharoti ambassador to Bemmea, the elementalist Aban (NE dragonkin wizard 10) experimented with augmenting his draconic blood, inadvertently altering himself forever. Recently recalled home to bolster his patron’s forces, he has developed other plans, involving a change of rulership in one of the provinces. He plots quietly but effectively, and clearly controls a fey road from Bemmea to Harkesh, a tool that saves him a great deal of overland travel.

### Jabbir, Herald to the Court
**Jabbir, Herald to the Court**

Officially only a herald of Harkesh, this little rakish fop of a faerie dragon is a master illusionist and enchanter (CN male faerie dragon illusionist 8). Secretly, he serves as spymaster for his Great Lord Satarah and, when required, as an assassin.

### Storros the Sea Sage
**Storros the Sea Sage**

With a dozen titles such as Defender of the Middle Sea, Herald of Seggotan, Khan of the Waters, and more, Storros the Sea Sage (N ancient male dragon turtle diviner 12) is one of the most respected councilors of the Dragon Empire and a gifted diviner who keeps an eye on the possible futures spoken by Veles and Seggotan. When he isn’t listening to the voices of the undercurrents he keeps to his lair, the Deep Blue Vault, an underwater library whose shelves are made from the sunken wrecks of hundreds of ships.

Sea denizens travel Midgard’s oceans to find more wrecks filled with valuables. In the Deep Blue Vault, the Hall of Figureheads is a place of carvings, which Storros questions about their former ships and their travels. Storros is consulted when some fateful decision for the Empire is required; he is a neutral party and often asked to speak on matters of justice or etiquette as well as matters of wisdom.

### Vorel
**Vorel**

The Mistress of the Royal Harem and the former sultan’s spymaster, Vorel (LG female silver dragon) specializes in forbidden information and even more forbidden acts. She organizes the sultana’s celebrations, and she gathers intelligence in plain sight though her sharp hearing and clever questioning. Vorel is the leader of the empire’s harem assassins, women trained to destroy rebels against the throne. Some younger sons and charismatic ambassadors have started making overtures to marriage or offering their services for the sultana’s harem, but Vorel is choosing candidates slowly.
