# 5g - Ishadia
## Overview
Ask the dragons about Ishadia and they will tell you of how the Mharoti crushed armies and devoured godlings. When the Great Lords carved out their empire, they tore its southern flank from the flesh of Ishadia. What they did not conquer, they washed away by shattering the Great Dam. The legacy of Ishadia lies scattered across the Arandis river valley, monolithic works of pale stone that some say rivaled the celestial realms. 

For generations, the Ishadi clung to the crumbled cities of their forefathers. The dragons crushed them toward the shores of the White Sea but never did consume all of Ishadia, growing weary of the stubborn monotony of war.

The Ishadi still believe their nation to be one of upstanding knights, but they are as often knaves if not outright cutthroats. They share a hatred for dragonkind and a heritage of angelic wrath and passion from a bygone age of gods now dead. Paladin or pirate, the Ishadi are not content to remain the dregs of the South.

## Ishadia
**Ishadia**

**Symbol:** Horned golden lion over a red background

**Ruler:** General-Regent Atred Mardhu (LG male aasimar fighter 14), and the Council of Commanders

**Important Personages:** Commander of the First Gate Ninshuel the Ancient (LG female aasimar oracle 20); Commander of the Second Gate Ludari, voice of the Eternal Sun (LG male human cleric 12 \[Khors-Quorzu]); Commander of the Sealed Gate Khorpa Elegza (LN female human wizard 12); Commander of the Feathered Gate Lilette Sorgas (LG female aasimar paladin 15 \[Quorzu (Khors)]); Mayor Thausis Sharchar (NG male human expert 8)

**Population:** 9,360,000 (9,000,000 humans, 280,000 aasimar, 80,000 gnolls)

**Capital:** Mardas Adamat, population 98,900 (90,000 humans, 8,000 aasimar, 900 gnolls)

**Major Cities:** Khazephon, population 60,000; Sequra, population 48,000; Shuruppak, population 25,000

**Great Gods:** Astarte (Lada), Mavrash (Perun), Quorzu (Khors), Az (Wotan), Bastet

**Trade Goods:** Glazed pots, livestock, jewelry, stone, antiquities and dragonhide

## Children of Heaven
**Children of Heaven**

The Old Gods and their courts found mortals fair and pleasant. Prolific dalliances resulted in celestial blood flowing thick in Ishadi veins, resulting in a prevalence of aasimar. The most common traits among them are horns or crimson irises. Most cannot differentiate the subtleties with the similarly featured hellborn of other nations.

## The Kingdoms of Gold and Salt
**The Kingdoms of Gold and Salt**

South of the great Crescent Desert at the River Nuria’s southern source, lies a constellation of kingdoms of great antiquity and wealth, who trade with Nuria, Ishadia, and Khandiria but rarely any lands further north. These are the Kingdoms of Gold and Salt: the clever bards and warriors of the lion kingdom of Omphaya, the cattle queens of Terrotu, the great scholars and serpent worshipers of Lignas, the ancestor-worshiping Morreg, the warrior castes of Narumbeki, and the hideous abominations of darkest Kush. Each is a place of power and mystery, with its own gods and monsters. Brave souls can join a camel caravan and learn what treasures and what strange monsters lie in the utmost South.

## Mardas Adamat, the City at the Gates
**Mardas Adamat, the City at the Gates**

Blackened by drakefire and grayed with age, a line of four ancient strongholds known as the Four Gates of Ashadon withstand the might of the Dragon Empire. The gargantuan fortress-city of Mardas Adamat holds firm at the heart of this defense. Despite dire costs, the people here dare adorn their infamous walls with the carcasses of dragons.

All of Ishadia offers tribute to the Gates for protection against draconic incursion. Military service is compulsory, and deserters are executed. The people accept the strict order for it has stemmed Mharoti advance for a century.

General-Regent Atred Mardhu leads the stern Council of Commanders, which rules the Four Gates and are thus de facto leaders of all Ishadia. They orchestrate frequent raids to disrupt Mharoti forces.

## Khazephon, the City of Baubles
**Khazephon, the City of Baubles**

Formerly called the City of Jewels, Khazephon sits at the confluence of the Arandis and its tributaries. Here the Great Dam once stood before the dragons unleashed its captive sea upon Ishadia. Khazephon faced the full deluge, which stripped it of everything save the sturdiest stonework. A second flood, one of people, rebuilt the city. Today it is a gaudy, teeming, amorphous metropolis of lively markets, caravan tents, and shanty districts dispersed between ancient temples and high estates.

The leaders of Khazephon wish to cement the city’s position as Ishadia’s center. They gather support to return the capital to Khazephon, away from the precarious position of Mardas Adamat.

Atop the broken dam overlooking Khazephon rests old Ishadia’s largely vacant palaces and gardens, once home to the Phoenix Throne of Ishadia. Lamassu sentinels guard the palaces, driving off or killing looters to protect the secrets of the old kingdom. When questioned, they say they await the rise of a true king to end the interregnum of the generals and commanders. Others claim the lammasu have degenerated into greedy hoarders like the dragons they loathe.

## Sequra, the White Haven
**Sequra, the White Haven**

“Sequrans bleed white” is a local saying. Sequra’s streets and walls are perpetually repainted a stark uniform white, covering up evidence of innumerable crimes and violence. Despite its tidy appearance, Sequra is a den of sin, and corruption is unspoken custom. In the relatively safety of the mouth of the Arandis, foreign traders, White Sea pirates, and local guilds that are little more than fronts for criminal orders mingle openly and freely.

Thausis Sharchar (NG male human expert 8) is Sequra’s mayor and the leader of its largest guild. Outwardly the same as top-skimming officials, Sharchar siphons wealth to fund a struggling Southland colony named Shibai. The commanders would consider the venture treason, but Sharchar is willing to risk his life if it means preserving Ishadia.

## Shuruppak, City of Lions
**Shuruppak, City of Lions**

The home of the aasimar and the human army alike, Shuruppak is a center of militant planning, training, and readiness. The city does not tolerate mercenaries, freebooters, and adventurers: those who wander here are pressed into service, willing or not. At the city’s heart is the Door to Heaven, said to be a literal gateway to the Seven Heavens. Only aasimar and those they choose pass through the portal to somewhere else. Others walk through an ornamental archway to the other side.

## Adventures in Ishadia
Adventures in Ishadia

Adventures in Ishadia typically involve the angels, ruins, smuggled goods, or threat from the Mharoti Empire.

- One of the Four Gates is to be attacked by dragons. Which one? The heroes must find the answer.
- A claimant to the Phoenix Throne has stepped forward. Is he a fraud?
- A crimelord of Sequra seeks to atone for his many sins with a pilgrimage into Mharoti territory. Is all as it seems?
- Thausis Sharchar needs guards for a shipment to Shibai in the South.

## Trade Goods of the Bazaars
**Trade Goods of the Bazaars**

The empire is a place of wonders and strangeness, since its people and its merchants serve scaly masters with needs unlike those of the human kings and queens of the north and west. Here is a sampling of the stranger goods found in the bazaars from Harkesh to Sarkland and Achillon to Naa-kesh on the edge of the plains.

**Animals and Servants**

Fantastic beasts from all over the realms of Midgard are imported into the Mharoti lands as tools and servants, from ankhegs and baboons to yeti and even zombies. Some are curiosities, whereas others serve the dragon armies as walking rations, devoured when the need arises.

**Baboons:** Dogs are not common in the Empire except occasionally as food animals. Their guard function is taken by baboons, as it also is in Nuria Natal. Most are kept leashed by city guards.

**Camels:** Camels come in many varieties, from beasts of burden to swift racing animals, and from trained war camels to the rare and spiritually unblemished white camels prized by the priesthoods for sacrifices.

**Goblin Servants:** Compliant servants, eager to please, and excellent rat catchers. Also, dragons find them tasty.

**Hunting Lizards:** The same weight and function as hunting dogs, but hunting lizards are scalier and somewhat tougher. Their statistics are identical to hunting dogs, with a 5 ft. slower speed, +1 AC, and no trip attack.

**Ogre Bodyguard:** The Naa-kesh ogres are favored by nobles who want their bodyguards strong and stupid. They are outfitted with showy breastplates and greatswords, but despite their finery, their lethality is rarely in dispute.

**Ostrich:** Used as mounts by kobold scouts, the ostrich is as fast as a horse over much longer distances. They are excellent runners in the high heat of the Empire’s lowlands and desert regions.

**Parrot:** Most parrots of the Mharoti Empire speak Draconic or the Southern tongue, though they aren’t exceptionally bright. The exception is the gold and green variety, which are said to know cantrips and gossip ferociously. Some are even spies, though perhaps that is merely an old tale.

**Saqretair:** The hunter birds of the Empire are long-legged, sharpbeaked, and dangerous both on the ground and in the air. They have statistics as a giant eagle, but move 20 feet on the ground as well as flying.

**Coin Pots:** Because not all coins are for sleeping on. Most include an *alarm* spell to warn of theft.

**Dragon Seals:** All drakes and dragons aspire to own a dragon seal, a symbol similar to the crown or scepter in human kingdoms. These seals are invariably carved gemstones or enchanted gold or platinum, and used with wax and a drop of dragon blood to sign contracts, laws, judicial rulings, decrees, and military orders. Each is unique to its owner, though they are often the subject of attempted pilfering and counterfeiting. They leave a mark equivalent to a *wizard mark* spell.

**Fire Wraps:** These simple cloaks shield the wearer from desert heat or the heat of a fiery dragon lord. All are magical cloaks and cunningly woven from watered silk and umbral gossamer. They are enchanted with an *endure elements* spell.

**Heat Stones:** Similar to sunrods, these provide energizing heat to spur the cold-blooded dragon races on during chill nights or damp mornings.

**Horn Bells:** Some younger drakes and dragons wear these silver bells on their horns or wingtips. They are said to lull dragons to sleep, and to create great confusion and clamor among the smaller races during a battle.

**Ivory Necklaces:** Great morza and generals wear necklaces made of entire tusks. Smaller ivory necklaces are common among dragonkin.

**Ostrich Plumes:** These delicate rarities from the South are prized for the sheer extravagance. Dragons don’t need them, but status items are rarely practical. Non-scaly folk are forbidden to wear these plumes.

**Platinum Armor:** Many dragons wear ceremonial armor made of gold and silver coins, but those are showpieces. The truly worthwhile coin armor is platinum, roughly as durable as steel but 100 times more expensive.

**Razor Rope:** Used to tie the wings of drakes and dragons; attempts to escape inevitably slash the victim’s wing membranes, preventing flight and leaving a clear blood trail. Getting out requires a DC 30 Escape Artist check; if the check fails, the creature takes 1d12 slashing damage + 3 bleed for the first attempt, and that amount increases by 1d12 + 1 bleed for each additional attempt.

**Wing Cuffs:** These chains pin a dragon’s wings and its tail together, making it impossible to flap or to maneuver. Requires a DC 20 Escape Artist to give them the slip.

## Scale, Talon, and Wing Ornamentation
**Scale, Talon, and Wing Ornamentation**

Dragons are as fussy about their scales as the non-scaly folk are about their hair and skin. They buff and polish, paint, and even tattoo their scales with various dyes and engravings. Others sport claw and talon extending metal caps, or tail ornaments, or scale gilding. The most expensive varieties of ornaments are poison-tipped talons, fire dyes to change the color of a breath weapon, and wing repair to address scarred or torn wing membranes.

**Aboleth Brain:** Extremely rare yet strangely prized by dragons.

**Basilisk Heart:** Turns its consumer to stone if eaten under-cooked, but if cooked too long you’ll get nothing but a mouthful of rocks. Requires a DC 20 Fortitude save to survive petrification if it is improperly prepared. Confers +1 Status on anyone foolish enough to eat it.

**Bean Brew:** A sour brew popular among dragonkin and kobolds, but not humans or other non-scaly folk. The drinker gains +1 to all Fortitude saves for 1d6 rounds. After that, non-dragonkind drinkers are nauseated for 1d6 rounds.

**Kava:** A bitter brew. Drinker gains +1 equipment bonus to Perception checks for 6 hours.

**Pastry Crown, Gilded:** Dragonkind like gold in food as well as ornamental form. This gilded crown of crisp bread can be worn at a feast, then eaten.

**Wine, Black:** Fermented cow’s blood. Non-scaly drinkers must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 hour and dazed for 1d4 minutes.

**Wine, Wyrm:** Made from rare azul berries that grow at high altitude. The wine is fermented slowly over 50 years. It is highly coveted by silver and red dragons.
