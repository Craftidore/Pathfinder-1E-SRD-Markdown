# 5a - The Mharoti Empire
## Overview
**The Mharoti Empire**

The lands of the Dragoncoil Mountains have always been infested with drakes, wyrms and wyverns—they give the mountains their name. But about 400 years ago, one especially cunning red dragon by the name of Mharot decided he was tired of working hard to steal golden treasures from humans and dwarves, and then doing all the work of guarding those treasures. He proposed a pact to 10 neighboring dragons, and he accepted the standing offers from kobold tribes to give their whole-hearted allegiance to the dragons in exchange for protection. With the patronage of the dragon gods and the aid of its elemental sorcery, the Empire has grown great indeed.

It is difficult to adequately describe the depth and exotic confusion of the Mharoti Empire. Many of its cities are more populous than entire nations in the North, and its ambitions and contradictions are great. The Dragon Empire seeks to expand, to garner tribute from subject nations, and to bring the word of its elemental gods to a wider world. It has expanded quickly in a few centuries, backed by dragon fire and claws.

The Mharoti Empire is one of the few places where humans and their kin are distinctly second-class citizens, though there is one notable exception: for reasons that remain indiscernible to outsiders, the dragons choose not to appoint a Scaled Sultan to rule the empire. Their vanity was such that they could never agree on a dragon ruler, so they gave the job to a clearly inferior human instead. The Dragon Empire is ruled by a human man or woman, who loosely holds the reins of power.

## Sultana Casmara Azrabahir
**Sultana Casmara Azrabahir**

The newest ruler of the Mharoti Empire, the young Sultana Casmara Azrabahir (N female human sorcerer 5/dragon disciple 7) murdered her weak, dragon-bloodless uncle Sultan Abdrazin Azrabahir one fine midsummer night and assumed control of the Empire. The sultan’s elite palace guards—the Order of the Wyvern—fell quickly in line, not questioning her usurpation, but some dragons, drakes, and emirs are still squabbling about whether to stand for or against the new order. The sultana has powerful allies within their ranks, and so has turned her attention away from possible coups and toward expansion. Indeed, her uncle’s failure at expansion past Nuria Natal to the West and his failure to destroy the last holdouts of Illyria might have been what led the dragon lords to withdraw their crucial support.

The charismatic, lithe, 26-year-old sultana stands a mere 5 feet tall. Her blue-streaked black hair confirms her wind dragon heritage (on her mother’s side), and she has been known to exhibit the creature’s foul temperament, as well. In addition to her dragon disciple abilities, Casmara possesses a supernatural ability to fascinate dragons and dragon-kin with her voice as per a bard of equal level.

On a day-to-day level, the sultana administers the executive office of the Mharoti compact: appointing judges and decreeing laws, bestowing and stripping titles from the nobility, and granting land and privileges to the morza, a term translated from the Draconic as “prince” or “dragon governor” or “great lord.” She collects the taxes, distributes bread and tribute, raises and leads the armies (or chooses the general who does), and makes everyone cooperate. Her harem assassins threaten dragonkin and human satraps who fail to toe the line. Her command of the armies gives her leverage against any individual great lord, though the morza remain independent powers to a large degree.

The sultana looks out for the empire as a whole. If she didn’t exist, the empire would not be an empire—it would more closely resemble eight draconic kingdoms at war. Young Sultana Casmara has a great deal of power, but only because the governors don’t trust any of their own number with that much authority. And yet, she seems able to plan effectively and to command the morza and the imperial legions.

Her rule is new and fragile, but Sultana Casmara has the confidence and the ruthlessness to command the Empire. So far, she has had little time for enjoying her rule, but that will soon change. Rumors swirl that the Royal Harem might soon see a swath of handsome male consorts for the first time in generations—but perhaps this is a bit of slander by her enemies.

## Government
**Government**

The Mharoti Empire is a Dragon Empire: founded by dragons, run by dragons for their enrichment, vastly powerful, and focused around the scaly races, not humans. If you put dragons in charge, they say that’s exactly the way it always should have been. But once you put dragons in charge, they will never leave. Mharoti humans might be perversely proud of being from the richest, strongest, and wisest land of Midgard. But they’re also a little...uneasy, because it’s not a human realm.

Humans are the underclass among the Mharoti. They are mostly farmers, militia, miners, artisans on occasion, and sometimes servants among the nobles. But they are not members of the ruling castes, with one considerable exception. The Sultanate and the system of viziers and satraps was put in place because dragons considered it a tiresome administrative chore to run an empire, and because none of the dragons could trust the others to rule fairly. These humans are the public face of the Empire to human kingdoms, and the sultana’s relatives are diplomats, messengers, and figureheads.

The ruling classes are all dragons and dragon-derived. Dragons are at the top of the social pyramid, as the eight noble houses of the morza and their dependents. The provincial governors are essentially dukes, each with a private army of thousands or tens of thousands, plus younger dragons (princes and barons), drakes (landed gentry and overseers), dragonkin (the sekban, edjet, timarli, and landless knights and priests), and kobolds (merchants and traders) under them.

In the Dragon Empire, you know where you stand in the social order. People see it in your face.

## Soldiers and Nobles
**Soldiers and Nobles**

The Mharoti are conscious of their place in the social order; status and pedigree matter as much as skill and achievement to them. Following are the eight basic classes or levels of the empire. It is possible to move between the social ranks, but most Mharoti never do.

The ranks of the empire—in increasing rank and status—are the jambuka, kobaldi, sekban, edjet, akinji, timarli, urmanli, and morza.

### Jambuka
**Jambuka**

At the bottom of the Mharoti social pyramid are the humans, dwarves, ogres, gnolls, giants, and all other unscaled races, collectively referred to by the dragonfolk as jambuka (literally, “jackals”). Despite this somewhat offensive collective name, any unscaly creature is welcome to live under the sultana’s rule, and humans have a certain role to play as peasants, administrators, and servants (and to be entirely clear, the morza think of the sultana as the most exalted and valued of servants). A great many jambuka are miners in the Dragoncoil Mountains, and the farmers who feed them. The jambuka are taxed and otherwise left alone to work, live, and carry on the business of running the empire. Dragons and dragonkin think the jambuka should show a little more gratitude for all that they gain as minor-but-still-legitimate citizens of the empire.

That said, the jambuka are not slaves, and some are not serfs or peasants. They thrive as smugglers, bandits, and dealers in flesh and drugs. They run gambling halls frequented by their scaly betters, and they find employment in a thousand dishonorable trades: as moneylenders, extortionists, assassins, musicians, actors, street sweepers, mercenary troops, alchemists, butchers, shepherds, thugs, night soil collectors, and stable hands. The jambuka might not rule in the Mharoti Empire, but that does not mean they are powerless. Their connections and loyalties are tighter for being put under greater strain by the ruling scaled folk.

### Kobaldi
**Kobaldi**

The teeming masses of Mharoti kobolds—kobaldi in Draconic—do much of the same work as the unscaled folk, with one important distinction: they are scaled folk, and thus superior citizens of the empire. They rarely let the human folk forget their inferior status in the empire, and always make a point of their draconic blood and their “close, personal” ties to some important personage. Kobold weavers and miners are especially skilled and control most of these guilds throughout the empire.

In war, the kobolds are archers, sappers, engineers, and massed light infantry. They fight with great devotion, though perhaps to little effect except through weight of numbers.

### Sekban
**Sekban**

The sekban are the lowest rank of the dragonkin, and a motley mix. Most are dragonkin who fail to be disciplined or well connected enough to join the ranks of the edjet. Those in the military are archers, scouts, skirmishers, and irregulars such as hunting bird handlers or officers among the unscaled. Most are not soldiers at all, but rather artisans, millers, merchants, scribes, smallholders, or smiths. They are sometimes overseers for kobolds, or they might command a patrol or a ship crewed by humans.

A few sekban are humans with dragon blood—the sultana would have been a lowly sekban at best if her draconic mother had not acknowledged her legitimacy. Most dragon-blooded humans are reviled by kobold and dragonkin as mixed breeds and abominations, and many are sacrificed or abandoned as children.

### Edjet
**Edjet**

The classic edjet are heavy troops of dragonkin devoted to one or another of the elemental gods, and commanded by paladins or priests. Their general is typically a lesser dragon or major drake, and their officers are timarli. Their numbers include powerful swordmasters, elementalist wizards, priestly warriors devoted to Veles and the Four Elemental Gods, as well as heavily armored lizard-riders, and even oliphaunt-riding artillerists.

The edjet are raised from birth to believe in the superiority of the scaled folk over all others, and their confidence shows on the battlefield. Their charges are swift and crushing, and they fight with a zeal rarely seen in Septime mercenaries or in levied human troops from Khandiria. The edjet are believers, and this gives them courage to stand tall against giants, magic, or even the walking gods of Nuria Natal.

### Akinji
**Akinji**

In war, the empire’s light cavalry, elementalists, and officers raise small companies. In peace the akinji are its landholders, merchants, priests, mayors, headmen, ship captains, and minor figures. Almost all are dragonkin, though a few are lesser drakes. The akinji are expected to serve the Empire’s interests, carry out the orders of the drakes, morza and the sultana, and are a class somewhat akin to the landed gentry elsewhere.

Relatively few of the akinji are major landholders—a few acres or a small mine tucked away with a few villages is the most they can expect. But most akinji are wealthy enough to maintain a horse or war lizard mount and a string of hunting birds or lizards. They are intensely conscious of the empire’s successes and its failings, since they are on the front lines of policy decided elsewhere.

### Timarli
**Timarli**

Secure in their power as true dragons, drakes, wyverns, and related scaly folk, the timarli are all minor nobles, generals, ambassadors, mayors, or important priests—and many own larger mines, farmlands, or an impressive city dwelling for their lair and stronghouse. These drakes and lesser dragons also raise companies of troops at their own expense to answer the sultana’s call to duty. A successful campaign season is a great credit to them and an opportunity for plunder. An unsuccessful season can result in complete disaster and death; some drakes do not risk the march at Mustering.

Not all Timarli hold independent power. Thousands of timarli serve the morza or the sultana directly as advisers, castellans, wardens, seers, spies, senior officers, concubines, and caravan masters. The Timarli are known for their ambition, for if their treasure hoards grows great enough, they might be granted a greater title as one of the scaled lords—and a greater share of the empire’s tribute.

### Urmanli
**Urmanli**

Not every dragon is a governor, but every dragon is one of the urmanli, the great scaled lords of the land. Some rule cities or command armies, or hold ancient and much-valued valleys in the Dragoncoil, perhaps as temple patrons or mining overseers. These scaled lords have thousands of kobolds and dragonkin attending to them, with a noble house of cousins and aunts and uncles to call on.

About 500 dragons rule fiefdoms in the empire, from wind and flame dragons to cave and sea dragons, and all seek to bolster their strength, wealth, and influence for the day when one of the eight morza dies. For on that day, one of the scaled lords can seize the title, if he or she is cunning, swift, ruthless, and—above all—well placed with troops and supporters in positions of power. The urmanli are rulers and not used to having any request denied by anyone but another urmanli.

### The Morza
**The Morza**

The eight Great Dragon Lords embody the empire and hold most of its wealth. Their opinions weigh heavily on the sultana, for if the morza are displeased, she might find herself assassinated, exiled, imprisoned, or summarily executed. The morza are rarely involved in the daily business of the empire, but they are concerned with its wealth and expansion as measured in years or decades.

## A Typical Mharoti Army
- **A Typical Mharoti Army**

When the Mharoti army marches out from Harkesh at the start of the season, it is immense, and sometimes it gathers additional auxiliaries on its way through the provinces to the border. Here is the order of battle of one such army, the Sultana’s Glorious Eastern Legion, recently sent against Khandiria to relatively little result.

- 16,000 jambuka levies: humans, gnolls, and ogres
- 4,000 kobold skirmishers
- 2,000 kobold archers
- 400 human and kobold siege engineers
- 3,500 edjet dragonkin heavy infantry
- 1,000 akinji light cavalry
- 1,200 timarli heavy cavalry
- 600 sekartair hunting birds
- 65 oliphaunts
- 21 fire and earth elementalists
- 18 fire dragons

With more than 28,000 troops, each great army of the Mharoti chews through food and supplies, but the way is eased by mule trains, wagons, and entire camel caravans of supplies as well as local foodstuffs. Most of the livestock is eaten underway, and the Mharoti strategy is dependent on staying close to food sources and seizing both territory and livestock for extended marches.

## Adventures Against the Dragon Empire
**Adventures Against the Dragon Empire**

Most adventures in the Dragon Empire involve dragonkind, from kobolds to dragonkin to drakes. Those that involve the Great Dragon Lords are the most dangerous and most lucrative. Their simple motivations include transparent greed and power grabs. More obscure to non-scaly races are issues of nesting rituals, peculiar forms of status or insult, or assassination of seemingly inconsequential personages. Theft is also a common theme.

- Assassinate a Great Dragon Lord or one of his generals, at the instigation of one of his likely heirs.
- The PCs are involved in massive alpine or open plains combat to repel a Mharoti army. They are tasked to cut a supply line, halt reinforcements, and guide a mercenary company to reinforce Illyrians seeking to retake Parszan.
- Discredit a morza by planting papers implicating a treasonous alliance or threat against the sultana, to make other morza turn against him.
- Steal dragon eggs and smuggle them to Illyrian sky knights.
- Recover a dragon slayer weapon that can be used against the dragons—currently in a dragon’s hoard.
- A villain has stolen a valuable object and given it to a dragon as tribute or a bribe. The PCs must recover it.
- Rescue an Illyrian political prison held in the mountains.
- The Silver Duchesses’ cousin is held for an impossible ransom.
- Enter the empire with weapons for jambuka rebels, deliver them using disguises, guile, brute force, and bribes.
- Summon a tremendous storm to help Kyprion break a naval siege. This requires special ley line magic and incantations or lore from Friula.

## Adventures for the Dragon Empire
**Adventures for the Dragon Empire**

If the PCs are loyal citizens of the empire, dedicated to its greater glory, their adventures expand its reach and power and serve the interests of their dragon masters.

- Protect a dragon hoard against thieves during a festival to Baal.
- Watch over the eggs of a Great Dragon Lord while the dragon is called away to urgent matters in the capital.
- Help the sultana’s troops storm a fortress: Take the tower, fight a tunnel battle against sappers, and prevent a minotaur general from escaping.
- Find a traitor within the ranks, someone sent to pit Dragon Lords against each other.
- Move a dragon’s horde in secret with stealth, portable holes, and a shadow road, and keep its true location hidden.
- Sabotage Triolan shipbuilding or a Kyprion alchemical workshop.
- Secure an orb of dragonkind for a Dragon Lord’s use against a rogue dragon in the North.
- Recover a dragon slayer weapon and smelt it down to iron in one of Baal’s tophets.
- Secure a new drug that is addictive to dragonkind. Every morza wants to control it, but the source is limited.
- An official has been assassinated by newly conquered locals in a public place. The killer must be found.

## Mixed Dragon Blood
**Mixed Dragon Blood**

The mixing of dragon and human is a topic of great delicacy and danger in the empire. Everyone agrees it happens, and bards and poets sing of the doomed love of a worthy dragon prince for some hideous human creature, surely an abomination. Sometimes in these tales love conquers all, but more often the dragon prince does the honorable thing and upholds his family line and dignity by expunging his feelings and not soiling his name. It’s a triumph. Other times, in tragedies, half-blooded children are born, a source of shame and regret.

That’s the point of view of the plays and poets. In reality, humans are low-caste and abused by their dragonkin and dragon overlords. The resulting children are typically raised for sacrifice or sent to the front lines in some lost-hope regiment. A few are acknowedged by wind dragons as their own children, and serve in Betik or Marea or Harkesh, more tolerant places. Elsewhere, such corruption of “pure dragon blood” is met with harassment, exile, or stoning.
