# Midgard Setup and Development
## Overview
The following are rules for character creation in the Dread Things Prowl campaign set in Midgard.

## Character Creation
Character Creation will be a 20 point build using the point buy system as outlined in the Core Rulebook, pg. 15. Remember that you can only take a given ability score to 18 **BEFORE** racial modifiers are applied. You may take two traits only; there will be no drawbacks allowed so that an additional trait may be taken.
Races allowed are those from the Midgard Campaign setting: Humans, Dragonkin, Dwarves, Elves and Elf-marked (half-elf), Gearforged, Kobolds, Minotaurs, as well as Centaurs, Gnolls, Gnomes, Goblins, Halflings, Tengu (also called Huginn or Heru), Tieflings (the Demonmarked, Hellborn), and Aasimar (Heavensent).

**Dragonkin:** All dragonkin have the following racial traits.
**+2 Strength, −2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma**: Dragonkin are strong and exude presence, but they are not quick.
**Slow Speed:** Dragonkin have a base speed of 20 feet, and their speed is never modified by encumbrance or armor.
**Darkvision:** Dragonkin can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
**Energy Resistance:** Dragonkin must choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic energy at 1st level. They have DR 2 against that energy type. Armor: Dragonkin have a +1 natural armor bonus.
**Presence:** Dragonkin gain a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate and Diplomacy checks. Fly is always a class skill for dragonkin.
**Languages:** All dragonkin begin with both the Trade Tongue and Draconic as known languages. Dragonkin who have high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Dwarvish, Elemental, Elvish, Infernal, Kobold, Minotaur, Nurian, or Darakhul (Ghoulish/Undercommon).

The dragonkin are one of the youngest races of Midgard, but one of the fastest growing. They are currently common only in the Mharoti Empire, and in fact are a consequence of its founding; the various breeds of dragonkin were unknown before unification of the empire. They have begun to spread beyond the borders of the empire, albeit slowly, since they are rarely trusted by warm-blooded humanoids in the various lands outside the empire. Still, they are found increasingly throughout the south and east of Midgard. 

As might be expected, the cunning and arrogance of humans fused with the scales, claws, and toughness of dragons is quite a powerful combination. The dragonkin divide themselves into four elemental breeds, “purebred” lineages of dragonkin, though interbreeding and hybrids are fairly common. 

The dragonkin all have clawed hands and feet, and short snouts dominate their faces. Their eyes are deep and golden or black. Beyond that, though, the genders differ quite a bit. Male dragonkin are larger and horned or crested, and they are also considerably heavier. Their tails are short and often spiked. Female dragonkin are faster, smaller, and wiry, with longer, lashing tails. They sometimes have a frill or collar of contrasting color. 

Most dragonkin gravitate toward the fighter, paladin, ranger, and sorcerer classes, especially the dragon disciple prestige class. Any number of dragonkin rogues (especially greyscale rogues), oracles (particularly of the Void mystery), and wizards (for those that have the intelligence, patience, and focus) exist out in the world also. 

**Dwarves:** All dwarves have the following racial traits. 

**+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, –2 Charisma**: Dwarves are both tough and wise, but also a bit gruff. 

**Medium**: Dwarves are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Greed**: Dwarves gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks made to determine the price of nonmagical goods that contain precious metals or gemstones. 

**Hatred**: Dwarves gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the orc and goblinoid subtypes because of their special training against these hated foes. 

**Hardy**: Dwarves gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-like abilities. 

**Stability**: Dwarves gain a +4 racial bonus to their Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground.

**Languages**: Elves begin play speaking the Trade Tongue (Common) and Elven. Elves with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Celestial, Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan. 

**Elfmarked Characters**

The elfmarked are similar to half-elves (though they have much less elven blood than half) and use the *Pathfinder RPG* racial traits for half-elves, as detailed below. In addition, some might have the elfmarked racial feats as presented starting on page 137. 

All elfmarked have the following racial traits. 

**+2 to One Ability Score**: Elfmarked characters gain a +2 bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their varied nature. 

**Medium**: Elfmarked are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. 

**Normal Speed**: Elfmarked have a base speed of 30 feet. 

**Low-Light Vision**: Elfmarked can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

**Multitalented**: Elfmarked choose two favored classes at first level and gain +1 hit point or +1 skill point whenever they take a level in either one of those classes. 

**Languages**: Elfmarked begin play speaking the Trade Tongue (Common) and Elven. Half-elves with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic). 

**Gearforged:** All gearforged have the following racial traits.

**Medium:** As Medium creatures, gearforged have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size. Gearforged base land speed is 30 feet.

**Clockwork Construct Traits:** As constructs, gearforged possess no Constitution scores and are immune to disease, poison, magical sleep effects, enchantment effects, paralysis, and effects that require a Fortitude save (unless those effects can also affect objects). They cannot become fatigued or exhausted.

Gearforged do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. As living creatures, though, they do not have any other immunities common to constructs.

Gearforged cannot heal damage on their own. Cure spells, wands, and potions heal gearforged for the minimum amount per charge or dose, and the psionic repair damage power works normally. The mending spell heals a gearforged for 1 point of damage, while the make whole spell heals 2d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +10).

Rather than sleep, gearforged must rewind their springs, repair gears, and oil and clean their parts each day for a 4-hour period to ensure normal functioning. They are fully aware during this period, but any interruption in their routine during these 4 hours requires them to start again from the beginning. Gearforged can function a number of days equal to their character level without performing this maintenance, but each day without such a repair period applies a cumulative –2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If a gearforged neglects his repair period a number of days equal to his character level, he becomes immobile and helpless until repaired by someone else. One 4-hour repair period eliminates all accumulated penalties.

Gearforged gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (clockwork) and Intimidate checks. Gearforged intimately understand how their own race works and can apply that knowledge elsewhere, while most living creatures find gearforged a little unsettling.

**Powerful Build**: Bearfolk function as if their Strength scores were 5 higher when determining their carrying capacity, and their maximum lifting and dragging weight.

**Ursine Talent**: Bearfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on Climb and Perception checks. 

**Languages**: Bearfolk begin play speaking the Trade Tongue (Common) and either Northern or Umbral. Bearfolk with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Halfling, Northern, and Umbral. 

**Centaurs:** All centaurs have the following racial traits.

**+2 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Con, −2 Int**: Centaurs are strong, tough, and wise in the ways of the natural world, but they are not deep thinkers, builders, or planners.

**Skilled**: Centaurs gain a +2 racial bonus to Craft (bows) and Heal checks. 

**Undersized Weapons**: Although a centaur is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, they wield weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most centaurs). 

**Languages**: Centaurs begin play speaking Centaur and the Trade Tongue. Centaurs with high Intelligence scores can also choose from the following: Dwarven, Elven, Gnomish, or Tengu. 

**Darakhul:** Darakhul are not born but, instead, rise from the death of a humanoid infected with darakhul fever. Only darakhul sires can inflict a creature with this disease, which burns the life from its victims until a cold corpse rises to replace the once-living subject. The resulting darakhul has the following traits. 

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma**: Darakhul are nimble and social. As undead, they have no Constitution score, but darakhul characters built using a point buy system must assign at least a score of 10 to their Constitution.

**Channel Resistance**: A darakhul gains a +2 bonus on saves to resist the effects of channeled positive energy. 

**Hunger**: Each day, a darakhul must consume at least a small meal of fresh or rotting meat. A darakhul that does not feed for more than 24 hours must make Charisma checks to avoid starvation (see the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*). Damage from starvation is lethal damage for darakhul. Once starvation sets in, only a meal consisting of one full pound of flesh ends the condition. Once a ghoul takes lethal damage, he must make a Will save whenever he makes a Constitution check. Failure indicates he obeys the compulsion to feed on any creature available, including allies or even himself. A starving darakhul must confirm a critical hit with his bite attack in order to tear off enough meat to satisfy this compulsion. 

**Light Blindness**: *Prerequisite*: Darkvision or see in darkness trait; *Weakness*: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.

Gnomes with Charisma scores of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—*dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation*, and *speak with animals*. The caster level for these effects is equal to the gnome's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the gnome's Charisma modifier. 

**Hatred**: Gnomes receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the reptilian and goblinoid subtypes because of their special training against these hated foes.
