# Everyone Lies (Module)
## Overview
*Multiple groups seek a thug’s girlfriend through the streets and alleys of Zobeck. The adventurers’ lives may depend on finding her first.*

Everyone Lies is an urban noir adventure suitable for four PCs of 1st to 3rd level.

**Adventure Background**

Ilyana Dukovich has issues with her father, Lord Greymark. He refuses to name her as his daughter, preferring to see her struggle, but the wily Ilyana plans to force her father’s recognition. She has used her seductive charms and exotic beauty to find her way into the beds of influential people in both reputable and illicit circles, eventually falling in with the Lord Commander of the Free Army and Praetor of the Blue House, Lady Marack. After learning Marack kept a *black book of confession*, Ilyana worked out a plan to steal it. She convinced a capable second-story man named Grigori to snag it along with a substantial collection of jewelry in a deal that would benefit them both – but she never revealed her relationship with Marack.

The pair executed the heist marvelously, and Ilyana seemed close to achieving the next step toward her goals. Some of Grigori’s fellow gangsters learned of the scheme, however, and decided they wanted the book. Realizing the gang’s interest, Ilyana stole the book from Grigori, planted some of the jewelry on members of the Cloven Nine, and tipped off the Spyglass Guild to make it appear that Grigori had betrayed them all. The secret police captured Grigori for interrogation shortly afterward. Ilyana hoped that taking the book would safeguard Lady Marack from the Nine and that returning it to the Lord Commander would help her convince Marack to force Lord Greymark into publicly recognizing Ilyana. Then Grigori talked. Now the Spyglass Guild’s enforcers hunt her, the Cloven Nine hunt her, and nothing seems to be working out.

**Adventure Summary**

A local thief, Grigori, approaches the party. He needs help finding his girlfriend Ilyana, and he’ll pay. Recently interrogated by in Blue House, he fears for her safety. If the PCs accept, Grigori sends them into Lower Zobeck.

Regardless of their acceptance, a group of gruff, hard-nosed individuals from the Spyglass Guild approach the party. They claim to know of the party’s involvement, threaten them with the Blue House’s dungeons unless they turn over Ilyana, and make clear that they will be watching. Ilyana’s trail leads into Cloven Nine territory and the Silk Scabbard, where the gang tells the PCs to quit searching for Lord Greymark’s illegitimate tiefling daughter before they end up dead.

With the underworld breathing down their necks, the law on their heels, and the threat of Lord Greymark’s fury hanging over their heads, the party has nowhere left to turn until Sergeant Hendryk approaches them with the real score. If the party works with Hendryk, he’ll help them out of the situation. The book is the key, and the best place to start looking is the Cartways Black Market.

In those dark tunnels where the Watch dare not go, the group meets Radu Underhill, who knows where Ilyana hides and will trade the information if the characters will cooperate. If the PCs can get the girl, and get everyone to agree to a midnight exchange at Hommal’s Rooftop, then the ghoul has a way for the characters to escape with the greatest treasure they could hope for: their lives.

Radu sends the group to the Old Stross Bathhouse where they find Ilyana, who, once discovered, explains her own tangled story. Unfortunately, everything’s gone wrong, and the party is Ilyana’s only hope of surviving the night.

Ilyana agrees to exchange the book for a hiding place. Once safely tucked away, she tells the group where she hid the book. Only with the book can the group attend the meeting with secret policemen and gangsters with any chance of survival.

Fulfilling his part of the bargain, Radu and a pack of ghouls ambush the enforcers outside Hommal’s, capturing Lady Marack as the party mops up the stragglers. With their deal consummated, the adventurers can trade the book to the waiting members of the Cloven Nine knowing they’ve escaped by the skin of their teeth. They return to their safe house triumphant, only to find Ilyana gone.

**Adventure Hooks**

What draws the adventurers into this twisted trip down Zobeck’s streets? An offer they cannot refuse. At their low level, they cannot afford to make enemies of either the Spyglass Guild or the Cloven Nine, and yet they risk just that simply because Grigori sought them out.

But why would Grigori come to the adventurers?

Some options include:

- Grigori shares an ethnic or national origin with one of the characters and approaches a countryman he may have heard of, hoping this connection will motivate the character to assist him.
- A rogue, bard, or other character has a shady background or a (possibly undeserved) reputation for finding lost things or people. Grigori hopes to capitalize on this.
- Grigori has a professional connection to a character from a previous job. He seeks out the fellow thief for a favor.
- A mutual NPC acquaintance tells Grigori that the party can likely get the job done, and no one will miss them if they blow it.

Whatever the reason, our tale begins as Grigori approaches the adventurers…

**Introduction**

While relaxing someplace public, the adventurers receive an unexpected visit from the well-dressed second-story thief Grigori.

**Part One:**

**I’ll See your offer**

**Only Hope**

You didn’t invite him, but he sat down anyway. Unshaven, and roughly treated quite recently, the man wears a look of desperate exhaustion as obvious as the fine stitching on his forest green doublet. He nods knowingly to your group, trying to muster an expression of false confidence. “You may not remember me. I’m Grigori.”

Using whatever connection you’ve chosen, Grigori attempts to establish some relationship with the party. Once he has his in, he gets to the heart of the matter.

He takes a swallow of his weak beer. “I need your help with something. I did a job the other night, and I think I got in over my head.” He looks sideways, as if checking for something. “The Spyglass Guild just got done grilling me hard for most of the afternoon. I’ve gotta lie low for a while, but my girl Ilyana, she doesn’t know. They may not be so kind to her, especially since she’s wearing some my handiwork, if you know what I mean.” Grigori takes another pull from his flagon. “If you can find her first, I’ll make it worthwhile.” He hands you a square of artists’ canvas bearing the charcoal sketch of a striking tiefling woman.

The party may wonder if Grigori’s lying or if they know of him:


| **Skill** | **DC** | **Benefit** |
|---|---|---|
| Sense Motive | <15 | He could be lying, he could be telling the truth, you can’t tell. |
| | 15 | He’s not lying. |
| | 20 | He’s not lying, but he is holding a little something back. |
| **Skill** | **DC** | **Benefit** |
| Knowledge (local) | <15 | You don’t know of Grigori. |
| | 15 | Grigori’s a member of the Cloven Nine, or at least he’s been associated with the gang in the recent past. |

If pressed, Grigori explains Ilyana helped plan the job and might crack under interrogation. He worries she’ll end up in the gibbet, and he can’t ask any members of the Cloven Nine for help, because he knows they won’t want the attention. The adventurers, as an uninvolved third party, can investigate freely, whereas he would only draw suspicion closer. He knows he wasn’t followed here; he took precautions to be certain.

A DC 10 Knowledge (local) check identifies the Spyglass Guild as Zobeck’s secret police, a quasi-legal organization that ultimately answers to the Lord Mayor and the Council of Praetors. A DC 15 Knowledge (local) check turns up Ersebet Cemilla as mistress of the Guild, but also that she answers to Lady Marack, Praetor of the Blue House. A DC 20 Knowledge (local) check reveals that Lady Marack is a flamboyant personality, with rather more colleagues than friends among the city’s elite, and it’s not hard to believe she might use her position for personal matters if given sufficiently strong reasons. The PCs should be getting nervous by now.

If the adventurers rebuff him, Grigori shrugs and departs, leaving the sketch with the party. The enforcers see the sketch and assume the PCs have taken the job. If they agree, he continues.

“My thanks,” he smiles, revealing a couple missing teeth. “Take this picture,” he taps the sketch, “and look in Lower Zobeck. She has friends working at the Silk Scabbard. Filipa maybe, or Iskra. Either might know where she is. They’ll probably tell you, since you’re not Cloven Nine.” He takes one last drink from his mug. “Tell them Grigori brought them their earrings. They’ll know I sent you.”

**Departing the Scene**

Grigori leaves first, saying he doesn’t want his presence to cause the group trouble, but maybe she’ll meet him “in their place, next New Year’s.” He plans to lay low, knowing that the authorities are watching, so that the PCs will draw the heat. When they turn up Ilyana, everyone will forget about him. As soon as the party enters the street, they are approached by a group of rough, serious men who are obviously more than street thugs.

“Evening. You look like you need to talk. What say we slip over to that quiet alley and have a chat?”

These men have no unifying dress, color scheme, or symbol, and they clearly won’t take no for an answer. A DC 12 Sense Motive check gives the feeling that, despite the menace, they really just want to talk, though the party may not like the conversation. A DC 20 Perception check reveals a polished pin shaped like a griffon holding a gear in its fore claws on one man’s cloak. If the PCs watch, they notice that that man never speaks, but all of his companions take their cues from him. As long as the adventurers cooperate without resisting, the enforcers simply talk. At any sign of defiance, they immediately attack to prove a point (See **Breaking the Law** for statistics). Otherwise, continue.

A wiry man with a thick, blond mustache does the talking. “Good. You seem like smart people. Let me explain how you can continue to be smart. We know about the girl, and we know you’re after her. We’re after her too. You find her and turn her over, or you’ll all see the bottom of Blue House.” He lets this sink on for a second. “And don’t bother trying to run. You’re not hard to find, and we are watching.” He smiles, as if genuinely pleased to have the unpleasant part out of the way. “And, if you do this quick enough, and we’ll even give you the reward for her. That’s a short-term offer, though.” He glances to one of his companions, who nods, and the group starts to drift away, some swinging silver-tipped ebony batons. The spokesman smiles again before leaving. “Better get going. It’s getting late.”

Some parties may not suffer threat or coercion. If such parties engage the enforcers, proceed to **Breaking the Law**. Others may be curious about the places mentioned or the items brandished.

**Skill DC Benefit**

Knowledge (local) <13 The Blue House houses Zobeck’s secret police.

Those batons are tipstaves, magical clubs capable of paralyzing foes.

17 There is a reward for Ilyana, but no sum is mentioned.

**Terrain**: This conversation should ideally occur at the mouth of an alleyway, but the exact location may vary.

**Creatures:** See below for the enforcers’ statistics.

**Breaking the Law**

The enforcers don’t want to kill the characters or even incapacitate them. They attack for nonlethal damage for the first 2 rounds and then use the *hold person* power of their tipstaves. After disabling the adventurers, they move them into the nearby alley for a discussion and recovery.

**Morale** Strongarms are bruisers trained by Blue House as muscle for its agents. They’re dedicated and very disciplined but trained to retreat when necessary. The entire group flees, carrying all their wounded, if any of them drop to 0 hp or if their leader is killed.

**Development:** With the enforcers’ threat delivered, it’s time to go hunt for a girl and find more enemies. Allow the party to search as they please, but proceed to **The Silk Scabbard**.

**The Silk Scabbard**

See page 22 for a full description of the Silk Scabbard. 

Rough men and women pack this establishment looking for all manner of opportunities. It is a bar, a casino, a whore house, and a death trap, all in one convenient location.

Many activities are available to characters visiting the Silk Scabbard. Eventually, they should seek out Filipa or Iskra. Filipa is in the upper gaming area (Area 2.1) with a fat cattle merchant, looking bored but milking him for an eventual trip to the comfort rooms. Iskra is trolling the bar area (Area 1.11) on the arm of a belligerent local tough looking for a fight.

Neither woman wants the characters interrupting, as they both want to close the deal with their current marks. Their starting attitudes are hostile if the PCs try to (or successfully) separate them from their ‘customers’ and unfriendly towards anyone asking about Ilyana’s whereabouts under other circumstances. “Tipping” a few silvers provides a +1 circumstance bonus (per silver piece, max +5) to Diplomacy checks to change this attitude. Once their attitudes shift to friendly, they pull at least one PC into a vacated booth (Area 1.10) and speak without reservation once they hear Grigori’s code phrase. Otherwise, they remain evasive before admitting:

The girl has an anxious, concerned look as she speaks. “Ilyana didn’t tell anyone where she was going, honest. She didn’t want us to get hurt, so she said it was better if nobody knew.”

Characters can do some Diplomacy checks to gather information at the Silk Scabbard, but this draws the attention of the Cloven Nine.

**Skill DC Benefit**

Diplomacy <15 Ilyana was a regular at the Silk Scabbard, but not an employee.

15 Ilyana associated with the Cloven Nine, but she wasn’t a member. Ilyana had many lovers, some of great influence.

17 Ilyana’s father is rumored to be the very powerful Lord Greymark.

In a scene which should seem familiar, a few members of the Cloven Nine approach as the party prepares to leave. They’re armed but don’t intend on starting trouble. They leave the adventurers with a stern warning.

The gangsters motion for you to stop. “You know, we know who you’re looking for, and you should quit.” Their spokesman cuts you off with a gesture, menacing in its simplicity. “Why? Because Lord Greymark would hate to find out she died because of you. You’d hate for him to find that out too. It’s the sort of thing that gets people killed, you know? You should just go home and enjoy the evening.”

A DC 12 Sense Motive check confirms that the gangsters would finger the party to Lord Greymark if Ilyana died. Defiant characters are told that kind of talk usually gets a beating, and they ought to be on the lookout for it. The gang members don’t start anything here unless a character presses the issue. In that case, they clear a space (Area 1.12), and a single PC faces a burly tough in unarmed combat (use a strongarm from **Breaking the Law**, but AC 12). The gang member will beat a character to -5 nonlethal damage, even hitting an unconscious foe.

**Development:** With their threat—and possible beating—delivered, the gang tells the characters to get out. If the characters are polite, or at least closemouthed, the staff forgets about the encounter and dismisses it as “just a part of business.” If the PCs are combative, the gang and the staff don’t forget them or the incident.

If the party starts trouble, a group of Watchmen arrive very quickly (top of round 4, if in combat) and haul the PCs outside. The Silk Scabbard’s staff, and some patrons, will assist the Watch. Once outside, the character with the highest Strength is beaten to less than 5 hp while the others are restrained and held at sword point. As the Watchmen leave, the last one looks at the PCs and says, “Don’t you have a job to do?” The party don’t recognize him, but a DC 20 Perception check reveals the same pin as the enforcer squad leader wore (DC 16 if they made the first check and know what they’re looking for).

The party gets no time to heal or otherwise recover before proceeding to **Part Two: The Plot Thickens**.

**Part Two: The Plot Thickens**

After departing the Silk Scabbard, the party may feel out of options. Fortunately Sergeant Hendryk awaits them. See page 8 for his description and statistics. If the party just got roughed up, this encounter takes place a moment after they’ve picked themselves up.

Four Watchmen approach you. In a bold voice, the largest one calls out, “You there, hold in the name of the Watch!” A slight man with a thick, but well-trimmed, black beard and a casual air of authority grins and gives you an obvious wink. “Step this way!” continues the larger man, “and keep your hands where we can see them.” The smiling sergeant nods to the alley.

The Watchmen do not draw weapons, and a DC 12 Sense Motive check indicates they have no hostile intent. Presuming the party complies, Hendryk continues. If they run, the Watchmen sigh and repeat the encounter an hour later – although they have weapons drawn when they arrive the second time.

Once in the alley, the sergeant speaks up. “Right. I appreciate you playing along out there. You’re in a bit of a tight spot, eh? Fortunately for you, Sergeant Hendryk knows what’s what. You hear me out, and do what I say, I’ll get you out of this jam. Can’t go wrong with that, eh?”

If the party refuses, Hendryk laughs. He tells them they have guts; it won’t be enough, but it’s worth something. He throws them a map, tells them to go to the Cartways Black Market, and find Radu.

If they agree, Hendryk explains the situation while his fellows stand guard. Seems Ilyana stole the Lord Commander’s *black book of confession*, the log of some egregious sins, from Grigori and made the Cloven Nine think he betrayed them. Now everyone’s looking for leverage over Lady Marack, and the book is the key. If the party talks to Radu Underhill and do as he says, Hendryk will help them out. The best place to find Radu is the Cartways Black Market, a place the Watch dares not go. He gives them a small map and walks them through the directions.

**Development:** The map is correct, leading the group into the Cartways. A DC 15 Knowledge (local) check identifies a number of sites suggesting its authenticity. (A DC 15 Diplomacy (gather information) check targeting kobolds confirms this authenticity.) The adventurers shouldn’t have divinations which allow them to bypass the Cartways. An *augury* might be available, showing both weal and woe for traveling to the Cartways. Eliminate this problem by making NPCprovided divination unavailable for 24 hours.

**Into the Cartways (CR 4+)**

Adventurers reluctant to enter the Cartways soon find they may not have a choice. Ilyana has gone to ground, and without new information, they’re just going to be wandering a city of 20,000 souls. Travel to the Black Market is fairly uneventful:

Dark, clammy tunnels swallow you all. Following the twisting passageways and odd landmarks on the Watchman’s map brings you a passage echoing with the faint hum of conversation. A short walk and a dogleg corridor later, you find yourselves staring at a bustling hive of activity. Kobolds push carts while humans trudge past duergar and ghouls. You even spot a drow or two. This must be the Cartways Black Market!

See page 14 for full description of the Cartways Black Market. An inquiry with the gate guards (currently kobolds) indicates Radu keeps his quarters in Area 5. Immediately following the sentry’s response, there is an incident outside the gate, in the larger gallery approaching the doors.

A kobold tinker, not paying attention to where he’s pushing his cart, accidentally bumps into a pack lizard led by a group of duergar. The creature hisses and rears up, dropping its cargo across the floor. Two of the duergar begin quickly collecting items, but three of the deep dwarves turn menacingly on the lone kobold. At the same time, a mixed group of humans and dwarves arrives to relieve the agitated kobold guards. “Tough break, eh?” chuckles one rough-looking man. “That’s the rules. We don’t act beyond the gates. Shuffle off, belts!” The kobolds shoot poisoned glances at the new guards but simply watch.

The duergar beat the kobold to a pulp unless the party intervenes.

**Terrain**: This is a 40-foot wide gallery, fed by several tunnels before entering the Black Market. It has a smooth, natural stone floor and walls. The ceiling is 35 feet high.

**Duergar (3)         CR 1**

**400 each**

7 hp (see *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, pg. 117)

**Adjusting to APL 3:** Increase this encounter to CR 3+ by adding either 3 duergar, or a monitor lizard (see *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, pg. 194).

The kobold guards note if the characters act on behalf of the kobold tinker, which may have consequences later.

The adventurers find Radu’s sanctuary easily (Area 5). Climbing the ladder brings them to a cozy room perched on the side of the support pillar. See page 8 for a description of Radu Underhill. He smiles, welcoming the group.

“Good,” he says, smirking. “Took your time getting here. I think I have a solution to your problem. Listen close.”

Radu explains that if the group finds the book and Ilyana, and keeps her safe while offering the book to both Lady Marack and the Cloven Nine, he’ll trade their lives for Lady Marack. They PCs need to arrange a midnight exchange at Hommal’s Rooftop with both groups, something perhaps best done by courier letter. If they get the Lord Commander there, he’ll ensure they can deliver the book and that the gangsters get nothing useful out of the deal. If they agree, Radu explains that Ilyana is at the Old Stross Bathhouse, attempting to hide in plain sight, but it’s only a matter of time before the someone finds her. What does the darakhul get? Radu needs to talk to Lady Marack for a while.

As they depart, Radu offers each adventurer a *potion of cure moderate wounds*, “for emergencies.” As they cross the gallery to return to the surface, the hunter hired by the Cloven Nine arrives. It is a barghest, part of a murdering Cartways gang, contracted to kill the party. It has run here in a desperate attempt to stop the party before they can leave the Cartways and is fatigued.

**Fatigued Barghest CR 4**

**Fatigued Barghest         CR 4**

**1,200 xp**

**1 fatigued barghest** 45 hp (see *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, pg. 27, -2 Str/Dex, cannot charge)

**Adjusting to APL 3:** Increase this encounter to CR 6 by making this two barghests. Optionally, consider a barghest with the advanced template for CR 5. Quick Rules: +2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and special ability DCs; +4 to AC and CMD; +2 hp/HD. 

If the party aided the kobold tinker, a group of kobold guards help them, beginning on round 3, initiative count 8, by firing a volley of poisoned crossbow bolts and driving off the enemy.

**Treasure**: None.

**Development:** Proceed to **Bathhouse Express**.

**Bathhouse Express**

Following Radu’s advice brings the adventurers to the Old Stross Bathhouse (pg. 20):

The clerk seated at the entry hall’s front desk notes that policy prohibits

weapons and armor within the bathhouse. He points to lockers along

the walls and says everyone needs to stow their gear or go away. Two

large warriors wearing the city’s livery monitor the entrance.

The two warriors in Area 1.1 refuse entry to anyone dressed

inappropriately. Guards search anyone carrying more than a towel.

Most regular visitors know this and come carrying nothing. The

clerk sounds the alarm at any attack. Five warriors arrive within 1d6

rounds and another 10 arrive after 10 rounds. If the characters are

not detained, 10 guards systematically search the Bathhouse while five

more hold the front door.

Once inside, characters quickly find Ilyana relaxing in Area 2.2. She’s poorly disguised and barely dressed. Her initial attitude is unfriendly, and she tries to maintain the bluff that she is not herself.

Using Grigori’s suggested phrase gets her to friendly, and if she learns the characters are on good terms with Iskra or Filipa, she becomes helpful. Any party clearly explaining the details of the situation, and the trouble they experienced trying to find her, gains her trust.

Ilyana finally grasps the situation, her hand over her mouth in horror. “That idiot. He’s pulled you into this. And the Spyglass Guild…? But, she and…I…we…” Grim realization sweeps across Ilyana’s face. “I don’t have the book with me.” She looks up. “You must believe me. They’re going to kill me, aren’t they? Just for that book.” She blinks away tears, eyes wide with fear. “This was never my plan. Never. But then they were never supposed to know I had it. Damn Grigori.”

Ilyana shares the details of the plot: she gained Lady Marack’s confidence, and convinced Grigori to steal the book, all so she could blackmail Lord Greymark into recognizing her as his daughter. She wants to survive this ordeal and will work with any plan based on Radu’s suggestions.

Ilyana smiles, “Well then. Sounds like we need to get to work. Where to from here?”

When the characters approached Ilyana, the Bathhouse masseuse Mikhail realized her identity. A greedy schemer, he tells the group of self-defense training citizens (Area 2.3) about the reward for catching Ilyana. They move in as the adventurers try to leave with her.

A DC 14 Perception check allows someone keeping watch to notice the collecting crowd and either surprise the ambushers or alert the group to their presence. A DC 20 Sense Motive check lets the observer discern their hostile intent.

“Hello there,” drawls one man, cracking his knuckles. “Why don’t you wander away. We’ll take care of the young lady.”

Proceed to **We’re Professionals**.

**We’re Professionals (CR 4)**

The masseur convinced these poor experts they can overwhelm the characters and capture Ilyana. They surround the group while the adventurers are talking to her and then try to intimidate the party through numbers. When those tactics fail, they try to overwhelm characters with unarmed attacks. Remember, such attacks only provoke attacks of opportunity against armed opponents.

These foes should normally be considered CR 1/3, but given their unarmed nature, low armor class, and lack of improved unarmed combat, their Challenge Rating is reduced.

**Adjusting to APL 3:** Increase this encounter to CR 5 by replacing the Skill Focus feat with Improved Unarmed Strike. Give the citizens maximum hit points (12), Improved Unarmed Strike, and have them fight until all only two remain standing to make this encounter CR 6.

**Development:** With the citizenry defeated, the adventurers can depart, and Ilyana asks them if they’ve someplace to hide. If they have no immediate or prepared answer, she mutters, “This is one lousy rescue.” She recommends a room at the Dented Shield hotel. The proprietor, a man named Benyosef, is willing to rent a secure room. Other options include: the back room at a regular tavern, within a temple where a character worships, the hideout of a small neighborhood gang, or the store of a friendly shopkeeper. Allow the players to be creative, but offer Ilyana’s suggestion if they’re short on ideas. She refuses to accompany them to the meeting. With a safe room established, Ilyana offers a *potion of cure light wounds* to each adventurer as a token of her appreciation, since, “there’s no way you’re going to save me if you’re dead.”

**Letters to Bad People**

The adventurers need to send instructions to the Spyglass Guild and the Cloven Nine. Some may not trust a messenger to deliver their letters, but Zobeck has services which do just that – reliably, cheaply, and quickly. Ilyana recommends the Masters of Small Matters or the Brown Blaze Boys, both of which any hotel, inn, tavern, or temple can rapidly contact. If the group writes out missives as directed by Ilyana with the details suggested by Radu, the gang and the Guild follow them. Both groups want the book very badly. Ilyana suggests they meet the messenger in the tavern across the street. 

However, the adventurers still don’t have the book, and they need it to make the hand off to the Cloven Nine. Once in a safe room, Ilyana explains:

“I hid the book, and you’re probably not going to like where.” Ilyana smiles weakly. “Iskra has it, sewn into a cloak I left in her comfort room at the Silk Scabbard.” She shrugs. “It seemed like a safe place at the time, and no one was going to break in there to take it.” She chuckles, “Except you, it seems.”

The adventurers need the book in hand. Ilyana suggests two options: the group can disguise someone to walk in the front door and hire Iskra’s services, or they can sneak in through the Cartways entrance. Ilyana knows about the back hallway entrance (Area 1.13). She sends them to the exit point in the nearby building, gives them her key to the doors, and tells them which secret door leads to Iskra’s room. Then it’s a matter of the party completing their own heist.

This encounter can be as involved or as quick as the players want. They need to infiltrate the Silk Scabbard and recover the *black book of confession* hidden within the cloak left in Iskra’s comfort room. See the Silk Scabbard (pg. 22) for the complete description of the area. The Scabbard is very busy with a well-advertised pit fight, meaning that guards and employees in the service areas suffer a -5 penalty to all Perception checks. A guard is always stationed at the Vault (Area 1.6), at the door to the Cartways (Area 1.13), and in the hallway between comfort rooms (Area 1.8). Guards won’t pursue thieves into the Cartways, but a reinforced lock (changed to Excellent quality) and three guards will be posted at the door in the future.

**Development:** With the book in hand and letters delivered, all that remains is waiting until midnight. As darkness falls, Ilyana paces the floor, anxious as the characters prepare to leave. If questioned, she says she worries about being alone as the group goes to the exchange. She promises to wait at the safe house until the characters return. Proceed to **Part Three: Rooftops and Crossbows**.

**Part Three: Rooftops and Crossbows**

As Radu directed, one of the shops in Hommal’s building is unlocked and open when the characters arrive, despite the hour. No one is inside. From this vantage point, they can see the street through a barred window. After sometime, a group approaches the tenement.

*You almost don’t see the enforcers arrive. People seem to just break away from the thinning crowd on the street and gather outside the tenement door at some unspoken signal. One minute there’s nothing, the next, you see an intimidating group. They seem to have gathered around a woman, who is apparently giving instructions.*

*Then the cobblestones erupt with violence. Snarling ghouls pile out from the shadows, knocking some enforcers to the ground where they lay as still as statues. Five well-dressed ghouls with heavy jaws overwhelm the woman and drag her into the alley, panic evident on her frozen and scratched face. Those not immediately incapacitated bolt into the foyer of the tenement.*

*One clear voice rises over the din. “You heard the Lady. The city depends on us getting that book. We go to the roof, and we take it.”*

If the characters attack now or any time before the group leaves, they gain a surprise round. The enforcers catch their breath here for three rounds and then ascend the stairwell. Proceed to **Stairwell Brawl**.

**Stairwell Brawl (CR 4)**

The enforcers pause on the landing to load their crossbows, and one must replace his string. If the characters decide to follow, this encounter occurs with their enemies on the landing just as the crossbow is repaired. Otherwise, the enforcers are in the foyer of the building as the party attacks, and their crossbows are loaded but not drawn.

The already-haggard looking men seem shocked as you advance on them. These are not the sort of men to throw insults or banter They move immediately for a fight.

This battle takes place on the stairwell between the first and second floor.

**Terrain**: See Hommal’s Tenement (pg. 18) for a map of the stairwell. Movement occurs on stairs without penalty, but Acrobatics DCs are increased by 4 and characters may not run on stairs. These stairs are not considered difficult terrain.

**Creatures:** The enforcers’ remaining troops intend to arrest the criminals carrying the ledger supposedly containing city secrets. They presume this attack is a continuation of the earlier ghoul ambush and only use tipstaves after seeing foes bleed. They resort to lethal force if the characters do so. Enforcers reduced to 5 hp or less attempt to flee out the front door and take their chances evading the ghouls. The ghouls, uncertain if they are the characters, do not attempt to detain them.

**The Handoff**

The characters still need to deliver the *black book of confession* to the Cloven Nine. See Hommal’s Rooftop (pg. 18) for full description of this area. Hommal’s is commonly known as neutral territory among most thieves and criminals (DC 15 Knowledge (local), DC 12 for rogues). A human of average build, wearing a dark-washed chain shirt and creaking leathers, meets the group at the roof entrance and escorts them across the roof to the Tea Kitchen (Area F10). He doesn’t say much unless the majority of the group is badly injured, when he observes, “Gods and demons. Someone beat the hell out of you, eh?”

*A well-dressed tiefling male sits at the dining table inside this green glass room. The air is cool and humid, as if it might rain very soon. Fireflies wink between fragrant, flowering vines in large ceramic pots. Two heavily-muscled and well-armed Kariv men wait outside the door with their longswords sheathed and their heavy crossbows slung over their shoulders. Your escort opens the door and ushers you inside.*

*The tiefling smiles. He finishes his tea, before refilling his cup and pouring tea for you. He gestures for you to sit. “Good of you to come. Hopefully, we can all be reasonable. We just want the book.” He sips his tea. “There’s no need for anyone to die over this.” He watches you closely “I trust you have it with you?”*

The tiefling’s name is Andros (sorcerer 6, infernal bloodline, active *extended fly* spell). An apprentice of one of the Nine, he has orders to collect the book but not to kill the characters unless they try to betray him. He smiles and accepts the book from them, dispelling and then detecting magic to authenticate it. When satisfied, he declares the matter settled, adding that the Nine bear them no ill-will, but they’d be wise to forget the entire exchange. Terrible things tend to happen when people tell wild tales. He nods to the guards and tells the adventurers they may leave. No one makes any moves against the party, but if the characters start trouble, Andros flies away with the book, and the three remaining gangsters attack (use stats for Hendryk, pg. 8). If they win, they leave the characters at negative hit points and depart; Hommal heals them to 1 hp, asking, “What were you thinking?” Otherwise, proceed to **Concluding the Adventure**.

**Concluding the Adventure**

The characters are not engaged by anyone as they depart Hommal’s Rooftop, but the only sign of the enforcers are a few dried pools and wide smears of blood. The living escaped, and someone carried away the corpses. Even the bloodstains appear fated to a short existence.

The rain that threatened while you were on the rooftop finally comes as a light precipitation begins to wash the cobbles. Long crimson strokes and ruby footprints begin to fade, melting with the water and flowing into the troughs and drains. The street is eerily empty, as if anyone who might have dared to glance outside is still holding their breath.

The ghouls departed with their meals and prisoners. The characters return to their safe house unmolested, where they find the following: There is no sign of Ilyana when you arrive. Her pack is gone, and her things are missing. There’s no sign of a struggle. In fact, it seems she tidied up before going.

Ilyana couldn’t chance the party would fail and decided to hide elsewhere. She may have taken a riverboat out of town, blended in with the rest of the everyday people of Lower Zobeck, decided to seek out aid from other gangs, or found a welcoming bed in the house of a rich patron; it’s up to the GM. A DC 10 Perception check locates a handwritten note on the windowsill. It reads:

*“Thank you. I know you did this as much to help yourselves as help me, but thank you.”*

Depending on what rewards the GM feels are appropriate, the characters might find a key under the note corresponding to a safe deposit box at the Cracked Coin. This box contains some portion of Lady Marack’s stolen jewelry, left by Ilyana as a token of gratitude. The exact composition of the stash depends on the party and the campaign, but this is an easy lead into new adventure. Perhaps Grigori knows of the stash and watches it. Certainly Lady Marack will look dimly on anyone fencing her jewelry, assuming she survives.

**Development**: The Cloven Nine and the Praetor Council (and by extension, the city government) will not appreciate this outcome, though the characters’ clever escape protects them from immediate retribution.

The ghouls may or may not kill Lady Marack, as best suits your game. They may slowly interrogate her regarding Zobeck, its leaders and prominent citizens, defenses and access points. They may transform her into a darakhul, so she can later lead plots against Zobeck. She may die during her interrogation or infection with darakhul fever. She may escape, be rescued, or cut a deal to go free. The Cloven Nine will certainly realize they’ve been tricked once word of Lady Marack’s disappearance gets out. They will remember the incident and may try to blackmail the characters into a job or favor later on.

**Scenarios**

**Let’s Buy a Bar!**

Over the course of their adventures, the characters could become the proprietors of an establishment like the Silk Scabbard. How might this happen? The characters could:

***• Purchase the Scabbard from Tyron.*** Tyron would sell the place for about two years’ profits up front, a sum of 30,000 gp.

***• Inherit the Silk Scabbard.*** Should the party perform a great service to Tyron, he might make them heirs. And on the streets, accidents happen all the time.

***• Become a Partner.*** Tyron might feel—or the PCs might convince him—that it’s time to step back from the business. A socially-inclined and morally flexible character with leadership tendencies might find herself with an opportunity to buy into the Silk Scabbard for a reasonable cost.

**Entrepreneurial Considerations**

**Selling sex for fun and profit.**

Presuming a rate of 2 sp to 2 gp/encounter, and assuming around 10 encounters/night, a prostitute can average (on the low end), 2 gp/day, or roughly 50o gp/year after holidays and alchemical expenses, such as birth control or *cure disease*. Figuring that 50% (at least) goes to his or her employer, said employer, with a full stable of twenty trollops, can clear around 5,000 gp/year, minimum.

**Booze it up.**

A 5-gallon cask has roughly 40 drinks, every 2 casks means 3 gp profit, so on the low end, a bar brings in about 5 gp profit every 2 days, or 750 gp/year.

**The First Rule of…**

Wagers on pit fighting can earn great sums. Tyron schedules fights weekly, and impromptu grudge matches happen about twice a week. Each fight nets the Scabbard about 20 gp, or around 3,000 gp/year. This number varies, however, and wagers which could payout over 50 gp require Tyron’s approval. Fights are kept between animals, like dogs and cocks, or restricted to bareknuckle brawls in order to limit the need to bury bodies. When disposal is required, you can bet the responsible party pays for it.

**The House Always Wins.**

Tyron keeps about four regular games of chance going: dice, roulette, and two varieties of card games. These players tend to bet silver, and there is a 5 gp table limit on wagers. He sees biweekly profits of about 200 gp from this aspect of the business, or 5,000 gp/year.

**And No Cover Charge!**

On nights with well-publicized fights, the Silk Scabbard charges a 2 cp entry fee and packs in 200 observers. This results in about 250 gp/year profit. With only one real entrance, this could be an issue in a fire, but that hasn’t yet happened.

**Bring the Adventure to You!**

Ownership might seem like the easy life for scoundrels, but here are some ideas to keep the new management from getting complacent.

**Everyone Loves Trinkets**

A regular client is also a thief who gives his favorite girl a particular stolen—possibly cursed—item. The justifiably angry original owner, perhaps the Painted Man or a Collegium master, sends demons, devils, or some other magical agents disinclined to negotiate, to recover the item. Hilarity ensues.

**The Moonlighting War**

A competing gang shakes down the brothel by stealing girls through threats, bribes, and trickery. Welcome to a low-key crime war that escalates as one gang begins to intimidate the neighborhood around the Scabbard, making it difficult get supplies or services.

**Like Roaches and Rats**

The Scabbard sees an infestation of another illegal business – drug dealers hiring the girls to push their product. The owners are threatened by clients who want more drugs and sought by the Watch or Spyglass Guild who want the drugs controlled or eliminated.

**Good Clean Fun**

Daughters of the upper class decide it will be entertaining to go slumming as part-time prostitutes. It’s less fun when girls get kidnapped and terribly maimed. It becomes downright poke-your-eye-out when the family holds the owners responsible for the incident.

**Promise Me We’ll Get Robbed**

The characters might find their roles reversed when a group of adventurers decides to make a play for the receipts from a particularly lucrative pit fight or holiday casino celebration. They attempt a multi-pronged heist which forces the characters use every option at their disposal in order to either foil the thieves or pursue them into the Cartways in an attempt to recover their cold, hard cash. Is the robbery a cover for something more sinister? What awaits the Scabbard’s owners within the tunnels’ shadows?

**New Archetype: The Fixer**

One sort of rogue works as an enabler, connecting thugs and burglars, trap-smiths and second-story men. That scoundrel is a fixer. The fixer knows people, knows where to find what you need, and knows who to pay to get things done. Uninterested in investigation or inspiration, this rogue realizes the most valuable currency is knowledge and makes very sure to be flush with its coin.

**Class Skills:** Replace Knowledge (dungeoneering) with Knowledge (nobility) in a fixer’s class skills.

**Scrounge (Ex)**: A fixer can locate a buyer or seller of an exotic weapon, alchemical concoction, a rare component, or even a minor magic item (worth 250 gp per level) with a successful Diplomacy (gather information) check, with a DC of 20 (+1 per 250 gp value of the item). Mundane items or services worth less than 50 gp may be found for free, once per week, at the GM’s discretion. The maximum value of this “found” item increases by 50 gp at 3rd level and every three levels thereafter. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Names and Faces (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a fixer has either invested the time to gain personal access, or knows the right people, to easily reach influential members of the community. She gains a +1 bonus to Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), and Diplomacy (gather information) checks used to identify or locate an important person. The bonus increases by +1 for every 3 levels beyond third. This ability replaces trapsense.

**A Jaded Eye (Ex)**: At 4th level, the fixer gains a bonus equal to half her class level on Perception and Sense Motive checks. This ability replaces Uncanny Dodge.

**A Magpie Among Songbirds (Ex):** At 8th level, a fixer gains a bonus equal to half her class level on opposed Bluff and Disguise checks made in an attempt to deceive someone. This does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to pass secret messages. This ability replaces Improved Uncanny Dodge.

**Rogue Talents:** The following rogue talents complement the fixer archetype: canny observer, charmer, coax information, guileful polyglot, hard to fool, honeyed words, minor magic, strong impression.

**Advanced Rogue Talents:** The following rogue talents complement the fixer archetype: another day, master of disguise, skill mastery, slippery mind, thoughtful reexamining.

**New Rogue Talent:**

*Expert Scrounger (Ex):* When making a Diplomacy (gather information) check (DC 20 +1 per 250 gp value of the item), the rogue may find either a buyer or a seller for an exotic item, component, or even magical item worth up to 250 gp per class level. This talent may be taken multiple times, increasing the maximum total value of the item sought, and it stacks with the fixer archetype ability Scrounge.

## The Silk Scabbard
**The Silk Scabbard**

By no means a small operation, the Silk Scabbard occupies an otherwise nondescript two-story brick structure near the junction of Upper and Lower Zobeck and the Kobold Ghetto.

Tyron, Lord Greymark’s fixer, owns and runs the Scabbard with the approval and protection of the trade oligarch. This den of excess draws in patrons of all social strata. Fond of risk, Tyron runs many games and fixes only a few. The management sees the occasional brawl as a cost of doing business, and keeps the furniture sturdy but comfortable. The Silk Scabbard’s girls are well kept; a local bard advertises the brothel as “a dozen lovely ladies, and two ugly ones!”

### The Silk Scabbard
![[Midgard Silk Scabbard.jpg|The Silk Scabbard|300]]
[[Midgard Silk Scabbard.jpg|open outside]]

**Layout**

The Silk Scabbard has two floors. The street level contains the brothel, main bar, and pit fighting areas. The upper level hosts the gambling and auxiliary bar with a couple of overflow rooms for the brothel.

**Street Level**

**Area 1.1 Entryway**

A heavily-reinforced metal door with a sliding view plate serves as the portal to the Scabbard. A clockwork mechanism allows people in area 1.3 to open this door.

**Area 1.2 Attendant Station**

A man behind a caged window sits in this small room to collect a cover charge from each attendee during advertised events; it remains closed otherwise.

**Area 1.3 Kill Station**

Three men with poisoned heavy crossbows stand watch over the entryway from this room, in case someone foolishly attempts something.

**Area 1.4 Mustering Area**

Guards gather in this open space before heading to any trouble in the Scabbard.

**Area 1.5 Office**

The Silk Scabbard’s ancient clerk works here, maintaining inventory and tracking cash flow. Other than Tyron, he is the highest paid member of the staff.

**Area 1.6 Armory and Vault**

Tyron stores about two weeks’ profits here in a safe—roughly 600 gp—along with a dozen longswords and heavy crossbows.

**Area 1.7 Storage**

Casks of wine, beer, and liquor are stacked neatly here. A single guard always watches this room and the adjacent service door.

**Area 1.8 Comfort Rooms**

These rooms offer beds which fold down, simultaneously closing and locking the door. Each room belongs to a specific girl and some contain a secret door leading to the service passage.

**Area 1.9 Lower Gambling Tables**

Tyron doesn’t run the games at these tables; anyone may play. He demands a 1 gp sitting fee for the night.

**Area 1.10 Booths**

These four simple booths provide comfortable seating for 6 medium creatures, good for private conversation.

**Area 1.11 Lower Bar**

The Silk Scabbard offers drinks at standard prices (*Pathfinder Core Rulebook*, pg. 159) but no food other than salted nuts.

**Area 1.12 Fighting Pits**

A sturdy metal rail encircles these bare, sandy-floored, 20-foot-square, 12-foot-deep pits.

**Area 1.13 Service Tunnel**

This passage allows guards near the comfort rooms in case of belligerent customers and ensures discerning patrons can slip into the Cartways unnoticed.

**Upper Level**

**Area 2.1 Open Gaming Area**

Tyron offers a number of games of chance here – usually four, six on busy nights. Games involving dice, cards, or even roulette are all common.

**Area 2.2 Upper Bar**

This area is identical to the bar on the first floor and has adjoining storage.

**Area 2.3 Comfort Rooms**

These rooms are identical to the ones downstairs, but have no secret doors.

**Area 2.4 Viewing Rail**

There is ample space here for spectators to watch any of the bouts in the fighting pit below.

**Area 2.5 Office**

Tyron’s private workspace boasts windows overlooking the main floor. He rarely spends any time here, but it is lavishly decorated.

**Personalities**

**Atsen, Bouncer**

A barrel-chested man with a thick accent and thicker forearms, he likes the girls and often loses his wages on table games.

(Human; warrior 5; 42 hp; Str 18, Con 14, Wis 8; +11 mwk sap, +9 unarmed strike; Intimidate +9, Perception +4, Profession (gambler) +5)

**Drajan, Bartender**

Drajan keeps his head shaved and his appearance neat, always wearing sleeveless vests to display his tattoos. A teetotaler, he only drinks spring water.

(Human; expert 3; 17 hp; Int 15, Cha 16; +1 sap, +4 heavy crossbow; Bluff +9, Profession (bartender) +10, Sense Motive +10)

**Jitka, Pit Boss**

A half-Kariv man who left his Margreve clan for Zobeck, he undisputedly rules the game floor.

(Human; rogue 5; 26 hp; Dex 16, Wis 16; +6 masterwork sap; Perception +14, Sense Motive +11)

**Kajya, Madam**

This raven-haired spitfire watches over the other girls like a feral mother bear. Offend her, and you won’t see the back rooms again soon. (Human; expert 4; 20 hp; Wis 16, Cha 16; +2 dagger; Bluff +10, Profession (courtesan) +10, Sense Motive +10)

**Timolius Druzeldorg, Patron**

A tall, dark-haired man with a potbelly and a braided beard, Timolius spends his days regaling listeners with repetitive stories of ancient kingdoms, lost treasures, and unusual monsters. He is a fountain of knowledge, assuming one can steer the topic of conversation. His mouth never shuts, but interestingly, his money never runs out.

**Tyron, Current Owner**

Tyron wears a long coat and narrow-brimmed felt hat. He is tall, thin, and in the later years of middle age. Befitting his role as Lord Greymark’s trusted retainer, Tyron wears only the finest clothing and carries himself with dignity and calm disinterest.

(Human; expert 4/rogue 4; HP; Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 16; +7 mwk short sword, *cape of the mountebank, circlet of persuasion*; Bluff +17, Diplomacy +17, Intimidate +17, Sense Motive +13)

**Vandessian Thrikk, Patron**

A prodigious man with a prodigious thirst and a connoisseur’s love of the Scabbard’s ladies, Vandessian is quick to point out his wide-traveling merchant background and heritage, claiming with a trademark guffaw, “That’s Thrikk with two K’s, at your service m’dear.”
