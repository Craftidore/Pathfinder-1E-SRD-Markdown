# 2i - 26 Common and Archaic Languages
## Overview
**26 Common and Archaic Languages**

Dozens of languages are common in Midgard, with those listed below warranting further description. Any of these languages might be learned by an educated or well-traveled adventurer.

**1. Trade Tongue:** The most common language in the Crossroads and the Seven Cities. All characters speak it.

**2. Aklo:** The language of derro, aboleth, linnorms, neothelids, gibbering mouthers, and other creatures of the underworld. Rarely heard on the surface.

**3. Ankeshelian:** A dead human language, more than 3,000 years old, whose runes and glyphs are still used in magical writing today. Those who speak it can use read magic 1/day.

**4. Caelmaran:** A very rare language, a human dialect of Infernal. Still spoken by the Master of Demon Mountain and a few wizards. Grants a +2 to Diplomacy with devils and demons 1/day.

**5. Darakhul:** The language of the Ghoul imperium, also called Ghoulish, Charun’s Tongue, or Undercommon, is an offshoot of the Trade Tongue and can be understood with a −4 penalty to a Language check. It is widely spoken in Morgau and Doresh and by vampires, thus serves as the common tongue of the undead. Those who speak it gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy with undead 1/day.

**6. Draconic, or Mharoti:** The language of drakes, dragons, dragonkin in the Mharoti Empire. Rarely spoken by non-scaly races. +2 to Diplomacy with scaly creatures 1/day.

**7. Druidic:** A degenerate form of Elvish mixed with the Trade Tongue. Rarely used outside religious ceremonies. Druidic can be spoken even when in animal form.

**8. Dwarvish:** One of the first languages, widely spoken in the Northlands, Krakova, and the Ironcrag cantons. Older documents are written in a slightly different script called “Anvil Dwarvish” and can be difficult to decipher (typically a DC 15 Intelligence check).

**9. Elemental:** The language of elemental creatures of fire, water, air, and earth. Related to Draconic.

**10. Enochian:** The language of the Celestial Sphere, spoken in Ishadia and among the Seven Heavens. Sometimes called Ishadian.

**11. Elvish:** The language of the Elflands, the River Court, the Grand Duchy’s Court, and elsewhere. Remarkably unchanged over the past 2,000 years. Documents in the precursor language, Old Elvish (also called Thornish), can still be read with a Language check at a −2 penalty.

**12. Gnomish:** A dialect of Elvish, with many words borrowed from Infernal. Those who speak it gain a +1 to the DC of their illusions or enchantment spells 1/day.

**13. Huginn’s Speech:** The language of the tengu. Remarkably constant in the North among the huginn and in the South among the heru. Sometimes used as a thieves’ cant.

**14. Illyrian:** An archaic language, rarely used outside the court of Illyria and among nobles. Those who speak it gain a +2 to Diplomacy in Illyria and the Seven Cities 1/day.

**15. Infernal:** A planar language spoken by demons and devils.

**16. Kariv:** A dialect of the Trade Tongue, with many borrowed words and bits of cant. Those who speak it gain a +2 to Diplomacy with gypsies 1/day.

**17. Khandirian:** A human dialect related to Enochian, and spoken in the East.

**18. Khazzaki:** An argot of eastern tongues, spoken only among the nomads.

**19. Kobold:** Technically a dialect of Draconic, though most dragons and drakes pretend not to understand it.

**20. Minotaur, or Rue-Thothka:** The language of the minotaurs is complex and resonant, and especially favored in the South. Its tones are guttural and dangerous sounding. Those who speak it gain a +1 to an Intimidate check 1/day.

**21. Morphoi:** The language of the Western Ocean and most aquatic races.

**22. Northern Tongue:** Also called the Rune Tongue or Giantish. A human language deeply related to Dwarvish and sharing many loan words.

**23. Nurian, or the Southern Tongue:** A human corruption of Enochian, the divine language, and closely related to Ishadian, a dialect of Enochian. A great deal of ritual magic is written in Nurian.

**24. Umbral:** The language of the shadow elves, a corrupted dialect of Elvish. Those who speak it gain +1 to a Stealth check 1/day.

**25. Vos’ghaen:** An ancient human tongue, related to Ankeshelian. Speakers of Vos’ghaen are often wizards and masters of glyph magic.

**26. Whisperium:** A silent language common among gnomes and diabolists. If you know Whisperium and have the Silent Spell feat, you may prepare or spontaneously cast a silenced spell without the normal corresponding level adjustment, 1/day.
