# C02 - Heroes of Midgard
## Overview
**Heroes of Midgard**

The realms of Midgard have always been home to a half-dozen major races and a handful of minor ones. Each of the major races is described here in some detail. Other races certainly aspire to heroism and strive to do great deeds, but they are fewer in numbers. These races provide the majority of the bright blades that hold back the darkness.
