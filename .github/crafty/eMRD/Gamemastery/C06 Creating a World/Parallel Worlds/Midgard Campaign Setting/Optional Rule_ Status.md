# Optional Rule: Status
## Overview
**Optional Rule: Status**

In Midgard, prestige or status is a matter of public importance, and the setting assumes that PCs will come from different stations, social classes, and backgrounds. This social standing is reflected in the optional Status attribute. This attribute is generated at character creation like ability scores, but can fluctuate considerably more than the other scores.

The Status attribute is rolled on 1d6+1 if other statistics are rolled, and it starts at a flat score of 4 if a point-buy system is used. Characters add their Charisma modifier to their starting status. Status increases further by special actions (see pages 131 and 212).

**GM Note:** Status determines which player character most nonplayer characters (NPCs) will defer to. Note which PC has the highest Status at the start of any given game session, and have all NPCs address that character as the default party leader. The character with the highest Status is always the best-known and most-respected PC of the party in the eyes of others.

Some PC races or classes begin with a Status bonus or penalty at the start of play. See Table 2-2: Starting Status Adjustments. Classes and races not listed have no adjustment to starting status.
