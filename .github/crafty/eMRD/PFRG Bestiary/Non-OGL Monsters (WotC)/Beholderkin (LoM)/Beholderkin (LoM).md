# Beholderkin (LoM)
## Overview
Beholders are perhaps the most deadly of the great aberration races. They are certainly one of the most distinctive and unusual in appearance.

The original beholders are said to have been spawned on one of the Outer Planes by a primal entity as powerful as a deity. This creature has no name, and its children have no need to generate one for it. To others, it is known only as the Great Mother, a name granted more for the fact that the creature spawned the entire beholder race from its very flesh than for any real certainty that it is female. From the Great Mother, the beholder race and its various kin have propagated to the other planes with great success, for few can stand in the way of such destructive creatures.

Although the information in this chapter is presented as fact, beholders are alien creatures in body, mind, and soul. Even Iphegor of the Ebon Mirror might not have divined all of their secrets, nor recorded everything he discovered in his *Codex Anathema*.

## Beholder Anatomy
**BEHOLDER ANATOMY**

Although beholders might look like relatively simple creatures, they are in fact complex and alien in nature. Some of their features and internal organs have similar shapes and functions to those found in other creatures, but many of them are wholly unique to these terrible monstrosities. 

**EXTERNAL ANATOMY**

A beholder’s body appears, on the outside, quite simple. It consists of a single sphere about 8 feet wide, but it’s not unusual to find a specimen slightly smaller or even much larger. A beholder’s natural buoyancy cuts down on its weight somewhat, but their bodies are still dense and compact. An 8-foot-diameter beholder typically weighs anywhere between 4,000 and 5,000 pounds.

A beholder’s skin has the strength of steel. Apart from the specialized skin of the eyelids and along the jaws, beholder skin is singularly inflexible. Coloration and texture varies widely from one beholder to the next. Some beholders have smooth, almost shiny skin of a single drab color, while others have brightly colored or even striped or spotted skin that seems to be comprised of thick, bony interlocking plates. Each beholder thinks of itself as the true form spawned eons ago by the Great Mother, and any variations exhibited by other beholders are taken to be marks of inferiority.

The flesh of a beholder’s eyestalks is tough and fibrous, but unlike the skin that covers its body, this skin is quite flexible. On most beholders, each eyestalk is smooth and rubbery, almost like a tentacle. Again, there can be much variation. Some beholders have segmented eyestalks similar to a worm’s body, while others have articulated, almost insect-like stalks composed of numerous knuckles and digits that can rotate and bend in any direction.

A beholder’s mouth performs the same functions as a human’s mouth; it has a tongue, soft upper and lower palates, and upper and lower teeth. A beholder’s teeth are long, thin, and sharp, designed for ripping and tearing.

A beholder’s sensory organs are, for the most part, not quite as acute as a human’s. Their sense of touch has atrophied nearly to the point of uselessness, except for the surface of the tongue. Beholders use their tongue to feel objects, since this fleshy muscle is quite sensitive. One thing it’s not well designed for, ironically, is taste. Beholders have no sense of taste whatsoever, which might explain why they eat anything that falls prey to them. Beholders detect scents through thousands of miniscule openings (called spiracles) over the surface of their bodies, and it is through these openings that they also breathe. Of the four nonvisual senses, only a beholder’s hearing approaches that of a human’s. Beholders typically have a dozen small tympanic membranes at almost random spots across their bodies; each is merely an inch in diameter and impossible to see except upon the closest examination.

Of course, beholders’ nonvisual senses are so rudimentary primarily because their eyes are so much more so developed.

### Beholder eye structure

**EYES**

Its multiple eyes are a beholder’s most notable (and feared) anatomical feature. In addition to providing the creature with all-around vision, the eyes can be used to aim, direct, and emit powerful supernatural effects. These effects aside, the eye of a beholder is a wondrous and complex organ that has long been the obsession of countless sages and wizards.

A beholder’s eyeball is remarkably hard and solid, about as strong as a similarly sized ball of stone. While at rest, the eyes have a round, brilliantly colored iris (1). The iris seems to be some sort of translucent crystal consisting of hundreds of interlocking sheaves, each of which is capable of independent movement. This allows a beholder amazing control over the shape of its iris and the amount of light that is allowed to enter the eye. A beholder can adjust its iris to almost any shape imaginable, and can even expand it to the rim of its eye socket to give the appearance of having no iris at all.

Curiously, a beholder’s eye doesn’t have a single lens. Rather, an eye can have as many as a dozen differently sized and shaped lenses (2), all capable of independent rotation and movement and linked to the movement of the iris. By adjusting these lenses and the iris, a beholder can aim with its eye ray. The numerous lenses have the added benefit of granting the creature exceptional vision. All beholders possess darkvision out to 60 feet, and in brightly lit conditions can count the legs on a mosquito at over twice this distance.

The interior of a beholder’s eye is a tangled mess of transparent, nearly invisible strands of nervous tissue called evocularies (3). Each evoculary feeds directly into one of the eye’s three retinas and anchors an iris sheath (4), a lens, or both. The evocularies not only aid in the movement of the various components, but also transmit light and magic energy from the retinas to the lenses and vice versa. Each eye has a slightly different configuration of evocularies. In one eye, they might form a complex spiral. In another, they might form tightly wound corkscrew patterns. In a third, they might be taut and straight. The nature of an eye’s evoculary configuration is believed to be what focuses the raw magic energy the creature generates deep in its brain to create its signature eye ray effects.

The three retinas (5) of each eye coil into a highly complex, braidlike structure as they wind down the stalk or up behind the central eye to converge deep inside the creature’s body and brain. The raw magic energy that powers a beholder’s eye rays is transmitted along this braid from the dweomerlobes of its brain.

### Beholder anatomy
![[Beholder anatomy 01.jpg|Beholder anatomy|300]]
[[Beholder anatomy 01.jpg|open outside]]

**INTERNAL ANATOMY**

A beholder’s outer body, although strange, at least seems logical in construction. The farther one gets into the innards of a beholder, however, the more alien and unusual the components become. Its internal organs are a tangled, brightly colored, often inscrutable mess of tubes, sacs, coils, and “things” that have little or no analogy to those found in a human. Sages have managed to pin down the purpose for some of these organs by the process of elimination or by their proximity to the creature’s mouth. A beholder’s digestive system (and its connected circulatory and respiratory systems) is fairly obvious. Beyond these, sages are positive about only the reproductive organs and the brain.

Perhaps the most unusual shared feature of a beholder’s internal organs is their freakish buoyancy. Even when separated from the remainder of the body, these organs float like balloons, despite the fact that they rarely contain any appreciable volumes of air or natural gas (with the exception of the lung itself). An internal organ separated from a beholder’s body retains this buoyancy for up to 12 hours, or longer if preserved by magic like *gentle repose*. This natural buoyancy allows a beholder to fly, its motions and movement controlled by bursts of air expelled from its thousands of spiracles.

**Skeletal System**

Technically, beholders are endoskeletal creatures, although what passes for a skeleton in their bodies really amounts to nothing more than a large skull. The material that comprises the skull isn’t bone, though; in fact, it is so similar in construction to the creature’s skin that it’s impossible to tell where the skin ends and the skull begins. The material is hard, inflexible, and, above all else, remarkably light. Despite the fact that it is incredibly porous (a cup of water poured onto a sample of beholder “bone” is absorbed in a matter of seconds), it remains rigid and nearly as strong as iron. Unfortunately, the material quickly grows brittle upon a beholder’s death. Some alchemists have devised methods to maintain the bone’s strength after the creature’s death, but because this material is only about as strong as iron and much more dangerous to harvest, armor and weapons made of beholder bone remain little more than curiosities.

**Vascular and Digestive System**

The most readily obvious set of internal organs make up the creature’s digestive tract. The back of a beholder’s mouth consists of a powerful sphincterlike muscle (1), opening into a short esophagus (2) and then into a large, flat stomach (3) that fills most of the hollow inside its lower jaw. Numerous smaller tubes that are similar to intestines (4) branch off from the stomach and coil up the back of the creature. As they continue to split, they carry the liquefied remains of a meal farther up into the body. Eventually, these intestines become as thin as hairs, and they coil around and through a large, fan-shaped organ (5) that contains hundreds of tiny, air-filled channels. This is the beholder’s lung, and the channels constantly mix air with digested food to produce a frothy, pink fluid.

The lung itself is lined with powerful muscles that expand and contract rhythmically, drawing in and expelling air from the spiracles in a beholder’s skin. From the lung, hundreds of thousands of fine arteries branch out to deliver the fluid mixture to the other organs. This runny material is pumped through the creature’s body by the pulsations of the lung. Once the nutrients and oxygen provided by the fluid are completely consumed, the waste liquid drains back into the beholder’s cavernous maw. It is then expelled or, more often, it dribbles out in a constant stream of foul-smelling drool. A beholder that goes without food grows more lethargic as its body begins to dry out.

Anything a beholder finds indigestible is either vomited back up and spat out or slowly absorbed into the lining of its stomach and eventually embedded in the inside surface of its “skeleton.”

**Reproductive System**

Beholders are gender neutral, and they become fertile only once in their lives. During this period (which happens within the first forty years of a beholder’s life), the creature grows increasingly more erratic and paranoid in behavior. A strange ovoid organ (6) below the back of the creature’s tongue grows large and swollen; this is the creature’s womb. A typical beholder gestates up to twelve young in its womb over a period of nearly six months, during which time it grows more and more active and cantankerous. A pregnant beholder eats nearly four times its normal amount of food for the first four months of its term, storing up food reserves in its stomach, intestines, and even its lung. During the final two months, the creature’s womb has swollen so large that its mouth becomes incapable of swallowing more food, and its tongue protrudes grossly from its maw. A beholder is at its most paranoid during this time and remains hidden in its lair until it gives birth.

The birthing of new beholders is a sight that few have witnessed, and by all accounts, it’s something that even fewer would want to witness. When a brood comes to term, a beholder’s jaw unhinges, and it regurgitates its womb out through the mouth. The creature bites the womb off, and it floats gently in the air. The young beholders are forced to chew their way out of the gory mass to freedom; they are capable of flight immediately, but their eye powers develop later in life. Although a beholder gives birth to up to a dozen young at once, only a handful survive. The parent observes its young and decides which look most like itself. The others are eaten by the ravenous parent, along with the discarded womb, and the surviving young are forced from the parent’s lair within the hour to fend for themselves.

**Central Nervous System**

A beholder’s intense magical power and energy are gathered and directed in the internal organs that comprise its nervous system and brain (7). Some theorize that beholders gather magical energy from the bodies of spellcasting creatures they’ve eaten, while others believe that they simply absorb ambient magic from the environment.

In fact, a beholder’s vast store of magical power is directly connected to its eyes. Just as the creature’s braided optic nerves transmit light to the brain to allow sight, so do the eyes transmit magic to the brain for storage and augmentation. A beholder can absorb magical energy by looking at spell effects in action, by observing magic creatures like constructs or spellcasters, by gazing upon ancient relics and minor magic baubles, and by simply reading or studying spellbooks. It can even absorb magic from watching its own eye rays, recycling the power back into its brain as it uses them.

The amount of magical energy the eyes absorb is miniscule; a beholder could study the same *magic missile* scroll nonstop for months before the study would render the scroll useless. The more powerful and permanent the magic is, the longer it takes to absorb. Further, beholders build up tolerances to magic of the same variety. A beholder would gain much less magical energy from studying a single pair of *winged boots* over the course of a week than it would from studying an entire library full of arcane tomes. A beholder that goes without a steady supply of new magic to study grows cantankerous and paranoid. More than any sense of greed, this forces the creature to hoard magic items as treasure or to seek out ruins, dungeons, and other repositories of powerful magic.

A beholder’s brain is quite large. Much of it consists of two lobes that descend down to the left and right like horns. These are known as dweomerlobes, and it is here that magical energy is stored and amplified.

**THE BEHOLDER’S MIND**

A beholder’s mind, like its body, is alien to the natural world and actually consists of two separate, independent minds. These minds can be categorized as the rational mind and the intuitive mind. Having two minds does not give a beholder any sort of tactical or magical advantage; if anything, it is perhaps the monster’s greatest disadvantage.

The rational mind is a coldly logical machine that classifies information into forms and shapes that a beholder can assimilate. It stores plans, magical knowledge, personal rationalizations, memories, and goals.

The intuitive mind consists of what a beholder sees. It sorts what it observes to determine what can and cannot be passed on to the rational mind. Here, a beholder keeps suppressed memories and suppressed knowledge, details of past failures, and theories that would shatter its rational mind.

In the gulf that exists between a beholder’s two minds lurk its paranoia and xenophobia. Beholders are considered to be insane, but not all beholders suffer from the side effects of having two minds. In some, their rational and intuitive minds work together to assimilate thoughts and plans without hiding truth and knowledge. These beholders are considered sane, and they can interact with other creatures in a nondestructive manner, although they remain just as capable of cruelty and sadism as the more common variety. (See Beholder Society, below, for more details.)

## Beholder Life
**BEHOLDER LIFE**

Theoretically, a beholder can live for more than a hundred

years. In practice, though, only a few survive their first decade,

since beholders spend their early years exploring and seeking

a proper lair.

A newborn beholder possesses strong racial memories. Within minutes of emerging from the womb, it can speak the beholder language and already displays powerful xenophobic and intolerant attitudes. For these reasons, it is difficult for a beholder to become anything but evil.

Newborn beholders grow quickly. For the first few months of life, though, they are fairly helpless, since their eye rays take some time to develop. A beholder needs to spend several months observing magic before its eye rays develop fully. For beholders born in remote ruins or magic-filled dungeons, the proper development of their eye rays takes about two to three months. Until then, they keep low profiles and feed on smaller animals and beasts. In areas where magic is scarce, it can take up to a year for a beholder’s eyes to absorb enough magic to properly fuel its powers.

Physically, a beholder reaches normal size and maturity at two years of age. Afterward, its growth continues at a much slower rate. In theory, a beholder becomes increasingly frail as it progresses beyond its ninetieth year. By the age of one hundred, its eyestalks begin to lose their powers and wither away. Only rarely do beholders live past the age of one hundred twenty. In practice, though, a beholder cunning and strong enough to survive attacks from powerful adventurers and other beholders finds a way to extend its lifespan with magic. If a beholder can stave off aging, it continues to grow slowly in size. Stories persist of immense beholders several hundred years old and nearly 20 feet in diameter.

### The Beholder Diet
**THE BEHOLDER DIET**

Despite its awesome power and magical might, a beholder remains at its core a physical being. It must eat and drink, and often these are its only vices and indulgences—apart from the intellectual pursuit of magical knowledge or the domination of lesser races.

A beholder is omnivorous and can gain sustenance from anything organic. A typical beholder must consume about 10 pounds of food and drink and at least 2 gallons of water per day. For beholders, the act of feeding and drinking is their greatest physical pleasure, and as such, they often consume far more than they need. For example, a beholder could eat a large fallen foe, consisting of up to 200 pounds of meat and several pints of blood, in one sitting. While this far exceeds what the creature needs for that day, it won’t turn down any additional offers of food or drink that happen to present themselves.

Because a beholder’s sense of taste is so atrophied, it finds satisfaction in the texture and visual qualities of the food. To a beholder, desirable food has an interesting texture (the combination of soft flesh and crunchy bones found in living creatures is considered a delicacy) or an interesting shape or color, since it can observe its food with its front eyestalks as it eats. For this reason, a beholder prefers colorful food over drab food.

Beholders find wine especially pleasing. Alcohol is one of the few tastes that beholders can experience, and this, combined with the colorful varieties of wine, make it an ideal beholder drink. A beholder’s body processes alcohol very efficiently, so the quantity of wine required to intoxicate a typical beholder usually exceeds the amount available to drink. As a general rule, a beholder can imbibe well over 10 gallons of wine before getting drunk.

Since beholders often overeat, their bodies are capable of dealing with sudden gluts of food. A beholder’s digestive system can store a large amount of material (600 pounds or more) inside the various folds of its stomach. The creature can process this stored food at the rate of about 20 pounds per day, during which time it need not eat (although it must still drink normally). Food in excess of this simply cannot be swallowed. Although a sated beholder might chew on food simply for the texture and enjoyment of eating, it allows the chewed food to drop from its mouth when the texture is gone.

A beholder’s favorite foods include small live mammals, exotic mushrooms and other fungi, gnomes, beef, pork, colorful leafy vegetables, leaves, flower petals, insects, and birds.

### Beholder Variants
**BEHOLDER VARIANTS**

Beholders are hateful creatures, and nothing inspires their hatred more than other beholders. In theory, a beholder could get along well enough with another beholder that looked similar to itself, but over time, beholders always find tiny imperfections in a companion that drive them to rage. Each beholder’s physical characteristics are unique, and no beholder would regard another as anything other than an inferior, good only for food.

Physical differences are the most minor of variations among beholders. Two notable beholder variants, the elder orb and the hive mother, possess wildly different abilities from those of normal beholders. Beyond these are the myriad forms of beholderkin, true aberrations among the race. Creatures like gauths, overseers, and eyes of the deep are the subjects of wrath among true beholders, for they are similar enough in appearance and ability to be regarded as mockeries of the beholder self-image.

**Elder Orb**

One in every several hundred beholders is born with amazing longevity. These beholders are known as elder orbs, and the source of their longevity is hotly debated. The elder orbs themselves believe that it is proof that they embody the primal purity of the Great Mother. An elder orb is effectively immortal; it never grows senile or infirm from age and can live forever unless it perishes from violence or disease.

Elder orbs have statistics similar to those of standard beholders, although most have significantly advanced Hit Dice. All elder orbs have at least six levels of sorcerer. They favor spells without material components (or take the Eschew Materials feat), but they can easily produce a spell’s somatic components with their eyestalks. Elder orbs never summon familiars. Naturally, they must close their central eye when casting spells.

When an elder orb reaches venerable age, it stops losing physical ability score points for increasing age but continues to gain mental ability score points. The cumulative effect of middle age, old age, and venerable age therefore modify the elder orb’s ability scores as follows: –3 Str, –3 Dex, –3 Con, +3 Int, +3 Wis, and +3 Cha. Elder orbs have enough additional racial Hit Dice that their size increases to Huge; this helps offset their lower Strength and Constitution scores, but, in the end, elder orbs are less agile than standard beholders.

**KULARKUTHAN, ELDER ORB**

Kularkuthan is a particularly ancient beholder elder orb with formidable sorcerous skill. It would make an excellent primary villain for a long campaign against a powerful beholder cult; the elder orb’s high Intelligence score and impressive Charisma score make it a natural leader.

**Kularkuthan:** Beholder elder orb sorcerer 16; CR 27; Huge aberration; HD 20d8+180 plus 16d4+144; hp 454; Init +4; Spd 5 ft., fly 30 ft. (good); AC 39, touch 13, flat-footed 39; Base Atk +23; Grp +33; Atk or Full Atk +22 ranged (eye ray) and +23 melee (2d6+3, bite); Space/Reach 15 ft./10 ft.; SA eye rays, spells; SQ all-around vision, antimagic cone, darkvision 60 ft., flight; AL LE; SV Fort +22, Ref +13, Will +26; Str 15, Dex 11, Con 28, Int 23, Wis 19, Cha 31.

*Skills and Feats:* Bluff +49, Concentration +33, Diplomacy +12, Disguise +10 (+12 acting), Hide +23, Intimidate +12, Knowledge (arcana) +45, Knowledge (the planes) +16, Listen +29, Search +33, Spellcraft +45, Spot +38; Agile Tyrant, Alertness <sup>B</sup>, Disjunction Ray, Empower Spell, Eschew Materials, Extend Spell, Flyby Attack, Focused Antimagic, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Maximize Spell, Metaray, Weapon Focus (eye ray).

*Languages:* Beholder, Common, Undercommon, Draconic, Infernal, Dwarven.

*Eye Rays (Su):* Each of a beholder’s ten small eyes can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. During a single round, a beholder can aim only three eye rays at targets in any one 90-degree arc. Each eye ray resembles a spell cast by a 13th-level caster, with a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 30.

*All-Around Vision (Ex):* Beholders are exceptionally alert; their eyes give them a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks, and they can’t be flanked.

*Antimagic Cone (Su):* A beholder’s central eye continually produces a 150-foot cone of antimagic that functions just like an *antimagic f ield* (caster level 13th). Once each round, during its turn, the beholder decides whether the cone is active or not.

*Flight (Ex):* A beholder’s buoyancy allows it to fly and grants it a permanent *feather fall* effect (as the spell) with personal range.

*Spells Known* (6/9/9/8/8/8/8/6/4 per day; caster level 16th):

0—*arcane mark, daze* (DC 20), *detect magic, ghost sound* (DC 20), *mending*, *message, ray of frost* (+21 ranged touch), *read magic, touch of fatigue* (+21 melee touch, DC 20); 1st—*acid arrow* (+21 ranged touch), *alarm, identify, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement* (+21 ranged touch), *unseen servant;* 2nd—*detect thoughts* (DC 22), *eagle’s splendor* (DC 22), *mirror image, scorching ray* (+21 ranged touch); 3rd—*arms of plenty*, *fireball* (DC 23), *ray of exhaustion* (+21 ranged touch, DC 23), *undulant innards*; 4th—*arcane eye, dimensional anchor* (+21 ranged touch), *enervation* (2) (+21 ranged touch); 5th—*cone of cold* (DC 25), *feeblemind* (DC 25), *teleport*, *wall of force;* 6th—*legend lore, planar binding* (DC 26), *true seeing*; 7th—*prismatic spray* (DC 27), *project image* (DC 27); 8th—*polar ray* (+21 ranged touch).

*Possessions: bracers of armor +8, ring of protection +5, ring of wizardry (IV), amulet of health +6, lens of ray doubling* (worn on *flesh to stone* eye and with 5 charges remaining), two *lenses of ray widening* (one worn on disintegrate eye and with 4 charges remaining, one worn on finger of death eye and with 6 charges remaining). Kularkuthan has read a *tome of leadership and influence +5;* his +5 inherent bonus to Charisma is included in the statistics block above.

**Hive Mother**

Even rarer than elder orbs are hive mother beholders. Although their name implies a feminine gender, these beholders are as gender-neutral as typical members of their species. Their name stems more from the fact that they have the ability to magically *dominate* other beholders. Hive mothers form large communities of beholders to serve them. This is how beholder cities originate; left to their own devices, beholders would rather slay their kin than live in harmony with them.

Hive mothers are universally larger and fiercer than typical beholders.

**Death Tyrant**

These truly reprehensible creatures are undead beholders akin to zombies, though they retain some innate magical abilities. These creatures are used by powerful wizards as guardians; they are almost never encountered near other beholders, who find them abhorrent. 

**Beholderkin** 

A vast number of beholderkin exist. Not true beholders, these creatures do not share the race’s xenophobia, although most are still quite evil and cruel in nature. True beholders consider beholderkin to be abominations.

**Death Kiss:** This creature’s eyestalks are replaced with blood-draining tentacles, and its body roils with a powerful electric aura.

**Director:** A director is often found dwelling in a beholder community led by a hive mother or an overseer. It has six eyestalks and three clawed tentacles with which it bonds with monstrous vermin mounts.

**Eye of the Deep:** An eye of the deep rarely comes into conflict with true beholders, for this aquatic variant dwells deep underwater. It has only two eyestalks, but its massive pinchers make it a dangerous combatant.

**Eyeball:** An eyeball is a Tiny beholderkin with four eyestalks; they are popular familiars in some wizardly and sorcerous circles.

**Gauth:** Easily the most common of the beholderkin, a gauth has six eyestalks and a central eye that can stun its enemies.

**Gouger:** A gouger’s ten eyestalks are magically useless. Its central eye retains the antimagic properties of true beholders, and four small legs hang from the creature’s underside. A gouger’s most hideous feature, though, is its long, barbed tongue, which is adept at temporarily neutralizing beholder eyestalks.

**Overseer:** An overseer is the most dangerous of the known beholderkin. Rivaling the power of a hive mother, an overseer resembles nothing so much as a large, fleshy tree with mouths on its trunk and eyes on its branches.

**Spectator:** A spectator is an extraplanar beholderkin with four eyestalks. Somewhat mild and even-tempered, spectators have even been known to form friendships with other creatures, a trait that no other beholderkin or true beholder ever displays.

## Unnamed
**BEHOLDER MAGE**

A normal beholder can become a wizard or sorcerer. The more ancient beholders are powerful arcanists (see Elder Orbs, above) that have used magic to extend their lifespans. Nevertheless, two practical limitations keep beholders from becoming spellcasters. first, their lack of hands makes it hard for them to use large numbers of spell components. Second, their central eye’s antimagic cone makes the study and use of arcane magic difficult.

However, an increasing number of beholders are embracing a practice once held to be vile and unthinkable to their kind. Through ritual destruction of its central eye, a beholder can learn to channel and use magic much more quickly and effi- ciently than can almost any other race. These are the members of the beholder mage prestige class, and the power they wield is truly impressive.

**Entry Requirements**

**Race:** True beholder (beholderkin cannot become beholder mages).

**Special:** Must put out central antimagic eye.

**Hit Die:** d4

**Class Skills (2 + Int modifier per level):** Appraise, (v3.5 Concentration), Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (any), Linguistics (v3.5 Decipher Script and Speak Language), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device.

**CLASS FEATURES**

All the following are class features of the beholder mage prestige class.

**Spells:** A beholder mage gains the ability to cast arcane spells. These spells are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. At 1st level, a beholder mage masters all the cantrips detailed in the *Player’s Handbook* and also knows two 1st-level spells. Each time it gains a level, it automatically learns two more spells of any level it can cast.

To learn or cast a spell, a beholder mage must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a beholder mage’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the beholder mage’s Intelligence modifier. A beholder mage’s spells function at a caster level equal to twice its beholder mage level.

A beholder mage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Its base daily spell allotment is given in Table 3–1. In addition, it receives bonus spells per day if it has a high Intelligence score.

A beholder mage combines the best of two worlds; it can learn new spells as a wizard can, and there is no upper limit to the number of spells it can learn and know. However, it casts its spells on the fly like a sorcerer. A beholder mage of high level typically knows a huge number of spells and can call upon any one of them at any time, providing it has a spell slot open of the appropriate spell level.

Starting at 1st level, whenever a beholder mage gains the ability to cast a new level of spells, it must sacrifice the use of its eye rays from one of its ten small eyestalks. From then on, that eyestalk casts spells of that level and is referred to as a spell-stalk. At 10th level, all of its eyestalks are spell-stalks.

As with its eye rays, casting a spell from a spell-stalk is a free action (although a single spell-stalk can cast only one spell per round). The spell is technically considered a cast spell (as opposed to the use of a spell-like ability), and thus the act of casting provokes attacks of opportunity normally. A spell cast from a spell-stalk otherwise resolves normally; unlike an eye ray, it does not need to make a ranged touch attack to successfully strike a target (unless the spell itself requires a touch attack). The standard beholder limitation against turning more than three eyestalks in any particular direction (that is, forward, backward, left, right, up, or down) still applies.

Beholder mages do not require material components to cast their spells. The ruined central eye acts as an arcane focus for all the creature’s spells. If a spell normally requires a material component that carries with it a gold-piece cost, the beholder mage instead spends a number of experience points equal to one-fifth of the normal gold-piece cost (minimum of 1 experience point). The somatic components of a beholder mage’s spells are supplied by the weaving and waving of its spell-stalks. The verbal component of a beholder mage’s spells is the creature’s special spellcasting song. The song takes effort; a beholder mage that is casting spells cannot speak or use its mouth to do anything else that round, including making bite attacks.

**Arcane Hands (Su):** A beholder mage develops the ability to manipulate objects as if with a *mage hand* spell. This ability is constantly active and can not only manipulate objects but also use magic items like wands, staffs, rods, and some wondrous items (like a *bag of tricks*). The hand cannot activate items that must be worn to utilize an effect (such as a *helm of brilliance*).

A beholder mage’s arcane hand has an effective Strength score equal to the creature’s beholder mage class level. An arcane hand can be used to perform any attack or defensive action for which a regular hand can be used. Using an arcane hand to make an unarmed strike provokes attacks of opportunity unless the beholder mage has the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. Theoretically, a beholder mage with monk levels could use its arcane hand for its unarmed attacks.

**Ocular Transformation (Su):** At 10th level, a beholder mage’s ruined central eye undergoes a supernatural transformation and can absorb magic energy directed at the beholder. This grants the beholder spell resistance equal to its Hit Dice +5 (maximum spell resistance of 30).

If the creature’s spell resistance succeeds in preventing the effect of a spell, its central eye begins to glow with red light equivalent to that of a torch. While it glows, the eye no longer grants spell resistance. In order to regain spell resistance, the beholder must spend a full-round action to absorb the energy stored in the eye. At the end of the full-round action, the eye stops glowing, and the beholder’s spell resistance is again effective.

Absorbing the energy stored in the eye does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and it heals the beholder of 5 points of damage per spell level absorbed. Hit points gained in excess of the beholder’s normal maximum are lost.

## Beholder Feats
**BEHOLDER FEATS**

Beholders are highly intelligent creatures with an ancient history, so it should come as no surprise that they have developed unique feats to further enhance their already formidable abilities.

**AGILE TYRANT**

A creature with this feat develops longer, more flexible eyestalks than its kin. This extra flexibility allows it to bring additional eye rays to bear against its foes.

**Prerequisite:** True beholder or beholderkin.

**Benefit:** The creature can direct an extra eye ray into a single 90-degree arc.

**BANE OF THE UNCLEAN**

A creature with this feat hates aberrant beholders so strongly that it gains bonuses when fighting them.

**Prerequisite:** True beholder or must have aberration as a favored enemy.

**Benefit:** The creature gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, touch Armor Class, and saving throws when fighting a beholderkin.

**Special:** If the creature is a true beholder, the benefits of this feat apply to other true beholders as well as to beholderkin.

**DISINTEGRATION FINESSE**

A creature with this feat can use disintegrate effects to affect smaller, more exacting areas.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, ability to cast *disintegrate* as a spell or use it as a spell-like or supernatural ability.

**Benefit:** When the creature uses disintegrate on a target, it can elect to disintegrate only portions of the target. Against living targets, it still does the normal amount of damage, but any parts of the target it wishes to spare remain unaffected by the spell. The creature could, for example, disintegrate only a target’s skeleton, leaving its skull untouched. It also can voluntarily reduce the amount of damage dealt.

Against nonliving targets, the creature can use disintegrate to sculpt and reshape the object in any manner desired, as long as the result is no larger in volume or size than the original object. The quality of the result is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check.

**Normal:** A disintegrate effect destroys all of a slain creature, an entire object, or one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter.

**Special:** If your campaign uses the Damage to Specific Areas variant rule on page 27 of the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*, a creature with this feat can disintegrate a single part of a target’s body, such as its hand, arm, head, eyes, ears, feet, legs, and so on, as long as the target is not killed outright by the damage caused by the spell.

**DISJUNCTION RAY**

A beholder with this feat can narrow its antimagic cone down to an eye ray that disjoins magic.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 19, Focused Antimagic, beholder with functional antimagic ability.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, the creature can reduce the cone-shaped area of effect of its central eye’s antimagic cone down to a razor-thin eye ray. If the creature hits a magical effect or magic item with this narrowed eye ray, it disjoins the effect or item as if it had cast *Mage's disjunction (v3.5 Mordenkainen’s disjunction)* on the effect or item.

Beholders avoid using this narrowed ray on magic items since the destruction of a magic item also destroys a potential source of magic that could be used to charge their dweomerlobes.

**FOCUSED ANTIMAGIC**

A beholder with this feat can focus the antimagic of its central eye to target a single person or object.

**Prerequisite:** Beholder with functional antimagic ability. Benefit: The creature can reduce the cone-shaped area of effect of its central eye to target a single creature or object. The target must be within range of its normal cone-shaped effect (150 feet).

**METARAY**

A beholder with this feat can apply the effects of metamagic feats to its eye rays.

**Prerequisites:** True beholder or beholderkin, at least one metamagic feat.

**Benefit:** Once per round, as a standard action, the creature can enhance one of its eye rays with the effect of a metamagic feat that it possesses. Enhancing an eye ray in this manner burns the eyestalk out for a number of rounds equal to the amount by which the metamagic would normally increase a spell level. Since firing an eye ray that hasn’t been enhanced with metamagic is a free action, the creature still can use its other eye rays in a round in which it enhances one ray with metamagic.

For example, if a beholder had the Maximize Spell feat and the Metaray feat, it could take a standard action to fire a maximized inflict moderate wounds eye ray that would cause 26 points of damage on a hit. Its inflict moderate wounds eyestalk would then not be usable for the next 3 rounds.

**Special:** The creature cannot use this ability with a metamagic feat that would increase the level of a spell by more than three levels.

**SKILLED TELEKINETIC**

A creature with this feat becomes so skilled with its *telekinesis* ability that it can manipulate and use magic items via telekinesis.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to use telekinesis as a supernatural ability.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, the creature can use its telekinetic power to trigger a command word, spell completion, or spell trigger magic item as long as the item is unattended and the creature would normally utilize the item when holding it. The magic item must be within reach of the creature’s *telekinesis* ability, the creature must have line of sight with its target, and the creature must have line of effect between the magic item and the target. The item must otherwise fulfill all the requirements for manipulating an object via *telekinesis* (such as weight).

## Beholder Magic
**BEHOLDER MAGIC**

Although they are naturally potent adversaries, beholders understand the value of augmenting their capabilities with additional magic. Yet beholders are not known for their skill or even their interest in creating magic items. Therefore, most of a beholder’s magic gear has been stolen from others. 

Since most magic items are crafted by humanoids, a beholder cannot use all of the items it finds. Still, it hoards weapons, armor, cloaks, boots, gauntlets, and similar magic items so it can study them to charge its dweomerlobes.

A creature with a beholder-shaped body can wear the following magic items:

One headband, hat, or phylactery on the body. A beholder can only wear a helmet specially designed to fit over the creature’s entire body.

Three pairs of eye lenses or goggles over the central eye and up to two eyestalks (one pair per eye or eyestalk).

Three amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, or scarabs on up to three eyestalks (one item per eyestalk).

One belt worn about an eyestalk.

One pair of bracers or bracelets on a pair of eyestalks.

Up to three rings on up to three eyestalks (one ring per eyestalk).

Beholders cannot wear vests, vestments, shirts, robes, suits of armor, cloaks, capes, mantles, gloves, gauntlets, boots, or shoes.

Beholder mages and elder orbs are exceptions to the rule that beholders do not create magic items. Some of the items fashioned by these powerful creatures are among the treasures sought after by their lesser kin and adventurers alike.

**Lens of Ray Chaining:** This small lens can be affixed over a beholder’s eyestalk and held in place by suction and the creature’s eyelid. An eye ray shot from an eye wearing a *lens of ray chaining* is enhanced so that it jumps from the initial target to a second target within range of the user’s actual location. If the ray misses its initial target, it does not jump to a new target. A spellcaster can use a *lens of ray chaining* as an additional focus component to chain a ray spell as long as he holds the lens in one hand. A *lens of ray chaining* shatters into ruin after it is used nine times.

Strong universal; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 11,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

**Lens of Ray Doubling:** This magic lens functions as a *lens of ray chaining*, except that it instead splits any ray shot through it into two rays. The user can direct the rays at the same target (affecting it twice) or at two different targets, as long as the two targets are no more than 30 feet apart.

Strong universal; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 16,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

**Lens of Ray Extending:** This magic lens functions as a *lens of ray chaining*, except that it instead doubles the range of any ray shot through it.

Strong universal; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

**Lens of Ray Widening:** This magic lens functions as a *lens of ray chaining*, except that it instead widens any ray shot through it into a cone-shaped effect. The user no longer rolls to hit a target with the ray. Instead, any creatures caught in the cone-shaped area must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid the effect of the ray entirely. Each target in the area that fails to save is affected as if struck fully by the ray. This widening magic dilutes the original strength of the ray; creatures affected by the cone gain a +2 bonus on any saving throws made to resist or negate the actual effect of the ray. When widened, rays that normally affect objects (such as a disintegrate ray) now affect only creatures, unless the ray deals some form of energy damage, in which case objects automatically make their saving throw against the damage caused by the attack.

Strong universal; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item; Price 32,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

**MouthpickWeapon:** Although most beholders are content with the vast power afforded by their eye rays and antimagic cone, some revel in the act of melee combat and enjoy the sensation of crushing bone and cutting flesh. For these beholders, a mouthpick weapon is a valued treasure indeed.

Mouthpick is a weapon quality that can be added to any melee weapon. The weapon must be of a size the beholder would normally use, or it takes a penalty for using an awkwardly sized weapon. Mouthpick weapons are of Large size.

Only creatures with a natural bite attack can wield a mouthpick weapon. A mouthpick weapon looks similar to a normal weapon, but when a qualifying creature places the handle of the weapon in its mouth, the handle writhes and transforms into a shape that can be wielded easily in the creature’s jaws. The creature’s natural bite attack is now replaced by the weapon attack; if the creature has a sufficiently high base attack, it can even gain additional attacks with the mouthpick weapon. While wielded in a creature’s mouth, the weapon automatically grants the creature proficiency in its use.

Recently, mouthpick weapons have begun to gain favor among other creatures that lack hands but have a natural bite attack. They are particularly useful to druids who wish to continue wielding their favorite weapon while in a wild shape form.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *fabricate*; Price +1 bonus.

**Sphere Mirror:** This large pane of glass measures 10 feet tall by 5 feet wide. The item’s name, which seems at odds with its rectangular shape, actually refers to the spherical shape of a beholder’s body.

The glass surface of the *mirror* does not reflect light, and, viewed under normal circumstances, it seems like little more than an empty metal frame. The magic of the glass perfectly reflects the image of any beholder that looks into it, up to a range of 60 feet. The image is so perfect that it is very likely to be mistaken for a live beholder; a DC 30 Perception (v3.5 Spot) check reveals the truth but offers no additional protection from the beholder’s eye rays.

A beholder can reflect and amplify any of its eye rays off the surface of the *mirror*, effectively firing the ray from the location of the *mirror* rather than from its eye. The beholder needs line of sight to the *mirror*, but not line of effect. If it fires a ray at an object it cannot see from its actual location or the *mirror*’s location, the target gains the benefit of total concealment. It is possible for a beholder to redirect its eye ray attacks around numerous corners if multiple *sphere mirrors* are used, as long as no two *mirrors* are more than 60 feet apart. A beholder must use a standard action to focus on a *sphere mirror*, and can use only one eye ray per round when employing this magic item. Attacks made against the beholder’s reflected image do not harm the beholder, although they might damage the *mirror* itself, which has hardness 10 and 30 hit points.

A beholder cannot use a *sphere mirror* if its central eye is open.

Strong illusion; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, *project image*; Price 91,000 gp; Weight 20 lb.

## Beholder Society
**BEHOLDER SOCIETY**

Although beholders are dangerous, powerful creatures, one factor above all others has played a key role in preventing them from establishing dominance over large portions of the world. Beholders are, by any definition of the word, insane. Spawned from an insane deity and spending all their days filled with hate and wrath, beholders have minds that are as fragmented as any intelligence can be. This insanity does not breed chaos; rather, it drives each beholder to adhere to a strict pattern that forces it to consider all other forms of life inferior and insulting.

As a result, beholders are hateful and aggressive in their relations with all other creatures. Ironically, it is toward other beholders (and especially beholderkin) that this hatred is the strongest. A beholder typically views nonbeholders as a necessary evil—stock to gather and command in its never-ending quest to eradicate other beholders and their ilk. Although a beholder is completely logical and organized in its efforts, its goals remain insane.

### Religion
**RELIGION**

Beholders almost never become clerics. They lack the interest to devote their lives to higher powers, and in truth, their minds simply cannot conceive of doing so. The fact that their antimagic eye disrupts their own magic is another reason they avoid the clerical path. Yet beholders are not atheists; they live every moment in constant devotion to an ageless entity known as the Great Mother.

From birth, beholders know that they came not from their parent, who disavows them and turns on them as an enemy, but from an ancient being known as the Great Mother. To beholders, the Great Mother epitomizes the truth. All else is imperfection, and as a result, each beholder strives to become as perfect in mind and body as the Great Mother. Each beholder vividly recalls its birth not as the event occurred, but as if it had been spawned personally by the Great Mother herself. Each beholder also believes to the core of its being that it personifies the closest approximation the flesh can hope for in replicating the true majesty of the Great Mother. All others are pretenders that must be destroyed, for each moment that another beholder lives is an insult to the Great Mother. To a beholder, there is no greater way to demonstrate its faith than to slaughter and kill.

### Language
**LANGUAGE**

All beholders can speak Common, mostly so they can interrogate and menace anyone they capture alive. Beholders find it crude and debasing to speak in this language (or any other nonbeholder language), as if the mere act of speaking in another creature’s language acknowledges that race’s creativity and intelligence. For this reason, beholders prefer to speak in their own native tongue.

The language of beholders is difficult, but not impossible, for humanoids to understand and speak. Beholder is a guttural language that incorporates plenty of lip-smacking, gurgling, and slobbering. A lengthy conversation between two beholders that don’t immediately try to kill each other can quickly douse the surrounding area with drool and worse.

Strangely, the beholder language does not include a word for the name of their species. The term “beholder” is an appellation granted to the race by those they deem inferior. Each beholder finds the idea of belonging to a beholder “race” disgusting, assuming that it is a one-of-a-kind representation of the Great Mother. On the rare occasion that one beholder befriends another, it typically refers to the other by its own name, perhaps the greatest way it can respect another.

Beholder names are long, complicated, and slobbery to pronounce; a beholder typically names itself within the first year of its life. Sample beholder names include Blorghathus, Gazriktak, Irixis, Ixahinon, Khuxristul, Kreskalat, Murlbalbluthk, Qeqtoxii, Sespetoxri, Sikrewxes, Vhalantru, Xanathar, Zommist, and Zulnethrak. Rarely, a sane beholder that establishes itself as the leader of a guild of lesser beings adopts a more easily pronounceable name formed in the language of its minions. Sample names of this type include Cinderglare, Eyebiter, Gobblegut, Manglecramps, Orbius, and Slatherjaw.

### Relations with Other Creatures
**RELATIONS WITH OTHER CREATURES**

A beholder (sane or otherwise) tends to place members of nonbeholder species in one of five categories.

**Powerful:** The creature in question is something that the beholder admits is equally powerful or even more powerful than itself. This category is by far the smallest, and beholders avoid these creatures completely rather than confront them. Examples include storm giants, outsiders with more than 16 Hit Dice, powerful liches or vampires, most dragons, and deities.

**Dangerous:** This category includes creatures that the beholder admits can cause it grievous injury or disrupt its carefully laid plans. These creatures have information that a beholder needs or access to items it covets, and thus the beholder seeks to capture, subjugate, and eventually destroy the creature as efficiently as possible. Examples include humanoids, intelligent undead, mind flayers, aboleths, and outsiders with 12 to 16 Hit Dice.

**Usable:** These creatures pose little threat to a beholder, but they possess useful abilities that a beholder can benefit from if it can *charm* them. Examples include goblinoids, giants, grell, neogi, and outsiders with fewer than 12 Hit Dice.

**Inferior:** These creatures offer nothing of interest to a beholder and are simply annoying. Beholders prefer to enslave or destroy them but don’t normally go out of their way to do so. Examples include elementals, nonintelligent undead, constructs, fey, vermin, and sentient plants.

I**nconsequential:** These creatures offer nothing to a beholder but a convenient source of food. Examples include animals and magical beasts.

**Relations with Other Beholders**

A beholder’s typical reaction to encountering another beholder is rage. If possible, the beholder directs its minions to attack the other beholder and kill it, but sometimes this tactic isn’t the best one available. In such a case, the beholder is driven to attack the other beholder personally.

Of all creatures, a beholder is perhaps the most invulnerable to others of its kind, due to its antimagic cone. A combat between two beholders is savage and ruthless, especially if the terrain doesn’t allow one an advantage over the other. A beholder that is able to ambush another can end the fight quickly.

When two beholders meet on equal ground, each rotates quickly enough to keep its enemy in the area of its antimagic cone. Thus, the encounter rapidly degenerates into a frenzied battle of flashing teeth and tearing flesh. Each beholder uses Flyby Attack to swoop in, bite its enemy, and then retreat to a point where its foe cannot escape its cone of antimagic with a single move action, forcing the foe to take two moves to escape the antimagic or retaliate in a similar swoop-bite-retreat tactic. Sometimes, a beholder can use the surrounding terrain to turn the tide of battle in its favor by using its eye rays to attack its enemy indirectly. For example, a beholder could use disintegrate rays to drop trees or cave in a roof on an enemy, or it could use its telekinesis eye ray to hurl objects at its enemy. (If the beholder uses the violent thrust form of *telekinesis*—that is, using magic only to launch the object, which thereafter moves of its own accord as if it had been thrown—the object maintains its velocity and trajectory even after it enters an antimagic cone.)

In the exceedingly rare cases where more than two beholders meet, the resulting melee is proportionally more savage and destructive. Beholders in such a fight team up against the one that looks the most unusual. The beholders form groups based on their similar physical features and work together to nullify the others. As each beholder falls, the groups reorganize so that the next most unique-looking beholder is the common target.

### Sane Beholders
**SANE BEHOLDERS**

Not all beholders are insane, solitary creatures with little more on their minds than slaughter. Just as other races have members who simply can’t abide by the rules of their society, so too do beholders have outcasts. From a humanoid viewpoint, these outcasts are the few sane beholders. These creatures maintain a hatred of other beholders, but this is a hatred born of fear rather than intolerance. A sane beholder understands that others of its kind view it as the greatest threat of all, and it seeks out places that other beholders shun. In other words, these beholders live in the societies and cities of other races.

Although these beholders might be considered sane, most remain evil to the core. They know that they are objects of fear to other races and take pains to establish their lairs in secret underground chambers below a city. They make use of their charm person and charm monster eye rays to build a small army of loyal minions from the local population, and before long, they establish themselves as the shadowy leaders of new organizations. Many of these groups function as thieves’ guilds, with the beholder running the show behind the scenes or through a carefully selected proxy. Other beholder-driven groups might include religious organizations, bard colleges, wizardly schools, or even the government of a small city.

The most common form of organization, of course, is the beholder cult. These cults consist of a single beholder that *charms* a number of minions, who then take to worshiping the beholder as a deity. Beholders find that being worshiped is an excellent path to self-satisfaction and delight, and they encourage such behavior in their minions. In many cases, a beholder keeps only a few select cult leaders charmed, and these leaders guide and influence the main body of the cult. That way, cult members worship the beholder voluntarily, without being coerced into doing so by magic, which beholders find most rewarding.

Some beholder cultists go so far as to gouge out a portion of their own forehead and graft in a beholder’s eye during a foul ritual dedicated to the Great Mother. These people become clerics of the Great Mother, after a fashion, even though they themselves are not beholders. Known as ocular adepts, they represent the most devoted, and thus most dangerous, of beholder cultists. Often, an ocular adept runs an entire cult and is allied with a beholder that might not live nearby at all. In some cases, a dozen or more ocular adepts based in as many cities might all follow the same beholder. The beholder selects the location of the most powerful cult as a base of operations and rules the other branches by proxy. The ocular adept is detailed in full in the FORGOTTEN REALMS supplement *Faiths & Pantheons*, but a sample ocular adept appears in the “Cult of the Hungry Eye” adventure at the end of this chapter.

In rare circumstances, sane beholders pool their resources and work together to accomplish a common goal. Such a grouping of beholders is called a beholder cluster and consists of anywhere from two to six of the creatures. Because beholders are asexual and have little need for physical companionship, these clusters are almost always focused on dominating inferior races or gathering new magic sources for study. A beholder cluster becomes the prevailing force in the region and, if left alone, can eventually challenge the rule of nations.

Even beholder clusters do not represent the most dangerous aspect of beholder society. For this, one need look no further than the dreaded beholder hives.

### Hives and Hive Cities
**HIVES AND HIVE CITIES**

One of the most terrifying manifestations of beholder society is a beholder hive. It is not unheard of for similarly shaped beholders to live in close proximity to one another, cooperating to build incredible and alien cities in the far corners of the world.

The existence of beholder hive mothers and overseers makes these gatherings possible. These thankfully rare creatures possess a supernatural ability to command and dominate other beholders. Hive mothers are powerful beholders said to have been spawned directly from the shuddering folds of the Great Mother herself. Overseers are horribly mutated creatures that only superficially resemble the original beholder stock from which they sprang. Both can organize a large collection of beholders to work toward a common goal.

The appearance of a beholder hive varies wildly. Some are little more than tangled underground mazes of chambers and circular passageways carved by a multitude of disintegrate eye rays, while others are fantastic cities of alien, disturbing architecture. These hive cities are built by *charmed* minions, with finishing touches by particularly artistic beholders that use their *disintegrate* eye rays to carve sculptures from solid stone or metal.

A beholder hive’s population depends on the nature of its leader. An overseer can command only a relatively small number of beholders at once, and thus its hive consists of only twenty or so beholders and beholderkin. These hives are typically underground warrens.

A hive ruled by a hive mother, on the other hand, has no limit to its size. Such a hive usually even incorporates a few overseers (all under the hive mother’s control, of course). These hives are more on the scale of cities, and although they are often found in underground regions, a rare few appear in remote regions on the surface. The primary goal of a hive mother that rules a hive city is almost always the collection of other beholders and beholderkin; hive mothers believe that they themselves are the chosen of the Great Mother and must work to bring unity and order to the beholder race. Other beholder cities ruled by rival hive mothers are their greatest enemies, for they represent all that is tainted and wrong about the beholder race. Once all other hive cities are destroyed or assimilated, the surviving hive mother can turn its vast resources to the other races of the world and begin the final cleansing to prepare for the Great Mother’s return.

A typical hive city has a population that breaks down roughly as follows:

1 hive mother

2 to 4 overseer beholderkin

6 to 12 director beholderkin (each with a bonded vermin mount, usually Huge monstrous centipedes)

11 to 30 beholders

5 to 15 gauths

3 to 8 beholderkin guardians (death kisses or gougers)

12 to 24 gas spores, used almost like traps at the outer city perimeters

30 to 120 charmed minions (these can be of any of the races that are dominant in the region)

Of course, these numbers represent only the average population of a hive city. Particularly massive hive cities are reputed to be located in the deepest underground reaches or the farthest corners of the world.

Life for a beholder in a hive city is an unusual prospect. The hive mother knows at all times where its commanded minions are, and even if this command is disrupted (by the *antimagic* eye of another beholder, for example), the beholders do their best to maintain a civil air, for to disrupt the city is to invite the terrible wrath of its ruler. Yet even a hive mother is incapable of directing an entire hive. It allows favored beholders or overseers to rule its city as a council of sorts. All city activities are directed by this council, and the hive mother itself simply observes them rather than watching the entire city as a whole.

Of course, the multiverse is infinite, so some beholder hive cities across the planes conform to other rules. Three examples of alternate beholder hive cities are described below.

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, located deep below the desert Anauroch in a great bell-shaped cavern, lies the city of Ooltul. Nearly 450 beholders and beholder mages live here in peace, without the presence of a single hive mother or overseer. Their hatred is held in check by an even more ancient and more powerful race that has hidden plans for the city.

In a remote corner of an unknown world on the Material Plane lies the massive beholder hive city of Kaggash. This surface city is of unprecedented size, with a beholder population of about two thousand, and is located on a volcanic, mist-shrouded island. Rumor holds that ten or possibly more allied hive mothers jointly rule Kaggash. Somewhere on the cold, barren slopes of Mungoth, the third layer of Gehenna, looms the beholder hive-tower of Uldinath. This massive spire is honeycombed with tunnels and is home to a hive of nearly three hundred half-fiend director beholderkin bonded to bonespears (*Fiend Folio* 24). Uldinath is ruled by Tchkarthu, a half-fiend elder orb and 20th-level sorcerer. Tchkarthu desires to gain the power to command beholders as a hive mother does, and given its resources, it might just find what it seeks.

**Why Don't Beholders Disintegrae the World**

This question has haunted sages and adventurers, in particular the famed half-elf scholar Odiit Tenrest. In his famous speech about beholders, delivered to students in the Mages’ Guild some years ago, Tenrest put forth his theories on the matter.

Tenrest wondered why these horribly powerful creatures, capable of using great magic virtually at will, haven’t used these abilities in a more obvious show of force. Sure, beholders are more concerned with fighting others of their kind, but certainly there must be at least a few that would use their disintegrate eye ray to try to destroy the world, one 10-foot cube at a time.

His answer lay in the mindset of the beholder. Although typically insane with xenophobia, beholders are also incredibly arrogant and vain, and nothing pleases them more than to have other creatures fawn over them and worship them, bolstering their own overinflated egos. A beholder that runs amok with *disintegrate* and *finger of death* eye rays quickly finds itself without anyone to dominate and menace. Thus, beholders use self-control to avoid destroying everything around them, simply to keep something nearby to give them a sense of power. Without a matrix of fearful worshipers, a beholder could not exist.

When several students challenged him on this theory, Tenrest simply smiled and told them to trust his sources. Newer students wrote him off as a lunatic, but older students were not so quick to ignore him. They knew that Tenrest spent much of his time exploring the depths of the Guild Library, and, according to rumor, the forbidden depths were themselves patrolled by beholders—invisible beholders, which might have whispered advice into old Tenrest’s ears, telling him what he wanted to hear. . . .

### Lairs
**LAIRS**

A typical beholder lair consists of a winding maze of passageways bored through solid rock with disintegrate eye rays. These tunnels tend to be perfectly smooth and round, with a 10-foot radius. Beholders know that their ability to fly gives them a distinct tactical advantage, so most lairs incorporate a large number of vertical shafts. This hinders intruders attempting to penetrate the lair and keeps prisoners from easily escaping.

A typical lair consists of three to five additional chambers. The farthest chamber from the entrance is the beholder’s personal quarters, where the creature sleeps and studies any magic treasure it has accumulated. Beholders are too arrogant to incorporate escape tunnels into their quarters; doing so only invites an invasion on multiple fronts. In any case, a beholder can quickly create its own escape tunnel, if need be, with its disintegrate eye ray. Between the quarters and the lair entrance are two or more chambers used to house guardians. Most beholders keep another room off to the side of the main complex to dispose of waste or to hold prisoners. A beholder with a favored minion (such as a representative, see below) allows that minion his or her own chamber as well. Additional chambers for additional minions are built as needed. Beholders are quite fond of traps, especially those triggered by pressure plates (which they can easily float over), and they incorporate pit traps and similar protections into their lairs.

### Minions
**MINIONS**

Although beholders are tremendously xenophobic, they can reign in their fears and intolerance when faced with a creature that they might be able to use for a time before killing it. A beholder never trusts bargains when “recruiting” a minion. Instead, it uses its *charm person* or *charm monster* eyes to magically control the creature. A beholder is careful to renew any *charms* it has on its minions as needed, setting aside the waking hours of the day for such tasks.

Beholders keep minions for many reasons, the most common of which are detailed below. Beholders normally never use beholderkin as minions—they’d rather simply disintegrate them. Exceptions exist among those that are sane or that have been commanded to employ such minions by an overseer or hive mother.

**Assassins:** Beholders invent complicated schemes and plans that can go awry when other creatures meddle in their affairs. When a beholder’s plan is foiled, it uses its spies to find out what happened. If it learns that a specific creature or group of creatures is responsible, it sends assassins to remedy the situation. Only if all of its assassins fail to kill the troublemakers does a beholder get personally involved. In such a case, it prefers to use its spies or gatherers to lure the creatures to its lair, where it has the advantage, and then use all of its resources to finish the job. Example assassins: assassins, chokers, derro, doppelgangers, driders, rogues.

**Entertainment:** Although beholders spend much of their time studying magic, plotting, and bullying other minions, most keep at least a few minions on hand solely for entertainment purposes. Entertainment to a beholder can range wildly according to personal tastes, from the sadistic glee derived from watching cowering goblins forced to fight each other under threat of petrification and disintegration to the more cultured displays of magical prowess from *charmed* spellcasters. Beholders particularly enjoy watching illusions, but observing any magical display by an entertaining minion can also help charge the creature’s dweomerlobes. Of all minions, entertainers are the ones most likely to be eaten at a moment’s notice. Example entertainers: bards, goblinoids, sorcerers, wizards.

**Gatherers:** Beholders prefer to remain in their lairs, surrounded by their guardians and defenses, but they need items that can be procured only from the world outside. In these cases, a beholder employs *charmed* gatherers—creatures capable of traversing great distances quickly and penetrating secure sites with ease. A beholder sends a spy to determine the probable location of an object or person it needs, and then sends a gatherer to finish the job. Gatherers are used to catch new prisoners, although for particularly dangerous missions, a beholder sends a combined force of assassins and gatherers. Example gatherers: ethereal filchers, mephits, rangers, wizards.

**Guardians:** The majority of a beholder’s minions are guardians, creatures selected to protect the lair. Unintelligent guardians are left to squat in dead-end sections of the lair, while more intelligent minions patrol the lair and look for intruders.

Gas spores deserve special mention. This unique airborne form of fungus was originally cultivated and shaped by an ancient beholder mage whose name has long since been forgotten. In the gas spore, the beholder managed to create a dangerous yet mindless guardian that served as a form of living sculpture to honor and venerate the classic beholder form, was fecund and self-propagating, and required little to no outside maintenance. Gas spores never rebelled against their masters, never attacked a beholder by accident, and couldn’t be reasoned with or *charmed* away by an enemy. Since their creation, gas spores have taken to the far corners of the world like a plague, and dungeons that were once under the rule of a beholder lord that moved on or perished still serve as breeding grounds for these terrible fungi. Example guardians: athachs, barbarians, bulettes, carrion crawlers, dire animals, fighters, gas spores, giants, hydras, minotaurs, ogres, purple worms, ropers.

**Representatives:** Rarely, a beholder needs to interact with another society or civilization in a nonviolent manner. A beholder put in this unenviable position relies on a *charmed* representative with a high Charisma score. Beholders treat their representatives much better than they treat their other minions, and even though representatives remain *charmed*, they are afforded the best personal quarters in the lair and are allowed to keep a fair amount of wealth and comforts. Beholders do this because, of all their minions, representatives are the most likely to be discovered and “rescued” by interlopers who dispel the *charm*. Often, a representative that is no longer *charmed* remains loyal to his beholder, thanks to the preferential treatment that he has received. Beholders keep only one representative, since they find treating other creatures as near-equals to be painful. Example representatives: bards, ogre mages, sorcerers, wizards.

**Spies:** Spies serve a similar role to that of gatherers, except that gatherers are sent to collect people and objects, whereas spies are used purely to observe the lands around the beholder’s lair. A spy typically remains in the field for a week, returning to the lair well before the charm monster ray wears off to report his or her findings. Example spies: cloakers, kobolds, mephits, rangers, rogues, water nagas.

## Variants and kin
## **Variants and kin**
Information about beholder variations and related creatures has been made available in *Dungeons & Dragons* publications.


| **Name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Eye Tyrant | Standard Beholder with 10 eyestalks with Charm Monster, Charm Person, Death, Disintegration, Flesh to Stone, Cause Grievous Wounds, Telekinesis, Sleep, Slow, and Fear and its central eye produces anti-magic cone. |
| Elder Orb | A rare stronger and bigger variant of the traditional beholder born once out of every several hundred regular Beholders; it is around 15 feet in diameter. These creatures have a very long lifespan and are more powerful than traditional beholders. Elder Orbs are skilled at arcane magic, though not to the extent of Beholder Mages (unless they become one). |
| Hive Mother | These are even rarer than elder orbs. Hive Mothers also known as Ultimate Eye Tyrants are gender-neutral like other beholders, rather than female. Their name stems from the fact that they have the ability to magically dominate other beholders. Hive mothers has no eyestalks, but its magical eyes are protected by hooded covers in the flesh of the creature's body, so that they cannot be severed. The central eye has 15 hit points. Hiver Mother's eyes can use Charm Monster, Charm Person, Disintegrate, Sleep, Fear, Finger of Death, Flesh to Stone, Slow, Telekinesis and Inflict Critical Wounds. |
| Orbus | The orbus is either a genetically bred or a stunted and immature form of the standard beholder. It is only found in space aboard the tyrant ships in Spelljammer campaign. |
| Observer | An observer has a spherical body about 6 to 7 feet in diameter, covered with a tough, chitinous shell. The shell's a mottled purple and pinkish color, and can be 2 to 3 inches thick in places. Unlike beholders, observers have three mouths spaced evenly around their lower hemisphere, and three main eyes spaced evenly around their equator. Six minor eyes on stalks ring their dorsal surfaces. Observers support their bodies by means of an innate levitation ability. The observer's mouths actually consist of powerful, retractable stalks that can reach things up to 5 feet from the main body. Each of the creature's main eyes projects a ray of telekinetic force.<br>The powerful eyes of observers are the equivalent of a true seeing spell, except that the monster can't determine alignment by sight. This means they can't be deceived by illusions or invisibility. Observers are also powerful psionicists, in possession of potent telepathic and psychokinetic abilities. An observer usually relies on its magical abilities first, but should those fail or a subtler means of attack be required, it'll fall back on mental attacks. Observers enjoy experimenting with telepathic attacks against nonpsionic creatures and take a fiendish pleasure in permanently wrecking a foolish opponent's psyche. |
| Examiner | Examiners are scholars and clerks involved in spell and magical item enhancement, research, and creation. They can use any artifact or tool as well as humans, and they can wield up to four items at a time.<br>An examiner is a beholder-kin that is a 4-foot diameter sphere with no central eye and only four small eyes, each at the end of an antenna, mounted atop the sphere. They have one small, lamprey-like mouth on their ventral surface. The mouth is surrounded by four multi-jointed limbs ending in gripper pads. An examiner's true strength lies in their talent with manipulating objects both mundane and magical, and their ability to wield magical items. Most examiners maintain a collection of magical wands which they use when needed in combat, although they prefer flight whenever possible, working to maintain the arsenal of the beholder hive. Examiner has 4 eyestalks with Enlarge or Reduce, Identify or Legend Lore, Transmute Form (similar to a Stone Shape spell, but works on all types of nonmagical, nonliving material) and Spell Reflection as a ring of spell turning. |
| Lensman | A lensman has one eye set in the chest of its five-limbed, starfish-shaped, simian body. Beneath the eye is a leering, toothy maw. Four of the five limbs end in three-fingered, two-thumbed, clawed hands. The fifth limb, atop the body, is a prehensile, whip-like tentacle. Its chitin is soft and there are many short, fly-like hairs. Lensmen are the only kin to wear any sort of garb – a webbing that is used to hold tools and weapons. Their preferred weapons are double-headed pole arms.<br>Their role in beholder society is that of menial labor, and they are treated as semi-mindless drones. Few lensmen ever strive above this lot, and advanced lensmen are rare. Similar to a beholder a lensman's eye has power. They are able to fire off an eye ray from their single eye. Their eye can have one of the six following powers (although some come in pairs of effects) Remove Fear, Scare, and Rage, Cure Moderate Wounds, Dispel Magic, Tongues, Minor Image, Resist Energy. |
| Watcher | Cowardly creatures by nature, watchers are semi-sentient beholder-kin. They are used as scouts and, as their name suggests, watchers by their more intelligent kin.<br>A watcher appears as a 6' diameter sphere with three central eyes. On the ventral side of the orb is a long, barbed tentacle, which extends from just behind the watcher's mouth, and on the dorsal side is a ring of six eye spots and a compound eye. Watchers are 6-foot-diameter spheres with three central eyes arranged around the circumference of the sphere. These eyes are huge and unlidded. On the crown of the sphere is a compound eye and a ring of six eye spots that make it difficult to surprise a watcher. A large tentacle with a barbed prehensile pad extends from the ventral surface, right behind the small mouth with its rasp-like tongue. Watchers feed on carrion and stunned prey. They are information gatherers and are the least brave of all the eye tyrant races. Each of a watcher's main eyes has two powers, and the compound eye on top may draw on three different abilities. The six eye spots have no special powers. Main eyes: True Seeing and ESP, Advanced Illusion and Demi-Shadow Magic, Telekinesis 1,000 lb. and Teleport. Compound Eye: Message, Tongues, and Suggestion. |
| Astereater | A giant Beholder-kin from Spelljammer campaign living in outer space.<br>The astereater has none of the intelligence or magical abilities of the beholders. In appearance, the astereater resembles a large round boulder with a one large central eye and large mouth filled with pointed teeth. The skin of the creature is virtually identical in appearance and consistency to rock. Astereaters speak the language of beholders and the common tongue. |
| Death Tyrant | A Death Tyrant is an undead beholder that has retained some magical ability. These creatures are used by powerful wizards as guardians; they are almost never encountered near other beholders, who find them abhorrent. |  |
| Death Kiss | This creature's eyestalks are replaced with blood-draining tentacles, and its body roils with a powerful electric aura.<br>The Death Kiss, or "bleeder", is a fearsome predator found in caverns or ruins. Its spherical body resembles that of the dreaded beholder, but the "eyestalks" of this creature are bloodsucking tentacles, its "eyes" are hook-toothed orifices. They favor a diet of humans and horses, but will attack anything that has blood. An older name for these creatures is eye of terror. The central body of a death kiss has no mouth. Its central eye gives it 120-foot infravision, but the death kiss has no magical powers. A death kiss is 90% likely to be taken for a beholder when sighted. The 10 tentacles largely retract into the body when not needed, resembling eyestalks, but can lash out to a full 20-foot stretch with blinding speed. |
| Kasharin | An undead beholder that can pass on a rotting disease which killed it. |
| Ghost Beholder | Dead Eye Tyrant who came back as a ghost. |
| Doomsphere | Ghost-like undead beholder is created by magical explosions. |
| Director | Directors resemble beholders, but their central eye is smaller. They possess only six small eyes on retractable eye stalks these eyes have Magic Missile, Burning Hands, Wall of Ice, Slow, Enervation, Improved Phantasmal Force. A director's central eye has the power of deflection.<br>Directors have a fanged mouth below the central eye and possesses three clawed, sensory tendrils on their ventral surface. These tendrils are used to cling to the mount and link with its limited mind. A director is often found dwelling in a beholder community led by a hive mother or an overseer. A director uses three clawed tentacles to bond with monstrous vermin mounts. Directors are a social, warrior-beholder, and breed specialized mounts. They mindlink with their mounts to better control them. |
| Eye of The Deep | An eye of the deep rarely comes into conflict with true beholders, for this aquatic variant dwells deep underwater. It has only two eyestalks (Disintegrate and Death), but its massive pinchers make it a dangerous combatant. |
| Eye of Shadow | Beholders who spent too long in the Shadowfell. It has eye rays that blind, do thunder damage, and immobilize. It can also teleport and become invisible. |
| Eye of Flame | These beholders serve more powerful beholders. They have fire rays, telekinesis rays and fear rays. When they die they explode in a fire burst. |
| Eye of Frost | A cruel beholder who lives in solitude. |
| Eyeball | An eyeball is a Tiny beholderkin with four eyestalks; they are popular familiars in some wizardly and sorcerous circles. They only have 4 eyestalks (charm person, Charm Monsters, Sleep, and telekinesis). In 5th edition, eyeballs are called gazers. They appear when beholders sleep. |
| Beholder Spawn | These are 4th edition minions. They fire a single eye ray. |
| Gauth | A gauth is a beholder-kin that feeds on magic as well as flesh. A gauth has six eyestalks with Disintegrate, Telekinesis, Death, Drain Magic, Polymorph and Flesh to Stone (one of which is used to drain magic from items) and four feeding tendrils. The most obvious feature of a gauth is that its central eye (which affects the viewer's mind) is surrounded by a ridge of flesh and many small eyes used for sight. |
| Gouger | A gouger's ten eyestalks are magically useless. Its central eye retains the antimagic properties of true beholders, and four small legs hang from the creature's underside. A gouger's most hideous feature, though, is its long, barbed tongue, which is adept at temporarily neutralizing beholder eyestalks. |
| Gorbel | Gorbel is a wild, clawed beholder-kin lacking magic but with the nasty habit of exploding if attacked. |
| Overseer | An overseer is the most dangerous of the known beholder-kin. Rivaling the power of a hive mother, an overseer resembles nothing so much as a large, fleshy tree with mouths on its trunk and eyes on its branches. They have 13 limbs, each of which ends in a bud that conceals an eye; one of these limbs forms the top spine, and three yammering mouths surround the spine. There are eight thorny, vine-like limbs that are used to grasp tools and for physical defense. Overseers sit on root-like bases and can inch along when movement is required. They cannot levitate. Overseers are very protective of their health and always have one or two beholder guards and at least a half dozen directors protecting their welfare.<br>Overseers are covered with a fungus which changes color as the overseers desire, commonly mottled green, gray, and brown. The powers of their 13 eyes are as follows: (all magical effects are cast at 14th level) Cone of Cold, Dispel Magic, Paralysis, Chain Lightning, Telekinesis 250 lb. weight, Emotion, Mass Charm, Domination, Mass Suggestion, Major Creation, Spell Turning, Serten's Spell Immunity, Temporal Stasis. |
| Spectator | A spectator is an extraplanar beholderkin with four eyestalks (fatigue, inflict moderate wounds, hold monster, and suggestion), their central eye can act as spell turning and reflect spells back at the caster. Somewhat mild and even-tempered, spectators have even been known to form friendships with other creatures, a trait that no other beholderkin or true beholder ever displays. They are smaller in size usually around 6 to 7 feet in diameter. |
| Beholder Mage | Through ritual destruction of its central eye, a beholder can learn to channel and use magic much more quickly and efficiently than can almost any other race. Only true Beholders can become Beholder Mages. |
| Mindwitness | Mindwitness is a Beholder who is part mind flayer. Mindwitnesses are created when a beholder is stunned and placed in a brine pool. |

## Additional Details
## Publication history
Unlike many other *Dungeons & Dragons* monsters, the beholder is an original creation for *D&D*, as it is not based on a creature from mythology or other fiction. [Rob Kuntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Kuntz)'s brother [Theron O. Kuntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Kuntz) created the *Beholder*, and [Gary Gygax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax) detailed it for publication.

### ***Dungeons & Dragons* (1974–1976)**
The beholder was introduced with the first *Dungeons & Dragons* supplement, *[Greyhawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhawk_(supplement))* (1975), and is depicted on its cover (as shown in the section below). It is described as a "Sphere of Many Eyes" or "Eye Tyrant", a levitating globe with ten magical eye stalks. The beholder later appears in the *[Companion Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Companion_Set)* set, in the *Dungeon Masters Companion: Book Two* (1984). In 1991, it appears in the *[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Rules_Cyclopedia)*.

### ***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* 1st edition (1977–1988)**
With the release of *[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Dungeons_%26_Dragons)* 1st edition, the beholder appeared in the first edition *[Monster Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Manual)* (1977), where it is described as a hateful, aggressive, avaricious spherical monster that is most frequently found underground. Ed Greenwood and Roger E Moore authored "The Ecology of the Beholder", which featured in *Dragon* #76 (August 1983).

### ***Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* 2nd edition (1989–1999)**
Second edition supplements to *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons*, especially those of the *[Spelljammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer)* [campaign setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_setting), added further details about these classic creatures' societies and culture. Beholders feature prominently in the [Spelljammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer) setting, and a number of variants and related creatures are introduced in the *[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer:_AD%26D_Adventures_in_Space)* campaign set, in the *Lorebook of the Void* booklet (1989). It also appeared in the *[Monstrous Compendium Volume One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_Compendium)* (1989), and is reprinted in the *[Monstrous Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_Manual)* (1993). The book *[I, Tyrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Tyrant)* (1996), and the *Monstrous Arcana* module series that accompanies it, develops the beholder further. *I, Tyrant* expands the information on beholders through details of the race's history, religion, culture, settlements and psychology, and more.

Based on [Tom Wham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wham)'s depiction in the first edition *Monster Manual*, [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR,_Inc.) artist [Keith Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Parkinson) characterized its popular appearance with plate-like armored scales and arthropod-like eyestalks. [Jeff Grubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Grubb) cites Keith Parkinson's artwork as the inspiration for the beholder-kin created for the [Spelljammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer) [campaign setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_setting). The Beholder's xenophobia towards other subraces of Beholders was added after [Jim Holloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Holloway_(artist)) submitted multiple designs for the Beholder's spelljamming ship and [Jeff Grubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Grubb) decided to keep them all and used xenophobia to explain the differences in design style.

### ***Dungeons & Dragons* 3.0 edition (2000–2002)**
The third edition of *Dungeons & Dragons* included the Beholder in the *[Monster Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Manual)* (2000) with the expanded monster statistics of this release. Beholder variants appear in *[Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faerun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_Compendium:_Monsters_of_Faerun)* (2001).

### ***Dungeons & Dragons* 3.5 edition (2003–2007)**
The beholder appears in the revised *Monster Manual* for the 3.5 edition (2003). The mindwitness was a sample creature of the half-illithid template using a beholder as the base creature, featured on Wizards of the Coast's website on August 14, 2003. The beholder receives its own chapter in the book *[Lords of Madness: The Book of Aberrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Madness)* (2005).

### ***Dungeons & Dragons* 4th edition (2008–2014)**
With the release of the fourth edition of *Dungeons & Dragons*, the beholder once again appears in the *Monster Manual* for this edition (2008), including the *beholder eye of flame* and the *beholder eye tyrant*. Variants of the beholder also appear in *Monster Manual 2* (2009), and *Monster Manual 3* (2010).

### ***Dungeons & Dragons* 5th edition (2014–)**
The beholder appears along with the more powerful [undead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undead_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) **death tyrant** and the [spectator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectator_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) in the 5th Edition *[Monster Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Manual)* (2014). Additionally, a [zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) beholder also appears under the *zombies* section later in the book. *[Volo's Guide to Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_Monsters)* (2016) provides more detail on beholder culture and contains stats for the **death kiss**, **guath** and **gazer** beholder kin. The half-illithid **mindwitness** also makes an appearance in this book. The book *[Xanathar's Guide to Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanathar%27s_Guide_to_Everything)* (2017) contains various notes written from the perspective of the beholder known as [Xanathar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beholder_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Forgotten_Realms). Xanathar is also one of the possible villains adventurers can face in the adventure module *[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waterdeep:_Dragon_Heist&action=edit&redlink=1)* (2018)*.*
