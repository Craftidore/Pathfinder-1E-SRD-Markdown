# Entropic Creature (Template)
## Overview
Creatures with the entropic template live in planes where chaos is paramount. They can be summoned using spells such as *summon monster* and *[[Planar Ally (Spell)|planar ally]]*. An entropic creature’s CR increases by +1 only if the base creature has 5 or more HD. An entropic creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the same.

**Challenge Rating:** +0 or +1.

**Rebuild Rules**: **Senses** gains darkvision 60 ft.; **Defensive Abilities** gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; **SR** gains SR equal to new CR +5; **Special Attacks** smite law 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against lawful foes; smite persists until the target is dead or the entropic creature rests).

**Source:** Bestiary 2, pg. 292
