# Quickling (Template)
## Overview
Quicklings are creatures that possess incredible speed. Some inherit their powers from quickling parents or distant ancestors, but others seem to become quicklings spontaneously. Such creatures are often individuals in need of great speed to flee a foe or reach a loved one in time to prevent tragedy. Most count their gift of speed as a great blessing at first, but they soon learn to curse it when they see their lives rapidly passing by.

Quicklings are prime examples of the old adage, “Live fast and die young.” In fact, they age four times as fast as normal for their kinds. Elf quicklings die of old age before their companions are old enough to be married, and human quicklings rarely live past twenty-five. Knowledge of their impending doom, however, drives many quicklings to accomplish great deeds in the small amount of time they have.

Creating a Quickling

“Quickling” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A quickling creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature +3.

**Initiative:** A quickling gains a +4 bonus on Initiative checks.

**Armor Class:** A quickling gains a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

**Defensive Abilities:** A quickling gains fast healing 1 plus 1 for every 5 racial HD it possesses.

**Weaknesses:** A quickling has the following weakness:

*Aging Vulnerability (Ex)* A quickling takes 50% more damage from aging effects, including the number of years aged.

**Speed:** Each of the base creature’s speeds is quadrupled. If the base creature has a fly speed, its maneuverability increases two categories (maximum *perfect*).

**Special Attacks:** A quickling retains all of the base creature’s special attacks and gains the following.

*Rapid Actions (Ex):* A quickling gains one extra attack or move action each round. This does not stack with other *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* effects.

*Quickling Casting (Ex):* All spells and spell-like abilities a quickling creature has can be cast as a swift action if it has a casting time of 1 round or less. Those spells and spell-like abilities with longer casting times have their casting times reduced to 1 round and take an attack action to cast. This ability cannot be used with the [[Quicken Spell (Feat)|Quicken Spell]] or [[Quicken Spell-Like Ability (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Quicken Spell-Like Ability]] feats.

**Abilities:** Dex +8.

**Skills:** A quickling creature gains a +4 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +10 racial bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks.

**Feats:** A quickling creature gains [[Dodge (Feat)|Dodge]], [[Mobility (Feat)|Mobility]], [[Quick Draw (Feat)|Quick Draw]], and [[Spring Attack (Feat)|Spring Attack]] as bonus feats.

**Special Qualities:** A quickling gains the following.

*Rapid Aging (Ex)* A quickling ages 4 years for every 1 year that passes.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* There are a couple of typical buy downs (ways to reduce the CR \[Challenge Rating]) of this template:

- Removal of two feats can reduce CR by 1.
- Removal of either Rapid Actions or Quickling Casting and Fast Healing can reduce CR by 1.
- Halving any three bonuses (such as Ability, Armor Class, Initiative, or Skill bonuses) can reduce CR by 1.
- Reduce speed by half can reduce CR by 1.
