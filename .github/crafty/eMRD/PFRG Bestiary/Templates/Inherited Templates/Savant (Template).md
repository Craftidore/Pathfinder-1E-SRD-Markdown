# Savant (Template)
## Overview
Savants are creatures gifted with unusual intelligence due to some accident of birth. Physically weak and socially inept, they live on the fringes of the social order and are viewed as oracles at best or freaks at worst. Despite their quick wits, fl awless memories, and faultless logic, few savants become leaders of their kind. Some, however, gain considerable political power by serving as advisors to more charismatic leaders who are socially acceptable to others. Such injustice often makes savants bitter and vengeful creatures.

A savant looks much like any normal member of its race, though it usually has an enlarged skull to house its extra-large brain. The typical savant also has some physical deformity, such as a club foot or a twisted back—a feature that further erodes its ability to relate to others.

**Creating a Savant**

“Savant” is an inherited template that can be added to any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. A savant uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Special Qualities:** The savant retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described here.

***Combat Insight (Ex):*** A savant gains a +2 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls and A +2 insight bonus to AC against any creature it has watched in combat for at least 3 rounds.

***Deductive Leap (Ex):*** Once per round, a savant can choose to substitute its Intelligence modifier for the ability modifier usually associated with a saving throw it is about to make. The decision to use this ability must be made before the saving throw is rolled, and this ability can be used even if the savant does not know what the saving throw is for.

***Terrain Insight (Ex):*** A savant gains a +4 insight bonus on initiative rolls and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks in any area with which it is very familiar (that is, a place that the savant has been to often and feels at home in).

***Uncanny Dodge (Ex):*** A savant retains its Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being caught [[Flat-Footed|flat-footed]] or attacked by an unseen opponent. If the base creature already has uncanny dodge or gains it later as a result of class levels or a template, it gains the improved uncanny dodge quality instead.

***Skill Mastery (Ex):*** A savant chooses number of skills equal to 3 + its Intelligence modifier when the template is added. It may take 10 on checks made with any of these skills, even if stress or distraction would normally prevent it from doing so.

**Abilities:** Change from the base creature as follows: Str –2 (minimum 1), Dex –2 (minimum 1), Con –2 (minimum 1), Int +10, Wis +6, Cha –4 (minimum 1). Savants are often physically weak and socially inept, but they have keen minds.

**Skills:** The savant retains the racial skill bonuses of the base creature, but it loses all skill ranks the base creature possessed. Recalculate skill points for the savant’s racial Hit Dice according to its type, as given on the following table, then purchase its skills afresh. Treat the base creatures’ skills and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (all), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] as class skills and all others as cross-class skills. The savant retains any skill points gained from class levels.

**Skills**


| **Creature Type** | **Skill Points** |
|---|---|
| Aberration | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Animal | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Construct | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Dragon | (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Elemental | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Fey | (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Giant | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Humanoid | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Magical beast | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Monstrous humanoid | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Ooze | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Outsider | (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Plant | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Undead | (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Vermin | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |

A savant gains a +4 insight bonus on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] , [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks against creatures it has observed or interacted with for 1 minute. Furthermore, it can use all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills, plus [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] untrained.

**Languages:** A savant often speaks many languages, chosen from the bonus languages available to creatures of its type.

**Feats:** A savant gains [[Blind-Fight (Feat)|Blind-Fight]] as a bonus feat if the base creature does not already have it.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature. The savant’s high Intelligence should make it a much greater threat than an average member of its race because of the plots and machinations it can invent, but in physical combat, no adjustment or a +1 adjustment to CR should be appropriate. If the savant can cast spells as a cleric, druid, or wizard, the abnormally high save DCs may justify a +2 CR adjustment.

**Level Adjustment:** Same as the base creature +4.

**Savant Characters**

A savant favors the wizard class because the study of magic comes easily to it.
