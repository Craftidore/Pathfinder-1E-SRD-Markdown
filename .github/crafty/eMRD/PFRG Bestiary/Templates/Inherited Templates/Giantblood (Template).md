# Giantblood (Template)
## Overview
Most true giants view their ability to procreate with other races and other kinds of giants as a curse upon their kind. A few kinds of giants, however, view the ability to breed with other races as a gift.

No matter how an individual giant feels about mating with other races, the fact remains that they are physically capable of procreating with nearly any creature of naturally humanoid form. Such a union produces a child with most of the traits of its nongiant parent, or of the mother if both parents are giants. Giant parentage often results in increased size and strength, and it bestows the giants’ famous knack for throwing boulders. The giant size of a giantblood dilutes in just one generation, however; the children of nongiant/giantblood pairs display no trace of giant heritage except perhaps strangely colored hair, skin, or eyes. Similarly, the children of a giant and a half-giant show few signs of the nongiant grandparent’s blood.

In addition to their strength and size, a giantblood often exhibits other physical traces of their giant parent’s heritage.

**Creating a Giantblood**

“Giantblood” is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature of at least Small size and naturally humanoid shape that does not have the oni subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Creatures that do not reproduce in the same manner as giants cannot receive this template. Furthermore, mating between giants of the same kind does not produce giantblood offspring. 

A giantblood uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** As base creature +1

**Size:** If the base creature’s size category is smaller than that of the giant parent, the giantblood gains one size category (maximum Colossal). A giantblood that changes size does not gain the normal bonuses associated with an increase in size. Instead, it gains the bonuses/penalties outlined in this template.

**Type:** If the base creature is a humanoid it gains the giant subtype.

**Speed:** If the base creature gains a size category, each of its speeds increases by +10 feet over that of the base creature. If the base creature increases size and can fly its maneuverability decreases one step.

**Armor Class:** The base creature’s natural armor bonus improves as given on **Table 2-21** and gains a size penalty depending on the giantblood’s final size.

**Table 2-21: Giantblood Traits**


| |  | **Space/** | **Rock** |
|---|---|---|---|
| | **Natural** | **Reach** | **Throwing** |
| **Final Size** | **AC Bonus** | **Bonus** | **Range Inc.** |
| Medium | +1 | +0 ft. | 60 ft. |
| Large | +3 | +5 ft. | 120 ft. |
| Huge | +4 | +5 ft. | 140 ft. |
| Gargantuan | +5 | +5 ft. | 180 ft. |
| Colossal | +6 | +10 ft. | 220 ft. |

**Defensive Abilities:** The giantblood gains rock catching if its giant parent has it.

**Attacks:** The bonuses on a giantblood’s attack and damage rolls changes based on its new base attack bonus, Strength modifier, and its new size modifier. If the base creature has any natural attacks the damage increases by one step.

**Space/Reach:** Same as the base creature unless the giantblood gained a size category. In that case, the giantblood’s space and reach increases by the bonus given on **Table 2-21**. Reach bonuses from specific attacks do not increase.

**Special Attacks:** A giantblood gains rock throwing with a range increment given on **Table 2-21**. If the base creature already has the rock throwing ability it uses either the base creature’s range or the one granted by this template, whichever is greater.

**Abilities:** The giantblood’s abilities change based on its final size, as shown on **Table 2-22**, even if the giantblood’s size did not change. Abilities reduced by the application of this template have a minimum of 1.

**Table 2-22: Giantblood Ability Modifiers**


| **Final Size** | **Str** | **Dex** | **Con** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medium | +6 | -2 | +2 |
| Large | +10 | -2 | +4 |
| Huge | +10 | -2 | +4 |
| Gargantuan | +14 | -4 | +6 |
| Colossal | +14 | -4 | +6 |

**Skills:** If the base creature increased in size, replace the base creature’s size modifier on Fly and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] checks with the appropriate one for its new size.

**Special Qualities:** The giantblood retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains additional qualities based on its giant parent.

**Ash Giant**—An ash-blood creature gains immunity to disease

**Athach** *—Extra Arm (Ex):* An athach-blood has an extra arm growing out of its torso. It gains a claw attack with this extra arm with damage dependent on its size. If the base creature has no natural attacks this claw attack is primary, otherwise it is secondary.

**Cliff Giant**—A cliff-blood gains acid resistance 10.

**Cloud Giant***—*A cloud-blood gains the scent universal monster ability.

**Cyclops***—Flash of Insight (Su)*: Once per day, as an immediate action, a cyclops-blood can peer into an occluded visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops-blood only, and cannot be applied to the rolls of others.

**Cyclops, Great***—Flash of Brutality (Su)*: Once per day, as a swift action, a great cyclops-blood can gain a burst of savage inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons, attack bonus on all natural and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn.

If the base creature has a bite attack, the second head grants the ettin-blood a second bite attack with the same attack modifier and base damage. The ettin-blood also gains Multiattack as a bonus feat.

**Fire Giant***—*A fire-blood gains fire resistance 10.

**Frost Giant***—*A frost-blood gains cold resistance 10.

**Slag Giant***—Natural Craftsman (Ex)*: All [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills are class skills for a slag-blood.

**Stone Giant***—Stony Soul (Ex):* A stone-blood’s natural armor bonus improves by +2.

**Wood Giant***—One with the Forest (Ex):* A woodblood gains a +4 racial bonus to [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]]. This bonus increases to +8 in forests.

**Other***—*A giant-blood from any other giant gains a +2 competence bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves.

For giants of similar types their giantblood offspring all share the same boon as given above. For example, a giantblood with any kind of troll parent gains fast healing 2.
