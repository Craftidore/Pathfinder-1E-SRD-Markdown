# Savant, Lesser (Template)
## Overview
Lesser savants, like savants, are creatures gifted with unusual intelligence due to some accident of birth. Physically weak and socially inept, they live on the fringes of the social order and are viewed as oracles at best or freaks at worst. Despite their quick wits, flawless memories, and faultless logic, few lesser savants become leaders of their kind. Some, however, gain considerable political power by serving as advisors to more charismatic leaders who are socially acceptable to others. Such injustice often makes lesser savants bitter and vengeful creatures.

A lesser savant looks much like any normal member of its race, though it usually has an enlarged skull to house its extra-large brain. Unlike most savants, the lesser savant is less likely to have some physical deformity, such as a club foot or a twisted back; this makes the lesser savant more able to move among common members of its race without exciting animosity.

**Creating a Lesser Savant**

“Lesser savant” is an inherited template that can be added to any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. A lesser savant uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Special Qualities:** The lesser savant retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains those described here.

**Abilities:** Change from the base creature as follows: Str –1 (minimum 1), Dex –1 (minimum 1), Con –1 (minimum 1), Int +8, Wis +3, Cha –3 (minimum 1). Lesser savants are often physically weak and socially inept, but they have keen minds.

**Skills:** The lesser savant retains the racial skill bonuses of the base creature, but it loses all skill ranks the base creature possessed. Recalculate skill points for the lesser savant’s racial Hit Dice according to its type, as given on the following table, then purchase its skills afresh. Treat the base creatures’ skills and [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (all), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] as class skills and all others as cross-class skills. The lesser savant retains any skill points gained from class levels.

**Skills**


| **Creature Type** | **Skill Points** |
|---|---|
| Aberration | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Animal | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Construct | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Dragon | (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Elemental | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Fey | (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Giant | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Humanoid | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Magical beast | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Monstrous humanoid | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Ooze | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Outsider | (8 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Plant | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Undead | (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |
| Vermin | (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (HD +3) |

A lesser savant can use all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills, plus [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] untrained.

**Languages:** A lesser savant often speaks many languages, chosen from the bonus languages available to creatures of its type.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature. The lesser savant’s high Intelligence should make it a much greater threat than an average member of its race because of the plots and machinations it can invent, but in physical combat, no adjustment or a +1 adjustment to CR should be appropriate. If the lesser savant can cast spells as a cleric, druid, or wizard, the abnormally high save DCs may justify a +2 CR adjustment.

**Level Adjustment:** Same as the base creature +1.

**Lesser Savant Characters**

A lesser savant favors the wizard class because the study of magic comes easily to it.
