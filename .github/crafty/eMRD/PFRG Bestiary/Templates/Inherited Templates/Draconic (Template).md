# Draconic (Template)
## Overview
“Draconic” is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) except a dragon. (The dragon devotee prestige class in Chapter 5 also allows a character to gain this template.)

A draconic creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Size and Type:** Animals with this template become magical beasts, but otherwise the base creature’s type is unchanged. All creatures gain the dragonblood subtype.

Size is unchanged.

**Armor Class:** Natural armor improves by 1.

**Attack:** A draconic creature retains all the attacks of the base creature and gains two claw attacks if it doesn’t already have them. If the base creature can use weapons, the draconic creature retains this ability. If the base creature has natural weapons, it retains those weapons. A draconic creature fighting without weapons uses either its claw attacks or its primary natural weapon (if it has one). A draconic creature armed with a weapon uses its claw attacks or a weapon, as it desires.

**Full Attack:** A draconic creature fighting without weapons uses either its claw attacks or its natural weapons. If armed with a weapon, it uses the weapon as its primary attack and claws or some other natural weapon as a secondary attack.

**Damage:** Draconic creatures have two claw attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from the following table, according to the draconic creature’s size. Creatures that have claw attacks retain their old damage values, or use the appropriate value from the table, whichever is higher.


| **Size** | **Claw Damage** |
|---|---|
| Up to Tiny | 1 |
| Small | 1d2 |
| Medium | 1d3 |
| Large | 1d4 |
| Huge | 1d6 |
| Gargantuan | 1d8 |
| Colossal | 1d10 |

**Special Qualities:** A draconic creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature, and it gains darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

**Saves:** Draconic creatures have a +4 racial bonus on saves against magic sleep effects and paralysis.

**Abilities:** Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +2, Con +2, Cha (or Int) +2.

**Skills:** Draconic creatures have a +2 racial bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (3.5: Spot) checks.

**Organization:** Solitary or as base creature.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as base creature +1.

**Level Adjustment:** Same as base creature +1.
