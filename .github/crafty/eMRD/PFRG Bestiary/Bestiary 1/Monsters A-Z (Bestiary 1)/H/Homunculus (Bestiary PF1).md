# Homunculus (Bestiary PF1)
## Additional Details
### Improved Homunculi
**Improved Homunculi**

The original rules for creating homunculi appear on page 176 of the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*. A character with the [[Craft Construct (Bestiary 6 Apx)|Craft Construct]] feat can use the following rules to create homunculi with new abilities in addition to those normally possessed by homunculi.

To create a homunculus with one or more improvements, the crafter must include large quantities of certain reagents (represented by the price listed for each of the improvements below) while performing the ritual to create a homunculus. For every 1,000 gp worth of additional abilities to be granted to the homunculus, the DC of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check to create the homunculus increases by 1 (minimum +1).

The crafter can also add new abilities to an existing homunculus by performing a brief surgical procedure. To do so, the crafter must purchase the necessary reagents and make a successful [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] check (DC equal to the DC of the [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] check necessary to create such a homunculus from scratch).

**Acid Breath**: By distilling brimstone and aqua regia, a crafter can bestow upon the homunculus the ability to spit a 15-foot-line of acid. This is a breath weapon that deals 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 Hit Dice of the homunculus. The damage from this attack can be halved with a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the homunculus’s HD). *Price*: +1,500 gp.

**Extra Eyes**: By adding silver shavings to the homunculus, a crafter can imbue it with additional eyes, granting it the [[S3.1A-C - Universal Monster Rules A-C (Bestiary 6 Apx)|all-around vision]] special quality (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2* 294) and a +4 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks. *Price*: +4,000 gp.

**Spell-Like Ability**: By incorporating 10 potions of the same spell in the homunculus’s creation, a crafter can imbue the homunculus with the power to use that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. *Price*: Total cost of the potions used.

**Spit Poison**: By adding gold and realgar to the homunculus, a crafter can give it the ability to spit its poison as a ranged touch attack that deals no damage but exposes the victim to the poison’s effect as though it were a contact poison. The ability has a range of 15 feet with no range increment. *Price*: +6,000 gp.

**Toughened Hide**: By adding diamond dust and [[Iron, Cold|cold iron]] to the homunculus, a crafter can increase its natural armor bonus to AC by 1, 2, or 3. *Price*: +1,000 gp (+1), +4,000 gp (+2), or +9,000 gp (+3).

**Voice**: By adding dew of lunary and platinum to the homunculus, a crafter can grant it the ability to speak in a voice that sounds eerily like a diminutive version of its master’s. *Price*: +500 gp.
