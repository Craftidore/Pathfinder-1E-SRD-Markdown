## Special Abilities
**Able Assistant (Ex):** A dedicated wright's master treats the dedicated wright as if it possesses the [[Cooperative Crafting (Feat)|Cooperative Crafting]] feat and shares all [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] skills and item creation feats he possesses with it. This ability replaces [[Alertness (Feat)|Alertness]].

**Item Creation (Su):** A dedicated wright can perform the daily tasks related to item creation on behalf of its master. The master must meet (or emulate) all the prerequisites to create the desired item normally, and pays the gold cost himself. The only cost a dedicated wright can help with is time. The master spends 1 hour initiating the process, channeling spell prerequisites into the dedicated wright to make the item. He may then leave, allowing the wright to carry the process through to completion.

**Telepathic Link (Su):** A dedicated wright cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator. A dedicated wright knows what its master knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out to a distance of 1,500 feet.

## Description
A dedicated wright is a homunculus created to carry out the process of item creation on behalf of its master. Unlike most homunculi, a dedicated wright does not go out on missions or accompany its master on adventures. Instead, it stays home working while its master adventures.

**Combat**

A dedicated wright shies away from combat. If threatened, it tries to hide someplace too confining for its attackers to follow.

**Construction**

A dedicated wright is molded from clay, glazed with a mixture of arcane unguents and the creator’s blood, and fired in a kiln. The materials cost 400 gp. A special workshop costing an additional 1,000 gp is required to animate the dedicated wright. The person whose blood is used to form a dedicated wright’s body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as a minion for the one who provided the blood.

A dedicated wright with more than 1 Hit Die can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds 2,000 gp to the cost to create.

**Dedicated Wright**

**CL** 7th; **Price** 3,000 gp

**Construction**

**Requirements** [[Craft Construct (Feat)|Craft Construct]], *[[Arcane Eye (Spell)|arcane eye]]*, *[[Fabricate (Spell)|fabricate]]*; **Skill** [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (pottery) DC 14; **Cost** 3,500 gp.

**Monster Feat Advancement**

Creatures gain one feat at 1 Hit Die and one additional feat for every 2 Hit Dice above 1. Most additional feats should be focused on increasing the creature’s combat abilities, but metamagic feats and skill feats are also possible choices depending on the creature’s role.

## Additional Details
Under the Construction requirements, [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (clockwork) may be substituted for [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (pottery) for a clockwork homunculus. This causes the clockwork dedicated wright to have a metallic body (cost 1,000 gp).
