# Generating a Character
## Overview
Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your character sheet 

**Step 1—Determine Ability Scores:** Start by generating your character’s ability scores (using the point buy system outlined above). These six scores determine your character’s most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.

**Step 2—Pick Your Race:** Next, pick your character’s race, noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits. There are seven basic races to choose from, although others will be added to the list on a case by case basis. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.

**Step 3—Pick Your Class:** A character’s class represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.

**Step 4—Pick Skills and Select Feats:** Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many feats your character receives, based on his class and level, and select them.

**Step 5—Buy Equipment:** Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class (take maximum gold allowed at first level for your class), that can be spent on a wide range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without the consent of your GM.

**Step 6—Finishing Details:** Finally, you need to determine all of a character’s details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character’s name, alignment, and physical appearance. 

Take any [[Character Traits|Character traits]] and [[Drawbacks|drawbacks]]. You may have up two traits; you must take a drawback for each trait you choose.

You may take 1 flaw (must be approved by the GM and worked into your backstory) which will provide one additional feat (also to be approved by the GM and worked into your backstory).

**Backstory:** Take a few minutes to provide yourself, the group and the GM with a few paragraphs about your character's life story prior to achieving 1st level. Include any pertinent family history you desire (ie., siblings, raised as an orphan, etc.) and any circumstances used to gain character traits/drawback and flaws/bonus feats.

**Ability Generation:** You may choose from the following options for character generation in this campaign:

**D&D 3.5**


Point buy from D&D3.5 DMG Page 169:

32 points

28 points (but you may choose an additional feat at 1st level)

24 points (but you may choose a +1 level bonus race or 2 bonus feats)

20 points (but you may choose a +1 level bonus race and 1 bonus feat or 3 bonus feats)

16 points (but you may choose a +2 level bonus race or +1 level bonus race and 2 bonus feats or 4 bonus feats)

Point buy is standard 3.5 (ie., all stats start at 8 and then you purchase using the table from the DMG v3.5 page 169). Please note this a change from what was said at the last game; we are going with 32 pt build, starting at 8, no dump stat!

If you choose an ECL adjusted race, you may by taking fewer points take the race at 1st level and NOT have to buy off the ECL penalty.
