# Hepmonaland
## Overview
[[Hepmonaland]] is a land on the verge, simultaneously pushing on the edge of the map of the Pearl Sea and lying near the Tilvanot Peninsula. The nigh impassable jungles of the area known as the Central Reach and the perilous navigation hazards of Xuxchan Bay isolate [[Hepmonaland]] from the [[Flanaess]], and its closest neighbors are only nominally
nations themselves. Several nations (as well as groups of adventurers) have attempted to colonize [[Hepmonaland]]) with limited success. 

Yet the citizens of [[Hepmonaland]] were not the first to attempt to carve civilization out of the wild region—since the dawn of history, humanity has strived to form great kingdoms amid the dangers of the Central Reach. Crumbled ruins are all that remain of these vanished empires, and even their names have been forgotten by history. Some scholars even whisper that lost ruins of the ancient Sarrukhan empire may be found in the unexplored jungles, but these crackpot theories are dismissed by more reputable sages. But whatever their origins, these ruins may provide incredible wealth and power to those who rediscover them. This dangerous land and the wilderness beyond serve as the setting for the Dragon's Claw.

This guide seeks to aid players preparing to take part in the Dragon's Claw adventure, to arm them with spoiler-free details and rules elements useful in the forthcoming challenges, and to help create backgrounds that easily mesh with the campaign. Along with advice for players of most races and character classes—details on [[Sharbhat]], the country in closest proximity to the campaign’s events, and of the Pogue's Folly, the ship conveying the PCs to adventure, should help ground players in the circumstances and events of this adventure.
