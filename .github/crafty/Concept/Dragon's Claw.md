# Dragon's Claw
## Overview
The Dragon's Claw adventure is a reworking of the Serpent's Skull Adventure Path from Paizo to make it suitable for play in the World of Greyhawk Setting.

**Dragon's Claw PCs**


Your band of characters begins the adventure as passengers on a cargo ship called the Pogue's Folly, headed south to [[Sasserine]]. The voyage promises not only to bring your characters together as you face adversity, but also to set you on a path into the very heart of one of [[Oerth]]’s most feared regions in search of wealth, fame, and ancient secrets. PCs in the adventure are not limited to origins in [[Sasserine]] itself. In fact, characters in this campaign may be from just about anywhere. Countless motivations draw the daring, curious, and downright foolhardy to [[Sharbhat]] with the hope of attaining personal fame and fortune, and your PCs likely boast a variety of backgrounds and decidedly different reasons for traveling to [[Sharbhat]]’s capital city.

This Guide is intended to provide characters with a reason to be on the Pogue's Folly, whether they are from a distant part of the Pearl Sea journeying to a new land or natives of [[Sharbhat]] returning home. The following suggestions provide basic information on potential PC origins, but focus on motivations to bring characters of all races and classes to [[Sharbhat]]. Use this guide as a starting point to give your PCs a reason to be aboard the fateful voyage that launches the adventure.

The following pages outline qualities of typical members of all seven core races, all 11 core classes, and the six classes found in the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide. Characters of all alignments, religions, and homelands can play a vital role in this campaign, and the following suggestions should serve to spark a concept or background for your PC. You’ll also find several new traits specific to the adventure to better customize your characters and link them to the campaign’s setting and plot.

**Land ho!**

While many of the background hooks described below involve seafaring and nautical adventuring, the adventure takes place on land, amid treacherous jungles, ruined cities, and vast underground vaults. Players who create PCs optimized for adventures at sea will be disappointed; use these suggestions to get PCs on the Pogue's Folly, but don’t expect them to stay there. If you want to play a “fish-out-of-water” character, thrown into adventures where his sea legs won’t help him, consider making your PC a member of the Pogue's Folly’s crew, but keep in mind that aquatic animal companions or skills such as [[Profession (Skill)|Profession]] (sailor) won’t benefit him for most of the adventure.

**Races**

While [[Sharbhat]] is primarily a human land—its population consisting of mainly [[Hepmonaland]] natives and even Scarlet Brotherhood-descended colonials—members of all races have reason to travel aboard the Pogue's Folly, seeking fame, fortune, or in some cases, anonymity and escape. All of [[Oerth]]’s core races exist in [[Sharbhat]] and members of any could be natives returning home from journeys abroad. Likewise, members of all races have numerous motivations to travel to the region from distant homelands throughout the Pearl Sea and [[Oerth]] at large. Regardless of your PC’s race, the passage south will set him on a straight course for adventure.

**Dwarves**

Although dwarves are not typically found at sea, even the least nautical among them must travel via ship to distant lands for trade or diplomatic reasons; whether they’re coming from Goldplain in Cairn Hills, the Lortmil Mountains, or the parched dunes of the Bright Lands, the Pogue's Folly provides the perfect opportunity for ambitious dwarves to reach [[Sasserine]]. Many hope to capture some of the wealth of the notorious Deeptreasure Mining Company, who retrieve tons of gems and precious metals from beneath the Bandu Hills, bringing inordinate riches to those involved in the operation, and most dwarves traveling to or from [[Sharbhat]] have some connection to this lucrative enterprise. Less entrepreneurial dwarves share a racial aff inity for stone with their mining brethren, and might travel to [[Sharbhat]] with plans to explore the many ancient ruins that pepper the wilderness of the Central Reach.

**Elves**

Elves as a race are relatively insular, preferring their own company to mixed settlements, though they may be found in small numbers in nearly every community throughout [[Oerth]]. Those elves raised apart from their own kind—known collectively as the Forlorn—are prone to travel and exploration and are likely to have secret and personal reasons for a nautical journey to [[Sharbhat]]. Elves’ long lifespans provide them a unique perspective on history, and they often have a strong interest in all things ancient; elves from any part of [[Oerth]] might find the mysteries of the Central Reach inspiration enough to leave their homeland. Elves native to [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach are generally members of the widespread Ekujae people, which consists of numerous clans and tribes of wild elves, who are considered primitive by their kin from other “civilized” lands. Frequently captured and sold into slavery, Ekujae live throughout [[Hepmonaland]] and once freed from bondage, generally return to their native homes.

**Gnomes**

[[Oerth]]’s wily gnomes are ever at risk of the dreaded Bleaching and constantly fight against its deadly effects by engaging in new and exciting experiences. What better way to inject interest into a gnome’s life than the exploration of ancient ruins and immersion in the varied cultures of the Central Reach’s dense jungles?

Wondrous foreign ports and eccentric seafarers may lead some gnomes to a life of destinationless nautical travel—including passage on the Pogue's Folly. Particularly adventurous gnomes might even serve as a member of the ship’s crew, trusting that passengers will provide enough variety to keep them young and colorful through their careers at sea. Rumors of ancient [[Hepmonaland]] ruins housing a spriggan community draw gnomes curious about their wild brethren to [[Sharbhat]], and have led to a number of deep jungle expeditions; none of these have greatly unraveled the mystery. 

Half-Elves

Half-elves often find sedentary lives unfulfilling and are generally overcome by wanderlust in late adolescence or early adulthood. Whether searching for an absent parent whose disappearance caused them trouble in their youth or seeking to fulfill the auspicious destiny of their human or elven ancestry, travel to distant corners of the world and immersion in unfamiliar cultures inspire many half-elves’ wanderings. Those journeying to [[Sharbhat]] may be exiled offspring of an embarrassing tryst amid the Pearl Sea’s nobility or might plan to search the [[Hepmonaland]] jungles for an Ekujae relative. Half-elves who have suffered especially heinous prejudice against their mixed heritage might dedicate themselves to the Sharbhatn natives’ cause against the oppression of their former Brotherhood rulers. Regardless of their reasons, half-elves are no strangers to adventure, and the lost colony of [[Sharbhat]] provides endless promise to anyone seeking danger and excitement.

**Half-Orcs**

Outcasts in most of the civilized lands of the Pearl Sea, half-orcs often travel to the ends of the map to escape persecution, prejudice, and their shameful origins. Indigenous orc tribes are rare in [[Hepmonaland]], so most half-orcs in [[Sharbhat]] are travelers from other lands. Those half-orcs native to [[Sharbhat]] are usually descended from such foreign half-orc colonists, though many claim native [[Hepmonaland]] parents. Among the demon-worshiping Bekwa common south of Desperation Bay in particular, human mothers see giving birth to a half-orc child as a blessing from [[Lamashtu]], the Mother of Monsters.

These bestial children are raised to be mighty warlords and slavers, but it is not uncommon for half-orcs bred in such a way to reject their parents’ expectations and leave their homeland to forge their own identities free from demonic inf luence. A half-orc of this origin may be on the Pogue's Folly returning home to right past wrongs or teach a better way to her people.

**Halflings**

As in most human lands, halflings often call the metropolitan cities and remote settlements of [[Sharbhat]] home, living quietly in the shadows of the region’s human population. A large number of halfling slaves were brought to the savage land when their Brotherhood masters colonized the region and have remained ever since. When [[Sharbhat]] gained its independence from the Scarlet Brotherhood in 574 CY, many of these slaves were freed either by decree or circumstance. These freed slaves began their own lives in [[Sharbhat]]’s bustling capital of Chebikav, often working on the harbor’s extensive docks and shipyards. Escaped halfling slaves from current-day Scarlet Brotherhood environs and countless other lands may travel to [[Sharbhat]] in the hope of starting a new life in a land where both halflings and native humans alike live under the recent memory of subservience and embrace a potential future of liberty. Halflings’ hardiness, easygoing natures, small size, and nimbleness make them ideal sailors, and the crew of the Pogue's Folly may contain one or more of the small seamen.

**Humans**

[[Hepmonaland]] is an undeniably human land. Since time immemorial, tribesmen have lived in the region. Chebikav seafarers are the most likely to have traveled to the greater reaches of the world and are thus most easily placed aboard vessels like the Pogue's Folly. The second most prominent sub-ethnicity among [[Sharbhat]]’s Central Reach natives are the ubiquitous Zanj, who exist in nearly every village or city from the Barrier Wall Mountains to the Screaming Jungle. The demon-worshiping Bekwa live almost solely in and south of [[Sharbhat]], but they comprise only a small minority of the region’s overall native population. Other than indigenous inhabitants, the most frequently encountered humans in [[Sharbhat]] are colonials whose ancestors may have lived in the region since 574 CY, many of whom consider themselves as native to the land as the Hepmonalanders. The draw of the Central Reach’s countless treasures and myriad mysteries bring members of all ethnicities to Chebikav, however, and all human cultures might have reason to travel there aboard ships like the Pogue's Folly.

**Other Races**

Other races can be found in [[Hepmonaland]]; most often as members of very small enclaves of their race or as single travellers. Check with the GM with regard to a desired race and be prepared to provide a solid backstory. 

**Classes**

While [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach play host to some classes more easily than others, members of all types have reason to journey to the region on the Pogue's Folly. Be they natives to the land returning home from travels abroad or foreigners venturing into uncharted territory for the first time, characters of any class can play an important role in the adventure. The following suggestions should provide context for both native and foreign PCs of all classes, but members of each may find additional reasons to travel to [[Sharbhat]] based on their particular origins.

Alchemists

Often self-involved and aloof, alchemists are generally more concerned with their inventive extracts and newest formulae than with the world around them. That said, some alchemists belong to a local guild or arcane school—many of which exist in most major cities in the Pearl Sea region. These organizations frequently send their members and apprentices to distant lands to collect rare reagents or explore unknown regional techniques. [[Sharbhat]], isolated as it is from most of the Pearl Sea by the Eye of Abendego, is the perfect destination for such an academic. Alchemists are sometimes misunderstood by society at large, and seen as strange, dangerous, even mad—often not completely inaccurate assessments—and might travel aboard the Pogue's Folly seeking a fresh start in faroff [[Sharbhat]]. Native Sharbhatans may have traveled to distant lands to gather allies for an expedition into the Central Reach in search of ancient alchemical formulae among the region’s countless lost tribes.

**Recommendations:** Traversing the wilderness and exploring dangerous ancient ruins play a major role in the adventure, so skills like [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana), [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]], [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] will see significant use. Additionally, characters will find themselves far from civilization for much of the campaign and having such versitile crafters in the party could prove helpful.

**Barbarians**

Wild and reckless barbarians seem a natural fit for the untamed reaches of the Central Reach, and many warriors native to the region are more berserkers than trained fighters. Even races generally considered cultured—such as elves—have barbaric tribes in the Central Reach and [[Sharbhat]]. [[Sharbhat]]’s position on the edge of civilization attracts many brawlers who find life in other lands difficult, and dockside taverns and brothels teem with unruly warriors from as far away as the frozen northlands of the Frost Barbarians; countless vessels bring such travellers to Chebikav’s harbor on a daily basis and the Pogue's Folly could easily be among them.

**Recommendations:** Wilderness exploration plays a major role in the adventure, so skills like [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]], [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]], and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] will be used quite often. The talents of an accomplished combatant, especially one capable of sensing traps and with experience in the wilds, also won’t go untested.

**Bards**

Ever collecting lost lore and captivating tales of high adventure, bards are frequently drawn to the ancient lands of the Central Reach. Eleder, with its impressive docks and shipyards, makes an ideal destination for traveling bards from across [[Oerth]], who often find the lawless and unscrupulous ports of Bloodcove or the Shackles more trouble than they’re worth. The ongoing struggle between [[Sharbhat]]’s colonials and the natives has raised the demand for political agents, and bards increasingly serve both causes as diplomats, mediators, spies, and inspirational orators. Native bards often specialize in the tribal chants and rhythmic drumcalling of the [[Hepmonaland]] people, in whose oral traditions they feature prominently. The thrumming beat of their ancestral drums resonates through the dense foliage and expansive savannas of the nation, maintaining an air of mystery about the drummers that still unsettles visitors to this day.

**Recommendations:** Diplomatic interactions between native tribes, nations, and other factions play a significant role in the adventure. Skills like [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] should be helpful quite often. All [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills will be useful at points during the campaign, but those having to do with the wilderness, esoteric religions, and the history and elusive secrets of the Central Reach will be most useful (typically arcana, geography, history, local, nature, and religion). Not a few of the region’s inhabitants, such as giant vermin or enormous carnivorous plants, are immune to mind-affecting magic. The versatile bard makes sure to have options available to deal with such threats when exploring the Central Reach.

**Cavaliers**

Many cavaliers find [[Sharbhat]] a nation much in need of their talents. Battlefield marshals increasingly travel to Chebikav aspiring to manage troops against the growing native unrest in the Kabrev Plains or to secure [[Sharbhat]]’s border with the Touv. Native cavaliers may have traveled to other parts of the Pearl Sea to receive training by their order and are now returning to their homeland to put their skills into practice. Cavaliers in the region typically ride horses, though the farther east one travels, the more likely one is to encounter strange jungle animals employed as mounts. Depending on the cavalier’s chosen order, he might be sent or volunteer to travel to [[Sharbhat]] to represent any established ruler, noble, or religion.

**Recommendations:** Cavaliers of all orders will find themselves useful in the campaign. The mandates of the order of the cockatrice and order of the dragon especially suit the upcoming adventures’ themes with their desires for fortune and glory, whether for themselves or companions. The close quarters of the jungle and dungeon exploration can make employing a mount challenging at times, so cavaliers might want to either devise creative tactics to utilize their steeds or focus on other aspects of their class. 

**Clerics**

Priests of all faiths travel the world on vessels much like the Pogue's Folly, and can justifiably be mere passengers on the voyage. Those most likely to travel to [[Sharbhat]] might be clerics of Mayaheine, hoping to quell rebellion and maintain order in Kalabuto, or faithful of Olidammara hoping to help the natives reclaim their homeland or prevent bloodshed. Members of some tribes often venerate a deity known as Shimye-Magalla, a janiform amalgam of Vara and Vogan though worship of the these two gods as separate deities is more common in the region overall. Wee Jas has gained a large following among the jungle tribes, which find the Central Reach’s many ancient ruins sources of immense and mysterious power. Less common, though nevertheless present, the Bekwa people worship a number of malicious demon lords including Graz'zt, [[Lamashtu]], and Pazuzu; cultists from across [[Oerth]] may be drawn to the region in search of like-minded people, or demon hunters and holy warriors may travel here to hunt down and eradicate these evil sects.

**Recommendations:** [[Breeka]] has a strong presence in the adventure, with the faith’s focus on wilderness and magical mysteries promising to serve worshipers well over the course of the campaign. Clerics of Fahrlanghn will be rewarded for the long journey, while those who venerate [[Beory]] may find their goddess represented in unusual ways in parts of the Central Reach. And [[Istus]], being one of the oldest deities, has traditions that date back for many thousands of years, and rumors of ancient secrets of the faith being hidden in lost ruins are common. Ultimately all of the deities may make excellent choices for clerics to worship, though you should check with your GM before choosing a god from beyond [[Oerth]]’s core deities.

**Druids**

[[Sharbhat]] serves as an active gateway to the jungles of the Central Reach, and few locations on [[Oerth]] attract druids in large numbers like the wild and untamed lands at the heart of [[Hepmonaland]]. Whether hoping to explore the region, harness its primeval powers, or guide civilization into the dense wilderness, druids often pass through Chebikav and, more often than not, Kalabuto farther inland.

Among the native population, many tribes employ shamanistic druids as spiritual leaders, and apprentice druids might have ties to one of [[Sharbhat]]’s many native peoples. Druids are likely to be aboard the Pogue's Folly as passengers, en route to [[Sharbhat]] or the Central Reach beyond with more personal motivations.

**Recommendations:** A wide variety of exotic creatures make logical choices for druids operating in the the Central Reach: ape, bird, boar, cat (big or small), crocodile, dinosaur, dog, horse, pony, and snake (constrictor or viper). From the Monster Manuals (and Bestiaries), the following additional choices are logical: dire bat, dire rat, elephant, giant frog, hyena, monitor lizard, and any of the specific dinosaurs listed. Players might also want to check with their GMs to see if any creatures in adventure's bestiaries might make appropriate companions.

**Fighters**

Few classes are as well suited for the dangerous and violent lands of [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach as the dedicated and highly-trained fighter. Often hired to escort vulnerable explorers, scholars, and merchants through the imposing jungles, fighters travel with nearly every group on the roads or waterways of the region. In the more civilized areas around Chebikav and Alocotla, mercenaries from across [[Oerth]] may be hired to fight for either side of the ongoing conf lict between the natives and colonists. Fighters born and raised in the region may be returning home on the Pogue's Folly after a campaign—failed or successful—in the nations of the north.

**Recommendations:** All manner of weapons and armor exist in the Central Reach, but legends speak of certain types of powerful magic weapons being hidden in the region’s ancient ruins. Fighters might want to avoid dedicating themselves to the use of heavy armor—or pursue ways of increasing their mobility in such armaments—as the heat and other challenges of the jungle can make such gear unwieldy, or even dangerous, to wear.

**Inquisitors**

Inquisitors of all faiths have good reason to make the long journey to [[Sharbhat]]. Zealous agents of lawful deities such as Pelor, Asmodeus, and Wee Jas may endeavor to preserve order amid rising animosity among [[Sharbhat]]’s inhabitants. Freedom-loving inquisitors, such as those venerating [[Beory]], Olidammara, or Mayaheine, may travel to [[Sharbhat]] to end the influence of the Scarlet Brotherhood colonials once and for all. The faithful of Wee Jas might plan to explore the Central Reach for long-lost secrets, either to uncover eldritch magic or to keep history’s powerful mysteries hidden from the world.

Other inquisitors might be returning home from another nation in the Pearl Sea with a prisoner in tow, or hunting down a particularly elusive quarry believed to be hiding in [[Sharbhat]] or the Central Reach. An inquisitor of any faith may set her determined gaze on [[Sharbhat]]’s shores for any of these reasons, or because of the simple, unceasing belief that her deity wills her to the exotic city for an as yet unknown purpose.

**Recommendations:** Any of the deities listed in the cleric description make excellent choices for inquisitors to serve over the course of the adventure. Judgements aimed at defending an inquisitor from the hazards common to the jungle, especially poison and disease, can prove especially useful. While inquisitors of any walk can surely find suitable motivation and quarries to inspire them through the campaign, those willing to quest for treasure, secrets, or ancient relics will find endless reasons to venture into the jungles’ depths. 

**Monks**

[[Hepmonaland]]’s western coast is not typically a region known for its monk inhabitants, but there are a number of reasons one might travel to the region from Keoland, Ket, or somewhere in the Theocracy of the Pale. Among the native peoples of the [[Hepmonaland]] interior, there are many cultures which forego armor and manufactured weapons, preferring the increased mobility and spontaneity unarmed combat allows as they face unsuspected threats in the dangerous land; a native monk may lack fangs and talons, but his natural weapons are no less effective than those of the jungle’s most ferocious beasts.

**Recommendations:** While monks are not particularly common in [[Sharbhat]] (or liked, due to past incidents with members of the Scarlet Brotherhood), a monk’s self-sufficiency will prove quite helpful in the campaign. Speed and flexibility will also serve monk characters well in a land of unpredictable challenges, both living and environmental. Focusing on ways to cripple creatures that rely more on natural weapons than on manufactured tools will serve monks well.

**Oracles**

The gods don’t generally intervene in the everyday events of nations or mortals, but their influence sometimes manifests in the form of enigmatic oracles—divine conduits of mysterious origin and purpose. For those rare individuals blessed and cursed with preternatural powers, the ancient, inscrutable jungles of the Central Reach are an attractive destination. Some oracles, ostracized from their homes by superstitious locals, make their way south on the Oljatt Sea to the port of Chebikav, where the Central Reach is only a short journey inland. There, many hope to find answers to pervasive questions regarding their very existence. Sharbhatan or [[Hepmonaland]] natives may likewise travel throughout the Pearl Sea seeking their own answers and assurances amid the most reputable and prestigious universities and temples from Greyhawk to [[Sasserine]]. Whether successful or not in these quests to understand themselves, such oracles often return home to seek a peaceful life in their homelands.

**Recommendations:** Oracles of all mysteries will find themselves useful in the adventure, but oracles of battle, bones, life, lore, nature, and stone will find the strongest ties to the themes and events of the campaign. Of all an oracle’s curses, the clouded vision and tongues options might eventually prove most beneficial.

**Paladins**

Holy warriors may travel to [[Sharbhat]] for any number of reasons. Paladins focused on maintaining order see the growing unrest in [[Sharbhat]] as needing their attention, and Pelorean and Mayaheinen paladins flock to Chebikav and Alocotla to face the threat of open rebellion from the native inhabitants. On the other hand, paladins may pity the natives’ plight and work to right the injustices committed by colonial oppressors. Additionally, the Scarlet Brotherhood maintains a base near Chebikav setting their sights on eliminating the spread of what they see as disease and savagery as relics from the past flow out of the Central Reach to the civilized world. Paladins with ambitions of rising in the ranks of this small order may travel to [[Sharbhat]] in the hope of discovering lost cities to seal their secrets deep in the jungle. Paladins native to [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach may be sailing home on the Pogue's Folly after a tour in the northern lands, the orc-wars of the Pomarj, or other holy missions throughout the Pearl Sea. The quest to liberate lost relics from the jungle depths also leads many paladins to explore the Central Reach, attracting those hopeful of discovering treasures to better the lives and further the goals of their brethren.

**Recommendations:** Mayaheine or Peolor make fine divine patrons for paladins, as their presence and influence are strong in [[Sharbhat]]. But in the depths of the wilderness such crusaders shouldn’t expect significant support from their churches. Also, a paladin’s mount can often prove troublesome in the claustrophobic jungle tangles and shadowy ruins common to the upcoming adventures—making the ability to summon and dismiss such a companion at will most beneficial. Yet for all the challenges a paladin might face, the class’s resistance to many aff lictions and ability to heal disease, poison, and other maladies commonly employed by denizens of the jungle make a paladin a most welcome addition to any band of explorers.

**Rangers**

The jungles of the Central Reach call silently to explorers from across the Pearl Sea to discover and tame them. Rangers often act as guides for scholars, archaeologists, or other parties venturing into the dark heart of the region. Some see it as their duty to protect the world from the strange and monstrous denizens of the deep jungle, and are adept at killing the foul creatures and malignant peoples that threaten the inhabitants of [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach itself. Other rangers see the region as prime hunting grounds to obtain a record-setting trophy and travel from across [[Oerth]] to traverse the vast swaths of the Central Reach’s wilderness in search of rare big game, including dinosaurs, giant apes, and monsters only spoken of in legend.

**Recommendations:** The ability to track well is particularly valuable in the adventure, and a variety of exotic animals might make for fine companions. The following favored enemy selection make excellent choices for rangers in the adventure: aberration, animal, humanoid (charauka or human), magical beast, plant, outsider (chaotic or evil), undead, and especially monstrous humanoid. Particularly useful favored terrain choices include jungle, underground, and urban.

**Rogues**

The treasures of [[Sharbhat]]’s jungles were instrumental in the nation’s rise to power under Scarlet Brotherhood colonial rule, as settlers flocked to the ancient ruins south of the Hambu Channel hoping to tap the land’s rich resources. The same treasures continue to attract tomb-robbers and fate-tempters from across [[Oerth]], despite the nation’s increased isolation from the northern realms. Ambitious pirates and thieves take inspiration from the Free Captains, whose coffers have overflowed with tribute from [[Sharbhat]]’s government in exchange for decades of protection. Whether from [[Sasserine]], the Hold of the Sea Princes, or Old Medegia, many enterprising rogues make their way to the dangerous region to muscle their own living off the weak and needy. Endless and ever more embellished tales of fantastic and impossible treasures hidden in lost jungle ruins also tempt countless treasure hunters to venture into the heart of [[Hepmonaland]], risking their lives for wealth beyond imagination.

**Recommendations:** The adventure includes many traps and extensive underground exploration, as well as hazards, ambushes, and social situations where rogues can excel. A rogue talented at stealth and scouting, particularly in wilderness areas and ancient ruins, should do well. While [[Disable Device (Skill)|Disable Device]], [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]], and [[Stealth (Skill)|Stealth]] prove endlessly useful, rogues with a knack for [[Appraise (Skill)|Appraise]], [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skills, [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], and other more physical skills will be well equipped to face the campaign’s challenges. 

**Sorcerers**

Ever exploring the far corners of the world in search of ways to test their mysterious powers, sorcerers often find that the Central Reach provides many such opportunities. Destined bloodline sorcerers frequently feel drawn to the ancient ruins of the region, as if their full potential can be realized only by tapping into the powers of the past. Similarly, arcane bloodline sorcerers find the ruins of lost empires a rich source of magical power, and often delve into the wild to uncover answers to ageless enigmas. Natives of the region often belong to the abyssal, serpentine, or verdant bloodlines, the result of millennia of either demon worship or the inf luence of the fecund jungle and its creatures on the inhabitants of the land. In rare cases, explorers who have never exhibited signs of innate arcane abilities manifest long-dormant powers when exposed to the strange and unknowable reaches of the deep jungle, and some youths journey recklessly into the wild hoping to unlock some as yet unrealized potential.

**Recommendations:** Although all bloodlines can prove useful in the adventure, the aberrant, abyssal, arcane, and destined bloodlines fit best thematically. Sorcerers might also want to explore their options beyond combat spells when choosing their spell lists, as versatile utility spells and magic well suited to wilderness exploration, like *[[Comprehend Languages (Spell)|comprehend languages]], [[Endure Elements (Spell)|endure elements]],* and *[[Unseen Servant (Spell)|unseen servant]]* can prove most beneficial.

**Summoners**

Summoners share much the same drive to uncover ancient mysteries and long-hidden secrets as bards, sorcerers, and wizards, and few locations on [[Oerth]] hold as much potential for discovery as the jungles of [[Sharbhat]] and the Central Reach. Summoners can often feel the almost palpable power of extraplanar creatures throughout the region, especially in areas where the worship of ancient powers and practice of strange magic still survives. The Central Reach’s most remote ruins seem to hold strong connections to otherworldly purposes now lost to time and decay, and many summoners have dedicated their lives to tapping into this enigmatic and sometimes overpowering potential. Strong superstitions surround summoners of jungle origin, and many find that calling an eidolon results in their exile from their tribe. Most ostracized summoners travel the Pearl Sea looking for acceptance or new sources of power, but in nearly every case they feel the eventual draw to return home.

**Recommendations:** Wilderness exploration and delves into ruins of long-lost civilizations are prominent during the adventure. Skills such as [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (all types), [[Linguistics (Skill)|Linguistics]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] will prove helpful throughout the campaign. Summoners who call upon eidolons with the ability to climb, fly, or swim should be of particular use during the campaign.

**Witches**

Generally feared and misunderstood, many witches live reclusive lives on the edges of civilization; few locations within a reasonable distance of the Pearl Sea are as remote and attractive to an outcast witch as [[Sharbhat]], where the native [[Hepmonaland]] inhabitants are more open to their mysterious magics and aloof way of life. In small settlements, witches serve as sages and healers, and many travel to the lands of the north to study in their youth before settling down in one village as the local mystic. Some witches neither settle down nor plan to, instead traveling about [[Oerth]], seeking greater knowledge and a better understanding of the enigmatic powers that guide them. The jungles of the Central Reach offer elusive answers for the inquisitive, and the powerful forces that call the jungle home prove an irresistible lure to many a curious witch. 

**Recommendations:** When choosing their class abilities, witches have a variety of options, several of which might prove exceptionally helpful during the adventure. All terrestrial familiar choices on the witch familiar list work in the context of the campaign, as will the animals, elements, endurance, and transformation patrons. Skills such as [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]], [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana, history, and nature), [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]], and [[Use Magic Device (Skill)|Use Magic Device]] should be useful during the campaign.

**Wizards**

Many wizard colleges encourage exploration or study in far-off lands, and [[Sharbhat]]—being one of only a few gateways to the Central Reach—is a natural choice for arcane scholars the world over. Whether from the Society of Magi of Greyhawk City, the Sorcerer's Nexux of Rel Astra, or the Eldritch Lords of Rel Deven, apprentice wizards frequently sail to Chebikav in the hope of discovering long lost secrets in the jungles to the east. Untold civilizations have risen and fallen in the heart of the Central Reach, leaving behind secrets and magical lore few adventurous spellcasters can resist the draw to discover. Even if foreigners don’t plan to delve into the jungles themselves, the rich tapestry of arcane forms practiced among the varied populations of Chebikav and Alocotla are enough to draw wizards from around the globe, and the Pogue's Folly is a perfect means of getting to [[Sharbhat]]'s shores.

**Recommendations:** See the Bard recommendations for good [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] skill choices. All of the arcane schools should be equally useful throughout the adventure, with the possible exception of enchanters, who may be periodically frustrated at the number of creatures like giant vermin or plants who are immune to mind-affecting magic.

While any sort of bonded object is possible in the campaign, wizards who opt instead to take on a familiar might wish to choose creatures that make sense for the region in which the adventure takes place. Logical choices for familiars based on the region’s climate include all of the basic familiars. Good choices of improved familiars (again, based on the themes of the adventure) include celestial or fiendish animals, dire rats, mephits, and pseudodragons.

**Other Classes and Prestige Classes**

Other character classes and prestige classes are encouraged (on a case by case basis), check with the GM with regard to which might be useful and/or usable and as always have a solid backstory ready.

**Character Traits**


Playing an Adventure Path is a different experience than playing in a one-shot adventure. An Adventure Path presents a long, ongoing campaign, but unlike a custom created campaign built by a specific GM for a group of players whose tastes and proclivities in character creation are known quantities, we don’t know what kinds of choices your players prefer when building their characters. As a result, one of the driving philosophies of crafting an Adventure Path is to include sections for all 11 of the core classes, so that no one feels “left out” by the game.

But what about the less tangible elements of game play? If you’re rolling up a new character for a homebrew campaign, you can (hopefully) trust your GM to tailor the campaign to include your character and his history and personality. For an Adventure Path, though, how is a player to know what choices and what backgrounds might dovetail into the predetermined story arc of the campaign he’s about to spend several months playing, without spoiling key components of the adventure’s plotline?

That’s the question that the Adventure Path Player’s Guides have attempted to address. In all of the Player’s Guides we provide not only a gazetteer of the region in which the campaign begins, but also a spoiler-free discussion on what choices might be best to make when creating a dwarf, an elf, a sorcerer, a ranger, and so on. Yet there’s another tool that’s been evolving as well: the character trait.

The first incarnation of this new element to your character appeared in the Rise of the Runelords Player’s Guide, disguised as six new feats that your new character could take (we recommended that GMs allow players to pick one of these six as a bonus feat). These new feats were more than just additional tricks and powers, though; they were crafted to infuse newly created characters with built-in links to the then brand-new realm of Varisia.

In the Curse of the Crimson Throne Player’s Guide, we abandoned the bonus feat model and instead came up with several traits from which new players could pick and choose. Each trait granted one of two relatively minor bonuses, but the majority of each trait consisted of flavor and background information intended to prime your new character for the start of the campaign.

And that brings us here, to the official Pathfinder character traits PDF, updated to work seamlessly with the Pathfinder RPG. This document contains all the rules you need to use character traits in your campaign, be they Pathfinder Adventure Paths or campaigns of your own design.

**Character Trait Design Philosophy**

At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat—in fact, at one point, we considered calling them “Half Feats” but abandoned that idea when we realized it implied a point-based system that didn’t really exist (there’s no such thing, for example, as a “Double Feat”). Yet a character trait isn’t just another kind of power you can add on to your character—it’s a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into the world of Golarion. Think of character traits as “story seeds” for your background; after you pick your two traits, you’ll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character’s personality and history. Alternatively, if you’ve already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.

One more thing: character traits are for PCs. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC will need to “buy” them with the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat. Player characters are special; they’re the stars of the game, after all, and if they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way, that kind of makes sense. The pregenerated characters presented in Pathfinder and the modules will not have bonus traits selected for them—we’re leaving those choices to you if you wish to use one of them as a PC.

Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a “trait” bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack—they’re intended to give you a slight edge over the non-PCs of the world, not a secret backdoor way to focus all your traits on one type of bonus to gain an unseemly advantage over the rules. It’s certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a “Courageous” trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait’s on the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn’t mean you’re any more brave if you choose both than if you choose only one.

**Gaining Traits**

When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what ammounts to a bonus feat at character creation. Some GMs may wish to limit this somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM doesn’t allow bonus traits, you should still be able to pick up some with the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat (see the sidebar on page 6). For Pathfinder Adventure Paths, there are two categories of traits to choose from. One of your traits must be a campaign trait chosen from the list given in that Adventure Path’s Player’s Guide—this trait ties your character into the campaign’s storyline and gives you a built-in reason to begin the first adventure. Your other trait can be chosen from one of the other types of traits: basic traits, region traits, race traits, or religion traits.  

**Types of Traits**

There are five types of character traits to choose from. This document presents only one category—the basic trait. The other four types of traits can all be found in Pathfinder Companions.

**Basic Traits:** There are a total of 40 basic traits—ten each, split among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren’t tied to specific classes. It’s perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are “generic,” and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization. 

**Campaign Traits:** These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new Adventure Path. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path’s Player’s Guide.

**Race Traits:** Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities. In order to select a race trait, your character must be of the trait’s race or ethnicity. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (as could be possible due to the result of polymorph magic or a *[[Reincarnate (Spell)|reincarnate]]* spell), the benefits gained by your racial trait persist—only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait. Of course, in such an event, you’re also likely to lose skills, feats, and a whole lot more!

**Regional Traits:** Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At first level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character’s place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character’s background.

**Religion Traits:** Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions.

**Restrictions on Trait Selection**

There are a few rules governing trait selections. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits. Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.

Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character’s development, either before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the [[Additional Traits (Feat)|Additional Traits]] feat) events that happened while adventuring. Even if you become a hermit and abandon society, you’ll still retain your legacy of growing up an aristocrat if you took a social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits—since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, you can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if you switch religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. He may simply rule that you lose that trait, or he might allow you to pick a new religion trait tied to your new deity. Another option is that if you abandon a religion, you lose the associated religion traits until you gain an experience level, at which point you may replace lost religion traits with basic faith traits.

**Combat Traits**

These traits are associated with combat, battle, and physical prowess. They give minor bonuses in battle and represent conflicts and physical struggles in your backstory.

**Anatomist:** You have studied the workings of anatomy, either as a student at university or as an apprentice mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your blows to strike vital organs. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all rolls made to confirm critical hits.

**Armor Expert:** You have worn armor as long as you can remember, either as part of your training to become a knight's squire or simply because you were seeking to emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn't the real thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as much as real armor would have, and you've grown used to moving in such suits with relative grace. When you wear armor of any sort, reduce that suit's armor check penalty by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.

**Axe to Grind:** There is a fire in your heart that can't be quenched. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage against foes who are threatened by only you.

**Battlefield Disciple:** You are skilled at supporting your allies in the heat of battle. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] checks made to stabilize a dying creature. In addition, when you successfully use the aid another action in combat to grant an ally a bonus on her next attack roll, the bonus you grant increases by 1.

**Black Powder Bravado:** You are particularly successful when using deeds. Once per day, when you perform a deed that requires an attack roll and you miss with that roll, you can reroll it. You must take the second result even if it is worse.

**Black Powder Fortune:** You have little to fear when there's a gun in your hand. As long as you are wielding a firearm, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against curse, fear, and emotion effects.

**Black Powder Interjection:** Your confidence rises when you foil spellcasting. Once per day, when you interrupt the casting of a spell with a firearm attack, you may regain 1 grit point.

**Bloodthirsty:** You have a vicious streak, and nothing satisfies you more than warm blood on your hands and blade. Whenever you make an attack that reduces a foe to 0 hit points or fewer or you confirm a critical hit, your attack deals 1 additional point of damage. The additional damage is a trait bonus, and is multiplied by your weapon's critical hit multiplier.

**Bullied:** You were bullied often as a child, and you are now constantly ready to defend yourself with your fists when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the ability to make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed strikes—you must have a level in monk, the [[Improved Unarmed Strike (Feat)|Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat, or some other similar power to gain the use of this character trait. However, that doesn't prevent you from selecting this trait. You simply cannot make use of it until a later point if you do.

**Cold and Calculating:** You are adept at tricking favored enemies of your race or those related to your race. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks against favored enemies that share one of your subtypes. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls made against such favored enemies during the surprise round.

**Courageous:** Your childhood was brutal, but you persevered through force of will and faith. No matter how hard things got, you knew you'd make it through as long as you kept a level head. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

**Dedicated Defender:** When a companion is down, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and on checks made to overcome spell resistance while you are adjacent to a dying or disabled ally, animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or mount.

**Deft Dodger:** Growing up in a rough neighborhood or a dangerous environment has honed your senses. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.

**Dirty Fighter:** You wouldn't have lived to make it out of childhood without the aid of a sibling, friend, or companion you could always count on to distract your enemies long enough for you to do a little bit more damage than normal. That companion may be another PC or an NPC (who may even be recently departed from your side). When you hit a foe you are flanking, you deal 1 additional point of damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is a trait bonus.

**Dispelled Battler:** When deprived of magic, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls while within an area of antimagic such as that created by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. You also gain this bonus for 1 round after you are subject to an area or targeted *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* spell, regardless of the effect's success or failure in dispelling your spells and magical effects.

**Easy Way or the Hard Way:** You are skilled at subduing your enemies. Whenever you attack one of your favored enemies with a weapon that deals lethal damage and choose to deal nonlethal damage, you take only a —2 penalty on the attack roll instead of the normal —4.

**Evasive Sting:** Larger enemies have a hard time striking you. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against enemies that are both your favored enemy and at least two size categories larger than you.

**Faith's Hunter:** Divine powers smile upon you each time you grievously wound a favored enemy. When you confirm a critical hit against a favored enemy, you may extend the duration of any divine spell affecting you by 1 round. The benefits from multiple critical hits stack. Divine spells with an instantaneous duration can't be extended in this manner.

**Fencer:** You trained with blades for long hours as a youth, either taking lessons in the genteel art of fencing from tutors paid for by your parents or being taken under the wing of a disenfranchised fencer who may have turned to a life of crime. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls made with daggers, swords, and similar bladed weapons.

Hidden Hand: Your concealed weapons strike fast and true. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Sleight of Hand (Skill)|Sleight of Hand]] checks made to conceal light weapons and a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls when making an attack with a light weapon during a surprise round.

**Hunter's Knack:** When you watch and wait before attacking, your strike is true. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against your favored enemies when you make such attacks as part of a readied action. 

**Indelible Ire:** When you are gravely wounded, you're stirred to greater combat focus. Each time a critical hit is confirmed against you, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls for 1 round.

**Just Like New:** Broken firearms are not problems—they are challenges. Your first attempt to remove the broken condition from your starting firearm and to upgrade it to a masterwork weapon costs 150 gp instead of 300 gp. In addition, when wielding a firearm that has the broken condition or is treated as if it had the broken condition, you take a —1 penalty on attack rolls made with it instead of the normal —2.

**Killer:** You made your first kill at a very young age and found the task of war or murder to your liking. You either take particular pride in a well-placed blow, or find vile pleasure in twisting the blade to maximize your target's pain. You deal an amount of additional damage equal to your weapon's critical hit modifier when you score a successful critical hit with a weapon; this additional damage is added to the final total, and is not multiplied by the critical hit multiple itself. This extra damage is a trait bonus.

**Kin Guardian:** You are dedicated to defending members of your family. When you use the aid another action to give a member of your family a bonus to AC, increase the bonus by 2. This increase is a trait bonus (and therefore doesn't stack with increases granted by other family members using this trait). This trait has no effect when using the aid another action to increase a family member's next attack roll.

**Larger Than Life:** You wield firearms with truly terrifying menace. When you use the [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] skill on a creature while wielding a firearm, you are considered one size category larger than your actual size.

**Martial Performer:** Your training has made you a martial performer. When you gain a monk bonus feat, you may instead take a performance feat for which you meet the prerequisites.

**Nature's Mimic:** Your knowledge of nature informs your fighting style, and that style gives you insight into related aspects of the natural world. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks, and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) is always a class skill for you. You can make [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks pertaining to animals that correspond to your style feats untrained.

**Never Stop Shooting:** Even when the chips are down, you keep on shooting. If your hit point total drops to 0 or lower but you are not dead, you may act as if disabled rather than dying (as if you possessed the [[Diehard (Feat)|Diehard]] feat). However, you can use your actions only to draw a firearm, reload a firearm, or attack with a firearm. If you have the [[Diehard (Feat)|Diehard]] feat, this trait also allows you to substitute your Wisdom score for your Constitution score for the purpose of determining the negative hit point total at which you die.

**Reactionary:** You were bullied often as a child, but never quite developed an offensive response. Instead, you became adept at anticipating sudden attacks and reacting to danger quickly. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks.

**Reckless:** You have a tendency for rash behavior, often disregarding your own safety as you move across the battlefield. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] checks, and [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] is always a class skill for you.

**Reckless Contempt:** You do not fear the threat of lesser weapons. Whenever you provoke an attack of opportunity by firing a firearm, you gain a +1 trait bonus on the attack roll that provoked the attack of opportunity.

**Resilient:** Growing up in a poor neighborhood or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist on food and water from doubtful sources. You've built up your constitution as a result, and gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves.

**Resolve of the Rejected:** Some disagree with your choice to wield a firearm, and their scorn has only hardened your resolve in battle. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects. Also, once per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you regain 1 grit point.

**Scarred Descendant:** Your own people are your favored enemy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against favored enemies of your own subtype and on [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] checks made to track such creatures.

**Startling Report:** Through either perfect timing or the determination of your action, the sound of your firearm going off sets your enemies on edge. When you shoot a firearm, you gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks for 1 round against those who heard the shot.

**Surprise Weapon:** You are skilled at fighting with objects not traditionally considered weapons. You gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons.

**Tactician:** You know how to take advantage of enemies who are unprepared for your assault. You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks. In addition, once per day when you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a +2 trait bonus on the attack roll.

**Unblemished Barrel:** Your skill with firearms speeds your repair of such weapons. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (alchemy) and [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (weapons) checks, and it takes you only 30 minutes to remove the [[Broken|broken]] condition from a firearm.

**Vigilant Battler:** You are hard to fool and harder to trick with a feint. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all [[Sense Motive (Skill)|Sense Motive]] checks. This trait bonus increases to +2 when used to counter a feint in combat.

**Faith Traits**


These traits rely upon conviction of spirit, perception, and religion, but are not directly tied to the worship of a specific deity. You do not need a patron deity to gain a faith trait, as these traits can represent conviction in yourself or your philosophy just as easily as they can represent dedication to a deity.

**Beacon of Faith:** You wield the might of your faith with power and clarity. Once per day as a free action, you may treat your caster level as if it were 2 levels higher when using one of the granted powers of your domain or inquisition, or when casting one of your domain spells.

**Birthmark:** You were born with a strange birthmark that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve you as a divine focus for casting spells, and as a physical manifestation of your faith, and it increases your devotion to your god. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.

**Blessed:** Some divine agent watches over you and heeds your call. Once per day as a swift action, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for 1 round.

**Caretaker:** As the child of an herbalist or an assistant in a temple infirmary, you often had to assist in tending to the sick and wounded. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] checks, and [[Heal (Skill)|Heal]] is always a class skill for you.

**Child of the Temple:** You have long served at a temple in a city, where you picked up on many of the nobility's customs in addition to spending much time in the temple libraries studying your faith. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nobility) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.

**Devotee of the Green:** Your faith in the natural world or one of the gods of nature makes it easy for you to pick up on related concepts. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (geography) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (nature) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.

**Disdainful Defender:** You are resistant to the magic of other faiths. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all Will saves you attempt against divine spells. This bonus does not apply against divine spells cast by a caster who worships the same deity you do.

**Ease of Faith:** Your mentor, the person who invested your faith in you from an early age, took steps to ensure you understood that what powers your divine magic is no different from that which powers the magic of other religions. This philosophy makes it easier for you to interact with others who may not share your views. You gain a +1 bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks, and [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] is always a class skill for you.

**Fate's Favored:** The fates watch over you. Whenever you are under the effect of a luck bonus of any kind, that bonus increases by 1.

**Fearless Defiance:** Upon overcoming your fear, you become a scourge to your enemies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects. In addition, if you successfully save against such an effect, you receive a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against your favored enemies for 1 round.

**Focused Disciple:** When weaker wills falter, you keep a clear mind. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.

**History of Heresy:** You were raised with heretical views that have made it difficult for you to accept most religious beliefs and often caused you or those you love to be treated as pariahs. As a result, you have turned your back on religious teachings. As long as you do not possess any levels in a class that grants divine spellcasting power, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against divine spells.

**Indomitable Faith:** You were born in a region where your faith was not popular, but you still have never abandoned it. Your constant struggle to maintain your own faith has bolstered your drive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves.

**Inspired:** A positive force, philosophy, or divine presence fills you with hope, and is a guiding force of inspiration. Once per day as a free action, roll twice and take the better result on a skill check or ability check.

**Loyalty across Lifetimes:** You and your eidolon share a link that seems to span multiple lifetimes. Your eidolon treats its Constitution score as if it were 2 points higher for the purposes of determining when its negative hit point total sends it back to its home plane. In addition, your eidolon gains a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. 

**Martial Manuscript:** You either carry or have memorized a sacred text from your school, temple, or monastery, and its wisdom gives you insight that makes your attacks more devastating. You gain a +2 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits when you're using an unarmed strike or monk weapon.

**Oathbound:** You have made a solemn oath, and you pursue that oath with headstrong determination. Once per day, you may reroll a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect. You must take the second result even if it is worse.

**Omen:** You are the harbinger of some future event. Whether this event bodes good or ill, you exude an ominous presence. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks, and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you may attempt to demoralize an opponent as a swift action.

**Perpetual Companion:** You are bolstered against fear when your eidolon is near. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects whenever your eidolon is within 30 feet.

**Planar Savant:** You have always had an innate sense of the workings of the planes and their denizens. You may use your Charisma modifier when making [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) checks instead of your Intelligence modifier.

**Principled:** You hold yourself to a strict code of behavior that guides all of your decisions and actions. You take a —2 penalty on [[Bluff (Skill)|Bluff]] checks and gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and emotion effects.

**Prophesied:** Your coming was foretold in prophecy, and people familiar with your legend regard you with awe and fear. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] checks and [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] checks when interacting with anyone familiar with you or your reputation.

**Reincarnated:** You lived a previous life as someone—or something—else. For you, life and death are a cycle, and you have no fear of death. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects.

**Sacred Conduit:** Your birth was particularly painful and difficult for your mother, who needed potent divine magic to ensure that you survived (your mother may or may not have survived). In any event, that magic infused you from an early age, and you now channel divine energy with greater ease than most. Whenever you channel energy, you gain a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of your channeled energy.

**Sacred Touch:** You were exposed to a potent source of positive energy as a child, perhaps by being born under the right cosmic sign, or maybe because one of your parents was a gifted healer. As a standard action, you may automatically stabilize a dying creature merely by touching it.

**Scholar of the Great Beyond:** Your greatest interests as a child did not lie with current events or the mundane—you have always felt out of place, as if you were born in the wrong era. You take to philosophical discussions of the Great Beyond and of historical events with ease. You gain a +1 trait bonus on [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.

**Schooled Inquisitor:** Your additional training aids in identifying the wiles of your faith's enemies. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (planes) and [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (religion) checks made to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.

**Spirit Sense:** You are so attuned to the spiritual world that it is hard to get the jump on you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks to avoid being surprised and to detect invisible or incorporeal creatures.

**Tireless Avenger:** You restlessly pursue your enemies. When you're in pursuit of one of your favored enemies, the DC for the Constitution check to avoid taking lethal damage during a forced march is 10 + 1 per extra hour, instead of 10 + 2 per extra hour.

**Wanderer's Shroud:** Your wanderings often go unnoticed. Efforts to use the [[Diplomacy (Skill)|Diplomacy]] skill to gather information about you take a —1 penalty, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against scrying and mind-reading effects that allow saving throws.

**Zealous Striker:** Your zeal is a danger to those of "lesser" faiths. While you have the destruction judgment active, you gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls when attacking a foe who can cast divine spells and worships a different deity than you.
