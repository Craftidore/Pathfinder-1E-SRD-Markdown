# Arachnid Athletics
## Overview
You have learned to emulate the skittering movement of the arachnids so precious to your kin.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *Strength 13 or higher*

## Effects
- You gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb surfaces.
- Climbing doesn't halve your speed.
- You may attempt a Strength (Athletics) check against DC 20 to gain climb speed equal to your base speed until the end of your round. This movement does not cost extra movement.
