# Vindictive Hatred
## Overview
Others may hold grudgesâ€”that does not even begin to describe the level of hatred you are capable of feeling towards a specific target that has slighted you.

## Effects
- You choose an enemy you have encountered before. This creature becomes your chosen foe. The chosen foe provokes an opportunity attack from you if he enters your reach.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (Investigation), and Wisdom (insight) checks pertaining the chosen foe.
- Upon slaying a chosen foe, you may choose a new foe after a short or long rest.
