# Draakistorian
## Overview
You have studied extensively the tales told by the [[Draaki|draaki]] shamans.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn two languages of your choice.
- You can spend 5 minutes telling anecdotal allegories of draconic wisdom, shoring up the resolve of your allies to fight. When you do so, choose up to 6 friendly creatures capable of understanding you (this can include yourself) within 30 feet of you. Each creature may thereafter reroll their weaponâ€™s damage dice once within the next 5 minutes. A creature can only benefit from this use of the feat once per day.
