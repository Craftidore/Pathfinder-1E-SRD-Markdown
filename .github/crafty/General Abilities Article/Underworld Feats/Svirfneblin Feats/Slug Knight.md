# Slug Knight
## Overview
You and your trusty riding slug are a surprisingly swift and agile team.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Svirfneblin]]*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- When mounted on a [[Svirf Riding Slug|svirf riding slug]] (or any other kind of slug), your mount gains a +15 ft. bonus to all movement speeds.
- Slugs and snails never willingly attack you or your allies and when forced to do so, do so at disadvantage and take your proficiency bonus as a penalty to their attack roll.
- Slugs and snails can communicate, miraculously, even complex concepts beyond their Intelligence to you via eyestalk gestures and, in some breeds, meowing. They are treated as though they had Intelligence 10 and shared a common language with you. Slugs and snails will go out of their way to help you and “ask” you for help.
