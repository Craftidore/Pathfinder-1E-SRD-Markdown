# Gem Fighter
## Overview
In your hands, a jewel can be as deadly as a blade.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Svirfneblin]], Dexterity 13 or higher*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- So long as a jewel or gem has a value of 50 gp or more, you can treat it as a dagger. When you roll a natural 1 on a ranged attack roll with a gem or jewel, it is destroyed. You are always considered to be proficient with gems.
- If a gem or jewel of 500 gp or more is used by you as a thrown weapon, treat it as a *+1 dagger* that threatens a critical hit when you roll a 19 and 20. When you roll a natural 1 on a ranged attack roll with a gem or jewel, it is destroyed.
