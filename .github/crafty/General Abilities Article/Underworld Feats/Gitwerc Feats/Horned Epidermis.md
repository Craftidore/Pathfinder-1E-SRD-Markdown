# Horned Epidermis
## Overview
Your skin is covered in jutting pieces of bone and hornâ€”some of them small nubs, others razor sharp and easily capable of piercing the skin of foolish foes.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- While you are unarmed, you can use Constitution instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
- You increase the primary damage dice of *[[Devil's Strike|devil's strike]]* to 3d10.
- You gain AC 12 + Dexterity modifier (natural armor) while not wearing any armor.
