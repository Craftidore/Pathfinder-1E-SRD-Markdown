# Amber Wayfarer
## Overview
You are a veteran of traversing the Amber Road.

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- When using an [[Amberized Lodestone]] in conjunction with an [[Amber Attenuator]], you are automatically cognizant of interfering resonance without requiring *detect magic*.
- You decrease the chance of incurring a mishap when using an Amber Road while subject to multiple resonances or using a broken lodestone to 01–10 on a d%, with 11–50 depositing you in a similar area and 51–100 putting you on target.
- You can cast *[[Seek Earthly Transit|seek earthly transit]]* as a 1st-level spell at will. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
