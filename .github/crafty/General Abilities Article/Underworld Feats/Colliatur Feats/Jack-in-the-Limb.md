# Jack-in-the-Limb
## Overview
You have learned to fashion tools and even weapons from your body by controlled extraction of crystalline parts.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Colliatur]]*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You can duplicate any tool worth 30 gp or less by breaking off crystalline sections of your body. Breaking off a tool from your body is an action. You can’t break off specific items (like a key to a certain lock), but could break off a substitute for a lockpick, for example. You are always considered proficient in these makeshift tools, but due to their improvised nature, checks made using them are made at disadvantage. You may duplicate up to 20 gp worth of tools per day without repercussions. Any more than that and you increase your exhaustion level by +1. If your size is Small, you instead only can generate 10 gp worth of tools before risking exhaustion and the maximum value you can duplicate is only 15 gp. Tools created from your body quickly decay after 1 day per Hit Die you have and thus cannot be sold unless you succeed a Charisma (Deception) check against an unwitting target.
- You may also break off a more significant section of your body to duplicate a simple or martial melee weapon of your choice. Breaking off a single weapon from your body is an action. You are always proficient with a weapon taken from your own body, but you may not duplicate weapons that have a lot of moving parts like a flail. Weapons made from a [[Colliatur|colliatur]]’s body emit light like a sputtering torch and, if the wielder is a [[Colliatur|colliatur]], he may will them to deal radiant damage instead of their usual damage type. You may create two simple weapons with the light or finesse property or one regular simple weapon sans repercussions. Creating a martial weapon takes a heavier toll and increases your exhaustion level by 1. If you create a martial weapon with the heavy or two-handed property from your body, you instead increase your exhaustion level by 2. Small [[Colliatur|colliatur]] have crystalline structures that are too dense to break off martial weapons. Large [[Colliatur|colliatur]] seem to be able to create more devastating weaponry: Large [[Colliatur|colliatur]] can create up to 4 simple weapons with the light or finesse properties or 2 simple weapons without any repercussions. You can also create one martial weapon without suffering any negative repercussions, even one with either the two-handed or heavy property. If you create two martial weapons or one with the heavy and two-handed property, you increase your exhaustion level by 1. Weapons draw from the body of Large [[Colliatur|colliatur]] also have an intrinsic power—[[Colliatur|colliatur]] add +1 to all attack and damage rolls made with them. Weapons created from your body quickly decay after 1 day per Hit Die you have and thus cannot be sold unless you succeed a Charisma (Deception) check against an unwitting target.
- You can reabsorb weapons and tools broken off from your body by finishing a long rest with the respective item. You reabsorb the item or items, immediately negating all exhaustion levels incurred by breaking them off.
- You may use the Acid Conversion ability an additional time before requiring a rest to recharge.
