# Light-Bringer
## Overview
You have honed your ability to control the crystalline structures suffusing your body, allowing you to emit light and intensify it.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Colliatur]], 8th level*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You may emit light as a hooded or bullâ€™s eye lantern for up to 6 hours before requiring a short rest to recharge. You may suppress or ignite this light at will.
- If your last long rest was in the sunlight, the light you emit is treated as sunlight for the purposes of Sunlight (Hyper-)Sensitivity and similar vulnerabilities.
- You gain advantage to attack rolls against any enemy that is sensitive to light, blinded by it, or otherwise hampered by exposure to light while emitting your light.
