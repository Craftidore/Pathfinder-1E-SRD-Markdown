# Ahool Senses
## Overview
You have started to develop a preternatural sense based on echolocation.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Ahooling]]**, [[Ironsinger]]*

## Effects
You gain the following benefits:

- You gain blindsight 60 ft. You cannot use blindsight when deafened. (Note: If you're using the [[Vestraadi]]'s sonar-rules, you may gain access to the sonar, subject to your GM's approval.)
- If you have vampiric bite, you may use it one additional time before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.
