# Primal Speaker
## Overview
You are in touch with creatures associated with your kind.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Ahooling]]*

## Effects
- You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with bats, insects, and rats. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence; at a minimum the creatures can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GMâ€™s discretion.
- If you have vampiric bite, you may use it one additional time before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.
