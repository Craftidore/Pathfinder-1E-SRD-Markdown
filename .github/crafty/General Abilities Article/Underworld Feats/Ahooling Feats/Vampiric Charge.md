# Vampiric Charge
## Overview
Driven by bloodlust, you can charge into the fray with devastating effect.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Ahooling]]**, flying speed*

## Effects
- If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line towards an enemy immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +2d6 bonus to damage dice with your bite (if you choose to make a melee attack and hit) or knock the target down if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
- If you have vampiric bite, you may use it one additional time before requiring a short or long rest to recharge.
- If you use vampiric bite as a reaction to an attack wherein you hit with a vampiric charge, increase the hit points you heal by +2d8.
