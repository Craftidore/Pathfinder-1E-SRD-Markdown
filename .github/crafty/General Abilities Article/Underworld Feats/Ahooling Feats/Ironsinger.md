You have learned lethal harmonics that can tear foes apart, called Ironsinging for the smell of iron that accompanies the blood spilled.

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: *[[Ahooling]]*

## Effects
- As an action, you emit a ray of destructive vibrations at a target within 120 feet. Make a ranged attack. If you hit, the target creature takes 2d6 thunder damage, 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, 5d6 at 16th level. You can use this ability up to Constitution modifier times. It recharges upon taking a long rest.
- At 8th level, you gain resistance to thunder damage. If you already have resistance to thunder damage, you instead gain immunity to thunder damage.
- As a bonus action taken upon attacking an object or structure with a damage threshold, you may emit destructive resonances to decrease the object or structureâ€™s damage threshold for the attack by 5.
