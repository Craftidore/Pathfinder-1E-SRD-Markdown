## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Dødelig|dødelig]] spellcasters at the discretion of the GM.***

**Level**: 1st
#Spell-Level/1st

**School**: Divination
#Spell-School/Divination

**Special Nature**: Ritual
#Spell-Nature/Ritual

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (gem valued 50 gp or more)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You cast the one spell developed by the [[Dødelig|dødelig]] as a pure necessity and survival requirement for their race as a whole. Your eyes begin to glow and your sight extends, looking for your trapped brethren. For the duration of this spell, you know if there is a [[Dødelig|dødelig]] within a 120-ft. cone emanating from your eyes, seeing a faint aura around any visible creature that is a [[Dødelig|dødelig]]. Unlike similar magic, the spell can penetrate most barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt only impedes it. For every foot of stone, inch of metal, or 3 feet of wood blocking a *detect [[Dødelig|dødelig]]* spell, reduce its range by 5 feet.
