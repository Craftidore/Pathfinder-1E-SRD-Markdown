# Dødeligization
## Overview
***The following spell is recommended for clerics, druids, wizards and sorcerers only.***

**Level**: 7th
#Spell-Level/7th

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth 3,000 gp)

**Duration**: Permanent

## Effects
This extremely potent spell is known to only a very few [[Dødelig|dødelig]], and for good reason; with one casting, you can permanently transform a normal, living, breathing halfling into a [[Dødelig|dødelig]]. The affected halfling loses all halfling traits, gaining instead [[Dødelig|dødelig]] traits. This transformation is permanent. You need to make a melee spell attack to hit unwilling targets and unwilling subjects may resist this spell with a Wisdom saving throw.
