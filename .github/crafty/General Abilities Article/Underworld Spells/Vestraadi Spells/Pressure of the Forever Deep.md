# Pressure of the Forever Deep
## Overview
***[[Vestraadi]]****** druids may learn the following spell.***

**Level**: 5th
#Spell-Level/5th

**School**: Evocation
#Spell-School/Evocation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (1 ounce of water from the Forever Deep)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

## Effects
You call forth the pressures of the Forever Deep, temporarily subjecting a 20-foot-radius, 40-foothigh cylinder centered on a point within range to the immense forces of the Underworldâ€™s deepest seas. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail to save also halve their speed for the duration. Flying creatures that fail their save crash to the ground and may not fly while within the cylinder.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
