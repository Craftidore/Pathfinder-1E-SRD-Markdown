# Loom Large
## Overview
***The following spell is available exclusively to [[Drow|drow]] spellcasters devoted to Naraneus.***

**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Illusion
#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (piece of glass)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You absorb your own shadow into your body, causing you to be suffused by the intangible bulk of darkness. Your shadow-enhanced size doubles in all dimensions and increases your size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for you to double your size, you instead attain the maximum possible size in the space available. Your dimensions continue to adjust to your surroundings. Note that, since the size increase is based on your shadow suffusing you, it does not actually increase your size and hence, does not hinder your progress through tight spaces. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Your weapons also grow to match their seemingly new size. While thus enlarged, your attacks with them deal an extra 1d4 cold damage. You can only cast this spell if you have a shadow.
