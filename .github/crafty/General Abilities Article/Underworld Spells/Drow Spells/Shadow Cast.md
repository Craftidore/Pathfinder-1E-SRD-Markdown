# Shadow Cast
## Overview
***The following spell is available exclusively to [[Drow|drow]] spellcasters devoted to Naraneus.***

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

**School**: Illusion
#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (scrap of black cloth)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You call forth an amorphous, 20-ft. -radius blob of black matter from the Plane of Shadows that you can direct toward any light source within range. You can cause this blob to change shape, creating moving shadows on nearby surfaces. These shadows can cause distraction and confusion, causing all viewers within the spell’s radius to suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight. At the end of each of the rounds of an affected creature, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell’s effects end for the creature, as it sees through the illusion.
