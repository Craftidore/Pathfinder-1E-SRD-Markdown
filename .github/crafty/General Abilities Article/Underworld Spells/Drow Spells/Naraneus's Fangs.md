# Naraneus's Fangs
## Overview
***The following spell is available exclusively to [[Drow|drow]] spellcasters devoted to Naraneus.***

**Level**: 9th
#Spell-Level/9th

**School**: Illusion
#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (a tooth from an intelligent humanoid, dipped in venom)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

## Effects
Your magics tear apart the tooth, wrapping ribbons of dark, web-like and poisonous energy and sending them to 4 points you designate within range to detonate there. You do not have to be able to see the areas at the moment of the spellâ€™s completion, but you must have seen them within the last hour, either personally or via *scrying* or similar means. Each creature in a 40-foot radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Constitution saving throw. The exploding ribbons extend around corners. A creature takes 10d6 poison damage and 20d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature failing to save against this spell continues to take poison damage on subsequent rounds until the creature makes its save. A creature in the area of more than one such burst is affected only once. The spell does not damage objects or constructs.
