# Ironfibre
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Funglets|funglet]] druids and clerics.***

**Level**: 7th
#Spell-Level/7th

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Special Nature**: Ritual
#Spell-Nature/Ritual

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (mushrooms roughly shaped like the intended object)

**Duration**: Permanent

## Effects
You touch fungal material and transform it into *ironfibre*, a magical substance created by druids from normal molds, mushrooms or toadstools. While remaining naturally fibrous in almost every way, *ironfibre* is as strong, heavy, and as resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on *ironfibre*. Spells that affect plants do affect *ironfibre*, although *ironfibre* does not burn. Using this spell with *[[Fiber Shape|fiber shape]]* or crafting, you can fashion fibrous items that function as metal items. Thus, fibrous plate armor and fibrous swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids. Fey creatures frequently use them as well.
