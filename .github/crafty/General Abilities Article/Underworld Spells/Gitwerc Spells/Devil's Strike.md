# Devil's Strike
## Overview
***This spell is available to all [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] spellcasters.***

**Level**: 1st
#Spell-Level/1st

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to being damage by a melee attack

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous, 1 round (see text)

## Effects
As part of the casting of this spell, your horns and bony protrusions quiver in bloodthirsty anticipation. One of these bones suddenly elongates and is fired in a bloody, visceral burst from your body (this does no harm to you), striking unerringly the target. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes primary damage equal to 2d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In either case, shards of the bones are lodged in the body of the target before dissolving after 1 round. If the creature continues to attack you in the following round before the fragment has dissolved, the latent power in the bone ignites, dealing secondary damage equal to 2d10 fire damage to the offending creature before evaporating.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the primary and secondary damage alternate their increase by 1d10 for each slot above 2nd. (When cast using a 6th level slot, it would do 4d10 primary damage, 4d10 secondary damage. When cast via a 7th level slot, it would deal 5d10 primary damage, 4d10 secondary damage.)
