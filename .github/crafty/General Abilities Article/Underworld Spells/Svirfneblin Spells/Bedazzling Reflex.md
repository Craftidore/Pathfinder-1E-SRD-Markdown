# Bedazzling Reflex
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Svirfneblin|svirfneblin]] spellcasters at the GM's discretion.***

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

**School**: Abjuration
#Spell-School/Abjuration

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to being targeted by a spell with a single-target effect within 60 feet of you that you can see

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a gem worth 50 gp x spell level of triggering spell)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

## Effects
You cast forth this spell onto a gem, which must be of a value equal to 50 gp times the triggering spellâ€™s level. The gem flies forth, harmlessly deflecting the spell. If you do not possess a valuable enough gem to deflect the spell, *bedazzling reflex* fails.
