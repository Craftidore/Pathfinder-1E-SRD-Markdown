# Alien Surge
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Colliatur|colliatur]] spellcasters at the GM’s discretion.***

**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Transmutation
#Spell-School/Transmutation

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (gem fragments)

**Duration**: 1 hour

## Effects
You touch the target and it temporarily is attuned to your alien mindset, gaining the Sacred Life trait, but also immunity to the charmed condition. Additionally, the target is treated as a [[Colliatur|colliatur]] for the duration of the spell, including control over weapons torn from a [[Colliatur|colliatur]]’s body. Unwilling targets receive a Wisdom saving throw, which is made at advantage if you and your allies are currently fighting the creature.
