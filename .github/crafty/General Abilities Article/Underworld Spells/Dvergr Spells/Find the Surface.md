# Find the Surface

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

#Spell-School/Divination

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Components**: V, S, M (steel ingot)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 day

## Effects
This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to the surface, provided there is one on the same plane of existence. For the duration, as long as there is a surface, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the surface. This spell does not take your movement capabilities into account, potentially requiring swimming, climbing, flight, etc. If the surface is farther than 1 dayâ€™s worth of travel away, this spell will instead guide you to the most elevated position.
