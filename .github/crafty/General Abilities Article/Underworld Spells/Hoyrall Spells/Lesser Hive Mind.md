# Lesser Hive Mind
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] spellcasters at the GM’s discretion.***

**Level**: 2nd
#Spell-Level/2nd

**School**: Divination
#Spell-School/Divination

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (piece of [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]] antennae)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

## Effects
You choose up to 3 creatures in range. The subjects become linked with a primitive form of telepathy allowing them to have a dialogue in mutually shared languages, so long as they remain within close range of one another. Should they venture out of this area, there’s a 50% chance that they cannot understand or be understood through *[[Hive Mind|hive mind]]* within double the spell’s range and beyond that, are no longer under its effects. Should they reenter the spell’s area during the duration, its effects immediately reinstate themselves for the duration of the spell.
