## Effects
Your eyes and carapace take on a hypnotic, calming countenance. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of you and the you can see each other, the you can force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw if you are not incapacitated. Saves are made at advantage if you or your allies are fighting the affected creatures. On a failed save, the creature is subject to the charmed condition. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the spell ends. A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see you until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at you in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
