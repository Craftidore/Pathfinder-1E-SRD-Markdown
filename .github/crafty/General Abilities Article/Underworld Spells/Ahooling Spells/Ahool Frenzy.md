# Ahool Frenzy
## Overview
***The following spell is available to [[Ahooling|ahooling]] spellcasters at the GM’s discretion.***

**Level**: 3rd
#Spell-Level/3rd

**School**: Enchantment
#Spell-School/Enchantment

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (1 ounce of blood)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute. (See text.)

## Effects
You make one willing [[Ahooling|ahooling]] or [[Ahool|ahool]] within range become incensed with a bestial bloodlust that drives their movements in combat to greater heights of savagery, mimicking a barbarian’s rage.

Any attacks against or attacks from targets that have been bitten by the enchanted [[Ahool|ahool]] or [[Ahooling|ahooling]] gain the rage damage bonus as though the attacker had barbarian levels equal to their Hit Dice. The target of the spell also chooses resistance to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage—the target gains resistance to the damage type chosen for the duration of this spell. If you cast this spell on yourself, you can still concentrate on this spell, even though you’re treated as though in a rage. The target of this spell can end it as a bonus action.
