# Aquatic Stealth
## Overview
***The following spell is available to*** ***[[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]****** spellcasters at the GM’s discretion.***

#Spell-School/Illusion

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (auditory gland of a [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]])

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour.

## Requirements and Restrictions
As part of the casting of this spell, you touch a creature. The creature touched gains immunity to both blindsense and blindsight while [[Underwater|underwater]]—it becomes invisible to both. This does not grant bonuses or invisibility from any other senses (such as auditory, sight, or smell) and the enchanted creature may still be detected. The unique sonar ability of [[Vestraadi|vestraadi]] does not work against a creature under the effects of *aquatic stealth*.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level, you can maintain your concentration on this spell up to 8 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on this spell up to 24 hours. Additionally, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
