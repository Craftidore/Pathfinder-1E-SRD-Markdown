# Pinned
## Overview
A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus. A pinned character also takes an additional â€“4 penalty to his Armor Class. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or [[Escape Artist (Skill)|Escape Artist]] check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler's CMB + spell level) or lose the spell. Pinned is a more severe version of [[Grappled|grappled]], and their effects do not stack.

**GM NOTE**

**Casting Spells while Pinned:** The only spells which can be cast while grappling or pinned are those without somaticcomponents and whose material components (if any) you have in hand. Even so, you must make a concentrationcheck (DC 10 + the grappler's CMB + the level of the spell you're casting) or lose the spell.
