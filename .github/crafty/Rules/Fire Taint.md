# Fire Taint
## Overview
**Type:** disease, inhaled

**Save:** Fortitude DC 18

**Onset:** 1 day

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d6 Wis

**Cure:** 

When a character takes more than 30 points of fire damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil (such as the presence of an evil outsider or a desecrated area), she risks contracting fire taint. Her flesh reddens and her insides seem to burn. The victim vomits bile during the worst of the disease.

When damaged, character must succeed at another saving throw or 1 point of temporary damage is permanent drain instead.
