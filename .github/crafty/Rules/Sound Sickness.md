# Sound Sickness
## Overview
**Type:** disease, contact

**Save:** Fortitude DC 18

**Onset:** 1d3 days

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d6 Dex

**Cure:** 

When a character takes more than 30 points of sonic damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil (as with acid fever, above), he risks contracting sound sickness. Given to fits of shouting, the victim of this disease shows no visible illness, but he staggers about, barely able to keep to his feet.

When damaged, character must succeed at another saving throw or 1 point of temporary damage is permanent drain instead.

With each failed saving throw, a second saving throw must be made. If at any time the second save fails, the victim becomes permanently deafened.

**Source:** Book of Vile Darkness, pg.
