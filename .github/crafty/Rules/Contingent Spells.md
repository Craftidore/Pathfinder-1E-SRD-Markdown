# Contingent Spells
## Overview
*Contingent* spells are single-use, one-spell magic items that do not use a magic item space and do not have a physical form. They remain inactive until triggered, similar to a spell cast with a feat to create contingent spells.

Triggers for contingent spells are usually things that happen to the bearer of the spell. Possible triggers include becoming [[Helpless|helpless]], blind, or deaf; death; disease; exposure to a breath weapon or to energy; falling; poison; proximity to danger (such as fire, water, and so on); sleep; and gaining negative levels.

The market price of a contingent spell is spell level × caster level × 100 gp. A contingent spell must be crafted in the presence of the person to bear it, and the bearer is treated as a participant in the creation of the item (he cannot cast any other spells while the contingent spell is being crafted, must be present for 8 hours each day, and so on). Once assigned to a bearer, a contingent spell cannot be transferred to another creature, although it can be destroyed (see below). An unwilling recipient cannot be a bearer for a contingent spell. A contingent spell is tied to the bearer’s body, alive or dead, and stories circulate among adventuring parties about contingent spells remaining quiet for hundreds of years on a slain bearer, only to suddenly activate when the proper condition was triggered.

Contingent spells are subject to *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* and similar spells. If a contingent spell is affected by *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* (made against the caster level of the contingent spell’s crafter), it is destroyed rather than merely suppressed. Destroying a contingent spell in this manner does not trigger the spell. Contingent spells are suppressed by an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]* or dead magic zones like any other magic item but are not destroyed by them.

At any one time, a creature can bear a number of contingent spells equal to its Hit Dice. Additional contingent spells applied beyond this limit simply fail.

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* The rule stating a creature can bear a number of contingent spells equal to its Hit Dice above is further defined to mean the total of ALL contingent spells (cf. *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]**, energetic contingency, final contingency, greater contingency, readied contingency,* *[[Contingent Action (Spell)|contingent action]]**, contingent energy resistance, contingent healing* \[all forms]*, contingent other,* *[[Contingent Scroll (Spell)|contingent scroll]]**, contingent spell immunity,* *[[Delayed Resurrection (Spell)|delayed resurrection]]* *(v3.5 death pact), [[Instant Refuge (Spell)|instant refuge]],* *[[Pact of Return (Spell)|pact of return]]**,* *[[Renewal Pact (Spell)|renewal pact]]**,* *[[Spell Phylactery (Spell)|spell phylactery]]**, [[Stalwart Pact (Spell)|stalwart pact]],* etc.)

Basically, any spell that is triggered by one or more preset DEFINED conditions should probably be considered a contingent spell and added to the above list.

There are several feats that add contingent spells or modify them (cf. [[Craft Contingent Spell (Feat)|Craft Contingent Spell]], [[Spell Mantle (Feat)|Spell Mantle]], and [[Spell Mantle, Greater (Feat)|Greater Spell Mantle]]).

It is recommended that GMs not allow free actions (such as speaking) to act as triggers for *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* or spells made contingent using the [[Craft Contingent Spell (Feat)|Craft Contingent Spell]] feat; this is not relevant for [[Spell Mantle (Feat)|Spell Mantle]] and [[Spell Mantle, Greater (Feat)|Greater Spell Mantle]] as each of them are defined actions (standard and swift) regarding triggering them other than through their preset conditions.

Items that trigger a spell-like effect once a preset condition occurs are NOT considered contingent spells and do not count against the above mentioned total. A crafty (pun intended) spellcaster could craft an item that used any of the above mentioned contingent spells or the [[Craft Contingent Spell (Feat)|Craft Contingent Spell]] feat to circumvent this restriction. GMs should consider the vulnerability of items as well as the cost in both time and wealth as part of the balance of this exception.

Players and GMs should also carefully consider spells such as *[[Reciprocal Gyre (Spell)|reciprocal gyre]]* and *[[Spell Theft (Spell)|spell theft]]* and their effects upon contingent spells.

Other considerations specifically regarding *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* for GMs should include:

As written, *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* triggers as soon as its condition is true, not as soon as the caster is aware that it is true. Neither caster’s senses, nor anyone else’s senses, are involved: it just happens. The spell changes the fundamental laws of the universe such that the next time X happens, spell Y is cast.

So the question isn’t about who knows, it’s about what is fact. 

1. Tell time?

*[[Contingency (Spell)|Contingency]]* certainly seems to be capable of responding to certain times (time of day, time since an event); the tricky part here is establishing the condition clearly. Many settings don’t have rigorously-defined times, so it’s not clear that “6 PM” is going to mean anything in-character. On a globe, time zone issues can also be problems. But something like “noon at Town” seems likely to work.

2. Read minds?

The open-ended nature of the spell leaves that conceivable, but I’d go with “no,” largely on the basis that personal thoughts are not “facts of the universe” and detecting another’s thoughts requires a Saving Throw. *[[Contingency (Spell)|Contingency]]* does not have a built-in *read thoughts*.

3. Predict the future?

Similar to how I feel about reading minds: predicting the future requires special, powerful, and uncertain magic. The future is not a fact, not yet, and so *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* cannot be triggered by it.

4. Penetrate disguises?

If the disguise included some form of hiding from magic (*[[Nondetection (Spell)|nondetection]]*), then no, but a simple mundane disguise would not affect *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]*.

5. Discern the morality of actions?

Magic can detect alignment without giving the subject a Saving Throw. Somehow, alignment is an objective observable reality. So things like “a creature of Evil alignment” and an “Evil action” could probably be valid. Whether or not alignment is the same as morality is debatable and beyond the scope of this question.

6. Employ senses the subject lacks?

*[[Contingency (Spell)|Contingency]]* doesn’t “sense” per se; it just automatically reacts to facts. So, basically, the subject’s lack of a particular sense doesn’t come into play.

7. Determine other creatures' intents?

Same deal as thoughts; probably not.

8. Hear or see things the subject can't?

Same as 6; it doesn’t “hear” or “see” but can certainly react to facts that the subject cannot hear or see.

9. Know if the subject's been robbed even if the subject doesn't?

Yes.

10. Otherwise be triggered by information the subject doesn't or even couldn't have?

The subject doesn’t come into play; it’s more about what “magic” could have the information. Protected information (e.g. stuff magic would require a failed Saving Throw to get) I’ll call unavailable, but even that might be wishful thinking on my part.

As for the timing of simultaneous events, the rules don’t really handle that well. Presumably you could just use whoever’s player declared the action first, but in the case of purely-reactive contingencies, both could be triggered by the same fact and therefore be “simultaneous.” For creatures’ actions, I’d consider houseruling an expansion of Initiative to use opposed Initiative checks in such cases. But *[[Contingency (Spell)|contingency]]* is not a creature and once cast, it doesn’t have anything to do with the creature it’s been cast on until it triggers a spell on that character. I think perhaps the best solution is to use opposed Caster Level checks.
