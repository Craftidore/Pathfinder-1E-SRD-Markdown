# Blinded
## Overview
The creature cannot see. It takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), and takes a –4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and on opposed [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks based on sight) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
