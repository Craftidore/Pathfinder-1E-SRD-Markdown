# Dual-School Spells
## Overview
Dual-school spells have effects that encompass two distinct schools of magic. In all cases, treat these spells as if they belonged to both schools simultaneously. Effects that prevent a spellcaster from accessing one school of a dual-school spell prevent all access to that spell. For example, a specialist wizard cannot learn a dual-school spell if either of the spell’s schools is one of his prohibited schools. Benefits that apply to a school of magic do not stack with themselves even if the spellcaster can apply them to both schools of magic. For example, if a spellcaster has the [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] feat for either school, it applies to the dual-school spell normally. However, spellcasters who have taken the [[Spell Focus (Feat)|Spell Focus]] feat for both of a dual-school spell’s associated schools only increase the DC of the dual-school spell by +1.
