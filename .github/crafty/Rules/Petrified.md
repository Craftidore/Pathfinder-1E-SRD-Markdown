# Petrified
## Overview
A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered [[Unconscious|unconscious]]. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the [[Broken|broken]] pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character's petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.

**Source:** PF Core Rulebook, pg. 568

**GM Note**

*House Rule:* A character who gains the petrified condition is still subject to damage. This damage is applied to the character's hit point total at the time the petrified condition is acquired (minus any temporary hit points from spells, items, etc.). All magic items and abilities (class, racial, etc.) are now nullified and noneffective. Damaged applied while the target has the petrified condition is subject to the hardness of the stone (8). Once a petrified character reaches sufficient negative hit points to be dead if they were not petrified then their stone form is destroyed and no longer able to be pieced back together sufficiently to allow the successful casting of *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]]**.*

A compromise solution is still possible; take a remaining piece of the destroyed creature's petrified body, then cast *[[Stone to Flesh (Spell)|stone to flesh]]* upon the fragment and then use either *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* or *[[True Resurrection (Spell)|true resurrection]]* to return the deceased character to life.
