# Faceless hate
## Overview
**Type:** disease, injury

**Save:** Fortitude DC 20

**Onset:** 1d4 days

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** 1d6 Str, 1d6 Con

**Cure:** 

When a victim of this disease takes enough Strength or Constitution damage to reduce the ability score to 0, the infection disappears. The character’s ability scores are immediately restored to what they were before the onset of the disease, but he becomes a monster with no face. The character loses his ability to see (and scent, if he has that ability), but gains blindsight with a range of 60 feet. He loses the ability to speak, but gains the Silent Spell feat if a spellcaster. The victim’s alignment changes to neutral evil, and he becomes intent on killing all those who were his friends and family. When the victim has hunted down everyone dear to him, he turns his ire against all other living things. These changes are permanent, and *remove disease* has no effect. A *wish* or *miracle* spell restores the character, but nothing else will. If the victim dies and a *remove disease* spell is then cast on the corpse, a *resurrection* or *true resurrection* spell restores the character to life and to his original form. *Raise dead* won’t work.

The victim must makes three successful Fortitude saving throws to recover.
