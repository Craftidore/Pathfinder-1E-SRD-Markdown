# Demon Lord
## Overview
Demon lords (also known as Abyssal lords) are demons (and, occasionally, gods or other entities) who have gained great power and established a position of preeminence among demonkind. Most demon lords have a unique appearance and set of abilities, although some few balors have also gained similar status by taking control of entire Abyssal realms. Most demon lords control at least one layer of the Abyss, though some rule only portions of Abyssal layers. A unique demon lord, when slain on a plane other than the Abyss, is banished to the Abyss for 100 years, whereas "ordinary" demons, including the mightiest balors and mariliths, risk being reborn into a lesser form (or not all). The most powerful demon lords are demon princes. "Demon lord" and "demon prince" are self-proclaimed titles; unlike archdevils, the chaotic evil demon lords do not have a rigid hierarchy. However, first edition AD&D did claim a demon can only be called a "prince" if he or she rules an entire plane of the Abyss, thus Orcus implied by his title to rule a least one plane of existence, while lesser lords did not.

Many demon lords wage eternal war with each other, often seeking ways to expand their holdings into other layers and at the same time defend their personal domains from rival lords and scheming underlings. Demogorgon has for many years been the most powerful demon lord, and he proclaims himself Prince of Demons. Orcus and Graz'zt contest his title, as does the obyrith Obox-ob, who once held that title. 

Most demon lords have secretive mortal cults who seek to elevate their lords to godhood through prayer and sacrifice. Book of Vile Darkness details a number of prestige classes for mortal disciples of demon lords, as does the "Demonomicon of Iggwilv" feature that once ran in Dragon magazine. 

**Known demon lords**

The most common and canonical demon lords in the latest 3.5 Edition (and generally most of the earlier editions) are Baphomet, Dagon, Demogorgon, Fraz-Urb'luu, Graz'zt, Juiblex, Kostchtchie, Lolth, [[Malcanthet]], Obox-ob, Orcus, Pale Night, Pazuzu, Sess'Innek, Yeenoghu, and Zuggtmoy. However, in addition to these, countless other minor demons have appeared in earlier editions, supplement books, Dragon, spinoffs from D&D, and other sources. Beneath is a large list detailing all known demon lords, both the major ones listed above and minor ones. 

The majority of these demon lords appear as listed in Appendix I in Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss. The designation (f) indicates a female demon lord, (o) indicates an obyrith, (l) indicates a loumara, and (d) indicates a lord that is presumed dead. Those names in italics are balors. 

Note that any demon lord who was mentioned by name only in the Monster Manual II (1983), on page 35, is noted as "\*MM2".

Non-canonical demon lords

Green Ronin published a D&D d20 supplement entitled Armies of the Abyss (2002, reprinted in 2003 as part of the Book of Fiends compilation) that provides information on 21 demon lords. Demon lords that share their names with D&D demon lords are listed in bold. As this book was written by Erik Mona, who would later be publisher of Dragon Magazine and co-author of Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss, later demonic works by Mona and by fellow Paizo staffer and Fiendish Codex I co-author James Jacobs would seek to remain essentially compatible with it.
