# Add Spells to Your Spellbook
## Overview
If you're a magus or wizard, you can spend 1 day of downtime to copy up to eight spells from other sources into your spellbook (see Spells Copied from Another's Spellbook or a Scroll). If you're an alchemist, you can use this option to add new formulae to your formula book. If you're a witch, you can use this option to add spells to your familiar. You may spend Magic toward the cost of copying spells.
