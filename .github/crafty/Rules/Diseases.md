# Diseases
## Overview
From a widespread plague to the bite of a dire rat, disease is a serious threat to common folk and adventurers alike. Diseases rarely have a limited frequency, but most have a lengthy onset time. This onset time can also be variable. Most diseases can be cured by a number of consecutive saving throws or by spells such as *[[Remove Disease (Spell)|remove disease]]*.

The following samples represent just some of the possibilities when creating diseases.

[[Blinding Sickness]]

[[Bubonic Plague]]

[[Cackle Fever]]

[[Demon Fever]]

[[Devil Chills]]

[[Filth Fever]]

[[Leprosy]]

[[Mindfire]]

[[Red Ache]]

[[Shakes]]

[[Slimy Doom]]
