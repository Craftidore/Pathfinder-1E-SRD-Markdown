# Vile rigidity
## Overview
**Type:** disease, contact

**Save:** Fortitude DC 19

**Onset:** 1 day

**Frequency:** 

**Effect:** Special

**Cure:** 

This infection at first seems a boon. The victim’s skin toughens, granting a +1 natural armor bonus to AC 24 hours after the infection starts. On the second day, this becomes a +2 bonus. On the third day, the natural armor bonus improves to +3, but the victim takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity. Each day thereafter, the victim’s skin becomes thicker and thicker, adding a cumulative +1 natural armor bonus and a –2 penalty to Dexterity. This lasts until the victim’s Dexterity reaches 0, indicating that his ever-thickening flesh has entrapped him. At this point, the victim dies of suffocation.
