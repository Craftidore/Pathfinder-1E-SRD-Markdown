# Dreaming Spells
## Overview
Spells with the dreaming descriptor cause specific (magic-induced) dreams in their targets. As a result, they only affect subjects that sleep and dream at some point during the spell’s duration. Dreaming spells either require the subject to be asleep when the spell is cast (sometimes allowing the caster to remain in a trance during casting, waiting for the target to nod off), or have a lengthy duration (with the spell effect not kicking in until the target falls asleep). Many dreaming spells have effects that continue after the subject awakens, but all require that the subject has slept and experienced the spell-induced dreams before their effects begin to manifest.

Creatures that do not sleep and dream are immune to dreaming spells unless some other magic has removed their sleepless state (see *drowse*, later in this volume). If a dreaming spell is cast on a nonsleeping target it may be negated by abilities such as *[[Dispel Magic (Spell)|dispel magic]]* sleep is not the same as immunity to magic dreams once you are asleep—elves have no special immunity to dreaming spells.

There is a limit to how many dreaming spells a target can be affected by in a single night’s sleep. Each night, a character can only be affected by a number of dreaming spells equal to his Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) +1 per 4 full character levels (+1 at 4th level, +2 at 8th level, and so on). Harmful dreaming spells can prevent a subject from receiving the benefits useful dreaming spells. If a creature is targeted by more dreaming spells than his maximum, he is affected first by spells that lack the harmless quality from highest spell level to lowest, and then harmless dreaming spells (also by level). Spells in excess of the creature’s maximum have no effect, though they are not dispelled. If the dreaming spells have a long enough duration, they may still affect the target on his next night’s sleep.

The most common dream-related spell from the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook*, *[[Dream (Spell)|dream]]*, should be considered to have the dreaming descriptor, but only for the spell’s designated messenger. The creature given a message through the *[[Dream (Spell)|dream]]* spell isn’t a target of the spell’s magic, and thus it does not count toward his total number of dreaming spells in a night. The *[[Nightmare (Spell)|nightmare]]* *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]* and *[[Deep Slumber (Spell)|deep slumber]]* are related to dreams through their connection to sleep, but are not dreaming spells.

Not every spell in *The Genius Guide to Dream Magic* has the dreaming descriptor. Like the *[[Sleep (Spell)|sleep]]* spell from the core rules, some of the spells presented are related to sleep and dreams without being dreaming spells.

**Order of Presentation:** In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell’s name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice:** The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level:** A spell’s power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster’s class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters:** The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.

**<sup>F</sup>** This spell has a focus component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>M</sup>** This spell has a material component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>R</sup>** Spell requires a requisite religion or race. If religion, spellcaster must worship the listed deity to utilize the spell. If race, the spell might only target members of the listed race (the spell will say this if it does), but often are just the race's guarded secrets. Members of other races can learn to cast them with GM permission.

**<sup>T</sup>** In order to prepare any of these spells, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches [[Torag]] (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

**<sup>Y</sup>** This spell has a Mythic version.
