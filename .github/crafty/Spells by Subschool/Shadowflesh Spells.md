# Shadowflesh Spells
## Overview
**Shadowflesh Magic**

Shadowflesh is a rakshasa-created subschool of magic that is usually found within the illusion and conjuration schools. Shadowflesh spells are imbued with a spark of the horrible life force that rakshasas command; these spells infuse flesh (either the target’s or the caster’s) with a shadowy essence that warps it to achieve twisted results. When creatures warped or created by shadowflesh magic are destroyed, they leave ragged pieces of flesh and bone behind. These twitching scraps do not last long—they dematerialize as the magic that created them dissipates—but they puzzle the few mortal spellcasters who have encountered them. Indeed, these strange remnants have sparked more than a few stories about shadowflesh’s prowess, nudging lore about rakshasas and their strange magic to even greater heights. 

**Order of Presentation:** In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell’s name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice:** The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level:** A spell’s power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster’s class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters:** The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.

**<sup>F</sup>** This spell has a focus component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>M</sup>** This spell has a material component not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**<sup>R</sup>** Spell requires a requisite religion or race. If religion, spellcaster must worship the listed deity to utilize the spell. If race, the spell might only target members of the listed race (the spell will say this if it does), but often are just the race's guarded secrets. Members of other races can learn to cast them with GM permission.

**<sup>T</sup>** In order to prepare any of these spells, the caster must spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.

**<sup>Y</sup>** This spell has a Mythic version.
