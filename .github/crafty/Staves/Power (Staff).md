# Power (Staff)
## Overview
**Aura** strong varied; **CL** 15th

**Slot** none

**Price** 235,000 gp

**Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

The *staff of power* is a very potent magic item with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem that often burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells:

- *[[Continual Flame (Spell)|Continual flame]]* (1 charge)
- *[[Fireball (Spell)|Fireball]]* (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
- *[[Levitate (Spell)|Levitate]]* (1 charge)
- *[[Lightning Bolt (Spell)|Lightning bolt]]* (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
- *[[Magic Missile (Spell)|Magic missile]]* (1 charge)
- *[[Ray of Enfeeblement (Spell)|Ray of enfeeblement]]* (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
- *[[Cone of Cold (Spell)|Cone of cold]]* (2 charges)
- *[[Globe of Invulnerability (Spell)|Globe of invulnerability]]* (2 charges)
- *[[Hold Monster (Spell)|Hold monster]]* (2 charges)
- *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|Wall of force]]* (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges)

The wielder of a *staff of power* gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a *+2 quarterstaff,* and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (×3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.

A *staff of power* can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30- foot spread. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 20 × the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 15 × the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 10 × the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.

The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the *[[Staff of the Magi|staff of the magi]]* and the *staff of power,* are capable of being used for a retributive strike.
