# 2 - Underworld History
## Overview
Living in the Underworld of Aventyr for any period of time tends to alter one’s perspective. The lack of light or changes in temperature that normally indicate day and night vanish, along with the meaning of the terms. The senses run amok as constant sounds flit in and out of the limits of hearing, and the need to be able to navigate in three dimensions—as chimneys and crevasses suddenly appear in your path—discombobulate any natural talent for direction. Were that not enough, the creeping horrors that developed below the picturesque surface of Aventyr have a disturbing trait of “changing” people.

In the stygian depths, the claustrophobic tunnels, endless caverns, undiscovered realms, countries, and entire lands beneath Aventyr’s surface, the races that thrived have adapted to their home in ways unheard of in the Upperworld. Specialties suited to the peculiar and particular environs abound, while those that cling to sunlit ways fall prey to what lurks in the shadows.

The archetypes and classes in [[Underworld Races and Classes|Underworld Races & Classes]] are most frequently associated with characters in the Underworld of Aventyr but can be adopted either by other races in an underground setting or by a character with an Underworld influence in their history. If your campaign doesn’t have a subterranean bent, each class has other means and motivations for characters to pursue them detailed in their class entry.

**Underworld History**

The first of the four great historical events in the history of the Underworld of Aventyr came by the hands of the gods themselves during the *Forging of the [[Dvergr]]*. Finding the mythical creatures to be ultimately self destructive, the divine powers carved each into the four dwarven races ([[Dweorg|dweorg]], [[Dvergr|dvergr]], [[Zwerc|zwerc]], and their foul kin, the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]]) and the immortals (elves and [[Drow|drow]]). The [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] removed themselves from the rest of these newly-created races, sealing a pact with the devils of Hel at the core of the world while their cousins were molded. Each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr while their slender, distant cousins sought refuge away and above. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans ([[Dweorg|dweorg]], [[Dvergr|dvergr]] and [[Zwerc|zwerc]]) were it not for the sweeping changes soon to overtake the Underworld.

The second great event is known as the *Grand Sculpting*, when the Progenitors (the first race of Aventyr, mysterious entities still shrouded by the mists of time) mastered the primal dragons of the subterranean depths. Enslaved, the powerful creatures were made to shape the whole of the continent beneath the surface, carving out grand empires and rerouting magma flows, creating vast networks of caves and connecting peoples and creatures never before exposed to one another.

The Underworld is as separated as the surface world by oceans, lakes, and wide, turbulent rivers. Of course, on Earth, the subsurface is one complete mass, but Aventyr is different. Although no one is certain (largely due to the constant movement at the surface of Hel), many sages believe there are several continental Underworlds, each resting as an individual land mass on an ocean of internal fire—Hel, the realm that rests at the core of Aventyr. So rather than plate tectonics and shelf drift, the continents really can move quite spectacularly if monumental events take place within or on the surface of Hel; this might account for a number of the great extinctions, the raising of gigantic mesas and mountains, the isolation of races and peoples, and so on. The Underworld itself can take on an almost fluid characteristic as Hel moves, magma flows, and the previous configuration of caverns and tunnels is reshaped beyond recognition.</span>

The dwarves scattered as the world around them was rebuilt by the potent draconic slaves; the [[Dweorg|dweorg]] to the relative safety near the surface, the [[Dvergr|dvergr]] to remote caverns to build cities of their own and the [[Zwerc|zwerc]] to isolated outposts barely tethered to the Material Realm, far removed from the rest of the world in pocket dimensions connected to the Elemental Plane of Earth (only accessible by the mystical Amber Roads—mysterious veins of orange crystal that bisect the realms of reality). The [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]] and [[Drow|drow]] were already far removed from most of the Underworld (the former near the core of Aventyr and ruling the realms directly above Hel, the latter foraging in the darkness at the farthest reaches of the existing cave networks after their banishment from the Silent Forest) and had little interest in the massive reshaping of the Progenitors.

<span class="RWgmDirections" title="GM Directions">**GM Sidebar: Prehistoric Progenitors**<br>
The Progenitors remain a mystery of the past. Scholars believe the [[Draaki|draaki]] to be the remains of the once great race that shaped the Underworld, but the many names attributed to the influential Progenitors—Kantaisa, Kantaa, Stamvader and more—leave the truth of their origins an enigma to even the finest historians of Aventyr. Legends suggest that the eldest primal dragons might know the truth of the mysterious, powerful, prehistoric peoples, but if they do know, they are keeping it to themselves.</span>

The third event, the Great Schism, saw the downfall of those powerful slavers. Over centuries the dragons plotted in secret, subtly enchanting the tunnels and byways they carved through Aventyr, beneath the notice of their minders. In a grand ritual that promised to grant the Progenitor race great power, they instead awoke a seemingly impossible creature—the Dracoprime. Before the monstrosity could fully rise and form, the greatest mages of the once powerful slavers sacrificed the very essence of their species to see it destroyed, calling out with a cry that shook the most far flung planes. The Progenitors were saved, but much reduced in power, influence, and ability, rapidly mutating into the [[Draaki|draaki]].

Forming out of the bedrock beneath the oceans, most of the continent was safe from the Dracoprime’s calamitous fall—all save Picollo. Once a great archipelago that extended far from the mainland, the realm of the halflings was reduced in one disastrous moment to a single island. Countless small folk died that cataclysmic day, and their world became forever changed by the mountainous creature’s end. The [[Drow|drow]] took this opportunity to “save” numerous refugees of the Dracoprime’s fallout, becoming the new powerful slavers beneath the surface, forcing the lesser races under their charge to build magnificent cities hidden away in the endless caverns.

The desperate call of the [[Draaki|draaki]] brought aid from a strange, otherworldly, god-like alien from far across the cosmos. Zagnexis transported his physical form (Zagn) and brood to Aventyr using a grand surge of divine power, placing them directly into the forming brain of the draconic idol. The Dracoprime’s skull erupted with the insectoid god’s body and its children, killing the monstrosity instantly. Many [[Hoyrall|hoyrall]], as its children were called, were carried to the Underworld where they prepared for a grand invasion, but the others remained on the surface engaging in a war that nearly consumed the remaining halflings of Picollo. Exis, the god’s essence, maintained a connection with his creations, granting them a [[Hive Mind|hive mind]] that made them a threat poised to topple the entire Underworld—if not Aventyr itself.

However, more than one bizarre entity answered the draakis’ call for aid, and the colloid arrived in the Underworld in an event called The Confluence. Exis’ conduit to his children had been studied by another being known as the colloid for some time. After several centuries the alien stole Exis’ power to transport itself to Aventyr, shattering the [[Hive Mind|hive mind]] that made the insect god’s creatures such a serious danger. Their race fell into disarray, their deity’s monstrous body turned into a mindless aquatic beast; the echoes of the colloid’s arrival would soon leave even bigger waves in the sea of history.

While its message only now reaches Upperworld, the denizens below have known the colloid’s touch for some time. One lich, obsessed with finding a way to protect himself from the otherworldly [[Hive Mind|hive-mind]], instead created two new species that survive in the subterranean world to this day (even if he does not). Each is a reflection of their creator; one a reduced version of himself but forever tied to stone (the [[Dødelig|dødelig]]), and the other that which he hated most—crystalline beings borne from contact with the alien creature (the [[Colliatur|colliatur]]).

It was during this latest period that the jungles of the Underworld saw the emergence of a fungal race that towers over its subterranean fellows with an aloofness and apprehension that sets them apart as surely as their intimidating presence, and they have propagated across Aventyr since.

**Forging of the** **[[Dvergr]]**

In the days of darkness when the world was young, the gods forged a race from the very heart of the world itself. They called this race “[[Dvergr]]” and placed them close to the heart of Motherworld.

The [[Dvergr|dvergr]] thrived and prospered, but as time went on they became greedy, fighting over the precious metals and gems of the Motherworld.

The gods foresaw the self-destruction of the [[Dvergr|dvergr]], and so they divided the race into five parts, each sharing the appearance of the first [[Dvergr|dvergr]] (but only a fragment of its whole).

The first were named [[Dweorg|dweorg]], and were created from the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]’s hands and heart giving them honor and expert craftsmanship.

The second were made from the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]’s head, and kept its most proud of names. They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.

The third were named the [[Zwerc|zwerc]], created from the spirits of the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]. This granted them [[Innate Power|innate power]] over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.

The potent avarice of the [[Dvergr|dvergr]], however, would not be undone by the gods. Their greed led them deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted them to go. Soon they had discovered Hel—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave these [[Dvergr|dvergr]] the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the [[Dvergr|dvergr]] more power.

When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the [[Gitwerc|gitwerc]].

The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the [[Dvergr|dvergr]]. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the elves and the [[Drow|drow]].

Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races. They created a realm between Upperworld and the Underworld, using the culminating thoughts of all the new races to forge the “Gift from the Gods, ” the first humans: Ask and Embla.

This gift would bring balance to the world.
