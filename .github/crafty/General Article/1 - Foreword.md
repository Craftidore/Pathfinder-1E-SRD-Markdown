# 1 - Foreword
## Overview
Welcome to [[Underworld Races and Classes|Underworld Races & Classes]]. What a treat!

Who doesn’t love a good dungeon crawl, especially when we’re starting out roleplaying and everything is shiny and new? Dark, creepy places underground... which if we’re lucky, give way to endless networks of caverns, an entire world down there.

It did for me, and I happily met, was frightened by, and fought intelligent fungi, talking rocks, and all manner of creeping, slithering, oddly-glowing, ceiling clinging, nightmarish critters.

And was, of course, inspired to create my own. Yes, I added intelligent underground races to the official D&D® rules, and even a subterranean-dwelling species of dragon—and I’m still doing it, with glee!

And why not? If the Underworld is a vast subterranean landscape, as big—or even bigger; layers!—as the surface world above, it’s a world. Vast and hopefully varied (all of these fearsome beasties we know are down there, entire races of them, have to live somewhere, and find food and drink; that takes space). If the surface world has hundreds of distinctly different sorts of critters, why not the Underworld? And what’s more fearsome than a roaring, horrible beastie? A race of intelligent roaring, horrible beasties who want revenge if you stomp one of them! And may even come hunting you ...

These subterranean landscapes are so much more, should be so much more, than labyrinths of caverns full of evil [[Drow|drow]] ruling everyone else (or at least trying to). Think of an Underworld so big it holds sentient races who’ve never heard of [[Drow|drow]]—or at least never actually seen one. It follows that for such a big, rich adventure playground to be rich, it will be full of new races, who live their lives in such different ways than humans on the surface that playing characters of these different races will demand new character classes.

Well, looky here! This gorgeous tome is brimming with details about subterranean-dwelling races, and new classes galore! I can’t wait to explore the Underworld anew with all these new toys!
