## Information
These exotic mushrooms can be the size of a childâ€™s finger in the quieter chambers of the Underworld and several stories tall in the most cacophonous caves. Audire boletus subsist on sound as much as they do the nutrients that most mushrooms thrive on and when introduced to an environment with sufficient aural activity they prove to be a vital resource to subterranean humanoids.

Underworld rangers plant these mushrooms in hidden areas of caves they frequent, using their growth as an indicator of how much traffic the chambers have s een in their absence and legends tell of a team of devoted dwarves that utilized Funneling Fungi to successfully avoid a siege of their patron city. Anyone standing directly under the cap of a Huge Funneling Fungi receives advantage on hearing-based Perception checks made to hear a noise as the runnels within the inverted cap subtly shift at the introduction of new sounds to its environment (Large mushrooms instead grant a +2 bonus). When these unique mushrooms are successfully harvested they may be used in conjunction with spell components for thunder blasts and other thunder-based energy damage spells to increase the damage die of the spell by one step or increase the DC to resist its effects by 1.
