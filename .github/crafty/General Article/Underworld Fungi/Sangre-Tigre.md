## Information
A pool of crimson liquid forms on the top of this mushroom; the substance has the consistency and smell of real blood but is actually a natural attractant formed by the fungus to beckon forth various carnivorous creatures. No harm comes to its benign subjects but if they attempt to eat or drink a part of the mushroom they take a number of spores with them. These spores mature in the belly of the creature and grow to twice their size before being excreted from the body with normal solid waste 2d20+20 days later. There is a 5% cumulative chance per ounce of liquid consumed or mushroom eaten that one of the spores gets trapped in the digestive tract, doubling in size every 20 days; after 2–3 months the intestines swell and finally burst, causing the creature to die from toxicity unless the fungus is surgically removed within 4 rounds after going critical—a procedure which requires a Wisdom (medicine) check against DC 20, supplemented by immediate magical healing within 2 rounds after removal. This process must be performed by another individual and not the victim; if below half hit points during the surgery, the infected creature goes unconscious regardless of abilities that might otherwise disallow it to.

**Secret Lore:** These mushrooms are used by only the eldest [[Drow|drow]] matrons in ritualistic sacrifices where the blood of an enemy is joined with the liquid produced by this fungi. They then force one of their own children to drink the blood, after which they slit their throat and drain their life essence into a scrying pool. This pool allows the matrons to see the future for a period of 1 day (although the time and location could be off by as much as 1–2 hours and 1 mile.)
