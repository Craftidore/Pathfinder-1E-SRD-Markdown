## Information
Few speak of the dreaded Necroshroom for fear that the very utterance of its name might draw the netherworldly spores of the fungus to the speaker, entombing their bodies in a birthing embrace that ends with their death and the growth of a new mortem diasporus. These are folktales and myths told to the children of kind races in the Underworld and the legends are vastly over-exaggerated; a Necroshroom is just as morbid as the stories tell, but rarely seek out victims from which to gestate. Necroshrooms are actually an aberration in the Underworld and would not exist naturally were it not for meddling spellcasters. Sometimes when a more mundane fungus is accidentally (or intentionally) targeted by magics steeped in negative energy, the mycelium grows a fondness for the necromantic force and begins to draw the ambient negative energy from the atmosphere around it (some studies show that the reach of the greatest Necroshrooms can be numbered in miles). Whenever a radiance energy effect is used within 30 feet of a Necroshroom, increase the die by one step; for necrotic energy effects, reduce the die by one step. Necromancers and evil clerics alike seek out Mortem Diasporus to harvest its negatively-infused stocks and caps. When a dried ounce of Necroshroom is used as a component for a necrotic energy spell, one target of the spell suffers disadvantage on saving throws to resist it; if consumed, the subject suffers 14 (4d6) necrotic damage should they fail a Constitution saving throw against DC 18, half as much on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, the target is poisoned for 10 minutes.
