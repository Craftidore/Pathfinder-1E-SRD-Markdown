## Information
The globule spores of this fungus fill up with a liquid vapor and then separate from the mother plant, floating throughout caves on Underworld drafts. After landing they grow another mother plant in 45–90 days; this new plant begins producing spores 10–20 days later. These floating globules of gas erupt from popped spores and immediately change into a liquid vapor when exposed to oxygen. When inhaled this vapor causes a violent reaction similar to mustard gas; a successful Constitution saving throw against DC 17 reduces the effects to 2 (1d4) poison damage, but on a failure the PC begins coughing and choking, falling prone to the ground and taking 4 (1d6+1) poison damage per round for a period of 1d4+2 rounds (after which they recover for 1 round before resuming normal breathing). For the next 1d2 days this character finds excessive activity difficult, resulting in suffering from disadvantage on saves prompted by any prolonged physical activity or effect that may cause exhaustion. This is a poison effect and any ability or magic that eliminates poison ends this effect. Bottling this liquid vapor is nearly impossible, but if one is able to harness it, they may use it to incur the same effects as listed above (treat this as a flask of this substance with the same rules as those for an acid flask but with no splash effect.)
