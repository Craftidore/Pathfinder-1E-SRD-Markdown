## Information
Dubbed “Treeshrooms” by visiting upperworlders, these giant mushrooms are common throughout the Fungi Forest and tower high above the heads of most creatures dwelling here. Growing an incredible 1–2 feet per day until reaching maturity (50–60 feet in height), these mushrooms make for an excellent renewable resource for the humanoid residents of the forest. They are generally cut down when they reach half-maturity before being formed into planks to be dried by the locals. Once dry, the boards created from these mushrooms are as strong as the wood of a cedar tree but with the flexibility of bamboo. Many of the homes and various structures found throughout the Fungi Forest are made using this material. It is also surprisingly resistant to fire and only takes damage if a strong and consistent source of flame is applied to the same area for more than 6 continuous rounds—fantafungus is treated as having a damage threshold of 5 against fire damage. Climbing these mushrooms is possible, but ascending to the cap can be quite difficult and in most cases climbing equipment is required.
