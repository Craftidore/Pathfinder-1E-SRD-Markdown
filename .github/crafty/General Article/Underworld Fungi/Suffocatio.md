## Information
The Suffocatio is an extremely dangerous and volatile fungus; the slightest tap or vibration expels a cloud of poisonous spores from the bloated puffball. Inhaling this poison is nearly fatal for most creatures; bones and partially rotted corpses litter the ground near groups of Poisonpuffs. Suffocatio fungi grow in groups (of 2d4+2) and are found scattered throughout the ruins near the Rift as well as the walls and interior of the region itself, making climbing into or out of the huge canyon a suicidal effort for those unable to avoid the toxic fungus. Once expelled a cloud of these spores fills a circular area (20 feet across and 10 feet high on the first round) that spreads an additional 20 feet out and 10 feet up each round for two more rounds (finally occupying a cylinder with a 60 foot radius and 30 foot height. ) Anyone within the cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin violently coughing and choking (gaining the poisoned condition); a successful save means that the character manages to hold their breath and when they eventually take a breath, the save will automatically fail. The cloud dissipates after 1d4+4 additional rounds after reaching its maximum size.
