## Information
The residents of the Fungi Forest find a number of uses for the caps of these mushrooms, often converting them into makeshift umbrellas (or hats) to keep dry while walking under waterfalls from Underworld cured to be used as shields. Finally, they may be shredded, treated with kombucha, and fermented to make a tea which when consumed provides hallucinogenic properties to the user for 1d4 hours. These hallucinations are intense and sometimes (5% cumulative chance per ounce imbibed) result in an individual temporarily losing their sanity and wildly attacking their kin or companions (Constitution saving throw DC 15 negates).
