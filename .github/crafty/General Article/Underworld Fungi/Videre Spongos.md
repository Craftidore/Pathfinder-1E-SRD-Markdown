## Information
These mushrooms can be found throughout the Underworld and always grow relatively close to the surface, thriving on the lighter gases denied to subterranean caverns. They are edible and while not exactly poisonous, habitual consumption of Twilight Caps (an ounce a day across three days) transforms the retina of anyone that eats 3 dried ounces of the mushrooms, granting them both darkvision 30 ft. and light-sensitivity. This condition persists for as long as the Twilight Caps are continuously consumed (3 ounces a day) and ends 1d3+2 days after the dosage has been reduced or eliminated entirely. When the mushroom is used as a spell component for any spell that grants a type of sight or unusual Perception, treat the spell as though it was cast using a spell-slot of one level higher and increase the duration of the spell by +50%.
