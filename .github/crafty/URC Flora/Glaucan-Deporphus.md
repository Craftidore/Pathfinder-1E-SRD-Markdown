## Information
These contain some of the same good bacteria present in kombucha but eating this mushroom provides different benefits due to the digestive process the microorganisms go through after the fungi absorbs it. Eating a 1-ounce serving of these fungi raw begins the healing process for any existing infection or disease allowing the PC to reroll a save versus such an existing condition. If the same serving size is cooked, it reduces down to 1/2 ounce once the moisture is removed and loses this potency; however, local dwarves and gnomes swear by either a cooked or dried variety as a digestive aid and this has been known to help nausea and mitigate the worst brunt of poisonous effects. After eating cooked Glaucan-Deporphus, you may, as a reaction to taking poison damage, remember the delicious taste of the mushrooms, fortifying your system. This reduces the poison damage taken by 1d4, to a minimum of 0. If this reduces the poison damage to 0, you are not affected by any effects of the poison. If the poison damage is tied to an ongoing poisoned condition and you successfully reduce the poison damage to 0, the poisoned condition ends immediately. You may only benefit once from the benefits of this mushroom in a given week.
