## Information
Long ago a Lunarae fungus spore came to this planet from the moon, carried into the atmosphere on the back of a giant meteorite. The surprisingly tough fungi survived the impact and the spores took hold but struggled in the Upperworld environment. As time went on the Lunarae spores eventually made their way into the Underworld where the environment was more suitable to their needs. While Lunarae mushrooms grow heartily within the Fungi Forest, they are very rare. Generally growing in groups of 1–4 mushrooms with a larger “moon mother”, they are considered so scarce that even the residents of the forest themselves have only had the pleasure of glimpsing a “Moon Child” once or twice in their lives. Lunarae Mushrooms are imbued with lunar power and the “moon mother” mushroom watches over the small fungi, bathing them in a soft blue glow and exercising a small field of gravity which stabilizes the surrounding environment. Once per week a “moon mother” may let out a gravity blast which strikes everything surrounding the mushroom group. All creatures within the area must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) force damage, half as much on a successful save. Remains of creatures attempting to damage or eat the mushrooms are generally found in the nearby vicinity, tipping off would be intruders of the danger. If the glowing blue gills of the “moon mother” are picked and distilled in alcohol for a period of 1d4+4 weeks a potion is created which gives the drinker the ability to channel a *reverse gravity* effect once during the next 24 hours (identical to the spell; the user’s caster level is equal to their hit die). Additionally, they gain the benefits of darkvision for 1–2 hours, depending upon the ability of the alchemist crafting the potion (proficient versus non-proficient).
