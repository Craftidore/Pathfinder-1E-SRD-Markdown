## Information
While a fairly common mushroom within the jungle, the Kekel’Ji holds a secret ingredient used in many healing potions (despite how difficult it is to harness). The cap of the fungi is hollow and typically holds between 1–4 gallons of water depending upon the size of the mushroom. The water, while seemingly normal and quite clean, it is infused with powerful vitamins and minerals deposited and refined by the mushroom (which are recycled each time it empties its core water). The core water is used by the plant should there come a time in which the surrounding soil is low on precious vitamins and minerals. If one gallon of this water is reduced (by 90%) and combined with no less than two other beneficial healing or restorative herbs, one may craft a healing or restorative potion that doubles the normal strength of the curative (depending upon the creator’s skill, the potency of the other two chosen herbs and subject to GM approval.)
