## Information
These mushrooms are quite edible; in fact they are both meaty and delicious whether raw or cooked. Considered a delicacy of the Fungi Forest, all manner of creatures may be encountered around these mushrooms, much like Upperworld beasts huddled around a waterhole. Those that consume at least 5 ounces of this fungus during the course of a day will be allowed to reroll the first Constitution saving throw incurred by strenuous physical activity the during next 24 hours (they will also have a very strong urge to eat more of these mushrooms once this time has passed, although this has no statistical effect).
