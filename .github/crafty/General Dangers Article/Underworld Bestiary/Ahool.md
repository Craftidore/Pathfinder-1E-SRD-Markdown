## Portfolio: Ahool
*This creature is easily the size and stock of a strong man or orc, corded with thick muscles that belie a nearly elven litheness. Unlike the kinder races, sharp talons extend from its hands and feet and its ears dwarf the creature’s head in their impressive size. The resemblance to a bat is uncanny, made concrete by the massive leathery wings that sprout from its back. Mottled brown fur covers its skin and accentuate the incredible tone of fitness apparent in the bat-like humanoid.*

Ahool are terrifying creatures that soar through the endless caverns of the Underworld of Aventyr. They are primordial hunters that strike swiftly and without warning, carrying subdued prey away to a moss cavern for eating later.

The average ahool is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds or so (despite its slender form and ability to fly).
