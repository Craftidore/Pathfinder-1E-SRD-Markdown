*Hit:* 18 (2d12+5) piercing damage.

***Mighty Swing.*** When the hondra attacks without moving during its turn, it makes its claw attack with advantage.

***[[Draaki]]****** Attunement.*** The hondra was bred by the [[Draaki|draaki]] and instinctively attunes to the closest [[Draaki|draaki]] it shares a space with for 24 hours. Its breath weapon can deal the same damage as that of the [[Draaki|draaki]] to which it is attuned. Determine the energy of the breath randomly for the hondra if it is not currently attuned to a [[Draaki|draaki]].

## Description
*Plated blue scales and bright purple spines extend off of this ursine creature as it lopes toward you on powerful hind legs and forelimbs that resemble that of a bear, though its massive, open-faced jaw is certainly not like its forest dwelling cousin.*

One of the [[Draaki|draaki]]’s few keepsakes from the distant past, these strange beasts are a reminder of the time long ago when they ruled over the Underworld with unmatched arcane power. Impressed with the physical prowess and durability of Aventyr’s northern tundra bears, they used magic to breed draconic traits into the beasts from the surface. The resulting creation has all the rage of an ursine and many of the defenses of a dragon, but remains quite stupid and easy for the [[Draaki|draaki]] to control. Domesticated not to attack their minders, the scavengers of the Underworld generally encourage these creatures to wander near their settlements as an impromptu and low-maintenance natural defense.
