***Batu Solidity.*** The rakasa batu's body exists at the same time in the Material and the Ethereal plane, in a state of constant flux between the two. Due to this unique state of everlasting change between the planes, rakasa batu cannot grapple or be grappled and have advantage on all escape checks.

At will: meld into stone, speak with animals, spike growth, stone shape

1/day each: earthquake

If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions.  For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate spell, but the spell has a “self only”  restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells.  If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them."]

## Description
*Though at first this creature seems to be an earth elemental, you notice part of its body phase out of existence and back in again, as if it were made of interdimensional sand.*

These mysterious entities first appeared along the Amber Roads shortly before the Confluence, blocking certain passages in an attempt to curb the destruction soon to wreak havoc across the interplanar transitway.

Their efforts were for naught, but the creatures found spiritual kinship with dwarves, in particular the [[Zwerc|zwerc]]—rakasa batu emissaries can now be found in virtually every one of their pocket demiplanes and, as time passes, more and more frequently in the endless caves of Aventyr. Encountering one of these creatures in the Underworld can be a dangerous proposition; they know much about the world around them and the veils between planes, but those who raise its ire can quickly find themselves buried underneath stone.

Rakasa batu are generally 13 feet tall or larger, but can weigh between 300 and 6000 pounds.
