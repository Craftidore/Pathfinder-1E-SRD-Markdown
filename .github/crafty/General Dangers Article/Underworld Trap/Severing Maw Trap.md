# Severing Maw Trap
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*

This primitive device is as simple as it is insidious and deadly. Unlike a bear trap, a maw trap is designed to outright kill whatever happens upon it, severing whatever limb is caught within.

## Conditions
The DC to spot most severing maw traps is 15. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools can trigger the severing maw harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any weapon or tool that is at least 3 foot long. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

## Effects
Upon triggering the trap, it makes a melee attack with a +13 bonus. The target hit takes 15 (2d8+6) points of piercing damage and scores a critical hit on a roll of 17 or higher. Creatures hit are restrained until their limb has been freed from the trap. The teeth of countless creatures (and often the jaws of [[Kraidyl|kraidyl]]) are used with numerous tendons to create a powerful spring anchored into the ground with wedges of bone. Prying open the jaws or pulling the bones from the ground requires a DC 15 Strength check, as many of the tendons snap apart when the maw trap strikes. On a critical hit, the trap severs the limb if the target fails a Constitution saving throw against DC 15. A limb thus severed can be reattached if the creature receives a DC 18 Wisdom (Medicine) check and a *cure* spell or similar magic within a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 2 rounds). Targets that had their limb severed are obviously not restrained, but short of one limb and still need to open the trap to extract the limb and reattach it.
