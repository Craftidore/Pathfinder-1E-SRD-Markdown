# Darkbridge
## Overview
**Price:** Major artifact

**Body Slot:** —

**Caster Level:** 25th

**Aura:** Overwhelming; (DC 28) all schools

**Activation:** — and free (command)

**Weight:** —

This is a floating, 10-foot-diameter disc of alternating roiling magical energy and shadow. 

The power of the Darkbridge can be utilitized by any spellcaster within 30 feet who succeeds on a DC 30 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check before casting a spell. Multiple spellcasters can attempt this at the same time.

Anyone touching the surface of the disc takes 6d6 points of damage from raw (untyped) magical energy and gains 1d6 negative levels (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A spellcaster able to harness the energy of the Darkbridge gains several abilities. The spellcaster’s spells are treated as if cast with the Shadow Weave Magic feat even the caster does not normally have access to the Shadow Weave. This allows the caster’s spells to function even in areas of dead magic.

The Darkbridge can also be used to cast spells accurately even in the auras of faerzress, other magic-distorting fields, and magically dead areas such as an *[[Antimagic Field (Spell)|antimagic field]]*. In addition spells cast through the Darkbridge are at +2 caster level and the save DC increases by 2. 

A spellcaster who succeeds on a DC 45 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check within 30 feet of the Darkbridge can cause it to move in the same manner as a *sphere of annihilation* (DMG 279). Only one spellcaster can control the Darkbridge in this way. Another spellcaster can attempt to wrest away control of the Darkbridge just as described in the DMG, but must succeed on his own DC 45 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] check first.

It is possible that the Darkbridge has other untapped powers waiting to be discovered. 

**Additional Powers:**

A spellcaster who succeeds on a DC 45 [[Spellcraft (Skill)|Spellcraft]] and a DC 45 [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (Arcana) while physically touching the Darkbridge is considered to have mastered it. Doing this grants the following abilities and powers:

Mastering the Darkbridge prevents other spellcasters from tapping into the powers of the Darkbridge until such time as the present master of the Darkbridge is completely destroyed (not merely dead but completely destroyed, body and spirit; since there have been several undead masters of it over the eons).

Mastering the Darkbridge allows the caster to spontaneously apply any metamagic feats he knows to his spells without increasing their level or casting time. This is done as the spell is cast and not when it is prepared.

***Lore:*** Characters who have ranks in [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (arcana) or [[Knowledge (Skill)|Knowledge]] (history) can research the Darkbridge to learn more about it. When a character makes a successful check, the following lore is revealed.

*Arcana or Planes DC 25:* This artifact comes from an alternate Prime Material Plane, there it was created on a world known as Toril.

*Arcana or History DC 30:* The damaged and corrupted remains of ancient Synod’s mythallar still exists as an artifact of raw magical energy inhabited by the spirit of a unique sharn consisting of the competing personalities of Augathra the Mad, the Dark Diviner Shar Cormrael, and the phaerimm Xeris.

*Arcana or Religion DC 35:* The unique creature within it was actually created through the machinations of the goddess Shar.

*Arcana DC 40:* While attempting its destruction (28 Tarsakh, 1385 DR) through the simultaneous casting of 3 separate *wishes*, a party of adventurers accidently caused the Darkbridge to be transported almost 5,000 years into the past and shifted onto the Plane of Shadows.

*Arcana DC 50:* It was discovered there by the savant Evard Neper (Wizard 5). Decades of study resulted in his transformation first into a shade and then into what would later become known as a [[Suel Lich (Template)|Suel lich]].

**Prerequisites:** Major artifact.

**Cost to Create:** Major artifact.
