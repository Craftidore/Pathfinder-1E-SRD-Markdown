# Blackaxe
## Overview
### Blackaxe

**Blackaxe** 

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th 

**Slot** none; **Weight** 50 lbs. 

**DESCRIPTION** 

*Blackaxe* is a Huge *+5 plant [[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]] greataxe* which is considered epic and can penetrate epic damage reduction. Virulent acid constantly seeps from its blade, dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, *Blackaxe* deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute, the weapon’s wielder can use *[[Heal (Spell)|heal]]* on herself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with *Blackaxe*, causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call *Blackaxe* to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as *Blackaxe* is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While *Blackaxe* is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature’s location and condition (as via the *[[Discern Location (Spell)|discern location]]* and *[[Status (Spell)|status]]* spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder’s senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating *Blackaxe* as if it were the source of the spell-like ability. Each time Treerazer does so, *Blackaxe*’s wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to avoid being [[Staggered|staggered]] for 1 round from the flow of power. These spell-like abilities trigger during the wielder’s turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the wielder’s actions in that round. 

**DESTRUCTION** 

In order to destroy *Blackaxe*, the weapon must be used against a powerful magical tree, and while the sap on the blade is still fresh it must then be used to sever one of the demon lord Cyth-V’sug’s many fungoid limbs. Doing so causes *Blackaxe* to explode in a burst of obsidian shrapnel and acid that deals 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of piercing damage to all within a 60-foot burst (DC 30 Reflex save for half ). 

**History** 

As a demon gains power, rebellion against its master is all but inevitable. Although Treerazer, the Lord of the Blasted Tarn, long served the demon lord Cyth-V’sug (said by many to have been Treerazer’s father), in time Treerazer rankled at this servitude. He carved *Blackaxe* himself from strange stones deep in the foundations of Cyth-V’sug’s Abyssal realm, intending to use the weapon to assassinate his master and assume control of the realm. Yet the materials of *Blackaxe* could not harm Cyth-V’sug, for having come from a realm that the demon lord created, the material was in a sense part of the Prince of the Blasted Heath himself. When Cyth- V’sug banished Treerazer, the traitor still clutched *Blackaxe* in his talons, its blade dripping (as it does to this day) with Cyth-V’sug’s foul acidic ichor. The weapon has aided Treerazer greatly in his crusade against Kyonin, and many are that nation’s fortifications that bear deep, pitted scars from the weapon’s wicked blade. 

**Ramifications** 

As the favored weapon of an otherworldly marauder, *Blackaxe* carries with it the will and corruption of the Abyss. Any who claim the weapon must contend with the following. 

**Treerazer’s Axe**: Regardless of who might be wielding it at a given moment, *Blackaxe* belongs to the nascent demon lord Treerazer. With a strong tie to his favored weapon, the demon can view and affect the world around the axe’s bearer, learning and sowing terror from any distance— especially through the use of his *[[Telekinesis|telekinesis]]*, *[[Wall of Thorns (Spell)|wall of thorns]]*, and summon demons abilities. Yet the greatest threat often manifests in Treerazer’s ability to call *Blackaxe* back to him under nearly any circumstances. The demon delights in watching a foe use his blade only to summon it back when the wielder faces dire peril. 

**Trophy of Ruin**: Should Treerazer be defeated, many would seek to claim his dreaded weapon. Chief among them would be the nascent demon lord’s demonic minions and rivals, eager to capture the remnants of the infamous fiend’s rule. The elves of Kyonin would also go to great lengths to see the weapon safely secured if not destroyed, *Blackaxe* being the symbol of a centuries-old blight upon their nation. But most covetous of *Blackaxe* will always be Treerazer himself, who—as the elves can attest—has avoided and feigned death countless times, only to reemerge from Tanglebriar when least expected.
