# Ring of Sorcerers
## Overview
*This beautifully crafted gold ring is shaped like a*

*serpent biting its own tail. Its eyes are tiny emeralds.*

**Aura** overwhelming divination and transmutation

(DC 25); **CL** 21st

**Slot** finger; **Weight** —

**DESCRIPTION**

The origin of the *ring of sorcerers* is lost to time,

forgotten by even those scholars best versed in

arcane lore. What is known is that when placed

on a sorcerer’s finger, it fills the spellcaster’s mind

with startling images of a gold dragon and compels

the wearer to establish a place of worship for this

dragon (DC 18 Will negates).

If you have at least one level of sorcerer, you derive all of the

following supernatural benefits when you wear this ring.

*Detect Sorcery:* As a standard action, you can cast out your senses

to detect the presence or absence of a sorcerer. The GM secretly

makes a DC 15 Spellcraft check on your behalf and if the check

succeeds, you discern the presence of any sorcerer within 100 feet. If

a sorcerer casts a spell within this range, you automatically identify

the caster as a sorcerer.

*Boost Spell:* As a swift action, you can increase the save DC of a single

spell you cast by +1, or +2 if the target is another sorcerer. You may

use this ability once per encounter.

*Buttressed against Sorcery:* You gain a +4 insight bonus on saves against

sorcerer spells.

*Metamagic Sorcery:* Up to five times per day, you may apply the effects

of a metamagic feat you have to a sorcerer spell you cast without

modifying the spell’s casting time. This ability allows you to make

use of the Quicken Spell metamagic feat.

**DESTRUCTION**

The *ring of sorcerers* can be destroyed by a great wyrm gold dragon

sundering it.
