# Bile and Lashes
## Overview
*These gauntlets are simple oiled leather gloves. The left is stained with tarry black streaks, while the right is marked with cruel stripes, possibly from a scourge.*

**Aura** overwhelming transmutation (DC 28); **CL** 27th

**Slot** hands; **Weight** —

**DESCRIPTION**

When you don both gloves, they create a pool of unformed potential that you may harness in several ways. The pool represents a total +10 bonus that you may split between an enhancement bonus on attack and damage with *Lashes,* a resistance bonus to all saving throws, or a deflection bonus to AC. As a free action at the start of your turn, you may allocate these bonuses wherever you like and the effects last until the start of your next turn.

Additionally, you may invoke the power of *Lashes* as a swift action and make a single melee touch against a creature you threaten. If you hit, the glove deals damage as if you had successfully hit the target with a *[[Disintegrate (Spell)|disintegrate]]* spell. Alternatively, you may invoke the power of *Bile* to throw up a *[[Wall of Force (Spell)|wall of force]]* as the spell. Each use of either ability deals 2 points of Constitution damage to you.

While wearing the gloves, you will never willingly take them off. If they are stolen from you, you must hunt down and kill the thieves as if under the effects of a *[[Geas_Quest (Spell)|geas/quest]]* spell.

**LEGENDS**

While chronicled in arcane scrolls and captains’ logbooks since the beginning of history, the exact age of *bile and lashes* is unknown. No one is quite certain about from where they came or for what purpose, though in every recorded instance, death heralds their appearance **(DC 25 Knowledge—history)**.

**DESTRUCTION**

The only way to truly destroy *bile and lashes* is to first cast *[[Remove Curse (Spell)|remove curse]]* on them by a caster with at caster level of 15 or higher. Within 10 rounds of the spell’s completion, the items must be swallowed by a kraken.
