# Reaverbane
## Overview
*T he blade of this brilliant weapon is forged of blue steel and etched*

*with holy symbols and prayers dedicated to the Justice God. Its*

*handle is wrapped with platinum wire and the pommel is a platinum*

*eagle’s head. T he crossbar continues the same theme, being two*

*eagles, wings held close to their bodies, necks craning forth, and*

*beaks open as if screaming.*

**Aura** overwhelming abjuration, divination, and evocation (DC 25);

**CL** 21st

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lb.

**DESCRIPTION**

This feared weapon has been the end of many a buccaneer’s career.

*Reaverbane* is a *+5 axiomatic thundering longsword.* In addition,

while wielding this weapon, the owner may cast the following

spells each once per day (caster level 20th): *dictum, magic circle*

*against chaos,* and *order’s wrath.* Finally, *Reaverbane* continuously

enables you to sense deception and lies as if you were under the

effects of a *discern lies* spell.

**LEGENDS**

*Reaverbane* was commissioned by a league of merchants in the early

days before Freeport’s founding and was put to work defending

their ships against the buccaneers and pirates that plagued the

Serpent’s Teeth **(DC 25 Knowledge—history)**. Many a corsair

of the day tasted *Reaverbane’s* edge—until a distant ancestor of

Xavier Gordon captured the weapon from the merchant fleet

**(DC 30)**. Up until recently, the weapon decorated the wall of

the Captains’ Council chamber and barely anyone outside of the

Council was even aware of its existence or significance. When

Marilise became the new Sea Lord, she claimed the weapon as

a badge of office. She rarely brings the weapon out, but in times

of great need, or when she needs to make an impression, she’s

sure to have it close by.

**DESTRUCTION**

A chaotically–aligned creature can destroy *reaverbane* by coating it

in the blood of a lawful god then melting it in a kiln willingly lit

by the fire of a phoenix.
