# Silver Sphere
## Overview
*This perfectly smooth two-foot-radius sphere is wrought of solid*

*silver.*

**Aura** overwhelming abjuration and transmutation (DC 27); **CL** 25th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 50 lb.

**DESCRIPTION**

The *sphere* continuously radiates *magic circle against evil*. When you

carry this device, it adds all of the spells of the Good and Water

domains to your spell lists and if you prepare your spells in advance,

you can sacrifice a prepared spell to cast one of these spells provided

the spell is the same level or lower. Finally, the *silver sphere* grants

a +10 competence bonus on all Diplomacy checks made when

interacting with creatures of the reptilian subtype.

**LEGENDS**

The *silver sphere* was found deep beneath the sea, lying amidst the

shattered ruins of an ancient Valossan city **(DC 25 Knowledge—**

**arcana)**. A triton explorer came across the item first years ago, but

lost it after his encampment was overrun by a vampiric kraken **(DC**

**30)**. Some claim this device is a gift from Yig, but those familiar

with the snake god know this cannot be true given the aura of

good that surrounds this powerful relic **(DC 35)**.

**DESTRUCTION**

If a *silver sphere* is carefully etched with symbols anathema to aquatic

creatures—such as depictions of fire elementals, drought–stricken

lands, etc—it turns into water, losing its form and magic. Such

etching requires an appropriate DC 50 Craft check (such as Craft

(jewelry) or Craft (silversmith)) and one month’s time.
