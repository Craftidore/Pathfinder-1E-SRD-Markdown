# The Lawgiver
## Overview
This galleon is perhaps the most capable vessel in the Multiverse. 

Created by the Archmage Ilbern Jascar of Sobhrach in the spring of CY 692 for an unknown client, he hired a master woodcarver to carve an exquisitely detailed model of a great galleon of strange lines and design from the wood of the Llohar tree. 

His notes on the construction and the command words for the final ship's various magical powers are rumored to have been recorded in his private journals and spellbooks.

He is said to have been paid in an immense quantity (several rooms full) of coins, gems and magical items as well as several dozen unique spells.

The figurehead of the craft is a stunning likeness of the goddess Wee Jas and this figurehead was blessed by a matriarch of that faith. This blessing (cf. *enhance crew)* extends to all lawfully-aligned members of the ship's company.

The Lawgiver is 240 feet in length and 40 feet wide. Her forecastle rises 20 feet above the main deck, while her stern castle towers 40 feet above it.

The exterior hull of the Lawgiver is clad in an inch thick layer of obdurium. All of its wooden components are a single living piece of Llohar wood. This wood is as hard as steel and still living. Each day that the Llohar wood has water (fresh or salt) and exposure to 4 hours of sunlight, the ship 'heals' 50 points of damage.

The craft has no need for a normal crew, as Ilbern used two permanent (cf. *permanency)* castings of the *unseen crew* spell to insure she would always be well crewed. This phantom crew may only be commanded by the ship's captain or those who have been entered into the ship's articles as officers.
