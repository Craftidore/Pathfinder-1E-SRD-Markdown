# The Infinity Wand
## Overview
The *Gem of Souls*

The *Wand of Stars (Rod of the Gods)*

The *Stone of Life*

This magical item appears to be a simple platinum bead one inch in diameter without ornamentation. 

This *stone* enable the user to cast *[[Resurrection (Spell)|resurrection]]* once per week on a single target. The user simply holds the *stone* in one hand and touches the slain living being to be *resurrected* with the other. The power is not without cost, however, and each use drains 1 point of Constitution from the whoever commands the *stone.* The lost Constitution point can be restored only a *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]**, g[[Restoration, Greater (Spell)|reater restoration]], [[Miracle (Spell)|miracle]]* or *[[Wish (Spell)|wish]] spell.*

The *Stone of Life* does not radiate magic
