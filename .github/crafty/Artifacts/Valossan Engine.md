# Valossan Engine
## Overview
*This massive construct is about the size of a house and constructed*

*from stone and metal, with dozens of arms tipped with tools and*

*powerful tracks for legs.*

**Aura** overwhelming transmutation (DC 30); **CL** 30th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 5 tons

**DESCRIPTION**

If you present the *Valossan engine* with building plans, the *engine* roars

to life and constructs the building, vessel, or nonmagical item depicted therein. One day of work

by the *engine* is equal to the work of a thousand humans laboring

for a year. There is no limit to the size of what the Engine can construct, but after a week of work, the *Valossan engine* powers

down for one month.

**LEGENDS**

This relic of Valossa’s golden age sank beneath the waves during the

cataclysm, but legends tell of its use by undersea races to construct

some of the vast palaces and walled cities of their underwater realms

**(DC 25 Knowledge—arcana)**.

**DESTRUCTION**

The *Valossan engine* can only be destroyed by presenting it with plans

to dismantle itself. Creating these plans requires a Knowledge

(engineering) check DC 50 followed by a Craft (blueprint) check

of DC 50.
