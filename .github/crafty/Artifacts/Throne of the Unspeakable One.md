# Throne of the Unspeakable One
## Overview
**Aura** overwhelming transmutation (DC 30); **CL** 30th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1,000 lb.

**DESCRIPTION**

*A monstrous idol to the Unspeakable One tops this massive ziggurat.*

Whenever an intelligent creature is sacrificed on the altar and its

blood greedily consumed by the stone, the throne emanates waves

of magical energy out to a 2-mile radius. All chaotic and evil spells

are empowered and maximized as if affected by the Empower Spell

and Maximize Spell metamagic feats. Additionally, charged magic

items (staffs and wands) gain a number of virtual charges equal to the

total Hit Dice of the creature sacrificed on the altar. These charges

vanish if the item is taken out of the range of the altar’s influence

or after 24 hours. Clerics and other divine spellcasters dedicated to

the Unspeakable One cast spells at +2 caster levels. Finally, the save

DC to resist gaining Insanity Points increases by +5 for all creatures

and effects within the radius of its malign influence.

Once activated, the *throne of the Unspeakable One* remains active for

24 hours.

**DESTRUCTION**

The *throne of the Unspeakable One* can be destroyed by being sundered

with a titan’s maul wielded by another creature. The titan must freely

allow the use of his maul without knowing the purpose.
