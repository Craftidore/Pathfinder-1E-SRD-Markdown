KORIANA’S BLADE

SLOT none CL 17th WEIGHT 4 lbs.

AURA strong abjuration

When the brave knight-commander Koriana of Zimar fell within the ranks of the Fifth Army of Exploration, her remains were returned home—along with her sundered steel shield. Her brother Tadric, distraught, focused only on creating a fitting legacy for Koriana’s daughter. Devoting himself to the study of metalcraft and magical crafting, he eventually turned a shard of his sister’s shield into a protective longsword. Though records indicate that Tadric’s niece took up the sword and joined the military, her full tale and the blade’s fate were lost to history. Rumors that she went into clandestine service for the royal family still circulate.

Koriana’s Blade is a +2 defending longsword. It’s strangely curved, betraying its origins, and has five gemstones in its pommel. Four are broken, but the white gem in the center is intact. Once per day, the wielder can trigger this gemstone as an immediate action to absorb and negate all darts targeting her from a magic missile spell.

When the wielder transfers at least 1 point of the weapon’s enhancement bonus to her AC using the defending special ability, she also chooses one creature other than herself within 10 feet to gain a +1 bonus to AC until the wielder’s next turn. This bonus is always +1, regardless of how much of the weapon’s bonus the wielder transfers to her AC.

First Triumph: One of the gemstones on the sword’s pommel (determined randomly) repairs itself. Once repaired, a gem can be activated as an immediate action once per day to make the sword’s wielder immune to a single effect of a particular type, as described below, just before she would be affected by it. She must choose to activate the gem before attempting any save or other defense against the effect. The black gem protects against negative energy, the red gem protects against fire effects,the pink gem protects against mind-affecting effects, and the green gem protects against poison effects.

Second Triumph: Koriana’s Blade is a +3 defending longsword. Another randomly chosen gem repairs itself.

Third Triumph: Another randomly chosen gem repairs itself. The wielder of the sword gains a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects of any type corresponding to one of the sword’s functioning gems.

Fourth Triumph: Koriana’s Blade is a +4 defending longsword. The final gem repairs itself.
