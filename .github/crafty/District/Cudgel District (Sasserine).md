# Cudgel District (Sasserine)
## Overview
### Taskerhill family crest

Cudgel District is primarily a residential district. Due to the vigilance of the local watch and the church of St. Cuthbert, it’s also the safest district in [[Sasserine]]. The citizens of Cudgel District know this, yet they are not a so􀈘 people; they remain ever vigilant to the threat of attack from without in the form of bullywugs or pirates, or from within in the form of thieves and traitors.

Cudgel District’s representative nobles are the Taskerhills. Although they’re hardly the oldest noble family in [[Sasserine]], the Taskerhills are easily the richest. Their ownership of Thunder River Lumber has ensured a constant inflow of profit for hundreds of years. The current patriarch of this noble family is a man named Kalmadar Taskerhill. A recent scandal involving his older brother, a noble of the nearby city of Cauldron, has done some unfortunate damage to the family name, and Kalmadar’s primary concern today is to repair this damage in any way he can. As a result, he’s been spending a lot of time away from home visiting his brother’s family.

Although St. Cuthbert’s the official religion of Cudgel District, a smaller shrine has been attracting a fair amount of attention lately. This is the mysterious Church of the Whirling Fury, located in northern Cudgel District on the aptly named Fury Street. The front doors of this church bear a set of chains fixed with a padlock, and there are no windows in the church’s stone walls. Locals say they’ve seen people entering and exiting the church using silver keys to unlock the chains, but no one’s been brave enough to investigate further. Rumors of demon worship, live sacrifices, and worse circulate about the church, yet the priests of St. Cuthbert remain curiously close-lipped about the matter. Father Ruphus Laro of St. Cuthbert says only that he’s keeping his eye on the Church of Whirling Fury, but that it does not pose a threat to the city.

The people of Cudgel District are a watchful, laconic lot. They have little patience or tolerance for the rough and coarse lifestyle led by most adventurers. Merchants, innkeepers, and bartenders in Cudgel District o�ften charge up to 200% over normal prices for customers dressed like adventurers (typified by openly wearing weapons or armor).

**City Watch**

In some ways, the Cudgel Watch are similar to the Champion’s Watch. Both are closely tied to their district’s official faith (in this case, St. Cuthbert), both present regular patrols in uniform, and both are fiercely loyal. Yet the Cudgel Watch is more concerned with preventing criminal activity than any other watch in [[Sasserine]], to the extent that they sometimes overstep their bounds. Tales of wrongful imprisonment abound here, although the Cudgel Watch maintains that such cases are rare as a result. The citizens of Cudgel District are the least flamboyant and outgoing of the people of [[Sasserine]], making the district a draw for those not as interested in the bustle of city life. Criminal activity in Cudgel District is more prevalent along the borders between Cudgel and [[Shadowshore (Sasserine)|Shadowshore]] and [[Merchant District (Sasserine)|Merchant District]]. Of the watches, the Cudgel Watch is the most likely to pursue criminals into other districts or meddle with another district’s watch affairs, making them the least-liked district watches.

**Citizens**

If you’re from Cudgel District, it’s possible you’ve never left [[Sasserine]]. Indeed, it’s possible you’ve never even left Cudgel District. The outer world is a place of mystery and perhaps fear for you, yet you may be equally intrigued by its lures. You likely worship St. Cuthbert, or perhaps Kord. Another church exists in your district, the Church of the Whirling Fury, but chances are that even if you’re curious about what they have to offer, you haven’t figured them out… yet. If you’re a ranger, your favored enemy is probably humanoid (humans), as you’ve learned that humanity has the greatest capacity for evil and treachery. Of the seven districts, the citizens of Cudgel are the least likely to seek an adventurous lifestyle. Those who do become adventurers are viewed by family and neighbors as black sheep.
