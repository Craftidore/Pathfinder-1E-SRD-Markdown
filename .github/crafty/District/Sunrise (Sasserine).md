# Sunrise (Sasserine)
## Overview
**Urban Region**: District
#Utility/District

### Picture (SimpKnowlern family crestle)

Like [[Cudgel District (Sasserine)|Cudgel District]], Sunrise is primarily residential. Yet the citizens of Sunrise are generally a bit better-off than their neighbors, in no small part due to the fact that many of them have stakes in the numerous plantations that dot the region surrounding [[Sasserine]].

Sunrise’s representative noble family is the Knowlern family. Unlike the nobles of the other districts, the Knowlerns are elves. Lord Aniphastus Knowlern and his family have taken the preservation of the region’s wildlands to heart, and the foundation of Sunrise’s Standing Stone Park is one of their proudest achievements.

**City Watch**

Like [[Cudgel District (Sasserine)|Cudgel District]], Sunrise is primarily residences, although the presence of the lumberyard and proximity to the [[Azure District (Sasserine)|Azure District]] make its edges a bit more active. The Sunrise Watch are affiliated with the church of Pelor, but for the most part are left􀈘 to their own devices in keeping the district safe. Their organization is the largest of the seven watches, and as a result it’s more difficult for the commanders to keep everything in control. Corruption is fairly common here, yet the guards can generally be trusted to do the right thing.
