**Special Abilities**

**Bleed (Ex)** Any living creature damaged by Umad’s claws continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. A critical hit does not multiply this bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check.

**Change Shape (Su)** Umad’s natural form is that of a donkey-hoofed undead shaitan. He can also assume the form of a hyena or any humanoid. Umad remains in one form until he chooses to assume another. A *true seeing* spell, however, always reveals his undead form. See *Dark Markets, A Guide to Katapesh* for complete details.

**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoid slain by Umad becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise. Likewise, a slain janni or genie becomes a ghul. Blessing or destroying the body (such as with acid or fire) prevents this reanimation.

**Cursed Claws (Ex)** Umad’s wickedly curved claws are as hard as steel and count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

**Genie-Kin (Ex)** For all effects related to race, Umad is considered a genie even though he is no longer an outsider.

**Metalmorph (Su)** As a standard action, Umad may warp and deform any one metal object within 20 feet. This functions like *warp wood*, but affects only metal objects that fail a DC 26 Fortitude save (attended objects use their wielder’s saves). Armor or shields lose half their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are rendered useless except as improvised clubs. The transformation lasts 1 minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. The save DC is Charisma based.

**Rend (Ex)** If Umad hits with both claw attacks, he latches onto his opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This automatically deals an extra 2d6+6 points of damage.

**Unholy Fortitude (Ex)** Umad gains bonus hit points equal to his Charisma modifier times his Hit Dice, and a bonus to his Fortitude saves equal to his Charisma modifier.

**Skills** Umad has a +4 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when following tracks. Umad has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 while climbing, even if rushed or threatened.

**Exceptional Stats** Umad is a hero of a past age. His ability scores were generated using 32 points, rather than the standard 25-point elite array. Additionally, his gear was determined as if he were a PC to account for his history and ancient victories. These advantages increase his total CR by 1.
