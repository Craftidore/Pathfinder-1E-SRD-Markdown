## Additional Details
**Ogre** (always spelled with quotes - "Ogre" - in the actual modules) is a human fighter. He was one of the adventurers who defeated the [Slave Lords](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Slave_Lords) in 580 [CY](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Common_Year). 

## **Appearance**
Ogre stands six feet tall, weighing 183 pounds, all of it muscle. He is a bull of a man, terrifyingly strong and enduring, though good-hearted. He is not very bright, but he means well.

## **Relationships**
Ogre's companions during his time fighting the Slave Lords were [Elwita](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Elwita), [Freda](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Freda&action=edit&redlink=1), [Karraway](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Karraway&action=edit&redlink=1), [Blodgett](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Blodgett&action=edit&redlink=1), [Dread Delgath](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dread_Delgath&action=edit&redlink=1), [Eljayess](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Eljayess&action=edit&redlink=1), and [Kayen Telva](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Kayen_Telva&action=edit&redlink=1).

## **History**
Ogre was captured by the Slave Lord [Stalman Klim](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stalman_Klim&action=edit&redlink=1) in 580 CY and was, with his companions, left naked to die in a maze. Together, they managed to escape. During their escape, the city of [Suderham](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Suderham&action=edit&redlink=1) (the Slave Lords' headquarters) was consumed by a volcano and the party made it back to the [Free City of Greyhawk](https://wait-wtf.com/wiki/index.php/Free_City_of_Greyhawk), where they were acclaimed as heroes.

## **Creative origins**
Ogre was one of the pregenerated characters in the original tournaments that the *Slave Lords* modules (A1-A4) were based on.
