**Elf Racial Traits**

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, –2 Constitution:** Elves are nimble, both in body and mind, but their form is frail.

**Medium:** Elves are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Normal Speed:** Elves have a base speed of 30 feet.

**Darkvision:** Though uncommon, some groups of elves are born with darkvision, rather than low-light vision. In many cases this is taken as a sign of a drow in the elf ’s ancestry, and can lead to persecution within the elf ’s home community. Elves with this racial trait gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet, but also gain sensitivity to light and are [[Dazzled|dazzled]] in areas of bright light or within the radius of a *[[Daylight (Spell)|daylight]]* spell. This racial trait replaces low-light vision.

**Elven Immunities:** Elves are immune to magic sleep effects and gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.

**Elven Speed:** An elf with this racial trait may draw a single longbow, [[Longsword|longsword]], [[Shortbow|shortbow]], [[Rapier|rapier]], or any weapon with “elven” in the name as a free action, or as part of an initiative check (requiring no action). This racial trait replaces the elven magic trait.

**Source:** Amazing Races: Elves! (Abandoned Arts), pg. 3

**Keen Senses:** Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] checks.

**Weapon Familiarity:** Elves are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name as a martial weapon.

**Languages:** Elves begin play speaking Common and Elven. Elves with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Celestial, Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.

**Fighter**

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

**Role**: Fighters excel at combat—defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

**Class Skills**

The fighter’s class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

**Class Features**

The following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”

Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.

**Bravery (Ex)**: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.

**Armor Training (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.

In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

**Weapon Training (Ex)**: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.

A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.

Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups):

*Axes*: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, heavy pick, light pick, orc double axe, and throwing axe.

*Blades, Heavy*: bastard sword, elven curve blade, falchion, greatsword, longsword, scimitar, scythe, and two-bladed sword.

*Blades, Light*: dagger, kama, kukri, rapier, sickle, starknife, and short sword.

*Bows*: composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, and shortbow.

*Close*: gauntlet, heavy shield, light shield, punching dagger, sap, spiked armor, spiked gauntlet, spiked shield, and unarmed strike.

*Crossbows*: hand crossbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, heavy repeating crossbow, and light repeating crossbow.

*Double*: dire flail, dwarven urgrosh, gnome hooked hammer, orc double axe, quarterstaff, and two-bladed sword.

*Flails*: dire flail, flail, heavy flail, morningstar, nunchaku, spiked chain, and whip.

*Hammers*: club, greatclub, heavy mace, light hammer, light mace, and warhammer.

*Monk*: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and unarmed strike.

*Natural*: unarmed strike and all natural weapons, such as bite, claw, gore, tail, and wing.

*Pole Arms*: glaive, guisarme, halberd, and ranseur.

*Spears*: javelin, lance, longspear, shortspear, spear, and trident.

*Thrown*: blowgun, bolas, club, dagger, dart, half ling sling staff, javelin, light hammer, net, shortspear, shuriken, sling, spear, starknife, throwing axe, and trident.

**Armor Mastery (Ex)**: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)**: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.

**Swyft (Template)**

Swyfts are creatures that possess heigntened speed. Some inherit their powers from quickling parents or distant swyft ancestors, but others seem to become swyfts spontaneously. Such creatures are often individuals in need of great speed to flee a foe or reach a loved one in time to prevent tragedy. Most count their gift of speed as a great blessing at first, but they soon learn to curse it when they see their lives rapidly passing by.

Swyfts, like quicklings, are prime examples of the old adage, “Live fast and die young.” In fact, they age twice times as fast as normal for their kinds. Elf swyfts die of old age just as their companions are old enough to be married, and human swyfts rarely live past fifty or so. Knowledge of their impending doom, however, drives many swyfts to accomplish great deeds in the small amount of time they have.

Creating a Swyft

“Swyft” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A swyft creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** Same as the base creature +1

**Initiative:** A swyft gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks.

**Armor Class:** A swyft gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

**Weaknesses:** A swyft has the following weakness:

*Aging Vulnerability (Ex)* A swyft takes 50% more damage from aging effects, including the number of years aged.

**Speed:** Each of the base creature’s speeds is doubled. If the base creature has a fly speed, its maneuverability increases one category (maximum *perfect*).

**Special Attacks:** A swyft retains all of the base creature’s special attacks and gains the following.

*Rapid Actions (Ex):* A swyft gains one extra attack or move action each round. This does not stack with other *haste* effects.

**Abilities:** Dex +4.

**Skills:** A swyft creature gains a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks and a +5 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks.

**Feats:** A swyft creature gains Dodge and Quick Draw as bonus feats.

**Special Qualities:** A swyft gains the following.

*Rapid Aging (Ex)* A swyft ages 2 years for every 1 year that passes.

**Spear Fighter (Fighter)** 

The spear is one of the oldest weapons known to most humanoid races, and no weapon has seen as much use across the different continents of Golarion. One of the oldest spear-fighting styles originates in Vudra, where many martial arts traditions consider the spear to be the ultimate weapon. 

**Class Skills:** A spear fighter adds Acrobatics to his list of class skills and removes Ride as a class skill. 

This alters the fighter’s class skills. 

**Armor Proficiency:** A spear fighter is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields. Instead, he gains Dodge as a bonus feat, even if he doesn’t fulfill the prerequisites, but he can’t use this feat while wearing heavy armor or using a shield. 

This alters the fighter’s armor proficiencies. 

**Balanced Stride (Ex):** At 2nd level, the spear fighter gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he has beyond 2nd. 

This replaces bravery. 

**Spear Parry (Ex):** At 3rd level, a spear fighter learns to parry his opponents’ attacks with his spear. This functions as a swashbuckler’s opportune parry and riposte deed (*Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide* 57) except as noted below. The spear fighter must use a weapon from the spears weapon group to perform the parry. He doesn’t need panache to parry an attack or to make an attack against a creature whose attack he has parried; instead, he takes a cumulative –4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts) until the end of his next turn. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, the penalty decreases by 1. At 19th level, a spear fighter can use spear parry without penalty. 

This replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4, and armor mastery. 

**Weapon Training (Ex):** At 5th level, a spear fighter must choose the spears weapon group for the weapon training class feature. 

**Weapon Mastery (Ex):** At 20th level, a spear fighter must choose a weapon from the spears weapon group for his weapon mastery class feature.
