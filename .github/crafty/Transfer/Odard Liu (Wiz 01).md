Strongheart halfling racial adjustments

Racial Traits

+2 Dexterity, –2 Strength: Strongheart halflings are quick, agile, and good with ranged weapons, but they are small and therefore not as strong as other humanoids.

Small: As a Small creature, a strongheart halfling gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

Strongheart halfling base land speed is 20 feet.

Halflings gain one extra feat at 1st level, because they have a strong drive to compete and many opportunities to practice their skills.

xxx +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, and Stealth checks. Strongheart halflings are agile, surefooted, and athletic.

xxx +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings. Throwing and slinging stones is a universal sport among Strongheart halflings, and they develop especially good aim.

+2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Strongheart halflings have keen ears.

Alternate Racial Trait: Strongheart halfling

Darkvision: Strongheart halflings can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
