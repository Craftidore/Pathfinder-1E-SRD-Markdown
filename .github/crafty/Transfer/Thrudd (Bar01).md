### Archetypes, Classes and Templates
**Barbarian**

For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

**Role:** Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.

**Alignment:** Any nonlawful.

**Hit Die:** d12.

**Class Skills**

The barbarian’s class skills are [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]] (Dex), [[Climb (Skill)|Climb]] (Str), [[Craft (Skill)|Craft]] (Int), [[Handle Animal (Skill)|Handle Animal]] (Cha), [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), [[Perception (Skill)|Perception]] (Wis), [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]] (Dex), [[Survival (Skill)|Survival]] (Wis), and [[Swim (Skill)|Swim]] (Str).

**Class Features**

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Fast Movement (Ex):** A barbarian’s land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian’s land speed.

**Rage (Ex):** A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like *[[Bear's Endurance (Spell)|bear’s endurance]]*, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except [[Acrobatics (Skill)|Acrobatics]], [[Fly (Skill)|Fly]], [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]], and [[Ride (Skill)|Ride]]) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is [[Fatigued|fatigued]] after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while [[Fatigued|fatigued]] or [[Exhausted|exhausted]] but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls [[Unconscious|unconscious]], her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.

**Rage Powers (Ex):** As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

*Animal Fury (Ex):* While raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the barbarian’s full base attack bonus –5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 points of damage if Small) plus half the barbarian’s Strength modifier. A barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.

*[[Clear Mind (Ex)]]:* A barbarian may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The barbarian must take the second result, even if it is worse. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power. This power can only be used once per rage.

*[[Fearless Rage (Ex)]]:* While raging, the barbarian is immune to the [[Shaken|shaken]] and [[Frightened|frightened]] conditions. A barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this rage power.

*[[Guarded Stance (Ex)]]:* The barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class against melee attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarian’s current Constitution modifier (minimum 1). This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 

*[[Increased Damage Reduction (Ex)]]*: The barbarian’s damage reduction increases by 1/—. This increase is always active while the barbarian is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

*Internal Fortitude (Ex):* While raging, the barbarian is immune to the sickened and [[Nauseated|nauseated]] conditions. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

*Intimidating Glare (Ex):* The barbarian can make an [[Intimidate (Skill)|Intimidate]] check against one adjacent foe as a move action. If the barbarian successfully demoralizes her opponent, the foe is [[Shaken|shaken]] for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which the barbarian’s check exceeds the DC.

*Knockback (Ex):* Once per round, the barbarian can make a bull rush attempt against one target in place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage equal to the barbarian’s Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The barbarian does not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

*Low-Light Vision (Ex):* The barbarian’s senses sharpen and she gains low-light vision while raging.

*Mighty Swing (Ex):* The barbarian automatically confirms a critical hit. This power is used as an immediate action once a critical threat has been determined. A barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this power. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Moment of Clarity (Ex):* The barbarian does not gain any benefits or take any of the penalties from rage for 1 round. This includes the penalty to Armor Class and the restriction on what actions can be performed. This round still counts against her total number of rounds of rage per day. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Night Vision (Ex):* The barbarian’s senses grow incredibly sharp while raging and she gains darkvision 60 feet. A barbarian must have low-light vision as a rage power or a racial trait to select this rage power.

*No Escape (Ex):* The barbarian can move up to double her normal speed as an immediate action but she can only use this ability when an adjacent foe uses a withdraw action to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used the withdraw action. The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during this movement. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Powerful Blow (Ex):* The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on a single damage roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Quick Reflexes (Ex):* While raging, the barbarian can make one additional attack of opportunity per round. Raging Climber (Ex): When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Climb skill checks.

*Raging Leaper (Ex):* When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Acrobatics skill checks made to jump. When making a jump in this way, the barbarian is always considered to have a running start.

*Raging Swimmer (Ex):* When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Swim skill checks.

*Renewed Vigor (Ex):* As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8 points of damage + her Constitution modifier. For every four levels the barbarian has attained above 4th, this amount of damage healed increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 20th level. A barbarian must be at least 4th level before selecting this power. This power can be used only once per day and only while raging.

*Rolling Dodge (Ex):* The barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class against ranged attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarian’s current Constitution modif ier (minimum 1). This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

*Roused Anger (Ex):* The barbarian may enter a rage even if fatigued. While raging after using this ability, the barbarian is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this rage ends, the barbarian is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent raging.

*Scent (Ex):* The barbarian gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes.

*Strength Surge (Ex):* The barbarian adds her barbarian level on one Strength check or combat maneuver check, or to her Combat Maneuver Defense when an opponent attempts a maneuver against her. This power is used as an immediate action. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Superstition (Ex):* The barbarian gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws made to resist spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. While raging, the barbarian cannot be a willing target of any spell and must make saving throws to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.

*Surprise Accuracy (Ex):* The barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on one attack roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Swift Foot (Ex):* The barbarian gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus to her speed. This increase is always active while the barbarian is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its effects stack.

*Terrifying Howl (Ex):* The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl as a standard action. All shaken enemies within 30 feet must make a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) or be panicked for 1d4+1 rounds. Once an enemy has made a save versus terrifying howl (successful or not), it is immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must have the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.

*Unexpected Strike (Ex):* The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per rage. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

**Trap Sense (Ex):** At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

**Damage Reduction (Ex):** At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

**Greater Rage (Ex):** At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +3.

**Indomitable Will (Ex):** While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she also receives during her rage.

**Tireless Rage (Ex):** Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.

**Mighty Rage (Ex):** At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her Will saves increases to +4.

**Alternate Class Feature(s):**

#### Archetype(s)
**Jotunkin (Barbarian Archetype)**

The jotunkin are barbarians whose bloodlines contain a trace of giant. When these barbarians rage, their giantish heritage manifests itself in greater size and strength.

**Jotunrage (Su):** A jotunkin can call upon supernatural sources of strength and ferocity, granting him greater size and prowess. Starting at 1st level, a jotunkin can jotunrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can jotunrage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like* bear’s endurance*, do not increase the total number of rounds that a jotunkin can jotunrage per day. A jotunkin can enter jotunrage as a free action. The total number of rounds of jotunrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.

While in jotunrage, a barbarian increases in size by one size category. He gains a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. He also gains a +2 natural armor bonus. The increase to Constitution grants the jotunkin 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a jotunkin cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A jotunkin whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. If insufficient room is available for the growth, the jotunkin attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using his increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If he fails, he is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing him.

All equipment worn or carried by the jotunkin is similarly enlarged by the jotunrage. Melee weapons affected deal more damage (see Table: Medium/Large Weapon Damage). Other magical properties are not affected by this ability. Any enlarged item that leaves a jotunkin’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this ability.

A jotunkin can end his jotunrage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the jotunrage. A jotunkin cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a jotunkin falls unconscious, his jotunrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.

Jotunrage does not stack with magical effects that increase size.

This ability replaces rage.

**Fear’s Friend (Ex):** At 3rd level, a jotunkin gains a +1 competence bonus to Intimidate checks. These bonuses increase by +1 every three jotunkin levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). The jotunkin also receives an insight bonus to saves against fear effects equal to one-half the competence bonus to Intimidate checks (drop fractions).

This ability replaces damage reduction.

**Greater Jotunrage (Su):** At 11th level, when a jotunkin enters jotunrage, his size bonus to Strength increases to +6 and his natural armor bonus increases to +3.

This ability replaces greater rage.

**Jotunrage Form (Su):** At 14th level, when a jotunkin enters jotunrage, he may choose to assume the form of a frost giant, fire giant, hill giant, or stone giant. Once he assumes his new form, he gains the following abilities (instead of those normally granted by jotunrage): +6 size bonus to Strength, -2 size penalty to Dexterity, +4 size bonus to Constitution, +4 natural armor bonus, low-light vision, rock catching, and rock throwing (range 60 feet, 2d6 damage). If the giant has immunity or resistance to any elements, the jotunkin gains resistance 20 to those elements. If the giant has vulnerability to an element, the jotunkin gains that vulnerability.

Every round in jotunrage form counts as 2 rounds against the jotunkin’s total number of rounds per day for jotunrage. In all other respects, jotunrage form is the same as jotunrage.

This ability replaces indomitable will.

**Mighty Jotunrage (Su):** At 20th level, when a jotunkin enters jotunrage or jotunrage form, his size bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by a further +2, and his natural armor bonus increases by a further +1.

This ability replaces mighty rage.

N.B. The 17th-level ability tireless rage applies to jotunrage but not to jotunrage form.

**Titan Mauler (Barbarian Archetype)**

In lands overrun by giants, dragons, and other hulking beasts, entire fellowships of barbarians hone tactics and traditions with one purpose—to bring low these massive foes. While her enemies’ size makes the creatures strong, the titan mauler is even stronger, taking up weapons from her fallen foes that no lesser warrior can lift, and using them when she beseeches the spirits to grant her increased size and greater ferocity against her titanic foes.

**Big Game Hunter (Ex)**: A titan mauler gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC in melee with creatures larger than themselves. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Jotungrip (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a titan mauler may choose to wield a two-handed weapon in one hand with a –2 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. The weapon must be appropriately sized for her, and it is treated as one-handed when determining the effect of Power Attack, Strength bonus to damage, and the like. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Massive Weapons (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes. The attack roll penalty for using weapons too large for her size is reduced by 1, and this reduction increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 3rd (to a minimum of 0). This ability replaces trap sense.

**Evade Reach (Ex)**: At 5th level, as a swift action, a titan mauler may choose one creature within her line of sight. Until the end of her turn, that target’s reach is treated as if it were 5 feet shorter with respect to reaching the titan mauler, and this reduction increases by 5 feet for every five levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Titanic Rage (Su)**: At 14th level, a titan mauler may choose to gain the benefits of *enlarge person* when she enters a rage. While using titanic rage, she must spend 2 rounds of rage per round, and she becomes exhausted rather than fatigued when the rage ends. This ability replaces indomitable will.

**Rage Powers**: The following rage powers complement the titan mauler archetype: body bludgeon, greater ground breaker, ground breaker, knockback, mighty swing, powerful blow, smasher, and strength surge.

#### Template
**Giantblood (Template)**

Most true giants view their ability to procreate with other races and other kinds of giants as a curse upon their kind. A few kinds of giants, however, view the ability to breed with other races as a gift.

No matter how an individual giant feels about mating with other races, the fact remains that they are physically capable of procreating with nearly any creature of naturally humanoid form. Such a union produces a child with most of the traits of its nongiant parent, or of the mother if both parents are giants. Giant parentage often results in increased size and strength, and it bestows the giants’ famous knack for throwing boulders. The giant size of a giantblood dilutes in just one generation, however; the children of nongiant/giantblood pairs display no trace of giant heritage except perhaps strangely colored hair, skin, or eyes. Similarly, the children of a giant and a half-giant show few signs of the nongiant grandparent’s blood.

In addition to their strength and size, a giantblood often exhibits other physical traces of their giant parent’s heritage.

**Creating a Giantblood**

“Giantblood” is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature of at least Small size and naturally humanoid shape that does not have the oni subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Creatures that do not reproduce in the same manner as giants cannot receive this template. Furthermore, mating between giants of the same kind does not produce giantblood offspring. 

A giantblood uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Challenge Rating:** As base creature +1

**Size:** If the base creature’s size category is smaller than that of the giant parent, the giantblood gains one size category (maximum Colossal). A giantblood that changes size does not gain the normal bonuses associated with an increase in size. Instead, it gains the bonuses/penalties outlined in this template.

**Type:** If the base creature is a humanoid it gains the giant subtype.

**Speed:** If the base creature gains a size category, each of its speeds increases by +10 feet over that of the base creature. If the base creature increases size and can fly its maneuverability decreases one step.

**Armor Class:** The base creature’s natural armor bonus improves as given on **Table 2-21** and gains a size penalty depending on the giantblood’s final size.

**Table 2-21: Giantblood Traits**


| |  | **Space/** | **Rock** |
|---|---|---|---|
| | **Natural** | **Reach** | **Throwing** |
| **Final Size** | **AC Bonus** | **Bonus** | **Range Inc.** |
| Medium | +1 | +0 ft. | 60 ft. |
| Large | +3 | +5 ft. | 120 ft. |
| Huge | +4 | +5 ft. | 140 ft. |
| Gargantuan | +5 | +5 ft. | 180 ft. |
| Colossal | +6 | +10 ft. | 220 ft. |

**Defensive Abilities:** The giantblood gains rock catching if its giant parent has it.

**Attacks:** The bonuses on a giantblood’s attack and damage rolls changes based on its new base attack bonus, Strength modifier, and its new size modifier. If the base creature has any natural attacks the damage increases by one step.

**Space/Reach:** Same as the base creature unless the giantblood gained a size category. In that case, the giantblood’s space and reach increases by the bonus given on **Table 2-21**. Reach bonuses from specific attacks do not increase.

**Special Attacks:** A giantblood gains rock throwing with a range increment given on **Table 2-21**. If the base creature already has the rock throwing ability it uses either the base creature’s range or the one granted by this template, whichever is greater.

**Abilities:** The giantblood’s abilities change based on its final size, as shown on **Table 2-22**, even if the giantblood’s size did not change. Abilities reduced by the application of this template have a minimum of 1.

**Table 2-22: Giantblood Ability Modifiers**


| **Final Size** | **Str** | **Dex** | **Con** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medium | +6 | -2 | +2 |
| Large | +10 | -2 | +4 |
| Huge | +10 | -2 | +4 |
| Gargantuan | +14 | -4 | +6 |
| Colossal | +14 | -4 | +6 |

**Skills:** If the base creature increased in size, replace the base creature’s size modifier on Fly and Stealth checks with the appropriate one for its new size.

**Special Qualities:** The giantblood retains all the base creature’s special qualities and gains additional qualities based on its giant parent.
