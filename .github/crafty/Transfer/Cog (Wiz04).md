**Class Features**

The following are the class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Wizards are proficient with the club, [[Dagger|dagger]], heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]], but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard’s movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells:** A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in Chapter 10 (of the Core Rulebook). A wizard must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3–16. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 of the Core Rulebook).

A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages:** A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

**Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp):** At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. 

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see arcane school).

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]] feat in Chapter 5 of the Core Rulebook). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

**Arcane School:** A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a *[[Fireball (Spell)|fireball]]*. In addition, a specialist takes a –4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard’s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.

**Cantrips:** Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 3–16 under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below). 

**[[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]]:** At 1st level, a wizard gains [[Scribe Scroll (Feat)|Scribe Scroll]] as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats:** At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or [[Spell Mastery (Feat)|Spell Mastery]]. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.

**Spellbooks:** A wizard must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for *[[Read Magic (Spell)|read magic]]*, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to his own (see Chapter 9 of the *PFRG Core Rulebook*).

---------------------

'Cog' is a gearforged wizard. 

His earliest memory is awakening in the smoking ruins of a collapsed tower buried under a thin layer of rubble. Everything was destroyed save the stones of the tower itself. Cog looked about himself and had no connection to it. He did not know the place, he did not even know what he was looking at.

Upon digging himself free, he wandered for several weeks, possibly months in the mountains with only a basic awareness of self and the things around him. Broken visions flashed through his mind and had to be processed and integrated. Finally he spoke his first words.

"Once there was another, now there is only Cog."

Cog has recovered enough of his past to realize that he is all that remains of a powerful wizard who was attacked in his tower sanctuary. Cog recalls nothing of that former life save that his gearforged body was part of a research project and that when his former self was attacked and lay dying, he managed to project at least a part of his self into the inanimate construct.

At least some of his former skills as a wizard have manifested themselves in the months since his awakening and Cog has seized upon this abilities and is working desperately to make them stronger. Once he feels he has enough power he intends to seek out his previous life.His earliest memory is awakening in the smoking ruins of a collapsed tower buried under a thin layer of rubble.

At least some of his former skills as a wizard have manifested themselves in the months since his awakening and Cog has seized upon this abilities and is working desperately to make them stronger. Once he feels he has enough power he intends to seek out his previous life.

Once he felt more integrated in being just Cog, he began moving with a more directed purpose. Seeking out a road, he traveled to the city of New Stetven. There he encountered a druid named Longtooth. Shortly after meeting Longtooth they were approached by a cleric of Iomde in the Griffon's Edge tavern who wanted them to undertake an investigation.

Arden Heathright, a Cleric of Iomede was tasked with investigating the disappearances within the city of New Stetven. 

Limpgin, a halfling noble was abducted by cult members, worshipers of Orcus, to be sacrificed at a makeshift temple located 3 days west in an old abandoned mine.

The party traveled to the mines and discovered cultist and druegar warriors inside and interrupted the sacrifice dispatching of several cult members, Druegar and the head priest freeing Limpgin. The players looted the first section of the mines to include melting down the bronze statues of Orcus for gold

After returning to Arden in the Iomede temple and telling him what was discovered, “Cog” sought out and found a construct wizard named Shamus Girdwin in hopes of finding out more information about his own nature.

Cog purchased 2 scrolls (*fabricate* and *dimensional stability*) and a finely crafted darkwood carving of a vardo (heavy wagon). Using these items and the *crafter's fortune* spell, Cog created a *folding wagon*.

The players are back with Arden and they were told that several clerics with a small contingent were sent to the mines with hopes of discovering more about the cultist. Only a few returned and the few that did were badly injured. Arden is tasking the explorers with finding out more about the cultist and what else lurks within the mines that they should be worried about.

Returning to the temple of Iomede, Cog and Longtooth, were offered the services of Godwin Lighthearst (a cleric of Iomede) which they accepted. After hiring Andrew (hm Exp01) as a driver, the party loaded 2 weeks of supplies and set out for the caverns.

On the very first day, at the cutoff towards the mountains, the party encountered 3 bandits on the road whom they immediately dispatched 2; offering the third his life in exchange for leading Cog and Longtooth back to their camp. At the camp, they found Sean (hm fighter) and Grimwald (hm wererat rogue) whom they killed quickly. In a locked chest, the party found 3 potions (cure light wounds x 3) and 12 gems in a smaller box (each worth 150 gp). In a large locked (and trapped) crate the party found trade goods worth 150 gp and a magical cloak (cloak of archnida 14,000 gp)

The party decided to head back to Stetven and sell off the goods and see if the brigands had a reward on their heads (Grimwald had one for 1,200 gp) and the goods as well as the magical cloak. Cog commissioned a *golden anhedron ioun stone* from Shamus for 8,000 gp.

Each member of the party was reward with 8,575 gp and 1,300 xp.

After traveling for three days the party was attacked by a giant scorpion during the first watch. It was quickly dispatched (400 xp) and the next day the party arrived the cavern. They found it well fortified. The party set up camp 4 hours travel away from the cavern opening. Upon arriving at the cavern, Longtooth was attacked by 2 duergar who dropped him and his dog companion. One charged Cog who had readied a color spray spell which the first duergar failed, then did the same thing again using his arcane bond to drop the second duergar. Cog dispatched both unconscious duergar with a coup de gras. Upon approaching the cavern mouth, he stabilized Longtooth and then was attacked by a cultist. After the first exchange of blows, the cultist cast *cause fear*, causing Cog to withdraw for 18 seconds. While he was coming back Longtooth slew the cultist. Quickly searching the bodies, Cog found 2 masterwork axes, 2 vials of holy water, a vial of bloodroot poison, 2 dwarven war axes, and a masterwork sickle (306 gp).

As the party moved further in the cavern, they began to encounter more duergar (5 each) finding 2 potions of *cure light wounds*, 2 potions of *detect secret door*, and two potions of *expeditious retreat*, 1 potion of *negate aroma*, 4 smokesticks, 4 tanglefoot bags, 6 thunderstones and 6 tindertwigs, 5 alchemical fire flasks (used 4), 6 flasks of acid, 1 masterwork greatsword, 1 light crossbow, 1 light mace, *pouch of dust of tracelessness, +1 chainshirt*; and a mutated goblin which they quickly killed (for 1400 xp).

The party decided to rest for the night in a deserted room, but before they could get there, Longtooth fell into a 40' pit trap. After getting him out, the party rested and recovered. Moving deeper into the dungeon, the party found a watery chamber filled with 2' of water. Floating in the water was a body in leather armor. When he moved to check the body, Longtooth was attacked by 2 ameoba swarms. Using the alchemists' fires (4) they had found earlier, they killed them (400 xp) and moved deeper into the caverns.

The party found a barricaded side corridor which they cleared an opening through (took 20 minutes to clear an opening). Further exploration on the other side of the opening revealed a large cavern with a troglodyte village set within it.

The cleric Godwin entered the caverns and alerted Longtooth and Cog that they needed to return to New Stetven. The party concealed the tunnel to the trog village and started back to the city. On the 3rd night they were attacked by a large boalisk. It grappled Cog and nearly crushed him before it was vanquished (600 xp each). Returning to Arden, Longtooth and Cog were asked to add Catherine (1/2elf rog02), Uther Granitehide (oread brawler02) and Medeo (elf cleric 02) to their group and then to track down the lost scout who supposedly has information on the warlord behind the cultists. While in New Stetven Cog sold off 2 potions of *detect secret door*, 2 potions of *expeditious retreat*, 1 potion of *negate aroma*, 4 smokesticks, 4 tanglefoot bags, 6 thunderstones and 6 tindertwigs, 6 flasks of acid, 1 masterwork greatsword, 1 light crossbow, 1 light mace, *pouch of dust of tracelessness,* and a *+1 chainshirt* for 2,026 gp (1,013 gp ea). 

Leaving New Stetven, the party traveled 2 days and while camping the second night was attacked during the first watch. Uther was attacked from behind while he sat on the top of the vardo. He reacted with blinding speed and counterattacked. Cog awakened the camp calling out 'Danger, danger...' and then cast *ray of clumsiness* using his arcane bond. Uther attacked as did Longtooth after he climbed up. Medoe cast *burning disarm* which the faceless stalker disregarded entirely. Cog cast *magic missile* for minimal damage. The creature attempted to bite Uther but everyone on the roof of the vardo took an attack of opportunity killing the faceless stalker (1200 xp). From his body the party recovered 80 gp, a masterwork longsword, and a mysterious brown liquid.

After setting up the camp the next day, the party moved up to the cavern entrance. Catherine did a recon and found a tripwire trap but accidentally set it off while attempting to disarm it. She reported back to the party, was healed by Medoe. Moving into the caverns, the party encountered a large duergar wielding a dwarven axe. Longtooth's wolf attempted to trip it without success. Calling the party up Cog dispatched the creature after Uther and Longtooth wounded it. After interrogating the duegar, Uther coup de graced it. Then the party set up an ambush for the 4 remaining duegard they were told of. Catherine scattered caltrops and Longtooth called out in dwarven saying "We are under attack!" Three duegar fell for the trick and rushed into the cavern where they were swiftly dealt with. The party collected 3 masterwork dwarven axes, 3 sets of banded armor, 3 heavy crossbows and 6 potions of *cure light wounds*. Longtooth tracked the duergar through the caverns back to the partial collapsed tunnel that laid to the trog village. Catherine discovered a swing trap which she easily disarmed.

The party moved through the short tunnel to the trog village. In the distance at the far end of the carvern was a keep that was flanked on each side by streams of falling lava. While attempting to cross the stream of water surrounding the village Longtooth noticed something in the water and attacked it. The large water elemental struck back but missed Longtooth. Cog attempted a *ray of clumsiness* spell which missed. Uther attempted to jump the stream but was immersed midjump by the water elemental. Longtooth shifted form into a large red dragon and attempted to breath on the water elemental but failed to affect it with his fiery breath. Grabbing the rope tied around Uther's waist, he mananged to pull him free of the water elemental. As he moved back to the water elemental he was attacked by many members of the trog village. He successfully fought off several of them by using his fiery breath weapon but was then attacked by a trog shaman or caster of some type as well a couple of trog fighters.
