Originally a pirate, Farzam Khorsheed was always noted for having eyes the color of burnished gold, and many said he was so greedy that they were surprised he hadn’t gouged out his own eyes to get at the gold in them. Khorsheed’s avarice quickly led him from piracy to the Okeno slave trade, and he has been busy capturing other ships’ crew and passengers and selling them into slavery ever since. 

When the Gray Corsairs sank the *White Dawn*, Khorsheed called upon Asmodeus, god of slavery, to help him, but only Khorsheed knows exactly what deal he struck with the Prince of Lies. What is certain is that the *White Dawn* emerged from the sinking ashes as the *Burnt Saffron*, and Khorsheed has a newfound ability to use divine magic. Together, the *Burnt Saffron* and its captain represent a potent force of slavery on the waters of the Inner Sea. 

Khorsheed treats slaving as his divine mandate, and woe betide any who step in his way. He sees everyone— including himself and his crew—as potential slaves that have not yet been clapped in chains, and he believes that with Asmodeus’s guidance, he will witness the whole world enslaved by his own hand.
