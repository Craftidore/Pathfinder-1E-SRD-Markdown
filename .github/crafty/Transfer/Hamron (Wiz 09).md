Once a promising young wizard with a bright future, Hamron’s personal failings have stolen his dreams and wrecked his life. Now he drifts from one aimless encounter to another, sometimes joining a band of adventures for a time before his problems cause him to move on. 

Now you can introduce Hamron to your own campaign. How will your party handle him? Will they save him from his demons or just leave him to suffer? 

**APPEARANCE** 

Hamron is a thin human man of average height, just past middle age. The lines etched in his face tell a story of hardship and pain. His shaggy, black beard is streaked with grey. His eyes are often bleary and bloodshot and he smells of rum. He dresses in the classic wizard attire; robes and wide brimmed pointed hat. 

**PERSONALITY** 

Like many people, Hamron has some positive and negative characteristics. He is a good person with a lot of personal demons. As determined by Chapter 2 of the <u>Book of Broken Dreams</u>, he is mildly antisocial with borderline and narcissistic traits. He has no plans for his life and is often reckless. He easily becomes attached to new friends and is quite protective and loyal. He yearns for a group of friends that will accept him. He also has grandiose mannerisms and often feels entitled and overly self-important. 

Hamron happens to be good with children and enjoys entertaining them with simple cantrips. Bloodstone Press 2 

**ALCOHOLIC** 

Hamron is a chronic alcoholic. In the mornings, he can be cantankerous and rude, but his mood improves after a few drinks. Throughout the day he is slightly intoxicated and acts jovial and friendly. In the evenings, he becomes inebriated and turns lazy, slovenly, and crass. 

***Addiction.*** Hamron must be drunk to function properly. If he isn’t, he gains 1 level of exhaustion. When he has had too much to drink, he is considered poisoned. 

***Withdrawals.*** Hamron is physically addicted to alcohol and suffers from withdrawals if he doesn’t drink. If denied alcohol, he becomes angry and violent. After 24 hours without alcohol, he gains 2 levels of exhaustion and is poisoned until he has some alcohol. After 48 hours he gains another level of exhaustion and becomes incapacitated. These conditions persist for another 1d4 days or until he drinks some alcohol. 

***Loose Lips.*** When inebriated, Hamron speaks about things he shouldn’t. He may mention secrets of the guilds and governments he has worked for. He may even reveal secrets about wizard circles or the Tower of High Sorcery. 

***PTSD.*** As a young battle mage, Hamron spent two years on the front lines of a losing war. He rarely speaks of the experience, but has never forgotten it. 

**BACKGROUND** 

Forty years ago, Hamron was a promising young apprentice at the Tower of High Sorcery. He easily passed the entrance exams and earned a scholarship. He was drawn to evocation and it became his field of study. 

Even at a young age, his drinking was a problem. It interfered with his studies and caused him to graduate lower in his class than he could have. 

His early assignments with the tower were routine, and he skated by. After reaching journeyman status, he became a battle mage and was hired out to King Otelin. The horrors of Otelin’s failed war against the Witby Isles left deep scars on Hamron’s mind. 

Shortly after returning home from the war, a drunken accident caused the death of his friend and fellow mage, Eravan. Hamron was expelled from the tower and banned from membership in all sanctioned wizard circles. 

He soon joined an unsanctioned group, but was expelled for drinking and recklessness after just a few months. 

Hamron drifted until he found work with the city of Hullstone as a scribe. Another night of drinking lead to an accidental fire, and he was sentenced to three years in the salt mines. 

Upon release, he traveled to Millcairn where he became an advisor and enforcer for the Castempi merchant’s guild. This was his favorite job, and he kept it for seven years. His employers paid him well and asked little of him. He had few responsibilities and access to a vast assortment of wines. Although sober when he left the mines, he soon relapsed. He was a functioning alcoholic during these years, curtailing his drinking while at work. This management of his addition and his employers’ lack of oversight fostered the longest period of stability in his life. He even married and fathered two sons. 

Competition cut into the guild’s profits and when the guild master died, feuding erupted among the members. The wealthiest members abandoned the guild and joined others. Those who remained dissolved the original charter and drafted a new one. Sadly, there was no budget in the new charter for a guild mage. 

Hamron has since been adrift. He occasionally finds work but always loses it and moves on. Each time, sinking deeper into addiction. Bloodstone Press 3 

**Family.** Hamron has an older brother who serves as a city watchman in Pernrith. He also has an ex-wife and two estranged teenage sons. He wants to be a good father, but rarely sees them. His wife kicked him out and told him not return until he stops drinking. That was ten years ago. She has since taken up with another man. Hamron sends money and gifts to them occasionally but never seriously considers sobriety. 

METHODS 

Hamron is a classic addict; rather than overcome his problem, he tries to get through life while supporting it. Every major decision is made with consideration of his addiction. Even when forced to acknowledge the problem, he will revert to excuses, justifications, and exceptions until he is drinking again. 

Hamron’s drinking always leads to disaster, failure, and setbacks. 

He conceals his problem from new friends. Drinking casually throughout the day and trying to remain coherent, he can easily convince people that his condition is not a problem. 

The problems only manifest after he has grown comfortable with new associates and begins to drink heavily. The PCs may notice he is quite intoxicated every evening. If they confront him about it, he reassures them that he functions better when drunk. He may offer some demonstrations of his spellcasting while drunk. Although he can easily cast a spell while sitting casually with friends, when combat happens he may be too confused, clumsy, and slow to cast the right spell in time. 

**ENCOUNTERS** 

These encounters involve Hamron joining the characters’ group. He works best in parties without a strong wizard, creating a situation where they need him despite his problems. He may also be several levels higher than the PCs. 

***Drunken Disaster.*** After earning the PC’s trust, Hamron’s drinking suddenly interferes with his spellcasting at a critical moment. The PCs narrowly avert disaster. Now they must decide what to do about him. If they deprive him of alcohol, he becomes angry. He sneaks and hides it, drinking on the sly. If the PCs succeed in depriving him of alcohol for 24 hours, he begins suffering from <u>withdrawals.</u> 

***Excessive Wages.*** Accountants from the new Rashani guild are harassing him, demanding that he return a large portion of the egregious wages he received while working under the old charter. They send debt collectors to extract the money. 

***Assassins.*** Hamron’s loose tongue has let too many secrets slip. Assassins from the Castempi guild, the Hullstone government, or the Tower of High Sorcery come to silence him once and for all. 

***Runaways.*** Hamron’s two teenage sons, angry at their stepfather and yearning to see the world, have run away from home and found their real father. Now they hope to tag along and live exciting lives of adventure with him and his friends. 

***Life of the Party.*** When visiting taverns and bars, Hamron often pressures his companions to drink with him. He might belittle those who cannot drink as much as he can. His drunken foibles are amplified when others join him. The PCs may wake up the next morning in an unknown part of town, hung over and wondering what they did last night. If the PCs aren’t careful, Hamron could cause them a tragic setback with this behavior. Bloodstone Press 4 

**CURING HAMRON** 

To cure Hamron, the PCs must remove both his alcoholism and PTSD. PCs may do this during downtime. 

Curing his alcoholism begins with convincing him to stop drinking. PCs can forcibly restrict his access to alcohol for 1d4+2 days while he goes through withdrawals, but if he doesn’t want to stop drinking, he will relapse as soon as he can. 

Convincing him not to drink requires a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. This must be repeated once per day for two weeks. If one check fails, he relapses and the process must be restarted. 

***Withdrawals.*** If Hamron stops drinking and has no medicines or magic to ease his symptoms, he suffers from withdrawals. After 24 hours he gains 2 levels of exhaustion and is poisoned. After 48 hours he gains another level of exhaustion and becomes incapacitated. These conditions persist for 1d4 more days or until he drinks again. 

***PTSD.*** Curing Hamron of his PTSD requires talking with him for 1 hour and making a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. Ten successful checks must be made. Only 1 check per week can be made. Failing a check indicates no progress is made that week. 

***Magic.** Lesser restoration* will remove Hamron’s withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours. *Greater restoration* will cure him of his physical addiction and eliminate all withdrawals. A separate *greater restoration* spell can be used to remove his PTSD. Using *detect thoughts* while treating his PTSD reduces the Insight DC to 10. *Suggestion* can be useful in convincing him to stop drinking. Note that *charm person* and *friends* leave the subject aware that they have been magically influenced, which may make him angry. 

***Medicines.*** PCs can make DC 15 Intelligence (Alchemy or Herbalism) checks to craft medicines that remove his symptoms. Each dose lasts 8 hours. 

**CHALLENGE AND REWARD** 

Hamron is an appropriate encounter for any party of 3rd to 8th level and could be with the PCs for a long time. It is likely that he will be higher level than the PCs when the meet him, but his self destructive ways prevent him from gaining levels as fast as the PCs. If they do not cure him, they will eventually surpass him in level.

CONCUSSIVE BLAST 

*4th level evocation* 

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous 

A blast of force erupts from you in all directions. All creatures within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer 6d6 points of force damage, be thrown back 20 feet, and be rendered prone. Those who succeed at the saving throw suffer half damage and are pushed back 5 feet. Creatures that are size Huge and Gargantuan are not thrown back or pushed, but still suffer damage. 

***At Higher Levels*.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th. 

DISEMBOWEL 

*5th level evocation* 

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You make a stabbing gesture with your arm as you complete this spell, causing a javelin of force to impale your target. Make a melee spell attack. If the attack hits, the target takes 10d10 force damage. If the attack misses, the spell ends. 

If damage from this spell kills the target, the target’s innards are spilled out. 

VOLTAIC SHROUD 

Evocation \[electricity]

**Level:** Magus 5, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5 

**BoXM:** Wizard 10

**Casting** 

**Casting Time:** 1 standard action 

**Components:** V, S, M (A bit of fur and an amber, crystal or glass rod.) 

**Effect** 

**Range:** Personal (see text) 

**Target:** Caster (see text) 

**Duration:** 1 round/level 

**Saving Throw:** Reflex half

**Spell Resistance:** Yes 

**Description** 

*Voltaic shroud* cloaks the caster in a mantle of electrical energy that protects against attacks and hurls bolts of lightning at will. Anyone striking the caster with a metal or natural weapon while the shroud is active suffers 1d4 points of electrical damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 8d4, Reflex save for half). Once per round as a free action the caster may also strike any target within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) with a bolt of lightning. This bolt also causes 1d4 points of damage per 3 caster levels. Thus, at 9th level it causes 3d4 points of damage. At 12th level the damage becomes 4d4. At 15th level it becomes 5d4 and so on (maximum 8d4 at 24th level). 

RING OF SORCERY 

*Ring, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)* 

When you cast a spell while wearing this ring, you can expend 1 charge (for every three caster levels you possess as part of casting that spel; doing so increased the spell DC by 1 for each charge expended. This ring has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn.  (This is changed from the original presented in 34 Magic Items.)
