Level Adjustment: --

The creature looks like the blackened skeletal remains of a human. Its eyes are such a deep shade of inky black that they stand out against their ebony remains.

The cult of Tharizdun created the elhoriads to act as guardians. The cult researched the various methods of undead creation for several years and even went so far as to recruit accomplished necromancers into their ranks to unlock the secrets that would allow them to manipulate the various forms of undead. Cultists produced elhoriads by taking the base skeleton and infusing them with the very power of entropy channeled from unearthed remnants of Tharizdun's once-mighty artifacts. This grants these creatures their above average intelligence and their deadly entropic touch ability.

Elhoriads are intelligent creatures, but they derive their power from Tharizdun, so they remain fiercely loyal to him and his followers. Elhoriads are the foot soldiers whenever the cult takes action against the outside world. Within their hidden temples, they serve as guards who protect the clergy in the event that their sanctuary is attacked.

The appearance of the elhoriads is not entirely unlike that of typical animated skeletons. Many who encounter them simply dismiss them as blackened skeletons, so they often make the mistake of employing the same tactics that they would against these all-too common undead. The inky blackness within the elhoriads' eye sockets and the constant shadow that surrounds their claws are the only outward characteristics that they display that cause them to appear as anything but common skeletons. These differences are subtle and have cost numerous adventurers their lives.

Combat

Elhoriads are used primarily for melee combat. Their job is to weaken opponents before their foes can reach the cultists whom they protect. Elhoriads typically use longswords to cut through less powerful enemies, but if they are pitted against higher level foes, they instead use their claw attacks to deliver their entropic touch, which quickly weakens their opponents.

Entropic Touch (Su): An elhoriad's touch disrupts most living tissue. Whenever an elhoriad successfully strikes an aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, outsider, plant, or vermin with a claw attack, the creature struck must make a Fortitude save (DC 13) or take 1d4 points of permanent Constitution drain and 1d4 points of permanent Strength drain. The save DC is Charisma based.

Undead Traits: An elhoriad is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.
