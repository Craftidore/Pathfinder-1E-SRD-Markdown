# Changeling (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
**Price:** +2,000 gp

**Property:** Weapon 

**Activation:** Swift (command)

*This spear appears to be made entirely of a metal with a bright silver sheen, and the head is joined seamlessly to the haft.*

A changeling weapon allows you to choose its length and appearance each time you attack with it. Once per round, by swift (mental) action (orig: speaking the appropriate command word), you can change the weapon into a spear, a [[Shortspear|shortspear]], a [[Longspear|longspear]], or a [[Greatspear|greatspear]] sized appropriately for you. As part of the same action, you can make its haft and head appear to be composed of any wood, stone, metal, or combination thereof that you want, and add any decorative flourishes desired, though the spearâ€™s actual composition does not change.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Shrink Item (Spell)|shrink item]]*; Price +2,000 gp.

**Source:** Magic Item Compendium (WotC), pg. 31

**GM Note**

*House Rule:*  The [[Greatspear|greatspear]] (Complete Warrior 145) is added to the weapon ability per Wizards of the Coast forum.

As written, this weapon special ability only applies to spears ([[Light spear, elven (MeleeWpn)|elven light spear]] also), greatspears, longspears, or shortspears) though the GM could also decide to apply it to a VERY specific group of weapons such as a short sword, long sword, and greatsword. The activation of this weapon special ability is a swift (mental) action.

This magic weapon special ability confers proficiency to the wielder with whatever weapon it is changed to.
