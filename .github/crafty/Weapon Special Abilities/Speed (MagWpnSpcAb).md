# Speed (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
When making a full-attack action, the wielder of a *speed* weapon may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielderâ€™s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]* spell.)

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Haste (Spell)|haste]]*; Price +3 bonus.
