# Thundering (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
A *thundering* weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A *thundering* weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Subjects dealt critical hits by a *thundering* weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be [[Deafened|deafened]] permanently.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Blindness_Deafness (Spell)|blindness/deafness]]*; Price +1 bonus.
