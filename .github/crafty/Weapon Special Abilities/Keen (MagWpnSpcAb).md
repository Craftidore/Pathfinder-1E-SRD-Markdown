# Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing melee weapons can be *keen*. If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll. This benefit doesnâ€™t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]* spell or the [[Improved Critical (Feat)|Improved Critical]] feat).

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Keen Edge (Spell)|keen edge]]*; Price +1 bonus.
