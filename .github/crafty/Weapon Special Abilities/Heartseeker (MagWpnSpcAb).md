# Heartseeker (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A *heartseeker* weapon is drawn unerringly toward beating hearts. A *heartseeker* weapon ignores the miss chance for concealment against most living targets, though the attack must still target the proper square. This special ability does not apply against aberrations, oozes, plants, outsiders with the elemental subtype, or any creature specifically noted to lack a heart.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, *[[Death Knell (Spell)|death knell]]*; Price +1 bonus.
