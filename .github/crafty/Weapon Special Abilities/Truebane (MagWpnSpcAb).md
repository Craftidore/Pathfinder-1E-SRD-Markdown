# Truebane (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
The cult of Kostchtchie is generally (if begrudgingly) credited with the development of this more powerful variant of the commonplace *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* weapon quality. When wielded, a *truebane* weapon gains the *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* weapon quality (ie., against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe) against the same type of creature as the wielder. Thus, a giant wielding a *truebane* weapon gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage and +2d6 additional damage against giants, while a lawful outsider would gain the bonus against other lawful outsiders. At the end of any round in which a *truebane* weapon deals damage to a creature, the weapon's *[[Bane (MagWpnSpcAb)|bane]]* quality changes to match the type of the creature it last damaged; this change persists for 1 round before reverting to the wielder's creature type (unless, of course, the weapon is used to damage a different creature in that round).

Strong conjuration; CL 11th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Summon Monster III (Spell)|summon monster III]]*; Price +3 bonus
