# Transformative (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
**Price:** +10,000 gp

**Property:** Weapon (melee)

**Caster Level:** 10th

**Aura:** moderate transmutation

**Activation:** —

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A *transformative* weapon alters its shape at its wielder’s command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon’s categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium *transformative longsword* can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small *transformative greatsword* can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the –2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]] transformative* weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the *[[Keen (MagWpnSpcAb)|keen]]* special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape.

*Prerequisite:* [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Major Creation (Spell)|major creation]]*

*Cost to Create:* 5,000 gp.
