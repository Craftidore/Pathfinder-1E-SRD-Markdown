# Axiomatic (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
An *axiomatic* weapon is infused with lawful power. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. It bestows one permanent negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including *[[Restoration (Spell)|restoration]]* spells) while the weapon is wielded.

Moderate evocation \[lawful]; CL 7th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Order's Wrath (Spell)|orderâ€™s wrath]]*, creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.
