# Dancing (MagWpnSpcAb)
## Overview
As a standard action, a *dancing* weapon can be loosed to attack on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. The weapon is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items. While dancing, the weapon shares the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The *dancing* weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved, the weapon canâ€™t dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor (Feat)|Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], *[[Animate Objects (Spell)|animate objects]]*; Price +4 bonus.
