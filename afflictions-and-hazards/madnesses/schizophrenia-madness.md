### Description

A character afflicted with schizophrenia can no longer function as he once did, dealing with sudden deficits in social skills and cognition, and an influx of new, strange behaviors. The character becomes erratic, chaotic, and unpredictable as his affliction and symptoms continue, often hitting a peak of symptoms including hallucinations and delusions. Each time a character afflicted with this madness finds himself in a stressful situation (such as combat), he must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for 1d6 rounds.
