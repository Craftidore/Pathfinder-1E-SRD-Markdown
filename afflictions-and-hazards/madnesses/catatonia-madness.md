### Description

A character suffering from catatonia mentally shuts down completely, or nearly so, greatly limiting her physical capabilities as well. While a catatonic character still breathes, she can eat or drink without assistance only if the catatonia is dormant. If a catatonic character is faced with a dangerous situation, she must attempt a saving throw. If she succeeds, she acts as if panicked (though this is not a fear effect) until she is out of line of sight of the danger or is cornered. If she is cornered, she cowers again.
