### Description

Creatures reduced below 3 Intelligence gain the fiendish creature simple template (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 294) and a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution; these effects vanish if a creature’s Intelligence score rises above 3.  
  
Lethe water loses its magical potency 24 hours after being removed from the hot springs, but remains mildly poisonous thanks to its mineral content (treat as bloodroot, but ingested rather than injury; _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ 558).
