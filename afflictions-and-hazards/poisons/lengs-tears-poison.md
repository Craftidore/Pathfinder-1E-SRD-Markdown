### Description

Made from the distilled tears and sweat of denizens of Leng (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2_ 82), this substance causes hallucinations and temporary paralysis. A creature that fails its initial saving throw is paralyzed and experiences terrifying hallucinations of wandering through an icy, windswept waste. The creature’s paralysis ends if it is cured or once the poison runs its course, though memories of the vivid hallucinations may haunt it for some time.
