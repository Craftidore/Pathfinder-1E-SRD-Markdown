**Price** 4,500 gp; **Weight** —  
**Type** ingested; **Save** Fortitude DC 20  
**Onset** 1 minute; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds  
**Effect** Consuming the flowers of this plant weakens the walls of the imbiber’s veins, causing them to rupture. The target takes 1d2 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of bleed damage. Blood (or an equivalent bodily fluid, if the imbiber does not have blood) flows from the target’s eyes, causing the subject to be blinded for the duration of the bleed effect. This bleeding can be stopped as normal (with a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any magical healing)  
**Cure** 2 saves
