**Type** curse; **Save** Will DC 15  
**Effect** The target is haunted by horrible phantasmal visions that distract him at critical moments. He takes a –4 penalty on concentration checks and on saving throws against effects that would impose any of the following conditions on him: confused, dazed, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or stunned. Once per day, when alone or confronted by something novel and strange, he must succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 points of sanity damage if using the [[sanity|sanity system]]).  
**Cure** The tormenting visions curse can be removed only by [[remove-curse|remove curse]] followed by [[banishment|banishment]], each cast within 1 minute of each another.
