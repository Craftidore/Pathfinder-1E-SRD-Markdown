**Type** regional curse; **Save** Will DC 23  
**Effect** The weather in the cursed region changes drastically, even bringing snow to a blazing desert. The area is plagued by your choice of %%TODO: link very 'hot conditions' to a block when working on [[weather]]%%very hot conditions or [[storms|frequent powerful storms]]. The weather remains unpredictable, and can change over time (as determined by the GM), but the baseline weather is altered as long as the curse remains.  
**Cure** The cursed weather can be returned to normal only by casting [[remove-curse|remove curse]] at the center of the affected area, followed by a casting of [[control-weather|control weather]].
