# Enchanting Demise

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 133_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**CR** 10; **XP** 9,600  
CN persistent variant haunt (80-ft. radius)  
**Aura** moderate enchantment (compulsion) \[mind-affecting\]  
**Caster Level** 9th  
**Notice** Perception or Knowledge (nature) DC 15 (to notice drifting motes of shimmering pollen in the air)  
**hp** 45; **Weakness** negative energy (see [[echoes-of-the-first-world|echoes of the first world]]); **Trigger** proximity  
**Effect** Every minute a creature spends within an enchanting demise, that creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or fall asleep as though affected by [[deep-slumber|deep slumber]]. Creatures that fail this save and fall asleep take 1 point of Wisdom drain each minute they sleep within the area of an enchanting demise. A creature that succeeds at this Will saving throw remains awake, but it must attempt a new saving throw after 1 minute if it does not leave the enchanting demise’s area. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom by this effect dies and blooms into a field of colorful wildflowers with a radius of 5 feet per Hit Die the creature had. If this radius would extend beyond the radius of the enchanting demise, it instead expands the radius of the echo out to the border of the created wildflowers. The presence of such wildflowers reduces the Perception DC to notice the echo by 2.  
**Benefit** Sleeping creatures take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each minute instead of 1 per minute.  
**Destruction** A character with the [[lucid-dreamer|Lucid Dreamer]] feat who falls asleep in an enchanting demise intrusion can attempt to destroy it permanently in the Dimension of Dreams. When such a character falls asleep, he receives one attempt to successfully form a [[lucid-body|lucid body]] without disadvantage. If he fails this check, he does not successfully lucid dream and remains in a dreamless slumber. If the character succeeds at this check, he can immediately attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to affect the boundary between the Dimension of Dreams, the Material Plane, and the First World. If he succeeds, the enchanting demise is destroyed and all sleeping creatures in its area wake up. If the character fails, he immediately ceases lucid dreaming and falls into a deep, dreamless sleep.
