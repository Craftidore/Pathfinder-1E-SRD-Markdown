# Living Decay

**Source** [_Horror Adventures pg. 177_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures)  
**CR** 10; **XP** 9,600  
NE persistent haunt (50-ft. radius)  
**Caster Level** 9th  
**Notice** Perception DC 20 (to smell decaying flesh)  
**hp** 45; **Weakness** [[remove-disease|remove disease]]; **Trigger** proximity; **Reset** 1 day  
**Effect** The area fills with a potent miasma that reeks of decaying flesh. Everyone within the radius must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or contract the disease living rot, as detailed below, except they bypass the latent/carrier state. Within the haunt’s area, the disease’s frequency increases to 1 round and its save DC increases to 20. Characters who succeed at this saving throw are not immune; they must attempt a new saving throw each round they remain in the haunt’s area. Reducing the haunt to 0 hit points does not remove the disease. A character who casts [[remove-disease|remove disease]] on the living decay haunt deals it an amount of damage equal to her caster level.  
**Destruction** Casting [[heal|heal]] on each remaining body in the original victims’ mass grave (or a single casting of [[mass-heal|mass heal]]) prevents this haunt from returning.  

### Description

Among the most frightening diseases are those that cause their victims’ bodies to rot away. A living decay haunt arises when an epidemic of such a disease devastates a population. This haunt uses the optional disease rules presented on pages 138–139 of _Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained_.  

### Living Rot

**Type** disease, contact, inhaled, or injury; **Save** Fortitude DC 17  
**Track** physical; **Frequency** 1/day  
**Effect** In the weakened state, the target also takes a –2 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks. In the impaired state, the target takes a 50% miss chance on attack rolls and the target’s speed is reduced by half (minimum 5 feet). All objects touched at the impaired state and beyond can transfer the disease; _Cure_ 2 consecutive saves, penalties from the weakened state and worse are permanent until the victim is the target of [[heal|heal]] or [[regenerate|regenerate]]
