**Destruction** The watery grave haunt is destroyed if the ghost ship’s captain is permanently destroyed.  

### Description

Watery grave haunts typically travel aboard ghost ships, protecting the ghost vessel’s passengers. When the ghost ship’s captain boards an enemy vessel, the watery grave haunt drifts aboard as well.
