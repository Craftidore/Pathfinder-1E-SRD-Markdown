**Effect** A tar snare consists of a shallow trench filled with tar or sticky mud that is then covered with a layer of debris to disguise its presence. When a creature steps into a square trapped with a tar snare, the trap makes an attempt to grapple it with a +10 bonus on the combat maneuver check. Sharp sticks can be added to the pit as well—this increases the CR of the trap by 1 and affects a creature grappled by the trap as if it had walked on [caltrops](https://www.aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Caltrops).
