## Breakaway Vine

**Source** [_Ultimate Wilderness pg. 172_](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo)  
**Associated Terrain** any forests, jungles, or swamps  
**Type** mechanical; **Perception** DC 20; **Disable Device** DC 20

### Effects

**Trigger** touch (timed); **Reset** repair  
**Effect** A breakaway vine has been sabotaged so that it snaps not long after someone begins using it to climb. A breakaway vine trap can be crafted from a length of rope as well, but this ruins the rope for other uses. When a Small or larger creature climbs a breakaway vine, the vine snaps just before the creature reaches the top of the climb. A creature can grab a handhold and avoid the resulting fall with a successful DC 20 Reflex save. This breakaway vine assumes a 20-foot fall for 2d6 points of damage; longer falls increase the CR of the breakaway vine by 1 per additional 20 feet.
