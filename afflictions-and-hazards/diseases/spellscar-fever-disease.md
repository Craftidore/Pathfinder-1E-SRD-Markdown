Anyone who lives with spellscar fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease and to mana fever, but also becomes a Mana Waste mutant (_Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary_ 28) or a mutant (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5_ 180), chosen by the GM. A Mana Waste mutant created in such a way can use the following Spellscar Fever Deformities table in place of a deformity from the _Inner Sea Bestiary_, while a mutant resulting from spellscar fever can take one effect from the same table in place of one deformity and one mutation.
