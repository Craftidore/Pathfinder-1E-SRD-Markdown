When skills come into conflict with each other, it can lead to extremely complex interactions, often well beyond the scope of the short skill descriptions in the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_. The following section offers detailed advice on the most common skill clashes that involve difficult adjudications, as well as clarifications of skills where the _Core Rulebook_ provides little guidance. The advice in this section is holistic, and GMs are encouraged to read each description in full to gain the best grasp of the nuances of each skill. Additionally, this section offers an optional variant system for opposed skill checks that reduces randomness and the potential for many rolls.
