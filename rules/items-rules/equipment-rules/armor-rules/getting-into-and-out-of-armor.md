## Getting Into and Out of Armor

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 153_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table 6–7.  
  
**Don**: This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.  
  
**Don Hastily**: This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.  
  
**Remove**: This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Removing a shield from the arm and dropping it is only a move action.

**Table 6-7: Donning Armor**

- 1: If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Twocharacters can’t help each other don armor at the same time.  
- 2: The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.
