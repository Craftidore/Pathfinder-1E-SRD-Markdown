## Masterwork Armor

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 153_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a wellmade item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.  
  
A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.  
  
The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.  
  
All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.  
  
You can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.
