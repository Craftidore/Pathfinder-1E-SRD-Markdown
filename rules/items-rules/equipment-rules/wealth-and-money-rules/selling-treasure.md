## Selling Treasure

**Source**Â [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 140_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price, including weapons, armor, gear, and magic items. This also includes character-created items.  
  
Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.
