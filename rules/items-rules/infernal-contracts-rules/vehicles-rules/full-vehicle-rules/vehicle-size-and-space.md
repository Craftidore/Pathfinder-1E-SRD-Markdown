## Vehicle Size and Space

**Source** [_Ultimate Combat pg. 172_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz)  
Vehicles have sizes and spaces different from creature sizes and spaces. Many vehicles are long and thin rather than taking up a space of an equal number of squares per side like creatures do. A wagon, for instance, may take up a 10-by-10-foot square, or may be 10 feet wide and 15 feet or more long. Often one of the shorter sides of the vehicle serves as a vehicle’s forward facing.  
  
**Size Conversion**: Often it is important to know the size category of a vehicle. Use Table 4–1 to determine the size of a vehicle or its propulsion based on the number of squares it occupies.  
  
**Driving Space**: At least one 5-foot-by-5-foot square on each vehicle must be designated as its driving space— often such an area encompasses multiple squares. In order to drive a vehicle, an intelligent creature must be within at least one square of the driving space and able to manipulate its driving device. The typical sizes and locations of driving spaces are detailed in the individual vehicle descriptions.
