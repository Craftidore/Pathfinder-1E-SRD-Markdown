## Propulsion Devies

Squares of propulsion devices have their own statistics, separate from the vehicle’s. Use the following rules to determine those statistics.  
  
**Alchemical Engine**: Harvesting the power of steam or some other alchemical reaction, these engines are typically reinforced and difficult to destroy. They can be disabled, and are considered either difficult or extreme devices based on the complexity of the device.  
  
**Creature**: A creature used as propulsion uses its own statistics. During movement and the effects of any combat maneuver, pulling creatures’ spaces are considered vehicle spaces to determine the effects of vehicle maneuvers. Creatures pulling a vehicle can be arranged in teams. This means two creatures of the same type and same size can occupy the same space to pull a vehicle.  
  
**Dirigible**: Lighter-than-air alchemical gases can be harnessed to give a vehicle flight. Dirigibles are often easier to destroy than the vehicle they convey. Dirigibles have 5 hit points per square and no hardness. They take double the normal damage from acid, electricity, and fire attacks (multiply the damage roll by 2).  
  
**Magic Item**: Like a creature, a magic item uses its own item statistics.  
  
**Sails**: Used on magically or alchemically powered airships and on any fast-moving water vehicle, sails are often weaker than the vessels they propel, though they are relatively easy to repair. Taking out the sails is a good way to capture a vessel. Sails have 5 hit points per square and no hardness. They take double the normal damage from acid and fire attacks (multiply the damage roll by 2). While the sails have rigging, such rigging manipulated by the crew, and as such are not considered driving devices.
