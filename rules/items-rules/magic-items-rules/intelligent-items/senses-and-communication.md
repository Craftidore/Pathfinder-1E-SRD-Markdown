## Senses and Communication

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 533_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Every intelligent magic item begins with the ability to see and hear within 30 feet, as well as the ability to communicate empathically with its owner. Empathy only allows the item to encourage or discourage certain actions through urges and emotions. Additional forms of communication and better senses increase the item’s cost and Ego score, as noted on Table 15–23.  
  
**Empathy (Su)**: Empathy allows the item to encourage or discourage certain actions by communicating emotions and urges. It does not allow for verbal communication.  
  
**Speech (Su)**: An intelligent item with the capability for speech can talk using any of the languages it knows.  
  
**Telepathy (Su)**: Telepathy allows an intelligent item to communicate with its wielder telepathically, regardless of its known languages. The wielder must be touching the item to communicate in this way.  
  
**Senses**: Senses allow an intelligent magic item to see and hear out to the listed distance. Adding darkvision or blindsense allows the item to use those senses out to the same range as the item’s base senses.  
  
**Read Languages (Ex)**: The item can read script in any language, regardless of its known languages.  
  
**_Read Magic (Sp)_**: An intelligent magic item with this ability can read magical writings and scrolls as if through read magic. This ability does not allow the magic item to activate scrolls or other items. An intelligent magic item can suppress and resume this ability as a free action.
