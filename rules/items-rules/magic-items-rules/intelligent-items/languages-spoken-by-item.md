## Languages Spoken by Item

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 533_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Like a character, an intelligent item understands Common plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking into account the item’s origin and purposes. If the item does not possess speech, it can still read and understand the languages it knows.
