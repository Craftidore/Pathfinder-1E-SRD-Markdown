## Intelligent Item Powers

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 535_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Each intelligent item should possess at least one power, although more powerful items might possess a host of powers. To f ind the item’s specif ic powers, choose or roll on Table 15–24. All powers function at the direction of the item, although intelligent items generally follow the wishes of their owner. Activating a power or concentrating on an active one is a standard action the item takes. The caster level for these effects is equal to the item’s caster level. Save DCs are based off the item’s highest mental ability score.
