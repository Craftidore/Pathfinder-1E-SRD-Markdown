## Major Artifacts

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 547_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign. Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.
