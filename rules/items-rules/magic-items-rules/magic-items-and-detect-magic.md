## Magic Items and Detect Magic

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 458_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
When _detect magic_ identifies a magic item’s school of magic, this information refers to the school of the spell placed within the potion, scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The description of each item provides its aura strength and the school to which it belongs.  
  
If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites, use the following default guidelines.

|**Item Nature**|**School**|
|---|---|
|Armors and protection items|Abjuration|
|Weapons or offensive items|Evocation|
|Bonus to ability score, skill check, etc.|Transmutation|
