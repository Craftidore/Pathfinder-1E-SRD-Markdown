## Wondrous Items

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 496_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
This is a catch all category for anything that doesn’t fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).  
  
**Physical Description**: Varies.  
  
**Activation**: Usually use-activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.  
  
**Special Qualities**: Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (see Intelligent Items later in this chapter).  
  
Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.
