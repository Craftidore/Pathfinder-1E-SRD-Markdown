# Magic Items

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 458_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
From the common _potion of cure light wounds_ to the mighty _holy avenger_, magic items are valuable tools used by heroes and villains alike. This chapter contains a wide variety of items to enhance any character.  
  
Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staves, wands, and wondrous items. In addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to belong to a category of their own— artifacts. Artifacts are classified in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major (each one unique and incredibly potent).
