## Magic Items on the Body

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 459_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It’s possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 15 magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body, known as a “slot.”  
  
A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which slot on the body the item is worn.  
  
**Armor**: suits of armor.  
  
**Belts**: belts and girdles.  
  
**Body**: robes and vestments.  
  
**Chest**: mantles, shirts, and vests.  
  
**Eyes**: eyes, glasses, and goggles.  
  
**Feet**: boots, shoes, and slippers.  
  
**Hands**: gauntlets and gloves.  
  
**Head**: circlets, crowns, hats, helms, and masks.  
  
**Headband**: headbands and phylacteries.  
  
**Neck**: amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, and scarabs.  
  
**Ring (up to two)**: rings.  
  
**Shield**: shields.  
  
**Shoulders**: capes and cloaks.  
  
**Wrist**: bracelets and bracers.  
  
Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those in the slots listed above have no effect.  
  
Some items can be worn or carried without taking up a slot on a character’s body. The description of an item indicates when an item has this property.
