## Creating Scrolls

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 552_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
To create a scroll, a character needs a supply of choice writing materials, the cost of which is subsumed in the cost for scribing the scroll: 12.5 gp × the level of the spell × the level of the caster.  
  
All writing implements and materials used to scribe a scroll must be fresh and unused. A character must pay the full cost for scribing each spell scroll no matter how many times she previously has scribed the same spell.  
  
The creator must have prepared the spell to be scribed (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires. A material component is consumed when she begins writing, but a focus is not. (A focus used in scribing a scroll can be reused.) The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from the caster’s currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)  
  
Scribing a scroll requires 1 day per 1,000 gp of the base price. Although an individual scroll might contain more than one spell, each spell must be scribed as a separate effort, meaning that no more than 1 spell can be scribed in a day.  
  
**Item Creation Feat Required**: Scribe Scroll.  
  
**Skill Used in Creation**: Spellcraft, Craft (calligraphy), or Profession (scribe).

\* Caster level is equal to class level –3.  

Prices assume that the scroll was made at the minimum caster level. The cost to create a scroll is half the base price.
