## Creating Rings

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 551_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
To create a magic ring, a character needs a heat source. He also needs a supply of materials, the most obvious being a ring or the pieces of the ring to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the ring. Ring costs are difficult to determine. Refer to Table 15–29 and use the ring prices in the ring descriptions as a guideline. Creating a ring generally costs half the ring’s market price.  
  
Rings that duplicate spells with costly material components add in the value of 50 × the spell’s component cost. Having a spell with a costly component as a prerequisite does not automatically incur this cost. The act of working on the ring triggers the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the ring’s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from the caster’s currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)  
  
Creating some rings may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.  
  
Forging a ring requires 1 day for each 1,000 gp of the base price.
