## Creating Wands

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 553_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
To create a magic wand, a character needs a small supply of materials, the most obvious being a baton or the pieces of the wand to be assembled. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating the wand: 375 gp × the level of the spell × the level of the caster. Wands are always fully charged (50 charges) when created.  
  
The creator must have prepared the spell to be stored (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any focuses the spell requires. Fifty of each needed material component are required (one for each charge). Material components are consumed when work begins, but focuses are not. A focus used in creating a wand can be reused. The act of working on the wand triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting during each day devoted to the wand’s creation. (That is, that spell slot is expended from the caster’s currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)  
  
Crafting a wand requires 1 day per each 1,000 gp of the base price.  
  
**Item Creation Feat Required**: Craft Wand.  
  
**Skill Used in Creation**: Spellcraft, Craft ( jewelry), Craft (sculptures), or Profession (woodcutter).
