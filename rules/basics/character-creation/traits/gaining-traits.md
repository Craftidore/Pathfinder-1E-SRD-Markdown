## Gaining Traits

**Source** [_Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1)  
When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what amounts to a bonus feat at character creation. Some GMs may wish to adjust this number somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM normally doesn’t allow bonus traits, you might still be able to pick up some with the [[additional-traits]] feat.
