## Age

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 168_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
You can choose or randomly generate your character’s age. If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age for the character’s race and class (see Table 7–1). Alternatively, roll the dice indicated for your class on Table 7–1 and add the result to the minimum age of adulthood for your race to determine how old your character is.  
  

## Table 7-1: Random Starting Ages

|**Adulthood**|**Barbarian, Rogue, Sorcerer**|**Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger**|**Cleric, Druid, Monk, Wizard**|
|---|---|---|---|
|15 years|+1d4|+1d6|+2d6|
|40 years|+3d6|+5d6|+7d6|
|110 years|+4d6|+6d6|+10d6|
|40 years|+4d6|+6d6|+9d6|
|20 years|+1d6|+2d6|+3d6|
|14 years|+1d4|+1d6|+2d6|
|20 years|+2d4|+3d6|+4d6|

  
With age, a character’s physical ability scores decrease and his mental ability scores increase (see Table 7–2). The effects of each aging step are cumulative. However, none of a character’s ability scores can be reduced below 1 in this way.When a character reaches venerable age, secretly roll his maximum age (on Table 7–2) and record the result, which the player does not know. A character who reaches his maximum age dies of old age sometime during the following year.  
  
The maximum ages are for player characters. Most people in the world at large die from pestilence, accidents, infections, or violence before getting to venerable age.
