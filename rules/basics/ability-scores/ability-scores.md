# Ability Scores

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 15_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Each character has six ability scores that represent his character’s most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls an ability check (using just an ability score), these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character’s skills and abilities. Each ability score generally ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an average ability score is 10.
