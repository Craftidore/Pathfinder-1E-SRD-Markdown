## Abilities and Spellcasters

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 16_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
The ability that governs [[determine-bonuses|bonus spells]] depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, and rangers; and Charisma for bards, paladins, and sorcerers. In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of a high enough class level to be able to cast spells or use spell slots of a given spell level. See the class descriptions in Chapter 3 for details.
