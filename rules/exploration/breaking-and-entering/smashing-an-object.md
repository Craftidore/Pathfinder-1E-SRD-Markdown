## Smashing an Object

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 173_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
Smashing a weapon or shield with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon is accomplished with the sunder combat maneuver (see Chapter 8). Smashing an object is like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your combat maneuver check is opposed by the object’s AC. Generally, you can smash an object only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.  
  
**Armor Class**: Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don’t usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object’s Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier (see Table 7–11) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (–5 penalty to AC), but also an additional –2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.  
  
**Hardness**: Each object has hardness—a number that represents how well it resists damage. When an object is damaged, subtract its hardness from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object’s hit points (see Table 7–12, Table 7–13, and Table 7–14).  
  
**Hit Points**: An object’s hit point total depends on what it is made of and how big it is (see Table 7–12, Table 7–13, and Table 7–14). Objects that take damage equal to or greater than half their total hit points gain the broken condition (see Appendix 2). When an object’s hit points reach 0, it’s ruined.  
  
Very large objects have separate hit point totals for different sections.  
  
_Energy Attacks_: Energy attacks deal half damage to most objects. Divide the damage by 2 before applying the object’s hardness. Some energy types might be particularly effective against certain objects, subject to GM discretion. For example, fire might do full damage against parchment, cloth, and other objects that burn easily. Sonic might do full damage against glass and crystal objects.  
  
_Ranged Weapon Damage_: Objects take half damage from ranged weapons ([[seige-engine|unless the weapon is a siege engine or something similar]]). Divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the object’s hardness.  
  
_Ineffective Weapons_: Certain weapons just can’t effectively deal damage to certain objects. Likewise, most melee weapons have little effect on stone walls and doors, unless they are designed for breaking up stone, such as a pick or hammer.  
  
_Immunities_: Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.  
  
_Magic Armor, Shields, and Weapons_: Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to the hardness of armor, a weapon, or a shield, and +10 to the item’s hit points.  
  
_Vulnerability to Certain Attacks_: Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the object’s hardness.  
  
_Damaged Objects_: A damaged object remains functional with the broken condition until the item’s hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed.  
  
Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill and a number of spells.  
  
**Saving Throws**: Nonmagical, unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving throws, so they are always fully affected by spells and other attacks that allow saving throws to resist or negate. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the character’s saving throw bonus).  
  
Magic items always get saving throws. A magic item’s Fortitude, Ref lex, and Will save bonuses are equal to 2 + half its caster level. An attended magic item either makes saving throws as its owner or uses its own saving throw bonus, whichever is better.  
  
_Animated Objects_: Animated objects count as creatures for purposes of determining their Armor Class (do not treat them as inanimate objects).
