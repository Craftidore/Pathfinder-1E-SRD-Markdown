## Breaking Items

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 175_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
When a character tries to break or burst something with sudden force rather than by dealing damage, use a Strength check (rather than an attack roll and damage roll, as with the sunder special attack) to determine whether he succeeds. Since hardness doesn't affect an object's break DC, this value depends more on the construction of the item than on the material the item is made of. Consult Table 7–15 for a list of common break DCs.  
  
If an item has lost half or more of its hit points, the item gains the broken condition (see Appendix 2) and the DC to break it drops by 2.  
  
Larger and smaller creatures get size bonuses and size penalties on Strength checks to break open doors as follows: Fine –16, Diminutive –12, Tiny –8, Small –4, Large +4, Huge +8, Gargantuan +12, Colossal +16.  
  
A crowbar or portable ram improves a character's chance of breaking open a door (see Chapter 6).
