# Movement

**Source** [_PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 170_](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj)  
There are three movement scales, as follows:

- Tactical, for combat, measured in feet (or 5-foot squares) per round.
- Local, for exploring an area, measured in feet per minute.
- Overland, for getting from place to place, measured in miles per hour or miles per day.

  
**Modes of Movement**: While moving at the different movement scales, creatures generally walk, hustle, or run.  
  
_Walk_: A walk represents unhurried but purposeful movement (3 miles per hour for an unencumbered adult human).  
  
_Hustle_: A hustle is a jog (about 6 miles per hour for an unencumbered human). A character moving his speed twice in a single round, or moving that speed in the same round that he or she performs a standard action or another move action, is hustling when he or she moves.  
  
_Run (×3)_: Moving three times speed is a running pace for a character in heavy armor (about 7 miles per hour for a human in full plate).  
  
_Run (×4)_: Moving four times speed is a running pace for a character in light, medium, or no armor (about 12 miles per hour for an unencumbered human, or 9 miles per hour for a human in chainmail). See Table 7–6 for details.

\* Tactical Movement is often measured in squares on the battle grid (1 square = 5 feet) rather than feet.
